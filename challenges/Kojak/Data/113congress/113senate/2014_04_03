There \nare others but there aren't many, and to have now the Presiding Officer \nhaving not only been to war but being a general and having led hundreds \nof people from Montana to war, I am sure when that Pledge of Allegiance \nis said by the Presiding Officer, your feelings are a little different \nfrom anyone else's because during those bitter battles in Iraq, members \nof your unit were killed and injured.\n  So even though we don't say much publicly about the new addition to \nthe Senate, I want the record to reflect that the people of Montana are \nso fortunate to have this patriot here in the Senate.\n  We will miss Max Baucus tremendously. He was my friend. But I am \nreally impressed with the Presiding Officer and--I repeat--his having \nbeen not only a warrior but a general who led a lot of warriors in war.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/03/senate-section/article/S2135-7", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2135]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. REID.

It was just a few years ago that there were mass \nmurders on that military base.\n  Our Nation mourns every casualty that befalls our brave \nservicemembers. These seem so unnecessary and such a sad event. Fort \nHood has seen more than its fair share of tragedy in the last few \nyears. We know this community of warriors and their families are \ngrieving and questioning this latest act of senseless violence.\n  As the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, GEN Martin Dempsey, put \nit, ``This is a community that has faced and overcome crises with \nresilience and strength.'' That is true.\n  We stand with the people of Fort Hood today. We stand with all of our \nmilitary wherever they are situated in the world, admiring their \nstrength and resilience.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/03/senate-section/article/S2135-9", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2135-S2136]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, no one can dispute that Winston Churchill \nwas a statesman and the most famous in the history of our world. This \nis what he said:\n\n\n[[Page S2136]]\n\n\n       Of this I am quite sure, that if we open a quarrel between \n     the past and the present, we shall find that we have lost the \n     future.\n\n  Why do I say that? Even though those remarks were made more than 70 \nyears ago, I believe there are many in Congress who should focus on \nwhat Winston Churchill said because it is true. For far too long \nRepublicans have obsessed over the Affordable Care Act--ObamaCare. The \nAffordable Care Act is the law of the land. It has been for more than 4 \nyears.\n  From the very day this law was signed, Republicans have zealously \nworked to undermine it in so many different ways. Day in and day out \nthey have clamored for repeal of this bill. House Republicans have \nvoted more than 50 times trying desperately to cripple ObamaCare. They \nshut down the government trying to defund health care reform. And how \nhas that worked? While they have obsessed over the past, the country \nhas moved forward.\n  Now Republicans have to face the fact that millions of their own \nconstituents, millions of Republicans are benefiting from health care \nreform in record numbers. But my Republican friends still insist on \nnothing short of repeal. So I ask my Republican colleagues, what would \nthey like to repeal? What would repeal look like?\n  Because of the Affordable Care Act, millions of Americans can no \nlonger be denied health insurance because of preexisting conditions. \nWhat are some of the preexisting conditions that caused so much trouble \nin the past? Diabetes. How about this one: You are a woman. Many \ninsurance companies considered women having a preexisting disability \nbecause they were women. Millions of young adults are now able to stay \non their parents' policies until age 26. That is more than 3 million. \nMillions of seniors are saving huge amounts of money on prescription \ndrugs because we are in the process of filling the doughnut hole. This \nyear alone millions of Americans will receive maternity coverage. \nRepealing the Affordable Care Act would be repealing many of these and \nmany more. I could spend a long time talking about what would be \nrepealed.\n  My counterpart, the Senator from Kentucky, will probably address the \nSenate after I finish. In his home State of Kentucky, 360,000 people \nhave signed up for coverage under the Affordable Care Act. Kentucky is \nnot New York; it is not Texas; it is not California. It is a sparsely \npopulated State, somewhat like Nevada. Yet 360,000 people have signed \nup for coverage. Of those, 75 percent were previously uninsured. That \nis approaching 300,000 people. Over a quarter million Kentuckians who \ndid not have insurance now have health coverage under the Affordable \nCare Act. In other words, ObamaCare has reduced the uninsured \npopulation of Kentucky by 40 percent.\n  I wonder when my friend from Kentucky will explain to the 270,000 \nKentuckians how he plans to repeal the law without stripping the new \nhealth benefits. How exactly will he and his Republican colleagues \nguarantee that their newly insured constituents have no lapses in \ncoverage? Remember, they want to do away with 270,000 people who didn't \nhave insurance. They want to do away with 360,000 people in Kentucky \nwho are signed up for insurance. So I await their answer.\n  In the meantime, Democrats will keep looking to the future, and the \nfuture of the Affordable Care Act is bright. Every day more and more \nAmericans are getting health coverage under the law. On Monday we \nlearned that 7,045,000 people had already signed up and about 1 million \npeople on the State exchanges--370,000 in Kentucky, for example. We \nknow there are more than 3 million young people on their parents' \ninsurance because of that. We know there are millions of people who are \nnow covered because of their ability to become part of Medicaid. So we \nare talking about a lot of people.\n  Health reform is working, and the law is here to stay. The more \nAmericans see the law is working, the more they want it to stay. The \ntime of fighting over the past is over. Remember what Winston Churchill \nsaid:\n\n       Of this I am quite sure, that if we open a quarrel between \n     the past and the present, we shall find that we have lost the \n     future.\n\n  I say this very seriously: I invite my Republican friends to look to \nthe future. Put this obstruction behind them. Work with us to make the \nAffordable Care Act even better for their constituents and our \nconstituents and Americans generally. Together, we can help millions \nmore Americans get the health coverage they deserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/03/senate-section/article/S2136-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2136]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNITION OF THE REPUBLICAN LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I wish to start this morning with a \nword about yesterday's tragic shooting at Fort Hood.\n  As the investigation continues, we will learn more facts, but what we \nalready know is that Fort Hood has faced a great deal of adversity and \nchallenges over the past few years and that the community there has \nrallied around our uniformed personnel. We also know that the on-base \nmilitary police appear to have responded quickly, appropriately, and \nobviously at great personal risk to themselves. So, as always in a \ntragedy such as this, we admire the courage and commitment of those who \nrushed to help the victims. And of course we are all thinking and \npraying today for the victims, their families, and their fellow \nsoldiers and civilians at Fort Hood.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/03/senate-section/article/S2136-3", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2136-S2137]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              JOB CREATION\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, all week Republicans have been coming \nto the floor to talk about our proposals to ignite job creation and get \nthe economy back on track. We have been talking about ideas that can \nhelp middle-class Americans who have been struggling just to make it in \nthe Obama economy. But our Democratic colleagues don't seem to care all \nthat much. They seem too preoccupied with an election still 7 months \naway. Instead of working with us on ideas for job creation, they have \nbeen talking about pretty much anything else.\n  Time and again yesterday Republicans asked our Democratic colleagues \nfor consideration of our amendments by the Senate. And time and time \nagain those efforts were rebuffed.\n  Republicans have a lot of good ideas. All we are asking is for those \nideas to get fair consideration. Let's get our amendments pending, have \na debate, and actually take a vote.\n  Some Senate Democrats seem to see things entirely differently. They \ndon't even want the elected representatives of the people to have a \nsay--a say on what Americans say is the most important issue facing our \ncountry. This is especially galling because our friends across the \naisle always seem to find time for poll-tested show votes aimed at \nfiring up the left. They may not be overly concerned about passing jobs \nlegislation for the American people, but we can bet they will be \nforcing everyone to endure plenty of political show votes as we get \ncloser to November. The so-called agenda that rolled out last week \nbasically guarantees it. They have already admitted they don't intend \nto pass the things it contains. That is not the point, they say. The \ntrue end is to help Democrats retain their Senate majority. They have \nessentially already admitted that, which is somewhat dishonorable. No \nwonder Americans are so disillusioned with Washington.\n\n  Look, the American people want us to focus on their concerns, not \npolitical show votes talked about by a few political strategists over \nat the Democrats' campaign committee. As I indicated, jobs are right up \nthere at the top of that list. We will see today whether Senate \nDemocrats are actually serious about giving our constituents what they \nwant. It appears our colleagues might allow consideration of one \namendment--just one. We are not even sure about that yet.\n  At least the amendment we would be considering is a good one, and I \nappreciate the work of Senator Thune and others in putting that \ntogether. This would reduce the tax burden on small businesses. It \nwould provide relief to the Kentucky coal communities that have been \nunder continual assault by this administration. It would approve the \nKeystone Pipeline, which would create thousands of jobs right away. It \nwould repeal the medical device tax, which even many Democrats \nacknowledge is killing jobs. It would eliminate\n\n[[Page S2137]]\n\nObamaCare's 30-hour workweek rule which is cutting paychecks to the \nmiddle class. In other words, this is an amendment that seeks to take \nthe causes of joblessness head on rather than simply treating the \nsymptoms of a down economy. It is an amendment that aims to help \nAmericans find jobs with a steady paycheck and the promise of a better \nlife.\n  There are other amendments not contained within this package the \nSenate should be voting on too. For instance, the national right-to-\nwork amendment Senator Paul and I have just introduced--\ntransformational legislation that would empower American workers and \nput our country on a path to greater prosperity.\n  But the larger point is this: The Senate needs to be allowed to \nfunction again. While Members file amendments on behalf of their \nconstituents, those amendments should get due consideration. That is \nparticularly true when those amendments have bipartisan support and aim \nto address our still-ailing economy and the families struggling in it. \nMy hope is our Democratic colleagues will allow this to happen.\n  These are serious times and we cannot afford to waste months on \npurely partisan proposals that have no hope of passing. We need to work \ntogether to advance serious proposals that expand jobs and opportunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/03/senate-section/article/S2137-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2137]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n              Sergeant First Class Matthew S. Sluss-Tiller\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I want to pay tribute to a Kentucky \nSpecial Operations Forces soldier who was lost in service to his \ncountry, the life of SFC Matthew S. Sluss-Tiller of Catlettsburg, KY, \nwhich prematurely ended on February 3, 2010, in Pakistan, where he was \nserving in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. He was killed when \nthe enemy attacked his unit with an improvised explosive device. He was \n35 years old.\n  For his service in uniform, Sergeant First Class Sluss-Tiller \nreceived many awards, medals, and decorations, including the Bronze \nStar, the Purple Heart, two Meritorious Service Medals, five Army \nCommendation Medals, the Joint Service Achievement Medal, five Army \nAchievement Medals, five Army Good Conduct Medals, the National Defense \nService Medal with Bronze Service Star, the Armed Forces Expeditionary \nMedal, the Kosovo Campaign Medal with Bronze Star, two Afghanistan \nCampaign Medals with Bronze Service Stars, the Iraq Campaign Medal with \nBronze Service Star, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, the \nHumanitarian Service Medal, three noncommissioned officers professional \ndevelopment ribbons, the Army service ribbon, two overseas service \nribbons, the NATO Medal, the combat action badge, and the senior \nparachutist badge; obviously a much decorated soldier.\n  Pictured behind me is Sergeant First Class Sluss-Tiller with his \ndaughter Hannah, who was only 3 years old when he died. Matthew's wife \nMelissa proudly sent this picture to my office so it can be honored on \nthe Senate floor. It was taken the summer before Matthew was killed, \nand it was his last picture with his daughter.\n  Melissa remembers the bond between Matthew and Hannah fondly. ``He \nused to sing to me and Hannah,'' she says.\n\n       He would dance with her standing on his feet, singing \n     loudly. Thinking of it makes me smile. He loved being a \n     husband and a father, and he was great at both.\n\n  Born and raised in eastern Kentucky, Matthew graduated from Lawrence \nCounty High School in 1993. Brenda Thornbury, his former art teacher, \nremained friends with Matthew after he graduated and recalls he knew \nfrom a young age what he wanted to do. ``Matthew was a wonderful \nperson,'' she says.\n\n       He was always eager to do whatever he needed to do to serve \n     his country . . . he knew he would serve his country. He \n     loved the Lord, and he loved his family.\n\n  Matthew's father Edward Tiller agrees. ``From the time I bought him \nhis first GI Joe, he wanted to be an Army man,'' he said.\n  In short, it seems clear that for Matthew, the Army was not just a \njob, it was a way of life. He was dedicated to justice and service in \nthe name of our country.\n  In 1991, Matthew enlisted in the U.S. Army Reserves as a heavy \nconstruction mechanic and served at the 261st Ordnance Company located \nat Cross Lanes, WV. In 1993, he left the family farm and enlisted in \nthe Active-Duty Army as a signal specialist. He served at Fort Bragg, \nNC, as well as in Germany and in Kuwait.\n  SFC Jamie Mullinax, a friend of Matthew's who trained with him at \nFort Bragg, knew well the look of happiness we can see in Matthew's \nface behind me. He says:\n\n       If you knew Matt, you knew that smile. He always strived to \n     do the best at what he did. I know he believed in what he was \n     doing and loved wearing the military uniform and believed in \n     what it stood for.\n\n  As the list of awards, medals, and decorations I read earlier makes \nclear, Matthew excelled at being a soldier. In his many years of \ntraining, he successfully completed the U.S. Army Airborne course, the \nJumpmaster course, the Master Jumpmaster course, the Air Movement \nOperations course, the Military Transition Team course, the Civil \nAffairs Qualification course, and the Advanced and Basic \nNoncommissioned Officer's courses.\n  Prior to his time of deployment, Matthew deployed in support of \nOperation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Joint Guardian in Kosovo. In his \nfinal deployment Matthew was assigned to the 96th Civil Affairs \nBattalion, 95th Civil Affairs Brigade, based out of Fort Bragg.\n  In his free time Matthew loved golf, hunting, hiking, camping, and \nriding motorcycles, and he was a passionate fan of UK basketball.\n  The many people who came to pay their respects at Matthew's funeral \nin eastern Kentucky witnessed the recognition of Matthew's sacrifice \nwhen they saw a three-star general come to their small town to lead the \nhonor guard.\n  LTG John Mulholland delivered these remarks at the service:\n\n       Matthew was part of America's Army Special Operations \n     Forces and as such was one of the finest soldiers in the \n     world.\n\n  He went on:\n\n       That's no exaggeration, that he was embarked on a very \n     important if not critical mission that is directly tied to \n     the security of this country.\n\n  Of course, as impressive as his service record was, I think the \npicture behind me makes clear that the most important job to Matthew \nwas husband and father. I know his family misses him terribly.\n  Melissa says the following about her husband:\n\n       I believe that our souls are beacons glowing immensely with \n     light so powerful and beautiful that only in heaven can we \n     become a true vision of ourselves. I know my Matthew is \n     standing tall in heaven, his light so stunning a reflection \n     of who he was. God needed him, and I cannot question that.\n\n  We are thinking of Matthew's loved ones today, including his wife \nMelissa, his daughter Hannah, his parents Edward Tiller and Jane \nBlankenship, his stepparents Von Tiller and Forest Blankenship, his \nsiblings Selena Dawn Pack Blankenship, Michael Blankenship, and Annette \nSorg, and many other beloved family members and friends.\n  Our country has lost a faithful and devoted hero with the passing of \nSFC Matthew S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of the 2.3 \nmillion Americans, including the 140,000 New Jerseyans who have been \nwithout a job for months and desperately need our help. These Americans \nare Americans who are veterans who stood for us in the military and \nArmed Forces. These are families and individuals with children. These \nare our seniors. These are folks who have been working for decades and \nsuddenly found themselves in the worst economy of my lifetime without a \njob.\n  I am very proud of this body. We are inching closer toward passing \nlegislation to restore Federal unemployment insurance. What this money \ndoes is it takes families from crisis with these meager checks to give \na little bit of stability so they can do what is necessary to look for \nwork.\n  It helps them keep their car insurance so they can ride to \ninterviews. It helps them keep the cable service going so they can \napply online and actually file their reesumees as they look for jobs. \nIt helps them meet mortgage payments, so they can keep a roof over \ntheir heads or rental payments as well.\n  I want to thank the incredible bipartisan leadership of Dean Heller \nand Jack Reed. Senator Heller and Senator Reed have been working hard \ntogether with a group of us relentlessly to bring us this far. I have \nbeen so grateful for the leadership of those two Senators and others \nbecause it made us so close in this body to getting unemployment \ninsurance extended.\n  This is a bipartisan bill. It involves compromise. It is what the \nAmerican people want us to do, Republicans and Democrats coming \ntogether for millions of Americans that are in crisis right now through \nno fault of their own, in an economy where there are three people \nlooking for a job for every single job that is available.\n  I want to express my gratitude to the entire bipartisan group \ncosponsoring the bill. My colleagues, Senator Reed, Senator Heller, \nSenator Merkley, Senator Sherrod Brown, Senator Durbin, Senator Susan \nCollins, Senator Rob Portman, Senator Lisa Murkowski, and Senator Mark \nKirk, Republicans and Democrats alike who hammered out a compromise, \nhave done the difficult work and are pushing to move this forward.\n  I also want to thank people from New Jersey who have shared their \nstories with me, who have been active and engaging from online posts, \nletters, and phone calls--all of them fighting to find work. I have \nheard from Republican New Jerseyans and Democratic New Jerseyans. I \nhave heard from military veterans and single moms. I have heard from \nfolks who are so hungry to work. But while they are looking, they are \nlooking to this body, to all of Congress to help them meet the basic \nminimum needs so that they can continue to have some stability and not \nbe swallowed up by the quicksand of economic crisis and to be able to \ncontinue to find a job.\n  They are living examples. Each and every one of those millions of \nAmericans are examples of what is at stake if we do not act. I have \nheard painful stories of people facing real crises, from homelessness \nto skipping medications, doing everything they can to keep some \nsemblance of stability so that they can find a job. Unfortunately, many \nare falling through the cracks. Many are facing the darkest of days.\n  As the Senate prepares to vote on this incredibly vitally important \nbill, I want to stress that this legislative body is only as effective \nas both Chambers and parties being able to come together, to really \nfollow in that great American tradition that for the last 50 years, \nDemocrats and Republicans during times of economic crisis, have come \ntogether and found a way to hammer out compromises to extend \nunemployment insurance under Reagan, under Bush, under Clinton, and \nunder Carter. We found a way to get forward, both Chambers being there \nfor Americans in the economic crisis.\n\n  Today is a significant step in our fight to restore hope to America's \nunemployed but only if this bill is also voted on and passed in the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  I have sat in living rooms, diners, and soup kitchens all across the \nState of New Jersey, and I can tell you the crisis is real. I am \nhopeful that if my colleagues in the House of Representatives listen to \nthe voices--Republicans and Democrats, red and blue, North and South, \nall across this country--of their unemployed constituents, they will do \nwhat is right. They will shun that intellectually unreal idea that \nAmericans are lazy, that they don't want to work. We have millions of \nAmericans out there fighting for their hope of finding a job, and they \nneed the help of the House of Representatives, as I believe they will \nget it from the Senate this week.\n  No matter our party, all of us have folks in our home States who are \nunemployed and suffering because we have thus far failed to do what \nevery other Congress has done in the past when long-term unemployment \nrates have been so high, as they are today. We must extend Federal \nunemployment insurance. America needs our House of Representatives to \nlisten to the pleas of those who are barely making ends meet.\n  I remember Joan and her daughter, a recent Rutgers University \ngraduate. They live together and were both cut off from unemployment \ninsurance the same week in December. The modest unemployment checks \nthat Joan and her daughter were receiving had helped them to keep up \nwith mortgage payments. While they waited for us to vote, their home \nwas placed into foreclosure.\n  Then there is Lauren from Clifton, who wrote my office saying she had \nsent out close to 1,000 resumes without luck and had reached the point \nwhere she couldn't pay to keep the heat on in her house during this \nbrutal winter and she feared her phone was going to have to be cut off \nnext. She wrote:\n\n       I've been looking for work tirelessly. What does someone in \n     my situation do?\n\n  These folks have worked hard all of their lives. They have played by \nthe rules but unfortunately happen to be in a bad economy not of their \nmaking, which they did not contribute to, and are caught in these \ndifficult times. They are doing everything right and so should their \nrepresentatives in Congress.\n  Today we are casting a vote for them. Today I am proud to say that in \nthe Senate we are coming together, Democrats and Republicans, hammering \nout a compromise, meeting each other in the middle, and doing what is \nexpected of us by Americans--reaching out, lending a hand, in a time of \ncrisis. I implore my colleagues in the House of Representatives to do \nthe same.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Booker). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I rise to speak to my amendment No. 2959 to \nthe unemployment insurance legislation that is before us. The amendment \nis called the Good Jobs, Good Wages, and Good Hours Act.\n  Twelve times Congress has voted to extend emergency unemployment \nbenefits since 2008, and what do we have to show for those 12 \nextensions of these benefits. More than 10 million Americans remain \nunemployed. Of those, more than 3.8 million Americans have been \nunemployed for longer than 6 months. Millions more remain underemployed \nor have simply dropped out of the workforce altogether, too discouraged \nto even look for work in this stagnant economy.\n\n[[Page S2139]]\n\n  Over that same period a Democrat-led Senate and the Obama White House \nhave done little but grow the size of the government and shrink the \nsize of the middle class.\n  In 2009, Congress passed a $1 trillion stimulus bill that poured \ntaxpayer dollars into projects such as Solyndra and a battery \nmanufacturer that is now owned by the Chinese. It failed to create the \njobs and economic growth that was promised by the White House, but it \nsucceeded in creating 5 straight years of record deficits.\n  In 2010 Congress enacted ObamaCare--essentially a government takeover \nof one-sixth of our economy with 2,700 pages of new laws and 25,000 \npages of new regulations. It didn't fulfill the President's promise of \nlowering health care costs or letting families keep their doctors, but \nit has succeeded in canceling health plans and raising taxes.\n  In 2010 Congress enacted Dodd-Frank. It hasn't fixed too big to fail, \nbut in one respect it has succeeded in creating jobs. It is estimated \nthat more than 30,000 employees will be required to file the paperwork \nassociated with the $18 billion in Dodd-Frank compliance costs for our \nfinancial sector.\n  Meanwhile, Congress has failed to put a check on the EPA, which \ncontinues pushing regulations that have record-setting price tags. \nThese regulations aren't creating jobs, but they are fulfilling the \nPresident's promise to make energy prices skyrocket.\n  Five years into the Obama administration and the scorecard doesn't \nlook very good, with $456 billion in new regulations, $1.7 trillion in \nnew taxes, 10.4 million people unemployed, and economic growth far \nbehind the pace of other post-World War II recoveries.\n  So here we are debating the 13th extension of emergency unemployment \nbenefits in the past 5 years because we have 3.8 million people in this \ncountry, workers who have been out of work for more than 6 months. If \nenacted, these benefits would last until June. Then what? Are we going \nto have a 14th extension, perhaps a 15th extension? Without job \ncreating policies, this 13th extension is just another bandaid that \ndoesn't address the true causes of chronic joblessness that plague the \nObama economy.\n  My Republican colleagues and I came to the floor yet again this week \nto debate and to vote on amendment ideas that will change the course \nthe Obama administration has put the country on. We have offered dozens \nof amendments that will stimulate private-sector investment, create \njobs, and make energy and health care more affordable. I have worked \nwith many of my colleagues on a package of job-creating ideas that we \nwould like to add to this 13th extension of emergency unemployment \ninsurance benefits. My amendment, as I said, is called the Good Jobs, \nGood Wages, Good Hours Act, and it includes many of these ideas.\n  I would like to share a few of them with my colleagues in the Senate \nso people understand that when we come to the floor to talk about \noffering amendments and getting votes on amendments, we are serious. We \nhave real substantive ideas that we believe will address the \nfundamental issue--the underlying cause of chronic high unemployment--\nby getting people back to work through job creation, through an \nexpanding and growing economy.\n  My amendment includes a provision that has been pushed by Senator \nHoeven that would finally approve the Keystone XL Pipeline. After 5 \nyears of delay, it is time to approve the pipeline and the 40,000 jobs \nit will support. Senator Hoeven has been the leading advocate of that \nhere in the Senate.\n  The amendment I am offering includes Leader McConnell's legislation \nto stop EPA's war on affordable energy. Leader McConnell's bill puts \nconsumers ahead of liberal and environmental groups by stopping costly \nregulations that will make it even more difficult for the middle class \nto make ends meet.\n  My amendment includes a provision pushed by Senators Barrasso and \nHoeven to approve more LNG exports to our NATO allies and to the \nUkraine, something that is especially timely in light of what is going \non in that part of the world. Now is the ideal time to create more \ndomestic jobs while breaking our allies' dependence on Russian energy \nsupplies.\n  My amendment also addresses the problems created by ObamaCare. It \nincludes a provision pushed by Senator Collins that will restore the \n40-hour workweek. It will finally repeal the job-destroying medical \ndevice tax, which Senators Toomey and Hatch have been tirelessly \nfighting, which has cost us, by some estimates, 30,000 jobs already in \nour economy because of this new job-killing tax.\n  My amendment ensures that veterans and the long-term unemployed are \nnot punished by the costs of the ObamaCare employer mandate. It \nincludes a provision Senator Blunt has authored that raised this issue \nin the Senate on behalf of veterans, and in the House a similar bill \npassed by a vote of 406 to 1. Certainly we can find few Democrats who \nare willing to provide ObamaCare relief to veterans and the long-term \nunemployed.\n  My amendment also provides permanent targeted tax relief to millions \nof small businesses. Small businesses create 65 percent of all new \njobs. Yet this administration has done little more than punish them \nwith more regulations and higher taxes. This amendment makes permanent \nhigher expensing levels, provides capital gains tax relief for \ninvesting in small businesses, and expands options to increase cashflow \nat Main Street businesses across the country. It allows small \nbusinesses to deduct more startup costs, and puts the selfemployed on \nan equal playing field when paying for health care costs.\n\n  This amendment also includes commonsense regulatory reform put \nforward by Senator Portman that will ensure taxpayers know the true \ncost of new regulations. It requires agencies to conduct a cost-benefit \nanalysis and provide advanced notice of any major new regulations.\n  Finally, this amendment includes the House-passed SKILLS Act, which \nSenator Scott has introduced as an amendment to the UI bill. Currently, \nwe have 50 Federal worker training programs spread across nine Federal \nagencies. Many of them are duplicative and few of them have been \nevaluated for whether or not they are effective. This amendment would \ncombine 35 of those programs into one Workforce Investment Fund that \nwill empower governors to tailor programs to their States and benefit \nemployers and employees alike.\n  My point simply is that Senate Republicans stand ready to offer more \nthan just the status quo. We understand the long-term unemployed want \nmore than just 20 more weeks of unemployment benefits. They want a job. \nWe understand those who are struggling to adapt in a changing economy \nwant more than a morass of broken worker training programs. They want \nrelevant training that prepares them for the jobs that are in demand \ntoday. We understand that low-income families want more than government \nprograms designed to help them just get by. They want more opportunity \nand a better future for their children. We understand that Main Street \nbusinesses across the country cannot afford endless regulations coming \nfrom Washington, DC. They want a chance to succeed and to fulfill their \nAmerican dream.\n  I am hopeful that at least some of our colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle understand that basic principle too and will join us in \nincluding job- creating measures as part of this 13th extension of \nemergency unemployment benefits. We can do better for the American \npeople. We should do better by the American people.\n  We have serious proposals, serious job-creating proposals that don't \nget a chance to see the light of day because the majority party in the \nSenate blocks amendments from being offered, blocks amendments from \nbeing debated, and blocks amendments from being voted on.\n  So what do we have. We have the status quo. That means that for the \n13th time we have to extend unemployment insurance benefits to people \nwho have been unemployed for way too long because we have failed to put \npolicies in place that are actually good for job creation, that are \nactually the right types of incentives for our small businesses to \nhire, that take away the burdensome cost of taxes and regulations that \nmake it more expensive and more difficult for our small businesses to \nhire, and because we fail to take into consideration the impact that so \nmany of these things we do here in Washington have on hardworking \npeople in this country who are trying to lift\n\n[[Page S2140]]\n\ntheir families into the middle class and to provide a better future for \ntheir children and grandchildren.\n  That is what every American wants. That is what every family in \nAmerica aspires to. We ought to do something about it. Another meager \ngovernment check that helps people get by isn't the way to a brighter \nand better future. The way to a brighter and better future is a good-\npaying job with an opportunity for advancement. That is what we ought \nto be focused on, and that is what the provisions I just mentioned, \nthat are included in my amendment, would do.\n  My amendment incorporates many of the ideas Members on our side have \nadvanced, all with an eye toward creating jobs and growing and \nexpanding the economy in a way that will create those good-paying \nopportunities and give people a better chance at a better future. So I \nreally hope we will get the chance to vote. We can't, evidently, get \nindividual amendments that have been offered by individual Members \nvoted on, so we have taken a number of ideas and incorporated them into \nthis amendment, an alternative to what is being proposed by the \nDemocrats, which simply treats the symptom of this problem but does \nnothing to address the underlying cause of the problem.\n  We want to focus on the problem; we want to focus on the cause; we \nwant to focus on solutions; and we believe the Senate ought to be the \nplace where we have an opportunity to vote on those very solutions. So \nI encourage my colleagues on both sides to open this process. Let us \nallow the American people to have their voices heard--not just the \nvoices of a few but the voices of the many people in the Senate who \nhave good ideas about how to create jobs, grow the economy, and build a \nbetter future for our children and grandchildren.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak to the \nSenate as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Creating Real Value\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, in Kansas there is a company called Koch \nIndustries that is an important component of our State, its economy, \nand many, several thousand Kansans work there. Unfortunately, in the \npolitical discourse of our country, Koch Industries and its owners are \noften subject to attacks.\n\n  I happened to be reading the Wall Street Journal this morning, and I \nnoticed a column, an opinion piece written by the chairman of the board \nof Koch Industries, Charles G. Koch, and I wish to share that with my \ncolleagues today.\n  It seems to me the things that are outlined in Mr. Koch's opinion \npiece, while not everyone would agree, they are certainly within the \nwide mainstream of American thought and certainly reflect opinions that \nare worthy of debate and discussion in our country and on the Senate \nfloor.\n  We all bring diversity, a different set of values, opinions, beliefs \nof political philosophy to the debate on the Senate floor, and I wanted \nto share one of Koch Industries owner's beliefs about those values and \nhis philosophy and how it affects Americans today.\n  This is an opinion piece from today's Wall Street Journal written by \na Kansan, Charles Koch. Mr. Koch says:\n\n       I have devoted most of my life to understanding the \n     principles that enable people to improve their lives. It is \n     those principles--the principles of a free society--that have \n     shaped my life, my family, our company and America itself.\n       Unfortunately, the fundamental concepts of dignity, \n     respect, equality before law and personal freedom are under \n     attack by the nation's own government. That's why, if we want \n     to restore a free society and create greater well-being and \n     opportunity for all Americans, we have no choice but to fight \n     for those principles. I have been doing so for more than 50 \n     years, primarily through educational efforts. It was only in \n     the past decade that I realized the need to also engage in \n     the political process.\n\n  Again, Mr. Koch speaking:\n\n       More than 200 years ago, Thomas Jefferson warned that this \n     could happen. ``The natural progress of things,'' Jefferson \n     wrote, ``is for liberty to yield and government to gain \n     ground.'' He knew that no government could possibly run \n     citizens' lives for the better. The more government tries to \n     control, the greater the disaster, as shown by the current \n     health-care debacle. Collectivists (those who stand for \n     government control of the means of production and how people \n     live their lives) promise heaven but deliver hell. For them, \n     the promised end justifies the means. A truly free society is \n     based upon a vision of respect for people and what they \n     value. In a truly free society, any business that disrespects \n     its customers will fail, and deserves to do so. The same \n     should be true of any government that disrespects its \n     citizens. The central belief and fatal conceit of the current \n     administration is that you are incapable of running your own \n     life, but those in power are capable of running it for you. \n     This is the essence of big government and collectivism.\n       Instead of encouraging free and open debate, collectivists \n     strive to discredit and intimidate opponents. They engage in \n     character assassination. . . . This is the approach that \n     Albert Schopenhauer described in the 19th century, that Saul \n     Alinsky famously advocated in the 20th, and that so many \n     despots have infamously practiced. Such tactics are the \n     antithesis of what is required for a free society--and a \n     telltale sign that the collectivists do not have good \n     answers.\n       Rather than try to understand my vision for a free society \n     or accurately report the facts about Koch Industries, our \n     critics would have you believe we're ``un-American'' and \n     trying to ``rig the system,'' that we're against \n     ``environmental protection'' or eager to ``end workplace \n     safety standards.''\n\n  These falsehoods remind Mr. Koch of the late Senator Daniel Patrick \nMoynihan's observation, ``Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but \nnot to his own facts.''\n\n       Here are some facts about my philosophy and our company: \n     Koch companies employ 60,000 Americans; who make many \n     thousands of products that Americans want and need. According \n     to government figures, our employees and the 143,000 \n     additional American jobs they support generate $11.7 billion \n     in compensation and benefits. About one-third of our U.S.-\n     based employees are union members.\n       Koch employees have earned well over 700 awards for \n     environmental, health and safety excellence since 2009, many \n     of them are from the Environmental Protection Agency and the \n     Occupational Safety and Health Administration. EPA officials \n     have commended us for our ``commitment to a cleaner \n     environment'' and called us ``a model for other companies.''\n       Our refineries have consistently ranked among the best in \n     the nation for low per-barrel emissions. In 2012, our Total \n     Case Incident Rate--\n\n  That is a safety measure--\n\n     was 67% better than a Bureau of Labor Statistics average for \n     peer industries. Even so, we have never rested on our \n     laurels. We believe there is always room for innovation and \n     improvement.\n       Far from trying to rig the system, I have spent decades \n     opposing cronyism and all political favors, including \n     mandates, subsidies, and protective tariffs--even when we \n     benefit from them. I believe that cronyism is nothing more \n     than welfare for the rich and powerful, and should be \n     abolished. Koch Industries was the only major producer in the \n     ethanol industry to argue for the demise of the ethanol tax \n     credit in 2011. That government handout . . . needlessly \n     drove up food and fuel prices as well as other costs for \n     consumers--many of whom were poor or otherwise disadvantaged.\n\n  Mr. Koch says:\n\n       Now the mandate needs to go, so that consumers and the \n     marketplace are the ones who decide the future of ethanol.\n       Instead of fostering a system that enables people to help \n     themselves, America is now saddled with a system that \n     destroys values, raises costs, hinders innovation and \n     relegates millions of citizens to a life of poverty, \n     dependency and hopelessness. This is what happens when \n     elected officials believe that people's lives are better run \n     by politicians and regulators than by the people themselves. \n     Those in power fail to see that more government means less \n     liberty, and liberty is the essence of what it means to be \n     American. Love of liberty is an American ideal. If more \n     businesses (and elected officials) were to embrace a vision \n     of creating real value for people in a principled way, our \n     nation would be far better off--not just today, but for \n     generations to come. I'm dedicated to fighting for that \n     vision. I'm convinced that most Americans believe it's worth \n     fighting for, too.\n\n  That is the opinion piece from the Wall Street Journal this morning, \nwritten by a Kansan, Charles Koch.\n  I commend that opinion piece and its thoughts to my colleagues in the \nSenate.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S2141]]\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I come to the floor today to address \nthe unemployment benefits legislation. This legislation is, frankly, an \nadmission that after 5 years of spending more money for costly \ngovernment stimulus--all of it borrowed--to try to increase employment \nin America, we still have an unemployment crisis.\n  Not long ago at the White House, Mr. Sperling said that there are \nthree applicants for every job in America and wages are down. In \neffect, this legislation is an admission that taxing, spending, \nregulating, and borrowing has not worked. Indeed, those policies will \nnever work. More regulation, more taxing, more borrowing, and more debt \nwill not improve the economy. We know that. Despite what some so-called \nexperts say, we know that is not a policy that will work, but urgent \naction is needed.\n  According to testimony we heard this week in the Budget Committee, if \nyou adjust for the retirement of the baby boomers, the labor force is \nstill short 4.5 million people, the equivalent of $500 billion in \nnational income lost each year. But the majority has circled their \nwagons around this spend-and-borrow agenda.\n  For instance, our friends are blocking a Republican amendment \nrequiring companies to hire legal workers, not unlawful workers. The E-\nVerify system should be required nationwide. It would simply check the \nSocial Security number of applicants, which would identify many people \nwho have no right to be employed in America because they are not here \nlawfully. In a time of high unemployment, we ought not to be filling \nour jobs with people who are not lawful and not lawfully able to work \nin America, while at the same time financially supporting people who \nare unemployed in the country. At the same time, congressional \nDemocrats have pushed for a bill that would more than double the future \nH-1B guest worker visas that are frequently used for offshore jobs.\n  As ranking member of the Budget Committee, I have to inform my \ncolleagues that this unemployment bill is not honestly paid for, and \nthat it violates the Ryan-Murray budget agreement that was signed into \nlaw just over 3 months ago. We said we were not going to spend above a \ncertain amount.\n  Actually, Ryan-Murray raised the amount the Budget Control Act had \nlimited spending to when we were in a tight fix. I think this year in \nparticular was probably the toughest year under the Budget Control Act, \nso relief was provided and it raised the spending limits for a fifth \nyear and it helped. Just 3 months ago we reaffirmed those spending \nlimits and said we were not going to go above them.\n  Yet just this past Monday, the Senate passed the so-called doc fix \nwhich exceeded the Ryan-Murray spending limits by $6.1 billion this \nyear alone. We adopted a limit, and what do we do? We want to help our \ndoctors, but instead of reducing spending somewhere else in this \nmassive government, we come up with a gimmick argument to say we are \npaying for it and add, in effect, $6.1 billion to the expenditures this \nyear. We objected to that, but people voted to waive the budget with an \nup-or-down vote. Do you want to stick by the agreement we reached 3 \nmonths ago or do you want to raise it and spend more? The majority in \nthe Senate voted to spend more, and this is why we have such an extreme \ndebt threat in America today.\n  The bill that is before us now is the unemployment insurance \nlegislation, which exceeds the 2014 limit on spending by another $9.9 \nbillion. Our Federal budget is $3.5 trillion--$3,500 billion--and we \ncan't find some other reductions if we want to fund a new expenditure, \nsuch as unemployment compensation? We can't find someplace that we can \ntighten our belts and pay for it?\n  My colleagues say that while spending increases this year, the bill \nis paid for over the next decade. They promised that although we will \nspend more this year, a decade later--10 years--we are going to get \naround to paying for it. There are three major problems with this \ncontention, and we just have to address them so there is no mistake \nabout it. This is not legitimate, and it threatens the financial \nintegrity of the country.\n  The Ryan-Murray budget deal established spending limits. You cannot \nget out of those spending limits by raising fees and taxes. Taxing more \nto spend more was not the deal. The deal in the Budget Control Act said \nthat we are going to reduce the growth in spending. We were on track--\nover 10 years--to grow spending $10 trillion. Under the Budget Control \nAct, we were going to allow spending to increase, but it would only \nincrease $8 trillion, not $10 trillion.\n  Now we are told that the Budget Control Act, which includes the \nsequester--we can't live with it. Growing and spending $8 trillion is \nnot enough; we have to grow spending even more. Every time some worthy \ncause is brought before the Senate, we take the easy way out. We come \nup with a gimmick pay-for or we just violate the budget and spend the \nmoney anyway. What good is it to have a Ryan-Murray budget agreement or \na Budget Control Act if nobody adheres to it?\n  Second, one of the big reasons our country is going broke is the \nphilosophy of ``spend today and promise to pay for it tomorrow.'' Here \nis what a new Bloomberg analysis--an independent group--concluded:\n\n       Since December 2013 [three months ago] the Republican House \n     and the Democratic Senate have approved more than $40 billion \n     worth of spending ``offsets'' in the form of cuts that would \n     take place in 2023 at the earliest or timing shifts in policy \n     to bring savings into the 10-year window . . .\n\n  Both of these gimmicks are not legitimate, will not work, and have \nbeen criticized by independent groups that are concerned about the \nfuture of the Republic.\n  Third, the promised revenue offsets are phony savings. The offsets \ncome from something called ``pension smoothing''--wow, what is \n``pension smoothing''?--and ``prepayment of premiums to the Pension \nBenefit Guaranty Corporation.'' These are two popular schemes--double \ncounting and timing shifts--that allow companies to prepay their \npayments for up to 5 years. In good times companies can pay ahead to \nthe PBGC trust fund and Congress can take the money out the backdoor \nand spend it on--in this case--unemployment. In bad times this will \nleave the taxpayer further on the hook if PBGC has to take over a \nfailed pension plan. It is taking money out of the plan that was \nsupposed to be set up to guarantee and insure pensions.\n  I realize some of this sounds complex, but that is the problem: the \nbig spenders in Washington have turned bilking taxpayers into an art \nform. Some spend their whole time trying to come up with a gimmick to \nget around the actual requirement, which is for us to set priorities \nand to recognize we cannot fund everything we would like to fund.\n  If we have a new idea for a new program, the Budget Control Act says: \nOK, do it, but you have to do it within the spending limits. You have \nto find some spending reduction to justify a new spending increase. \nThat is what we agreed to, and that is what the President of the United \nStates signed into law. He also signed Ryan-Murray into law. Is he here \nadvocating responsible action? No, he is here supporting the Democratic \nleadership to push these budget-busting provisions and is not properly \npaying for them. Frankly, that is a disappointment.\n  The President of the United States is the chief person who talks to \nthe American people. He has yet to look them in the eye and tell them \nwe are on an unsustainable course, and we are going to have to tighten \nour belts. Instead, every time he talks, he talks about a new spending. \nA new program that spends more, in essence, is borrowing more and \nincreasing our debt even further.\n  In the few months since Ryan-Murray was passed, the Senate--driven by \na Democratic majority--has passed five bills that busted through the \nRyan-Murray limits. There have been five bills that busted the budget. \nWe just agreed to it, and they just voted for it 3 months ago.\n  They say these are all important measures and we have to pass them, \nso we should disregard those prior promises we made to the American \npeople. The whole point of a spending limit is to make Congress set \npriorities. If you feel you have legislation that needs to pass, it is \nyour duty to find a way to pay for it within the limits of spending we \nagreed to.\n\n[[Page S2142]]\n\n  This is not a radical concept. This is responsible governance. It is \ndone in cities and States all over America. They are living within \ntheir means. They are tightening up their efficiencies in productivity. \nPeople holler and wail whenever they make those cuts, but those cities, \ncounties, and States are still standing. They have not been sucked into \nthe ocean. They are still operating. They are going to be leaner, more \nefficient, and more productive as the result of going through a tight \nbudget time. As money rises, and hopefully the economy bounces back, \nthey will be in a better position in the future to serve the taxpayers \nof their communities efficiently.\n  Here are the budget violations in the pending bill, and these budget \nviolations were all confirmed. I am the ranking Republican of the \nBudget Committee, and the Democratic chairman, Senator Murray, is a \nfine and fair chairman of the committee. Her team has acknowledged \nthese violations of the budget, and as a result, it is subject to a \nbudget point of order. There is not a dispute about what I am saying \ntoday.\n  There is $9.9 billion in spending in excess of the top-line outlays \nfor fiscal year 2014 set by the Ryan-Murray spending agreement. There \nis also another violation of the Budget Control Act because there is \n$9.9 billion of spending in excess of the Finance Committee's \nallocations.\n  The committees have certain allocations. The Finance Committee has a \ncertain allocation, and now it is spending $9.9 billion more. How much \nis $9.9 billion? Well, in Alabama we have a lean State government, and \nI am proud of it. My State's budget is about $2 billion. This is $9.9 \nbillion, and it is in violation of our agreement.\n  Also, there is a $10.7 billion increase in long-term deficits in the \ndecade beyond the budget window that is subject to a budget point of \norder, and that is in violation of the budget.\n  Ordinarily, we would be able to raise a point of order to enforce all \nthree of these violations. However, two of these points of order were \nwiped away by a loophole created in the language of the Ryan-Murray \nlegislation. I warned them that it was in there, and I urged my \ncolleagues not to adopt it, but it was adopted anyway. Two of the \nbudget points of order I just mentioned are not subject to floor action \nand have been eliminated, basically, through the use of the deficit-\nneutral reserve fund. At the time of the Ryan-Murray deal's \nconsideration, the Budget Committee staff--my staff--did the work and \nwe warned that the 57 deficit-neutral reserve funds in the Ryan-Murray \nbill would be used to increase spending above the spending limits. We \nwarned that would happen. The way that works is the majority can get \naround the budget rules that limit spending if they propose to offset \nnew spending with new higher taxes.\n\n  So we are witnessing today exactly what I warned would happen: The \nminority has lost the procedural tool to block spending increases as \nlong as they pay for it with more taxes.\n  What we agreed to under the Budget Control Act was that we couldn't \nspend above this limit, and if we raised taxes, it would be used to \nreduce the deficit. So now we have been able to switch that around so \nthe raising of taxes is allowed to increase new spending.\n  These deficit reserve funds have been used by Senator Reid and the \nmajority to pass a proposed additional $13 billion in spending above \nthe caps already. However, the unemployment bill still triggers a long-\nterm deficit point of order because it uses revenue timing shifts to \nconceal long-term deficit impact. So it is still in violation of the \nbudget, even though two of the points of order are gone.\n  We do need to look at the long-term deficit picture. It is good that \nwe still at least have that point of order we can raise. We can't just \nspend today because it fits within the 10-year window and somehow looks \nOK, when we know in the outyears it is going to add to the deficit of \nthe United States. So the budget drafters and the BCA people have \nlanguage in to prohibit that, rightly so. The problem is we won't \nadhere to it.\n  Last year, we paid our creditors $221 billion in interest payments--\n$221 billion on our roughly $17 trillion debt. That is a huge amount of \nmoney. The Federal highway bill is $40 billion. Aid to education--a \nwhole bunch of programs we have--$100 billion in total. The Defense \nbudget is $500 billion. We paid our creditors last year $221 billion in \ninterest alone on the debt. That is enough to pay for 172 weeks of \nunemployment benefits for everyone collecting at the end of last year. \nOver the course of the next 10 years, according to CBO, we will spend a \ncumulative $5.8 trillion in interest payments on our debt. Over the \nnext 10 years, CBO--our accounting firm that tries to do the right \nthing every day and tells us what is going to happen with our budget--\ntells us we are going to spend over $5 trillion, almost $6 trillion, in \ninterest in the next 10 years--money that could be used to help people, \nto rebuild our infrastructure, to fix crumbling roads and bridges. At \ntoday's levels, that $5.8 trillion could pay for a great amount of \ngreat things.\n  The CBO also told us that 10 years from today, the 1-year annual \ninterest payment will not be $221 billion, it will be $880 billion--\n$880 billion, an increase of over $650 billion in interest payments \neach year--not one time, but that year alone we will pay $600 billion \nmore in interest. So how can we fund programs? Isn't it going to crowd \nout spending we need?\n  Washington is squandering our national inheritance. We are a nation \ndeeply in debt. I would say to my colleagues that every time you \nviolate our budget limits--because I am not voting for it--every time \nyou add more to the Nation's credit card, you are increasing the \ninterest burden that is crushing America, and you reduce the amount of \nmoney that will be available to spend on whatever program you would \nlike to spend it on as the years go by. Interest costs represent the \nfastest growing item in our budget. How much money will there be left \nover for your chosen government projects when our interest payment \nreaches almost $1 trillion a year? CBO says that by 2024, it will hit \n$880 billion. How many more years will it take, 2 or 3, to reach $1 \ntrillion?\n  We must help the unemployed, no doubt about it. We need to help them \nget better jobs, more jobs, and better pay, and we have to do so \nwithout adding more to the debt. That is what is placing a wet blanket \nover the American economy.\n  We need to produce more American energy. We can do that.\n  We need to streamline our Tax Code to lower rates, close loopholes, \nand boost economic growth. We need to eliminate regulations that are \nreducing productive activities and sending jobs overseas.\n  We need to endorse a trade policy that defends the American worker \nfrom unfair trade practices. Too much of that is occurring. We don't \nneed to lose a single job to unfair trade practices.\n  We need an immigration policy that serves the interests of the \nAmerican worker. At a time of high unemployment, the very idea the \nSenate would pass a bill that would permanently double the number of \nguest workers who can enter the country boggles the mind. That, in \naddition to the fact they would legalize 11 million and increase the \nannual flow of immigrants into the country from 1 million a year--the \nmost generous of any Nation in the world--to 1.5 million. In effect, \nunder the bill that passed this Senate, we would be providing permanent \nlegal status to about 30 million people in the next 10 years. Our \ncurrent law allows for 1 million a year--about 10 million over the next \n10 years. Is it any wonder people are having a hard time getting a job \ntoday?\n  There is not a tight labor market out there; there is a loose labor \nmarket. How do I know? Because wages are going down. If employers are \ndesperate and need more workers and can't find them, why aren't they \nhaving to pay higher wages to get good workers?\n  We have to stand up. The American people need to know what is \nhappening to them.\n  What is the solution, our colleagues say? Well, unemployment is too \nhigh and wages are not going up; let's borrow more money and spend it \nby sending out unemployment checks to people who are unemployed because \nsomebody illegally here took a job they could have taken.\n  There is no doubt about this: We need to create and transform the \nwelfare office into an office that transforms the lives of people who \nare struggling today. We have 40 job programs, at least. We have more \nthan 80 different\n\n[[Page S2143]]\n\nmeans-tested social programs. Those all need to be consolidated. There \nneeds to be one central place where an American who is hurting, who is \nout of work and needs help, may be given financial help, but also \ncounseled and provided training in the things they might need to get a \njob. Maybe instead of a subsidy while they're unemployed, individuals \nneed help with transportation to go to work. Maybe they need help \nrelocating to another town where the jobs are readily available.\n  This idea that we just continue to spend more and more on attempting \nto help people by giving them money without helping them transform \ntheir lives and become productive has to end. In fact, all the means-\ntested programs all added up amount to more than $750 billion, which is \nmore than all the other individual programs we spend money on--more \nthan Social Security, more than Medicare, more than Medicaid, more than \nthe Defense Department.\n  This country has some challenges in front of it. If we would respond \nwith classic American values of hard work, individual responsibility, \nand our technology and training, we could turn this country around. But \nwe don't have any leadership in that regard. Any change, any \nsuggestions that we would reduce a subsidy program in order to fund job \ntraining or even fund unemployment compensation is a nonstarter around \nhere, it appears.\n  I am worried about where we are. This unemployment insurance violates \nthe budget. We should not pass it. We should do it within the budget \nand we need to analyze it carefully to make sure we are doing it in a \nway that actually helps those we intend to help.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I came to the floor today with the \nintention of asking unanimous consent to pass H.R. 3521, which we have \nheard a lot about on the floor lately between Senator Vitter and \nSenator Sanders. This bill would authorize the construction of 27 \nveterans clinics--2 of them in our State, Louisiana, 1 in Lake Charles \nand 1 in Lafayette.\n  It is a long and sad story about why these clinics have not been \nbuilt. I will get into that in a minute. As you can see, Texas, \nCalifornia, Florida, Georgia, and other States are affected. I know the \nSenators from those States support what we are trying to do.\n  Yesterday or the day before, my colleague came to the floor to call \nme ``ineffective.'' I would like to say that I was a little bit shocked \nto hear that. I have been called many things on the floor of this \nSenate--hardheaded, stubborn, tenacious, the Senator who never quits. I \nhave never been called ineffective, so it was a little bit shocking.\n  What I can say is that I think I have spent 18 years on the floor of \nthe Senate and here working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nand developing very strong friendships, very good relationships and \ntrusting friendships that I think have accrued in large measure in a \nvery beneficial way to the State I represent and to the region of the \ncountry I am also so proud to represent, the gulf coast.\n  Maybe my colleague was having a bad day. I am going to let it go, but \nit was a little shocking to hear that word.\n  Back to the issue. The issue is quite serious. The issue is that we \nhave had a process of building veterans clinics in this country a \ncertain way for a very long time. About 3 years ago CBO kind of out of \nthe blue decided to change the scoring mechanism--instead of the way we \nwere doing it through a leasing process, change the scoring system to \ncause the budget problem, the constraints in the budget to not allow us \nto move forward with the construction of these veterans facilities.\n  But added to that change, what is really happening in Louisiana and \nwhy this is such an important issue for us is that we were scheduled to \nbuild our two clinics and had waited in line patiently for many years. \nOur clinics were getting ready to be built in Lafayette and Lake \nCharles, which are a very important part of our outreach to the tens of \nthousands of veterans in our State.\n  The Veterans' Administration itself made a very serious mistake, \nwhich they have admitted in writing, verbally. General Shinseki has \nbeen down to our State to visit these sites, to talk with many of us in \nLouisiana about how unfortunate it was that mistakes in the bidding \nprocess were made--not by us, not by the State, not by the locals, but \nby the Federal Government. Because of these mistakes, our process of \nbuilding these clinics was delayed.\n  That is why House Member Boustany--a wonderful colleague and a dear \nfriend and a great leader--has been leading the effort. These are \nbasically in his district. He and I have been working very closely to \ntry to bring to the attention of the leadership here the fact that they \nmade the mistake, not us. We should not have to pay the penalty because \nof that.\n  Then, in the midst of that fight, this new scoring mechanism came \ndown.\n  Now we cannot get out from underneath either the offset required or \nthe new process required to get our clinics built. It has nothing to do \nwith need--we are at the top of that list. We have the need. We have \nthe veterans. We have the commitment of the Federal Government to get \nthese built.\n  All of our delegation has been working very closely to try to get \nthese clinics built. I am happy to say that I am here today--as I have \nalways been on this issue--supporting it and will ask in just a \nminute--I wanted to ask but will not ask in just a minute--for \nunanimous consent to build these clinics without an offset, just as the \nHouse bill passed. It is a $1.6 billion charge. It would move without \nan offset. That is what the House voted on. It was a huge vote, 346 \nvotes, Republicans and Democrats. I think when we have a vote like \nthat, we need to really pay attention over here. They voted to build \nthese clinics at a cost of $1.6 billion without an offset.\n  That is what I am going to ask for. Senator Coburn will object. He \nhas let me know he will object. Unfortunately, because of personal \nreasons, he is unable to be here today. So out of respect for the \nprocess of the Senate and out of courtesy, I will not be asking for \nthat unanimous consent now, but I will be asking for it early next \nweek.\n  Just to be clear, it will be a unanimous consent to build these 27 \nclinics based on the House vote without this bill going back to the \nHouse, going straight to the President's desk for signature by the \nPresident.\n  The offset the Senator from Louisiana offered is a bogus offset. We \nhave a letter from CBO that I would like to read into the Record. The \njunior Senator from Louisiana offered his offset to supposedly raise \nthe $1.6 billion that will pay for this. This is from the CBO analysis.\n  It says: Based on preliminary estimates of the amendment offered by \nSenator Vitter, based on the information of the Department of Defense \nand the Department of Veterans Affairs and their current practices and \njoint purchases of prescription drugs, I do not estimate any savings \nfor drug purchases relative to current law. My preliminary estimate of \nthe amendment would be a minimal discretionary cost of less than \n$500,000.\n  There is no money to be saved by the amendment offered by Senator \nVitter, so I would be offering the bill to build these clinics with no \noffset, and that is what the House passed. It will go directly to the \nPresident's desk, and we will resolve the problem for these States. \nThen we will finally figure out a way to get back on track building \nclinics that we need and figure out a way to pay for these clinics in \nthe future, but these clinics got stuck in kind of a technical \nbureaucratic mess in the recalculation. Ours, in particular, were \ncaught because they should have been built in the 2 years before this \nnew scoring process came to be, which is why Louisiana is having a \nparticularly difficult time.\n  But as the record will show, our entire delegation has supported this \neffort. I honor the leadership of Congressman Boustany from the House, \nwho has literally worked on this tirelessly for 6 years. I thank the \nHouse delegation for sending this bill over.\n  I will not require an offset. The offset Senator Vitter offered is \nbogus.\n\n[[Page S2144]]\n\n  As soon as Senator Coburn can get back, which will be early next \nweek, I will be offering this unanimous consent. Unfortunately, I \nunderstand he will object to it because he believes we should find a \nway to pay for it. There might be other objections as well, but I am \nlooking forward to the debate with Senator Coburn next week.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. (Ms. Hirono). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               GM Recall\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, yesterday's hearing of the commerce \ncommittee's subcommittee on consumer safety provided a powerful and \nimportant moment in our legislative process, and I want to thank my \ncolleague, the chairman of that subcommittee, Chairman McCaskill, for \nenabling us to come together, as well as my other colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle, Senators Klobuchar and Boxer and Ayotte, for their \nvery insightful and significant questions and comments on a challenge \nthat should unite us on both sides of the aisle--the tragic events, \ndeath and life-changing injuries to unsuspecting drivers who were \nvictims of a defective ignition switch in automobiles manufactured by \nGM; a car defect that should have been fixed, disclosed, and remedied \nbefore these deaths occurred.\n  I want to thank the families of the victims of these defective cars \nfor coming forward and being at that hearing yesterday and sharing \ntheir stories with me and others. They are doing a great public service \nthrough their courage and strength.\n  I want to also thank Mary Barra, the CEO of GM. As I said to her \nthen, and I will repeat now, I admire her fortitude and her service in \ncoming forward to face the questions of our committee and be the face \nof General Motors on the issues that confront us now in car safety. I \nadmire her career at GM--an engineer who has risen through the ranks, a \nsecond-generation employee at an iconic, great American manufacturing \ncompany.\n  I have long admired that company and the products it has produced. \nThey have enriched the lives of so many Americans over the years. My \nhope is this hearing and this process will be a turning point for the \ncompany in facing these car safety challenges.\n  I admire greatly also its dealers and employees. Some of them have \ncontacted me, especially Connecticut dealers, telling me how they are \nreaching out proactively to the drivers of these defective vehicles, \nasking them to bring them to their company so they can be repaired \nbefore they do further damage.\n  This great company can reclaim its iconic brand and luster by \nbreaking with its past, and Mary Barra has the opportunity for this \nhistoric contribution. As I said to her yesterday, she may be \nsurrounded by a phalanx of lawyers and public relations people who will \nadvise her to be cautious, to be timid, and to be reactive, but now is \nthe time for her to seize the initiative and take three simple steps as \na beginning.\n  No. 1, establish a compensation fund for all who have suffered damage \nfrom this defective ignition switch which caused cars to crash, some of \nthem to burn--victims who have suffered injuries and death as well as \neconomic damage. No. 2, provide a warning--a clear, strong warning--to \ndrivers still behind the wheels of vehicles that still have this \ndefective ignition switch. The cars are under recall but unrepaired. \nPeople are still driving them, many not knowing the full risk they have \nundertaken by continuing to drive. A strong warning to ground those \nvehicles until they are repaired is what is needed now.\n\n  Third, support our legislation. Senator Markey and I have offered \nlegislation that would provide for better reporting by car companies, a \nstronger accountability system, and better disclosure through a \ndatabase to consumers so they will know what the risks are before they \ntake them and can make informed choices about what they drive and when.\n  These steps are well warranted by the past misconduct of GM, but they \nare also potentially a model for other companies in doing the right \nthing--facing the truth, telling truth to power, and making sure \ninnocent consumers are protected against harms that may not be known to \nthem.\n  She had the opportunity to break with the past culture--a culture of \ndeniability and of deception. Deception is what happened at GM. These \nignition switches were known to be defective. As early as 2001, year \nafter year there were reliable and material facts indicating to GM it \nhad a responsibility to fix these vehicles. Yet they took no action to \nrepair them, to recall them, to inform consumers. And the fix was not a \nmajor costly one. It was $2 per vehicle--easily done. Yet in 2005, \n2006, GM made a business decision that the price was too high, the time \nwas too long, and it continued to provide those vehicles for sale to \nconsumers.\n  Then it deceived the U.S. Government. I have already spoken on the \nfloor about section 612 of the agreement GM signed that indicated there \nwere no material adverse facts at the time it was bailed out in 2009 as \npart of the reorganization. That deception is bad enough, but what \nhappened as a result of that reorganization was a shield from \nliability, a form of immunity against legal accountability granted only \nbecause GM failed to disclose to the United States and to the \nbankruptcy court that it might well be liable and in fact was \nresponsible for these defective vehicles. That shield from liability \nstill bedevils the victims of injuries, death, and economic damage as \nthey seek to hold GM accountable because GM itself is invoking that \nshield in courts today around the country and seeking to dismiss \nactions brought against it, seeking to return them to the bankruptcy \ncourt where the black hole of discharge will prevent recovery.\n  I welcome the independent investigation GM has undertaken by a very \ncredible and respected former U.S. attorney. I welcome the appointment \nof consultant Ken Feinberg, also well respected, with experience and \nexpertise in providing compensation. But GM itself has still said there \nis no compensation fund and it will not commit to one. And as able as \nthese two individuals are, the question remains, what will it take? \nWhat facts or evidence will be required to persuade GM to do the right \nthing?\n  I think there is more than ample evidence--in fact, abundant evidence \nnow--as to what the path should be, and I urged it yesterday on Mary \nBarra. GM should very simply do the right thing now: Establish a \ncompensation fund sufficient to seek to make these victims whole. \nNothing will erase or even ease the pain and grief suffered by these \nfamilies and loved ones, but justice has its own virtue. GM has the \nrare opportunity in American corporate life to do justice and not wait \nfor its consultants and its investigators to ``work through the issues \nhere.'' Working through the issues here means doing right by those \nvictims.\n  Yesterday I asked Ms. Barra about the safety of the vehicles still on \nthe road. She assured me they were fine to drive--as long as the key \nwas not overloaded, as long as the ignition switch was used alone \nwithout additional keys. She assured me there was no more risk to drive \none of those vehicles than any other in use today.\n  I asked her about the contradiction of that statement with the recall \nnotice itself. I am going to display it here. It says that these \nvehicles are risky to drive, in effect, if your keyring is carrying \nadded weight or--and I emphasize that it is an ``or''--there are rough \nroad conditions or jarring or impact-related events.\n  Unfortunately, too many of our highways and our byways have rough \nroad conditions or provide the opportunity for jarring events.\n  Ms. Barra may believe tests and analyses done by her company she \nreferred to yesterday assured her and GM that driving these defective \nvehicles is safe as long as it is done with only the ignition key, \nwithout the added weight of additional keys, but she must know, because \nshe has children--as do I and most Members of this body--that they will \ndrive with additional keys on that ignition switch. In fact, hundreds \nof thousands--millions of Americans have no idea that driving these \nvehicles with\n\n[[Page S2145]]\n\nadded keys provides that kind of potentially fatal risk. When these \ncars lose power, they lose steering, they lose their brakes, and they \nlose their airbags. Losing power, brakes, and steering is terrifying, \nbut airbags are essential if power is lost and the car crashes, as \nvictims of these crashes have discovered, to their sorrow and the grief \nof their families.\n  This kind of pothole, a rough road condition, a potentially jarring \nevent--how common are they? This photograph is from Surf Avenue in \nStratford, a beautiful town along the coast of Connecticut. I could \ntake hundreds of these photographs from Connecticut, which has better \nroads than many other places in our State or country. They are as \ncommon as the roads themselves.\n  Those risks are GM's responsibility to warn. It has failed to do so. \nI asked Ms. Barra what evidence or facts would persuade her to issue a \nstronger warning. The recall notice itself said that risk increases if \nyour keyring is carrying added weight--such as more keys or the key fob \nitself; the key fob alone adds additional weight--or your vehicle is \nexperiences rough road conditions or other jarring or impact-related \nevents. What would persuade her to issue this warning to consumers: \nStop driving these cars until they are repaired.\n  I specifically asked her whether evidence about drivers who have, in \nfact, experienced the power loss without adding additional weight to \ntheir keyrings--if they encountered these kinds of conditions and their \ncars shut down--would persuade her to change her view. She answered to \nme:\n\n       Senator, if I had any data, any incidents where with just \n     the key, or the key and the ring, there was any risk, I \n     would ground these vehicles across the country.\n\n  Ms. Barra, let me tell you about Laura Valle. In March of 2014, Ms. \nValle, who owns a 2007 silver Chevrolet Cobalt, received GM's recall \nletter instructing her to remove all items from her keyring, leaving \nonly the vehicle key. As the recall notice instructed, she continued to \ndrive her vehicle using only the vehicle key. Yet, while driving with a \nfriend, she lost power. Fortunately, she was on the right side of the \nroad and she was able to pull the vehicle to a stop.\n  There will be other instances. I know they will come forward to me, \nto my colleagues, and to lawyers who may represent them.\n  Today I call on GM to issue that warning. There is more than ample \nevidence or, as Ms. Barra said, ``data,'' ``incidents'' where the key \nor just the key and the ring led to the vehicle stopping not because \nthere was added weight but because they encountered rough road \nconditions or jarring events, which could consist of simply leaning the \nwrong way or the driver's knee moving.\n  These vehicles create unacceptable risks before they are repaired. \nThe advice GM should give to people is this: Bring these cars to be \nrepaired immediately. Stop driving them. In the meantime, use the \nloaners GM has offered.\n  GM has the opportunity to avoid another business decision. It may be \nmore costly to provide loaners, but in the long run they will save \nlives and dollars.\n  Finally, I ask GM to do the right thing again by supporting the \nlegislation Senator Markey and I have introduced. This legislation is \ncritically important to the future. It can't correct the past, but it \ncan make sure that accidents are reported; that defects are made known \nto the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration; and that \nthere are not only incentives for reporting but there is increased \naccountability for failing to do so; and require NHTSA to establish a \npublicly accessible, searchable database that will allow drivers and \nconsumer safety advocates to connect the dots. Companies that are \nunwilling to connect those dots will be brought to justice, will be \nrequired to recall these vehicles and find out about defective models \nin time to save lives.\n  Ms. Barra has not yet committed to supporting this bill. In my view, \nit is her responsibility to do so. It is the responsibility of GM to \ntake this action now. She and GM have the opportunity to change \ncorporate culture not only in that company but in others by setting a \nmodel--leading by example, not by their words at a Senate hearing or \nletters of apology but by action. Action speaks louder than words. \nAction speaks louder than the appointment of a consultant or an \ninvestigator whose report may not be made fully public.\n\n  Ms. Barra was unwilling to make that commitment yesterday. It is a \ncorporate culture that refused to make a 57-cent change to car \nignitions--or a $2 change--even though that change would have saved \nlives. Now is the time to hold GM accountable, for GM to issue that \nwarning that will help save others from a fate known only too well by \nthose families who came to be with us yesterday.\n  I look forward to working with Ms. Barra, GM, my colleagues, and with \nall who are interested in improving car safety and to using this sad, \ntragic, unfortunate experience as a turning point and a teaching \nmoment--a rare moment--of bipartisan action to make our roads safer.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. SCOTT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCOTT. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I rise today to discuss my two amendments to the legislation we have \nbeen debating this week. I think most of us would agree we need to give \nfolks a hand up. That makes a lot of sense. But we also need to ensure \nthey have a solid foundation on which it stands. The best way we can \nhelp the unemployed is to help them find a job. My amendments aim to do \njust that. First, we will restore the 40-hour workweek which was \ndestroyed by ObamaCare. The employer mandate currently requires \nemployers to provide health insurance to full-time employees, and the \nnew definition of a full-time employee is 30 hours per workweek. As a \nresult, employers are cutting hours for many of the employees to fewer \nthan 30 hours per week.\n  I have heard from several employers at home in South Carolina, \nrepresenting institutions as large as Clemson University and as small \nas the local surf shop that are suffering the consequences of this new \n30-hour definition.\n  A few weeks ago I was on a bus in Charleston talking with some of my \nconstituents. I started speaking with one young man who had just moved \nto South Carolina from Georgia looking for new opportunities. He worked \nfor a restaurant and had recently received notice that his hours were \ngetting cut. After talking with this young man for a few minutes, it \nbecame very clear to me that his pay was cut and his hours were \ndwindling as a direct result of the 30-hour rule. Not only was he \nlosing 25 percent of his pay, he was losing the ability to work \novertime.\n  According to the Hoover Institution, 2.6 million Americans are \nespecially at risk of having their hours and wages cut like the young \nman with whom I was speaking. Of those 2.6 million Americans, 59 \npercent of them are between the ages of 19 and 34, 63 percent are \nwomen, and 90 percent do not have a college degree. Further, families \nmost at risk are those with a median income, $29,126.\n  Many of these millions of Americans who are earning hourly wages to \nsupport their family will see a 25-percent cut in their pay as \nemployers struggle with the massive new costs forced on them by the \nFederal Government--their Federal Government. Thanks to ObamaCare, not \nonly will these workers not have health insurance but they will no \nlonger have full-time jobs. We must--and I want to emphasize we must--\nrestore the 40-hour workweek, period.\n  My second amendment is the same as my SKILLS Act which I introduced \nas a part of my opportunity agenda earlier this year. It provides much \nneeded reforms to modernize the government's bureaucratic means of \nworkforce development and training programs. With 4 million jobs \ncurrently unfilled across our Nation today, including 65,000 jobs in \nSouth Carolina, job skills training is critical for folks looking for \nwork. We have to make sure people are prepared\n\n[[Page S2146]]\n\nfor continued success, and that starts with education and workforce \ntraining.\n  Thanks to the leadership of my colleague, Mrs. Foxx in the House, the \nSKILLS Act has already passed with some Democratic support on the other \nside of the Capitol. It is well past time for that to happen in the \nSenate, and I hope my colleagues will join me in providing more skills \nand more opportunities to develop the skills to put Americans back to \nwork.\n  This is truly a conversation about jobs. How do we encourage job \ngrowth and stop the government from blocking job creation? It is a \nsimple answer. These two amendments are steps in the right direction. \nLet's not let politics dictate the future of these two amendments. We \ncan do better, and we should.\n  Thank you, Madam President, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 2:30 p.m. \ntoday all postcloture time on the Reed of Rhode Island amendment No. \n2874 be considered expired; that the following amendments be withdrawn: \nNos. 2875, 2877, 2878; that Senator Sessions or designee then be \nrecognized to raise a point of order against the Senator Reed of Rhode \nIsland amendment No. 2874; once the budget point of order is raised, \nSenator Murray or designee be recognized to make a motion to waive; the \nSenate then proceed to vote on the motion to waive; if the motion to \nwaive is agreed to, the Senate then proceed to vote on adoption of the \nReed of Rhode Island amendment No. 2874; that upon disposition of the \nReed amendment, the Senate proceed to vote on the motion to invoke \ncloture on H.R. 3979; that if cloture is invoked on the bill, no other \namendments or motions be in order to the bill; that at 5:30 p.m. on \nMonday, April 7, all postcloture time be considered expired and the \nbill as amended, if amended, be read a third time and the Senate \nproceed to vote on passage of the bill, as amended, if amended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                            THE MINIMUM WAGE\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. There are a number of women who are going to be joining \nme today. They are leaders in this Capitol who are working each and \nevery day, both here and back in their home States, to give more of \ntheir constituents a chance to succeed. Today we are here to talk about \none small idea that stands to make a huge difference in the lives of \nour constituents, and for women in particular, and that is the idea \nthat if you are putting in 40 or 50 or 60 hours of work per week you \nshould be able to put food on your table and pay your bills, and you \nwon't be stuck below the poverty line.\n  This idea could change the lives of millions of Americans if Congress \nsimply acted and raised the minimum wage. We need to act now because \nright now one in four women--one in four women--is making minimum wage \ntoday. That is 15 million American women who are making the equivalent \nof about 2 gallons of gas per hour. Are we prepared to tell them that \nshould be enough to support themselves and their kids?\n  In fact, as I am sure you will hear repeated by others today, nearly \ntwo-thirds of those who earn minimum wage or less are women. This is \ncoming at a time when more women are now depended upon as the sole \nincome earners in their families. Right now in cities and towns across \nAmerica there are millions of those women who are getting up at the \ncrack of dawn for work every day. They are stuck living in poverty. \nThey cannot save for a car, much less a house. They cannot pay for \nschool so they can get better skills and a better paying job. They \ncannot even afford to provide their children with more winter clothes \nor basic medical care. That is not how it is supposed to work in \nAmerica, the country where you are told if you work hard and play by \nthe rules you can get ahead.\n  So when we talk about the minimum wage, let's be clear: Raising the \nminimum wage is about bringing back our middle class. I am proud that \nin my State of Washington we are taking the lead. In our State our \nworkforce enjoys the highest minimum wage in the country, and I am glad \nto point out to all of our friends on the other side of the aisle, \nWashington State's economy has not been negatively impacted by our high \nminimum wage. In fact, our economy has benefited from a high minimum \nwage.\n  Job growth has continued at a rate above the national average. \nPayrolls in our restaurants and bars have expanded due to people having \nmore money in their pockets to spend at dinner or a night on the town, \nand poverty in Washington State has trailed the national level for at \nleast 7 years now. That is why I support making the national minimum \nwage $10.10 for families from Washington to Wisconsin, from \nMassachusetts to Minnesota and Hawaii and everywhere in-between.\n  It is not enough to make you rich, but it is a small raise for \nmillions of families who desperately need it. It is a small raise for \nmoms and dads who need help. We have to do more. Today, two-thirds of \nfamilies rely on income from both parents, but thanks to our outdated \nTax Code, a woman thinking about reentering the workforce as a second \nearner in her family may face higher tax rates than her husband. That \nis unfair, and it has to change.\n  Last week I introduced the 21st Century Worker Tax Cut Act which will \nhelp solve that problem by giving struggling two-earner families with \nchildren a tax deduction on that second earner's income.\n  My hope is that over the coming weeks we can all come together in \nthis Chamber on behalf of millions of American women who--like my own \nmother when I was growing up--are the sole caregiver and breadwinner in \ntheir families.\n  I hope our colleagues have gotten a sense of how the current $7.25 an \nhour translates to a grocery trip for a family of four, shopping for \nschool supplies or even how it impacts people's daily commutes.\n  That is why we are here today--to give that mom or that dad a fair \nshot at succeeding in America. I am proud to be joined today by a \nnumber of my colleagues in the Senate who are strong women and fighting \nfor women and men in their home States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schatz). The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, when my grandparents were raising me, I \nlearned that if you work hard and play by the rules, you should be able \nto get ahead. As I traveled throughout the State of Wisconsin meeting \nwith Wisconsinites I know that my fellow Wisconsinites learned that \nvery same thing when they were growing up. Today people are working as \nhard as ever, and they deserve to get ahead, but many are working full \ntime and even two jobs to make ends meet. Yet far too many are just \nbarely getting by or living in poverty.\n  As I have traveled my State, Wisconsinites have told me that the \npowerful and the well-connected seem to get to write all of their own \nrules, while the concerns and struggles of the working poor and middle-\nclass families go unnoticed here in Washington. They feel like our \neconomic system is tilted towards those at the very top and that our \npolitical system exists to protect those unfair advantages. The House \nbudget introduced by Congressman Paul Ryan--from my own home State--is \na perfect example of that. Instead, we should make sure that everybody \ngets a fair shot.\n  I am really proud to join my colleagues this afternoon to deliver our \nown call for action. It is simple. The time is now to give hard-working \nAmericans a raise. We can do that if both parties work together to \nreward hard work so an honest day's work pays more. We can do that by \nraising the minimum wage.\n  I believe we need to build a fairer economy and grow the middle \nclass. I believe our economy is strongest when we expand opportunity \nfor everyone, and that is why I am an original cosponsor of the Minimum \nWage Fairness Act. Raising the minimum wage would improve the economic \nsecurity of families across the country and strengthen the overall \neconomy. It would give 28 million American workers a raise--including \nover 595,000 Wisconsinites--and will benefit more than a quarter \nmillion Wisconsin children who would have at least one parent getting \nthat raise.\n  It would mean workers in Wisconsin would have $816 million more to \nspend\n\n[[Page S2147]]\n\nin local businesses, which according to the Economic Policy Institute \nwould boost Wisconsin's GDP by $516.6 million and generate 1,800 new \njobs after only 3 years.\n  Because women are disproportionately low-wage workers--making up two-\nthirds of low-wage workers in the country--raising the minimum wage \nwould also directly impact millions of women across America.\n  Nadine, from Appleton, WI, would directly benefit from a raise. \nNadine is a 20-year-old woman who makes the tipped minimum wage. She \nworks as a server in a family restaurant. I probably need to remind \nsome people that the tipped minimum wage is only $2.13 an hour. Nadine \ngot her first job at age 14 so she could start saving for college. She \nstarted college but had stopped attending because she simply could not \nafford it. She even moved from her small hometown to a larger city in \nsearch of a better job so she would be able to return to school.\n  In telling her story, Nadine writes:\n\n       Raising the minimum wage is not an abstract notion in my \n     life. It is a real factor that affects me in several \n     important ways. First, and most importantly, it is important \n     to me because I am a young woman and I am working to support \n     myself. I had to put going to college on hold because I \n     couldn't afford it. Without a higher income, I worry I won't \n     ever be able to transition from dead-end jobs into a long-\n     term career.\n\n  Nadine currently averages $200 to $300 per week. She spends $50 on \ngas every week because she can't afford a more fuel-efficient car. She \neats simply in order to budget $30 each week for food. The rest of her \nincome goes to rent and other bills. Needless to say, it doesn't go \nfar.\n  Nadine picks up every shift available to her and doesn't rely on \ngovernment assistance of any kind. She worries she will never be able \nto experience having a family and finishing college, traveling, and \njust having a fair shot at building a stronger future for herself.\n  Women such as Nadine make up 72 percent of workers in predominately \ntipped occupations. Workers in tipped occupations are twice as likely \nas other workers to experience poverty, and servers are almost three \ntimes as likely to be in poverty.\n  If for no other reason, we need to raise the minimum wage because in \nAmerica no one who works full time should have to live or raise a \nfamily in poverty. Raising the full minimum wage and the tipped wage \nwill give 15 million women a raise--including 330,000 in my State of \nWisconsin. Women who make up 80 percent of America's 2.8 million \nworking single parents would benefit from an increase in the minimum \nwage, thereby reducing child poverty among female-headed households.\n  According to the Center for American Progress, raising the minimum \nwage to $10.10 an hour would reduce dependence on government programs, \nincluding the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which we \ncommonly call SNAP, which would see nearly 3.5 million fewer \nenrollments and save $46 billion over the decade. Raising the minimum \nwage will help make progress towards closing the gender pay gap.\n  I look forward to getting the job done and reward the hard work of \nwomen across our great country.\n  I look forward to getting the job done and passing the Minimum Wage \nFairness Act so American women will get the raise they deserve.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am so proud to join Senator Murray, who \norganized several of the women here, to speak out in favor of the \nminimum wage increase for the workers of America.\n  My colleagues have said it well, but it bears repeating: No one in \nAmerica--male or female--should have to live in poverty after putting \nin a full day's work. Yet that is the case today.\n  We should give hard-working Americans a fair shot to get ahead so \nthey can raise their families. Everyone deserves that fair shot, and \nthat is why Democrats have a fair-shot agenda. Right now we don't seem \nto have many Republicans joining us in our desire to raise the minimum \nwage so that it gets people above the poverty line when they work full \ntime.\n  I would argue that anyone who votes against that level of pay--which \nis about $10.10 an hour to get a worker right above poverty--simply \nwants to keep people in poverty, and that is not the American way. \nRight now a mom who is working full time and makes minimum wage earns \njust $290 a week. That is just $15,000 a year, which is below the \npoverty rate for a single mom.\n  No mom or dad should come home from a full day's work and have to \nworry about whether they can feed their children or whether they can \nafford a roof over the heads of their kids.\n  I see Senator Warren is here, and she has brought such attention and \nfocus to the unfairness in the number I am about to say. There are 400 \nfamilies in America that control as much wealth as 150 million \nAmericans. To hear people in this Chamber--who do just fine supporting \ntheir families--oppose the minimum wage is absolutely, in my view, a \nmorally wrong position. They have their right to it, but I think it is \nmorally wrong.\n  The minimum wage is a two-thirds problem for women. Let's be clear. \nAlmost two-thirds of workers earning minimum wage or less are women, \ntwo-thirds of tipped minimum wage workers are women, and in two-thirds \nof American families, women are the breadwinners or co-breadwinners. We \nhave a two-thirds problem. Women are overrepresented in low-wage jobs, \nand that is why I am so proud that next week Senator Mikulski is going \nto lead us toward equal pay for equal work. It is a wonderful bill. I \nthink it is called the Paycheck Fairness Act.\n  When we lift the salaries of these workers, it helps entire families. \nSenator Harkin's bill, which we are all supporting, will benefit 14 \nmillion children. We have to do it for workers like Wendy Arellano, who \nworks directing vehicles at an airport and has two other jobs, but she \nstill doesn't make enough to support her two daughters.\n  We should do it for women like Shareeka Elliot, who works all night \nas a janitor scrubbing the floors and cleaning the toilets but still \ndoesn't make enough to get her kids above the poverty line.\n  We should do it for women like Nyah Potts, who is working so hard to \nfinish her college degree, but she is struggling to make enough to \nsupport herself and her son. I joined Nyah at a press conference last \nweek.\n  In closing, I want to talk for a minute about the tipped minimum \nwage. This is a disgrace because the tipped minimum wage at the Federal \nGovernment is $2.13 an hour. We all know--because it has been studied--\nthat there are waitresses and there are waiters, and most of the less-\nexpensive restaurants hire women, and they don't get big tips. If there \nis a storm, and suppose nobody comes into the restaurant that day, they \nget paid $2.13 an hour. This bill does move us up to 70 percent of \nminimum wage for tipped workers. Personally, I think there ought to be \nno difference. In California, we pay our workers--all of them, tipped \nor not--the full minimum wage. And no one can tell me that California's \nrestaurants are suffering. They are some of the most successful in the \ncountry and in the world.\n\n  So let's be clear. History shows raising the minimum wage doesn't \nhurt the economy.\n  Now we will hear our colleagues on the Republican side cite the CBO \nstudy that said we could lose hundreds of thousands of jobs. That study \nis an outlier.\n  In 1956, the minimum wage was a buck. I hate to say it, but I \nremember those days. It was a dollar. And I remember, I worked my first \njob as a telephone operator for Hilton Hotels, and I earned the minimum \nwage. Actually, then, because I was a teenager, it was half the minimum \nwage, so I worked for 50 cents an hour. I was not very good at that \njob, but I tried hard. But let's say Congress had that attitude then: \nWe are not going to raise the minimum wage because we will lose jobs. \nThe minimum wage would still be a dollar an hour. How ludicrous.\n  Since then--since 1956--we have raised the minimum wage 18 times. \nGuess what. Did we lose jobs? No. The economy grew by more than 80 \nmillion jobs.\n  I know others are waiting to speak. I am so excited to finally get to \nvote on paycheck fairness and on minimum wage. All we Democrats are \nsaying is, let's give Americans a fair shot.\n\n[[Page S2148]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I will be making a point of order in a \nmoment against the bill before us because it violates the budget we \nagreed to. I will share briefly for a few moments--the order is that we \nare to commence voting at 2:30. I believe that is correct. I think I \nwas approved for 5 minutes. If the Chair would notify me when my time \nis up, because others I see here might want to speak.\n  In August of 2001, this Congress--House and Senate, Republicans and \nDemocrats--along with the President of the United States, agreed on the \nBudget Control Act. It limited spending--the growth of spending only. \nHow much did it limit the growth? Well, at that time we were projected \nto spend $10 trillion more over the next 10 years than we were \ncurrently spending. So the Budget Control Act didn't cut the budget, \nreally, although a few agencies in the short term have had reductions, \nDefense being the primary one. But over the 10 years, under the Budget \nControl Act we would grow spending $8 trillion instead of $10 \ntrillion--not enough of a reduction in spending, I say to my \ncolleagues, to cause this country to sink into the ocean; that is for \nsure. Really, not enough, because our deficits are so high.\n  In December of last year, this Congress passed the Ryan-Murray Budget \nAct which amended the spending agreement we struck in the Budget \nControl Act. The Ryan-Murray bill broke the budget agreement and \nallowed more money to be spent than we had agreed to in the BCA, but it \ncapped overall spending for the next 8 years. So that was the \nagreement. It passed, and the President signed it 3 months ago. It is \nnow the law of the land.\n  What I would say to my colleagues is this--today is the third or \nfourth time we will vote on legislation, since the Ryan-Murray spending \nagreement passed, that busts the budget--that busts the spending limits \nwe agreed to.\n  There are multiple budget violations against this bill. Two of them \nare voided by loophole language in the Ryan-Murray legislation that \npeople didn't fully understand at that time. That loophole language \nallows the use of a deficit-neutral reserve fund to, in effect, erase \nbudget points of order. So two of the budget points of order that lie \nagainst this bill cannot be raised because a deficit-neutral reserve \nfund--which I think is a gimmick--essentially erases them. But one of \nthe violations still remains, because this bill will add to the debt \noutside the 10-year window.\n  One of the things we have learned is that when we pass laws today \nthat sound good--and sometimes those laws, even if they are within the \nbudget window, they may, indeed, in the out years add to the debt of \nthe United States. Kent Conrad, a Democrat and former chairman of the \nBudget Committee--it was his language that created this long term point \nof order, because he was concerned we were passing things that might be \nOK within the budget window but were adding to the debt in the long \nterm. So that is why we have this point of order.\n  The cost estimate from the Congressional Budget Office clearly shows \nthat this UI bill violates that principle of the budget, and lays out \nthe numbers that so say. Our chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator \nMurray, has acknowledged that this bill does, in fact, violate the \nbudget.\n  But we need to stay within our budget. Violating the budget agreement \nis simply a refusal to make tough choices. We spend $3,700 billion a \nyear, and we can't find $8 billion or $9 billion in savings to fund a \nprogram that we think needs to be funded today like unemployment \ninsurance? People want to deal with that and help people who are \nunemployed, and I understand that desire. But if we do so, we should do \nit by finding offsets, not spending more than we agreed.\n  People say we can raise taxes to pay for the new spending. Well, that \nviolates the budget too, because our agreement says we can spend only \nso much. And if my colleagues want to raise taxes, I believe we ought \nto use that money to pay down the deficit, not grow the government.\n  This past year, we spent $233 billion on interest on the debt, an \namount that is virtually half the Defense budget. The highway bill is \n$40 billion. In 10 years, the Congressional Budget Office--Dr. \nElmendorf testified before the Budget Committee a few weeks ago--says \nthat in 10 years, 1 year's interest payment on the debt of the United \nStates of America would be $880 billion. That is over $650 billion more \nin 1 year on interest than we are paying today.\n  So you can see why we have to adhere to our promises to contain \nspending. We cannot continue to vote time and time again to violate the \nspending limits we agreed to. It just adds to the debt and to our \ninterest payments on the debt. No wonder the American people are \nunhappy with us. This is irresponsible. I am confident we can find the \n$9 billion or whatever we need to fund any program in this bloated \ngovernment of ours. But, no, it won't even be discussed. There is no \ndiscussion about finding honest reductions in spending from places \nwhere money is wasted. Instead, we just come up with a plan that \ngimmicks the spending and adds to the long-term debt of the United \nStates.\n  In conclusion, I would say it is quite clear that this legislation--\nthe unemployment extension--will add to the long-term debt of the \nUnited States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has spoken for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the pending measure, amendment No. 2874 \nto H.R. 3979, the vehicle for the unemployment insurance extension, \nviolates section 311(b) of the fiscal year 2009 budget resolution by \ncausing a net increase in the deficit over $5 billion in the 10-year \nperiod from 2024 to 2033.\n  Therefore, I raise a point of order against this measure pursuant to \nsection 311(b) of S. Con. Res. 70, the Concurrent Resolution on the \nBudget for fiscal year 2009.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974 and the waiver provisions of \napplicable budget resolutions, I move to waive all applicable sections \nof that act and applicable budget resolutions for purposes of the \npending amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote \noccur at the time set under the previous order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an extension \nof time for 6 minutes to be divided equally between myself and Senator \nStabenow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I will keep my remarks short because I \nknow there are others who want to speak on why we need to raise the \nminimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10. I will focus on Hawaii.\n  In Hawaii, nearly 100,000 women would get a raise if we were to do \nthis. That is one out of five women workers in Hawaii. The Presiding \nOfficer and I are both from Hawaii. We know the high cost of living in \nHawaii. Minimum wage amounts to about $14,500 a year. The average rent \nfor a one-bedroom residence in Hawaii is almost $1,300 a month. That is \nmore than $15,000 a year. It is no wonder people in Hawaii have to work \nmore than one job.\n  In Hawaii, tourism is our No. 1 industry. We have a lot of tipped \nworkers. They work in our restaurants. Do my colleagues know there are \nmany people who work in our restaurants who can't even afford to eat in \nthe restaurant in which they work?\n  When we raise the minimum wage, we are going to enable a lot of \nfamilies to not have to rely on various programs such as SNAP. In \nHawaii, over 15,000 workers would no longer need these kinds of \nbenefits.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hirono). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, first let me say that we should be \ncongratulating everyone who has gotten us to a point where we are going \nto be able to help people who have been\n\n[[Page S2149]]\n\nworking hard to find a job and still have not found a job to put food \non the table for their families and pay their rent. To be able to allow \nthem to receive emergency unemployment assistance is incredibly \nimportant. The votes we are doing here are very important to give \npeople who want a job and need a job a fair shot to be able to survive \nuntil they can get a job.\n\n\n                            The Minimum Wage\n\n  I also want to speak for just a moment, as so many of my colleagues \nhave today, about what it means for women to have a pay raise through \nthe minimum wage because the minimum wage is very much a women's issue, \nas you have heard, because a disproportionate number of folks who are \nearning the minimum wage are, in fact, women. And it is not college \nstudents; the average age is about 30, 35 years old.\n  This is a critical issue for Michigan families, including 416,000 \nwomen in Michigan who would directly benefit from raising the minimum \nwage to $10.10 an hour and another 141,000 whose wages would also \nincrease. This is not just about people earning the minimum wage; it is \nabout lifting up wages, increasing purchasing power, and helping \nbusinesses large and small be able to get more customers because people \ncan buy things because they have money in their pockets.\n  Let me repeat, in terms of the numbers for Michigan, 557,000 women in \nMichigan who are working hard and just want a fair shot--just a fair \nshot--to get ahead would benefit from the legislation the Senate will \nsoon be voting on called the Minimum Wage Fairness Act.\n  Too many people, including far too many women, are simply trying to \nstay afloat, let alone get ahead. The minimum wage used to be worth \nmore. Its value has eroded since it peaked back in 1968, and it is \nharder and harder for people to put food on the table and a roof over \ntheir family's heads.\n  Today, a single mom can clean houses and scrub floors for 40 hours a \nweek--working hard--and still find that she earns less than the poverty \nlevel. There is something wrong with that. If you are going to work \nhard 40 hours a week, you ought to be able to lift your family out of \npoverty.\n  Work ought to be valued in this country. In fact, for a family of \nthree, you are $4,000 below the poverty line if you are working for the \nminimum wage. It is just not right.\n  To add insult to injury, if you compare that to the average CEO's \nsalary today, you could put 933 minimum-wage workers, 933 women working \nhard--and I would daresay maybe harder than the folks who are at the \ntop as CEOs--trying to put food on the table for their kids, buy them \ncloths, make sure they can care for them, 933 minimum-wage workers \ncombined equals the salary of the average CEO.\n  So I would urge that we come together and look at this as Henry Ford \ndid 100 years ago in 1914 when he doubled the salary of his workers to \n$5 a day. He lifted them up. The small businesses around his plant saw \nincreases in their business and hired more people because more people \nhad money in their pockets. They could come in and buy the food and \ngoods.\n  We are talking about people working hard, again, every single day--\nmoms who are cleaning hotel rooms and are on their feet all day; they \nare mopping floors, preparing food; they go home; they take care of \ntheir families. All they want is a fair shot to succeed and be able to \nmake their lives and their children's lives better.\n  Let's have a strong, bipartisan vote on raising the minimum wage.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of increasing the \nminimum wage. Congress needs to do away with wages that don't reward \nhard work and workplace policies that belong in an episode of ``Mad \nMen.'' This Congress needs to do two things to make sure we give a fair \nshot to everyone and build a stronger middle class: raise the minimum \nwage and pass the Paycheck Fairness Act.\n  The minimum wage is at an historic all-time low. It has lost 30 \npercent of its buying power compared to its peak buying power in 1968. \nThe minimum wage only pays $15,000 a year. That is $4,000 below the \npoverty line for a family of three. Increasing the minimum wage to \n$10.10 per hour would pay $20,200 a year--lifting that family of three \nout of poverty.\n  What does increasing the minimum wage mean for Maryland? Increasing \nthe minimum wage will give 450,000 workers in Maryland a raise. \nIncreasing the minimum wage will improve the lives of 210,000 Maryland \nchildren because their parent just got a raise. When we raise the \nminimum wage, we all move a rung up on the opportunity ladder.\n  I am on the side of economic fairness and building a stronger middle \nclass to bring opportunities to families across the Nation. That is why \nI am an enthusiastic cosponsor of the Fair Minimum Wage Act. This bill \nraises the minimum wage from $7.25 per hour to $10.10 an hour over 3 \nyears and indexes the minimum wage to inflation in the future.\n  Everyone who works hard and plays by the rules deserves a fair shot \nat the American dream. That means raising the minimum wage so that hard \nwork is worth it--because a full-time job shouldn't mean full time \npoverty.\n  The minimum wage for employees who earn tips is barely over $2 per \nhour. The Fair Minimum Wage Act will slowly increase that base wage by \nless than $1 a year until it reaches 70 percent of the regular minimum \nwage. Women are nearly three-quarters of workers earning tips at their \njobs. For a hotel housekeeper in the western Maryland mountains, a \nhairdresser on the Eastern Shore, or a restaurant server in Baltimore \nor Bethesda, this raise is economic security so that a slow week in an \noff-peak season doesn't mean below-poverty wages.\n  The minimum wage is a women's issue. Women make up two-thirds of \nminimum-wage workers nationwide. Congress needs to raise their wages \nand make sure they are not being redlined or sidelined by outdated \npolicies or harassed and intimidated when seeking justice for pay \ndiscrimination.\n  Being a woman costs more, and women pay more for everything. Women \npay more in medical costs than men--an estimated $10,000 over a \nlifetime. Women are often responsible for child care. Women even get \ncharged more for dry cleaning. We are charged more for our blouses than \nmen's shirts, and we are tired of being taken to the cleaners. When we \nearn less, we are asked to pay more.\n  Women are almost half of the workforce and 40 percent of them are the \nsole breadwinners in their families. They are tired of being paid \ncrumbs.\n  Women continue to make less. Women are still making only 77 cents for \nevery $1 a man makes. Women of color suffer even greater injustice. If \nyou are African American, you earn 62 cents for every $1 a man makes. \nIf you are Hispanic, you earn 54 cents for every $1 a man makes.\n  Everybody likes to say to us: Oh, you have come a long way. But I \ndon't think we have come a long way. We have only gained 18 cents in 50 \nyears.\n  By the time she retires, the average woman will lose more than \n$431,000 over her lifetime because of the wage gap. That affects your \nSocial Security and pension. It weakens your retirement security.\n  This is not about men versus women. It is about building a middle \nclass. Wages have been flat for everyone. Men need a pay raise too. \nWhen they get it, we will stand shoulder to shoulder with them--because \nwe all need a raise to raise our families.\n  The Fair Minimum Wage Act is about putting change in the lawbooks and \nchange in family checkbooks. Women of America, it is time to suit up, \nsquare our shoulders, put on our lipstick, increase the minimum wage \nfor everyone, and fight the fair pay revolution.\n\n\n             Amendments Nos. 2878, 2877, and 2875 Withdrawn\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

For the knowledge of all Members, we are going to have one \nmore vote today and the next vote will be Monday at 5:30 p.m.\n  I just want to tell everyone, sometimes people get upset at Senator \nMcConnell and me because we don't know what is going on. Well, I hate \nto admit this, but sometimes he and I don't know what is going on. It \nis hard to get, sometimes, where we are. So I appreciate that even \nthough Senator McConnell and I have a few little dustups on the floor \nin front of everybody, whenever we are in private we work well together \nto try to do the best things for this body.\n  To get to where we are today wasn't easy, and we should have a good \nweek next week.

Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, this is the same legislation, and so for \nthe same reason, on behalf of Senators Coburn and Cruz, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. WALSH. Madam President, in the far northwestern corner of Montana \nis one of the most special places on Earth--the North Fork of the \nFlathead River. The North Fork is a spectacular gravel-bed river that \nstarts in British Columbia and runs along the western half of Glacier \nNational Park before arriving in Flathead Lake.\n  The North Fork is a world-class trout fishery, with bulltrout and \ncutthroat trout sharing the same winding waters that grizzly bears rely \non for huckleberries. It is the most important wildlife corridor \nbetween the Great Plains and the Cascades, and Montanans have always \nenjoyed rafting, hiking, fishing, and hunting in it.\n  Today, about 2 million people visit Glacier National Park each year, \nbringing $170 million into the local economy and supporting 2,750 jobs.\n  For 40 years, Montanans have fought to keep the North Fork pristine. \nMy colleague Senator Jon Tester and I are committed to taking this \nacross the finish line.\n\n[[Page S2151]]\n\n  Four years ago, Montana and British Columbia reached a historic \nagreement to protect the river on both sides of the border. Two years \nago Canada upheld its end of the bargain. Today, the U.S. Congress has \nthe opportunity to do the same. The entire Montana congressional \ndelegation is in bipartisan agreement that the North Fork deserves to \nbe withdrawn permanently from future mineral development. Montanans of \nall stripes have endorsed this action, including the local chambers of \ncommerce and energy companies such as ConocoPhillips.\n  In fact, the primary interest in more than 80 percent of existing \nFederal leases in the watershed have voluntarily been relinquished. \nEveryone recognizes how important it is to keep the North Fork \npristine. It is just the right thing to do.\n  The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee passed the North \nFork Watershed Protection Act with no opposition last June. The House \npassed the North Fork Watershed Protection Act by voice vote last \nmonth. This bill is our chance to leave a jewel in the crown of the \ncontinent in better shape than we found it.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me and all Montanans in that effort. We \ncan send this bill to the President to sign today.\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, will the junior Senator from Montana \nyield for a question?\n  Mr. WALSH. I will.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, when my colleague's motion was objected \nto, the good Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator Toomey, said he \nunderstood Senators Coburn and Cruz wished to have further \nconversation. Has my colleague had a chance to visit with Senators \nCoburn and Cruz already about this bill?\n  Mr. WALSH. Yes, I have.\n  Mr. TESTER. So that has already been done.\n  I want to thank my colleague Senator Walsh for attempting to bring up \nthe North Fork Watershed Protection Act for a vote. I also want to echo \nhis frustration that once again politics is trumping good policy.\n  The North Fork bill is a Montana-made bill. Folks back home who \nsupport this bill are from all political sides of the spectrum. It has \nwide bipartisan support. Members of both parties, as Senator Walsh \npointed out, voted it out of the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee. Yet today two Senators--whom I would challenge to find the \nNorth Fork on a map--have decided to hold this bill up.\n  Let me remind them what this bill does. It ensures access along the \nNorth Fork for hunters and anglers who contribute to Montana's $6 \nbillion outdoor economy. If you want to talk about economic \ndevelopment, this is an incredible driver.\n  The bill also honors a commitment to our neighbor to the north, \nCanada. Three years ago British Columbia signed an agreement to retire \noil and gas leases on their side of the border, expecting us to protect \nthe region as well. This bill guarantees we hold up our end of the \nbargain, and it ensures we pass along our outdoor way of life.\n  I should also point out that Exxon and Conoco both have also given up \ntheir leases in this region. Why? Because this drainage feeds Flathead \nLake, which is the largest freshwater body of water west of the \nMississippi. It is an incredible ecosystem.\n  I think what has happened today is a loss not only for Montana, not \nonly for America's great outdoors, but for this entire country.\n  This fight is not over. For far too long in this body we have had \npeople who obstruct just because they can. It is time to start working \ntogether and doing what is right, whether we are talking about \nconservation issues, tax issues, unemployment issues, or whatever it \nmight be. It is time to start moving the country forward because people \nare suffering out there.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. WALSH. Madam President, I am so disappointed my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle are blocking the desire of Montanans to protect \nthe North Fork. This bill is a no-brainer. I invite my colleagues to \nvisit Montana and see the North Fork for themselves. Their actions \ntoday show why Washington is broken. Despite years of bipartisan hard \nwork, narrow interests can trump responsible leadership.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/03/senate-section/article/S2151-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2151-S2152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             GREEN MOUNTAIN LOOKOUT HERITAGE PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I come to the floor this afternoon to \nrequest unanimous consent to pass a bill that is a very small step in \nwhat will be a very long recovery process for a community in my home \nState of Washington that was devastated by a landslide less than two \nweeks ago.\n  This is the Green Mountain Lookout bill, which will be passed \nshortly. It is not going to rebuild anybody's home--which needs to be \ndone--or provide desperately needed human aid that we are supporting \nthrough our recent Federal disaster designation. What this small, \nlittle bill does is provide a glimmer of hope for the long-term \nrecovery of this region, and in particularly of the community of \nDarrington.\n  For years now, along with Senator Cantwell, I have fought to pass \nthis bill through procedural and political hurdles because I know what \nit means to Snohomish County and that region of my State. The Green \nMountain Lookout is more than a hiking destination. It is part of the \nPacific Northwest heritage. It is a cherished historical landmark. It \nis a place where parents have brought their kids for generations to \nappreciate the splendor of the great outdoors in the Northwest, and it \nis a place that has been a vital source of tourism-related income for \nthe people who have been impacted by this deadly landslide that struck \nthis region.\n  I was in Darrington this weekend and had an opportunity to sit down \nwith the mayor and many of the town officials--a town of about 1200 \npeople--and they told me tremendous stories about the families that \nhave been lost, about people who had driven to the store on that \nSaturday morning and now only had what they wore when they left their \nhomes a few hours earlier. I heard about the needs this community is \ngoing to have for a long time and the emotional impact.\n  After finishing our official meetings, the mayor took us aside and \ntold me, Senator Cantwell, and Congresswoman DelBene that the one \nglimmer of hope he thought he could provide for this community was \npassage of this Green Mountain Lookout bill that we are going to pass \nin just a few moments.\n  So I want to extend truly heartfelt thanks to both Senator Landrieu \nand Senator Murkowski, who have been incredibly understanding, and to \nall the Members of the Senate who have been helpful in going through \nthe process of getting the bill to the floor today. They know what it \nmeans when communities large or small are impacted by a disaster of \nthis size, and both of them know that the Federal Government needs to \nbe there quickly to provide support.\n  Madam President, the people of Oso, Arlington, and Darrington have a \nvery long road to recovery ahead, so I was very pleased when the \nPresident granted a major disaster declaration just last night which \nwill be vital to meeting many of the immediate human needs that we are \ngoing to be facing.\n  It is important that these communities know we are in it for the long \nterm as well. Even a small step like this one that supports the \nregion's tourist economy and brings that little bit of hope is critical \nto showing them that all of us and the Federal Government will be there \nfor them. So as they mourn their loved ones and work hard to recover \nand ultimately rebuild, I am proud that we will not forget them.\n  With that, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 338, S. 404.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 404) to preserve the Green Mountain Lookout in \n     the Glacier Peak Wilderness\n\n[[Page S2152]]\n\n     of the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill, \nwhich had been reported from the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources, with an amendment.\n  (Insert the part printed in italic.)\n\n                                 S. 404\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

If the Secretary makes such a \n     determination, the Secretary shall move the Green Mountain \n     Lookout to a location outside of the lands described in \n     section 3(5) of the Washington State Wilderness Act of 1984 \n     and designated as a wilderness area in section 4(b) of such \n     Act.\n\n     SEC. 4.

I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                          Rodriguez Nomination\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the Judiciary Committee, of which I am a \nmember, voted out the nomination of Leon Rodriguez to be Director of \nthe U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, also known as USCIS. \nThis agency has been at the center of the collapse of immigration \nenforcement in America, and Mr. Rodriguez, if confirmed, will--it seems \ncertain--continue to accelerate that collapse. I think it is an \nimportant issue for all of us to talk about. It is not so much about \nhim personally, but it is what he is going to be asked to do.\n  This is about what has been happening at Homeland Security--and USCIS \nis an important part of that--and how it is impacting the rule of law \nin America and immigration enforcement in America--or nonenforcement. \nIt is a very serious matter. What I am going to say today is based on \nmy best judgment of how and why it is happening and why this Congress \nneeds to speak up about it.\n  I have an article from the Washington Post, which is dated December \n18, a few months ago. The article in the Washington Post is headlined \n``Federal Workers' Job Satisfaction Falls, with Homeland Security \nDepart. Ranking Lowest Again.''\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       Federal employees who deal with homeland security matters \n     remain some of the government's least-satisfied, as overall \n     workforce morale hit its lowest point in a decade, according \n     to a report that began ranking agencies on such issues in \n     2003.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       The Department of Homeland Security, a perennial bottom-\n     dweller in the ``Best Places to Work in the Federal \n     Government'' rankings, marked its third consecutive year of \n     decline and its second straight year of being last among the \n     19 largest agencies. This is not acceptable, and I raised \n     that issue with Secretary Napolitano repeatedly at the \n     hearings.\n\n  I will remind my colleagues that the officers association of another \none of the three core immigration agencies--the Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement Service--unanimously voted no confidence in their then-\nDirector John Norton mainly because he refused to allow them to comply \nwith their duty under the law to enforce immigration laws in America. \nWe had the Director of ICE and--you will learn--the Director of USCIS, \nand I suggest the Homeland Security Director, investing their time and \neffort in seeing that the laws of the United States were not enforced \nrather than being enforced.\n  This gentleman is not prepared to lead this job if he were to be \nsupported in his activity, but, in fact, he was sent here because he \nwill not rock the boat. He will be given this position to continue this \npolicy of nonenforcement, even against the will of the officers who \nserve under him.\n  The last thing we should do is put someone in a critical law \nenforcement position, as these are, who doesn't know anything about it, \nNo. 1, and who is going to carry out President Obama's policies, which \nis fundamentally not to enforce the law. I know there are people who \nthink that is an exaggeration, but I am going to talk about it, and we \nare going to keep talking about it, and we are going to show what the \nfacts are. This is a serious matter.\n  Mr. Rodriguez is not a trained administrator. He has never led a \npolice department. He has never led and managed a real law enforcement \nagency. He has been a prosecutor of white-collar crime cases. He served \nfor several years in the civil rights part of Homeland Security, but he \nhas not managed the officers out there on the ground who are trying to \ndeal with violent criminal aliens and get them deported and all the \ngimmicks that they use to get around that. He was a chief of staff to \nMr. Perez, the head of the civil rights division in the Department of \nJustice. Mr. Perez is nearly a radical pro-amnesty nonenforcement \nleader himself. They were both members of CASA de Maryland, which is \nvery much a pro-amnesty activist group that proposes ideas that are \noutside the mainstream.\n  I assume Majority Leader Reid will bring this nomination up for a \nvote in\n\n[[Page S2153]]\n\nthe Senate, and it will be an important moment. Will the Senators vote \nto defend the integrity of the immigration laws we passed or will they \nhelp install someone to one of the most important positions in \ngovernment who will further erode and undermine those laws? This is the \nquestion we are dealing with. We need to be honest about it. I don't \nthink there is any mystery here.\n  First, Mr. Rodriguez lacks the normal background and experience for a \nposition such as this. He doesn't have it. I am not saying he is not a \ngood civil rights lawyer or white-collar crime lawyer, but he doesn't \nhave the leadership experience to lead an agency such as this. His only \napparent encounter with immigration was his service on the board of \nCASA de Maryland, which encourages illegal immigrants to defy law \nenforcement. It has been a very active group.\n  Tellingly, Mr. Rodriguez refused to answer questions regarding \nwhether he believes an illegal immigrant who is ordered deported or \nconvicted of a felony criminal offense or convicted of multiple \nmisdemeanors or convicted of a single sex-related offense or convicted \nof a single drunk driving offense or known to be a gang member should \nbe eligible for legal status in America. That is a pretty fair question \nto ask a nominee to this important position because USCIS evaluates \npeople as to whether they have the requisites to be given legal status \nand a pathway to citizenship in America.\n  Mr. Rodriguez would not even say whether someone who has been denied \nlegal status should be deported. So they come in and ask for legal \nstatus, and it is turned down, and he was asked: Should that person get \nto stay in the country or should that person be deported? There is only \none answer to that question. If you are not eligible to be in the \ncountry and you had your hearing and you have been denied legal status, \nthere is only one answer, and that is you should be deported. These \nshould not be difficult questions for someone who wants to head an \nagency that is charged with ensuring the integrity of our system.\n  The President has summarily suspended entire portions of immigration \nlaw, granting unilateral reprieve to people based on everything from \nfamily connection to age of illegal entry, and criminal record. He just \nissues an order.\n  The Los Angeles Times reported earlier this week on the collapse of \ninterior enforcement. They reported that ``immigrants living illegally \nin most of the continental U.S. are less likely to be deported today \nthan before Obama came into office.'' Boy, that is an understatement. \nThat is an absolute fact. It went on to state:\n\n       Expulsions of people who are settled and working in the \n     United States have fallen steadily since his first year in \n     office, and are down more than 40% since 2009.\n\n  It is really a lot more than 40 percent. They went on to quote the \nformer Acting Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, \nJohn Sandweg, who left a little over a month ago. He was a top official \nin the Obama administration. He said: ``If you are a run-of-the-mill \nimmigrant here illegally, your odds of getting deported are close to \nzero.'' This is a guy who held an important position in the Department \nof Homeland Security. His duty was to identify people who are here \nillegally.\n  In effect, the administration's policy is that unless you commit a \nfelony or other serious crime, you are free to illegally work here, \nclaim certain tax benefits, and obtain fraudulent documents so you can \nget a job. Apparently having a fraudulent document to get a job you are \nnot lawfully entitled to get is not something that gets you deported in \nthis administration. Not apparently, that is the policy if truth be \nknown.\n  It is an open invitation to every would-be illegal immigrant to come \nto the United States unlawfully and to every visa holder who is here \nlawfully on a visa for a limited time to ignore the expiration date of \ntheir visa and remain unlawfully in the country. That is the law the \nPresident has set.\n  If the immigration laws are not enforceable by virtue of the plain \nfact that they are duly passed laws by the Congress of the United \nStates, then there is no real immigration law. Anyone who wishes is \nfree to come on visa, let the visa expire and never leave. If you can \nget past the border in some fashion unlawfully, they can stay and \nnobody is going to impact you.\n  Yet, on March 13, after meeting with representatives of various \namnesty groups, the Homeland Security Secretary--the top man, Mr. \nJohnson--reaffirmed that he is working to fulfill the President's \nrequest to reduce enforcement even further. It is astonishing that the \nPresident would order a review of enforcement policies, not for the \npurpose of repairing enforcement flaws but to weaken it even more.\n  According to a March 14, 2014, Los Angeles Times article quoting \nadministrative officials:\n\n       The changes under review would effectively stop most \n     deportations of [illegal immigrants] with no criminal \n     convictions other than violations.\n\n  So any fraudulent documents that are used to come here and violate \nimmigration laws or get a job or get into the country unlawfully don't \ncount. You can do this all day. Come on down. This means that even \nfugitive aliens, and those who have committed immigration felonies \nwould now be exempt from enforcement. It would represent a total \nevisceration of immigration law, including those laws designed to \nprotect the wages and jobs of working Americans.\n  I will say parenthetically--we just had a vote on unemployment \ninsurance because we continue to have a very high unemployment rate. We \nextended the normal limit on unemployment benefits to people who don't \nhave a job, and now we are doing nothing to protect American workers \nfrom people who are illegally here and taking jobs they need for their \nfamilies.\n  In addition to that, the Senate passed a comprehensive immigration \nbill that would double the number of guest workers--the people who come \nhere just to work--at a time of high unemployment.\n  We have a bill that will be coming up soon, I suppose, to raise the \nminimum wage. Why? Because wages have not risen sufficiently. We are \nnot happy about that. In fact, wages have been declining for over a \ndecade. This is a serious trend.\n  Dr. Borjas at Harvard attributes a good deal of that to the large \nflow of immigration, particularly in lower income Americans who are \nbeing hammered by this large flow of lower skilled foreign workers. It \nis supply and demand.\n  Why are wages not going up, colleagues? Do you believe in the free \nmarket? They are not going up because we have more workers than we have \njobs.\n  Mr. Sperling, the President's former top economic adviser, admitted a \nfew weeks ago that there are three applicants for every job in America. \nThe last thing we need to be doing is doubling the number of foreign \nworkers brought into the country and not enforcing the law with regard \nto people who have entered illegally, isn't that correct? I mean, can't \nwe agree on issues such as that?\n\n  In 2012--go back to this, the problems--and people need to know this. \nThe mainstream media does not want to talk about it. They don't tend to \nreport it, but it has been out there for months--years. It is the \nreality. This is what a 2012 inspector general report of the Department \nof Homeland Security--this is their own inspector general, who serves \nat the pleasure of the Homeland Security Secretary. They issued a \nreport which found that senior officials at USCIS--that is the \nCitizenship and Immigration Services, where this individual will be the \nhead--they found that senior officials at USCIS have been pressuring \nemployees to rubberstamp applications for immigration benefits despite \nobvious signs of fraud.\n  Kenneth Palinkas, president of the National Citizenship and \nImmigration Services Council--the union representing 12,000 \nadjudicators, officers, and staff--issued a statement in May of 2013 \nthat echoed the findings of the report. This is what Mr. Palinkas's \ngroup said:\n\n       USCIS adjudications officers are pressured to rubberstamp \n     applications instead of conducting diligent case review and \n     investigations. The culture at USCIS encourages all \n     applications to be approved, discouraging proper \n     investigation into red flags and discouraging denial of \n     applications. USCIS has been turned into an approval machine.\n\n  This is not acceptable. What are we paying 18,000 officers to do? \nDon't the\n\n[[Page S2154]]\n\nAmerican people expect that they are supposed to be reviewing \napplications, not rubberstamping them; identifying people who may be \nterrorists or criminals or have no likelihood of producing anything \nworthwhile in America, who are not going to be successful in America, \nand who may be otherwise unlawfully eligible to enter, while we turn \npeople down who have the lawful right to enter and put them on a \nbacklog? It doesn't make any sense.\n  According to Mr. Palinkas:\n\n       USCIS has created an almost insurmountable bureaucracy \n     which often prevents USCIS adjudications officers from \n     contacting and coordinating with ICE agents and officers in \n     cases that should have their involvement.\n\n  Look, the ICE officers are kind of like the criminal investigators. \nThey deal with people who are apprehended inside the country. They deal \nwith people who have been arrested or in jail on one cause or another--\nassaults, drugs, violence, criminality. So USCIS is evaluating \npaperwork to see if somebody is qualified, and they have some red flag, \nand they would like to call the ICE officers to see if this is the same \nguy who committed an assault or an armed robbery a few years ago, and \nthey are being discouraged from doing that. What is this? It is exactly \nthe opposite of what we are paying them to do.\n  Mr. Palinkas continues:\n\n       USCIS officers are pressured to approve visa applications \n     for individuals that ICE agents have determined should be \n     placed into deportation proceedings.\n\n  So they are pressuring them to approve these individuals who have not \nbeen approved.\n  I see Senator Warren is here, and I will wrap up. I didn't realize \nshe had been approved to speak at this time, and I will wrap up \nbriefly.\n  We need to put an end to this lawlessness, and the next Director of \nUSCIS must ensure the integrity of our immigration system--it is just \nthat simple--as his mission statement calls for him to do. They must be \nindependent and able to stand up for the rule of law under what \nundoubtedly will be tremendous political pressure from an \nadministration and pro-amnesty activist groups who seem to be \ndominating the agenda and who have little interest in seeing the great \nclassical American rule of law enforced.\n  Mr. Rodriguez, unfortunately, I am convinced is not that person. He \nwould not be the right person if he really had the support of his \nleadership. He just doesn't have the background. He has never managed a \nmajor agency with 18,000 employees or anything like it. He does not \nhave any experience on the frontlines of what they do every day and how \nthey do it. But it is even worse because--look, why didn't they choose \nsomebody who is experienced in DHS? Why didn't they choose a police \nchief or a military officer, someone who knows how to lead and manage a \nbig agency such as this one, somebody with independence and integrity? \nWhy? Because they don't want somebody with independence and integrity \ncommitted to the enforcement of law. They have already decided they are \nnot enforcing the law, and they want somebody such as this Casa de \nMaryland protege to go into that agency who is not going to enforce the \nlaw.\n  It is a serious statement I make, and I think it is fundamentally \naccurate. I am just buffaloed that this is the fact.\n  Mr. Jonathan Turley, a constitutional lawyer who has written about \ngovernment issues and constitutional issues for quite a number of \nyears--Professor Turley has written recently and participated in a \ndiscussion where he said that what the President is doing with regard \nto immigration is beyond any justifiable utilization of prosecutorial \ndiscretion, that it amounts to a nullification of law by the President, \nwho takes an oath and is constitutionally required to see that the laws \nof this country are faithfully carried out.\n  This is a very serious matter. We need to talk about it. This \nnomination sort of provides us an opportunity to recognize what is \nhappening, and the American people are going to need to speak up. We \nneed to be able to change what is happening to restore the great \nAmerican heritage of law.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                              Minimum Wage\n\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, it has taken us 4 months, but we are \nfinally on the verge of passing a long-overdue emergency extension of \nunemployment benefits. So I come to the floor this afternoon to urge my \ncolleagues to continue supporting America's working families by raising \nthe minimum wage.\n  Over the past 50 years the value of the minimum wage has sharply \ndeclined. In 1968 the minimum wage was high enough to keep a working \nparent with a family of three out of poverty. In 1980 the minimum wage \nwas at least high enough to keep a working parent with a family of two \nout of poverty. Today the minimum wage isn't even high enough to keep a \nfully employed mother and a baby out of poverty. This is fundamentally \nwrong. Anyone who works full time should not live in poverty.\n  For nearly half a century, as we came out of the Great Depression, we \nlived by the basic principle that we all do better when we work \ntogether and build opportunities for everyone. For nearly half a \ncentury, as our country got richer our workers got richer, and as our \nworkers got richer our country got richer. As the pie got bigger, we \nall got a little bit more. That is how it was, and that is how we built \nAmerica's great middle class.\n  But that is not how it works now for low-income workers. Dr. Arin \nDube of the University of Massachusetts has explained that if the \nminimum wage had kept up with increases in productivity, it would be \n$22 an hour today. But it didn't keep up. So today, while corporate \nprofits soar, millions of hard-working moms and dads are left behind, \nworking full time and still living in poverty.\n  Democrats aren't proposing to increase the minimum wage to $22 an \nhour. Our proposal is much more modest--a raise to $10.10 an hour. That \nis modest by comparison, but for at least 14 million children who \ndepend on a parent whose wages would go up as a result of this \nlegislation, this increase will make their lives a whole lot more \nsecure.\n  This bill is about the lives of minimum-wage workers, but it is also \nabout every taxpayer in America and about the corporate welfare \ntaxpayers are forced to dole out when these companies pay poverty-level \nwages.\n  More than half of low-wage working families participate in government \nassistance programs for food, for health care, and for other expenses. \nA study by researchers at UC Berkeley and the University of Illinois \nshow that we spend about $240 billion a year providing benefits to \nworking families through food stamps, Medicaid, and other antipoverty \nprograms.\n  When big companies pay poverty-level wages and then count on the \ngovernment to cover basic expenses for their employees, they get a \nboost from every American taxpayer who helps pick up the ticket for \nfood stamps and Medicaid. Taxpayer dollars are being used to boost the \nprofits of private companies that don't want to pay their employees \nenough to keep them out of poverty. That is corporate welfare, plain \nand simple.\n  I understand why some businesses might like to keep it that way, but \nAmerican taxpayers have had enough of this corporate welfare. American \nworkers have had enough of this corporate welfare. America has had \nenough of this corporate welfare.\n  This is an uphill fight. Those big corporations that pay poverty-\nlevel wages want to keep wages the way they are. And why not? It is \nmore money for corporate dividends and CEO bonuses. So those companies \nhire armies of lobbyists and lawyers who lean on Washington politicians \nto keep things exactly the way they are. Minimum-wage workers don't \nhave an army of lobbyists and lawyers, and American taxpayers don't \neither. But Congress doesn't work for those big companies. We work for \nthe workers and the taxpayers and the voters who sent us here.\n  It is time to call out this corporate welfare for what it is, and it \nis time to fight back. It has been 7 years since Congress last \nincreased the minimum wage. Senator Ted Kennedy led that fight, and I \nam proud to carry that fight forward today. It is time to honor work \nagain, time to honor people who get up every day and bust their tails \nto try to build a life for themselves and their children. It is time to \nincrease the minimum wage.\n\n[[Page S2155]]\n\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak and that Senators Murkowski, Begich, and Wicker be \nallowed to join me in a colloquy as they come to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, thank you very much.\n\n\n                             Pirate Fishing\n\n  Mr. President, we are coming to the floor today because the four of \nus serve as the cochairs of the Senate Oceans Caucus. I know the \nPresiding Officer from Delaware has a keen interest in oceans issues as \nwell, and we appreciate his support for the caucus.\n  We have worked very hard in this caucus to find bipartisan common \nground on issues that relate to the seas and to our oceans, and one of \nthe areas we have worked on is the area that is described in the jargon \nas IUU fishing, which means illegal, unreported, and unregulated \nfishing. The better word for it, the clearer word for it, the more \naccurate word for it is pirate fishing.\n  These are fishermen around the world who go to sea and they fish \nabove legal limits, they fish out of season, they fish for catches they \nare not allowed to catch, they fish in waters they are not allowed to \nfish in, and then they come to shore and market their illicit product. \nWhen they do that, they hurt legitimate fishermen and they hurt \nAmerican fishermen in two ways. First of all, fish migrate around the \nglobe. If they are knocked down, damaged, and caught illegally in other \nareas, then the American fishery for that same species is hurt. The \nsecond is that depresses the global price for fish. These people can \nflood the market with illegal fish. That drops the price through the \nlaw of supply and demand, and now our American fishermen--who are \nfishing lawfully, who are abiding by the catch limits, who are fishing \nin the right seasons and places--suffer a disadvantage in the pricing \nwhen their fish get to market.\n  So this is an important issue for our States, and it is not for \nnothing that we are all coastal State Senators who are here to express \nour support for action on these treaties.\n  In the United States, commercial fish landings are over $5 billion in \nrevenue a year. Recreational anglers spend more than $25 billion a \nyear. So this is big business, and pirate fishing is a big hit to our \nbig business. Pirate fishing losses have been estimated at between $10 \nbillion and $24 billion every year. When you consider that our whole \nrecreational fishing industry is only roughly $26 billion--and this is \na $24 billion raid, basically, on the international fisheries--it is \nimportant that we can do this.\n  So there is a package of treaties that has come out of the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee. There are four of them. Three of them are \ntraditional fishing treaties covering the South Pacific, the North \nPacific, and the Northwest Atlantic fisheries. You can only imagine \nwhat the North Pacific fishery means for Alaskan fishermen and what the \nNorthwest Atlantic fishery means for our northeastern fishermen. It is \nvery important that we get these treaties cleared through the Senate.\n  I am delighted that Chairman Menendez and his ranking member Senator \nCorker have passed these bills through the Foreign Relations Committee \nwith very strong bipartisan support. I think we have a really good \nchance to get something done in a bipartisan fashion that is good for \nour industry and also the right thing to do.\n  It is simply unfair when international pirate fishers are able to \nknock down the fisheries market internationally and take away product \nthat we would otherwise catch.\n  I see the senior Senator from Alaska has joined me on the floor. I \njust mentioned the North Pacific treaty, which I know has specific \nrelevance to her State.\n  We are in a parliamentary position where we have unanimous consent to \nengage in a colloquy--Senator Murkowski and I and Senator Wicker and \nSenator Begich as they arrive. So I now yield the floor to Senator \nMurkowski. Let me say how much I appreciate her leadership. She has \nbeen the cochair of the Oceans Caucus. It was significantly her \ninitiative that we should focus on pirate fishing, and I applaud all \nthe work she has done, together with Senator Wicker, who has now joined \nus.\n  I yield to the Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank my friend and my colleague from \nRhode Island, who also is my cochair on the Senate Oceans Caucus. As he \nhas noted, this is an issue of IUU fishing--illegal, unreported, and \nunregulated fishing--and, really, that is too polite a term for it. It \nis really piracy--piracy of our fisheries.\n  Senator Whitehouse has been very engaged in working on so many of \nthese key issues. I think this is quite important what we are \ndiscussing today--the positive step forward, not only for fishermen in \nmy State but for fishermen around the Nation.\n  I would like to thank those who have been involved in this effort in \naddition to Senator Whitehouse--Senator Wicker, as well as Senator \nBegich, for their efforts to help advance these treaties. I would also \nlike to recognize Senator Menendez and Senator Corker for their support \nthrough the Foreign Relations Committee process.\n\n  It should come as no surprise to any of my colleagues here in terms \nof Alaska's role with our fisheries. Alaska leads all States in terms \nof both volume and value of commercial fisheries, with approximately \n1.84 million metric tons, worth $1.3 billion. The seafood coming out of \nAlaska accounts for over 52 percent of our Nation's commercial seafood \nharvest. Our commercial, sport, and subsistence fisheries are really at \nthe heart of coastal Alaska. They are the source of economic livelihood \nfor more than 80,000 Alaskans who are directly or indirectly employed \nin the industry. I count my family as part of Alaska's fishing families \nwho support very well managed, sustainable fisheries.\n  But what we have seen from these acts of piracy--this illegal \nfishing--let's take, for instance, the crab fisheries, is very serious. \nIllegally harvested Russian king crab has been a real problem for us in \nAlaska since the early 1990s. In 2011 NOAA law enforcement seized 112 \nmetric tons of illegally harvested Russian king crab that was being \nshipped to U.S. markets through the Port of Seattle. So what happens \nhere is you have the Russians, who are taking too many of the king \ncrab, illegally harvesting them and then effectively dumping them on \nthe U.S. markets. Well, what do you think that does, then, to the price \nof the crab we are catching here lawfully in the United States? It is \ndepressing the price of crab. Now, I know this. I mentioned that my \nfamily is in the fishing business. My cousin is involved in the crab \nindustry. They have seen the prices of crab go down between 20 and 25 \npercent because of this illegal harvesting by the Russians.\n  This is not just a small problem. This is not something that is just \nhappening right now. This has been happening for decades now, and it \nneeds to be stopped. I do want to take a moment to express my \nappreciation for the amazing work our U.S. Coast Guard does, as well as \nthe other agencies, NOAA and the State Department, their combined \nefforts they are making to combat pirate fishing. It is greatly \nappreciated by me and my constituents.\n  We have four treaties in front of us that will help to level this \nplaying field and ensure that our coastal fishing communities will face \nless unfair competition from pirate fishing vessels that simply have \nnot been held to the high fisheries management standards we have here \nin the United States.\n  Two of the treaties we are looking at are particularly important for \nmy State. One is the Port State Measures Agreement. This sets global \nstandards to combat IUU fishing, and it helps to protect our U.S. \nfishermen by keeping the foreign, illegally caught fish from entering \nthe global stream of commerce. It is hugely important for us.\n  The other one I would like to highlight is the Convention on the \nConservation and Management of High Seas Fisheries Resources in the \nNorth\n\n[[Page S2156]]\n\nPacific Ocean. This will ensure that the North Pacific Fisheries \nCommission is established and also helps to ensure that there is a \nfisheries management regime in place to deter this IUU fishing within \nthe region adjacent to Alaska. So it is critically important when it \ncomes to our fisheries and the sustainability of our fisheries and how \nwe manage our fisheries.\n  We are trying to play by the rules. We expect others to be doing the \nsame.\n  So, again, I appreciate the work so many have done to help advance \nthese treaties that are before us.\n  I see my colleague from Mississippi on the floor, and I would like to \nhear again from him in terms of support for these treaties.\n  With that, I yield to my friend from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. President, I do not know if I need to seek recognition to be in a \ncolloquy, but I do appreciate the remarks of the Senator from Rhode \nIsland and the Senator from Alaska.\n  I rise this afternoon to join them in wholehearted support of these \nfour important measures. They are an important step in combating--the \nterm we use, as the Senator from Alaska said--is illegal, unreported, \nand unregulated fishing, IUU fishing, but I will also join my \ncolleagues in saying that it is nothing short of pirate fishing.\n  It has broad economic, social, and ecological consequences. I am glad \nto join in support of these four measures. They have been hotlined. For \nthose within the sound of our voices today that do not understand that, \nit is an expedited way to move things on a unanimous basis. I have \nevery reason to believe that it will only be a matter of time before we \nhave these hotline requests cleared on both sides of the aisle.\n  Alaska and Rhode Island have their interests in this. I can assure \nyou that Mississippi does too. Mississippi is home to many hard-working \nfishing communities. They depend on the oceans for their livelihoods. \nWe are the sixth largest seafood-producing State in the country. Many \npeople might not realize that. We are second in the Gulf of Mexico to \nthe State of Louisiana.\n  Pirate fishing hurts our fishermen. Our fishermen abide by the law. \nPirate fishing puts them at a competitive disadvantage, as the Senator \nsaid. These fishermen who are small business owners, for the most part, \nshould not be penalized for playing by the rules. International \ncooperation and standards are needed to protect local commerce and the \nenvironment. That is what the Agreement on Port State Measures would \ndo.\n  Under the agreement, vessels carrying illegally harvested fish would \nnot be allowed to enter our ports and thereby dilute the market with \nfraudulent product. In this way, the agreement would protect U.S. \nfishermen, seafood buyers, and consumers, while also supporting marine \nhabitat, coastal economies, and coastal communities.\n  Estimates show that pirate fishing costs as much as $23 billion per \nyear globally and poses a serious threat to the sustainability of \nmarine habitat. In parts of the world it accounts for up to 40 percent \nof the wild marine fish caught.\n  Other treaties under consideration address high seas fisheries \nresources. As the Senator from Alaska said, one in the North Pacific, \nyet another in the South Pacific, as well as amendments to the 1978 \nNorthwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization Convention. These amendments \nsimply update the conventions with standards similar to those that we \nin the United States use for our domestic waters.\n  These treaties can serve as powerful tools for showing that the \nUnited States is committed to enforcing fisheries laws and encouraging \nother countries to follow suit. Like other fisheries treaties that the \nSenate has ratified, they would protect America's interests, and they \nwould protect American workers.\n  Our commercial and recreational fishing industries are responsible \nfor 1.7 million American jobs and countless more at docks and \nfacilities for processing and distribution. In summary, these four \nmeasures are good for the economy, they are good for the seafood \nindustry, they are good for consumers, they are good for small business \npeople, and they are good for our commercial fishermen.\n  It is an opportunity for us to strike a blow for bipartisanship and \ninternationalism. I am glad to see the widespread support. I look \nforward to the measures being cleared on both sides of the aisle. I see \nmy other distinguished colleague from Alaska here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, what you will find with these issues is \nthat they are bipartisan. Fish know no boundaries of political \npersuasion. They look at what is important to them. We like to catch \nthem and eat them. So it does not matter where they come from, whether \nfrom the seas of Alaska or from the gulf. So I thank the Senator for \nthe opportunity to say a few words.\n  To Senator Whitehouse, my thanks for organizing and allowing this \nopportunity. I will tell you, we do not mean to outnumber you, having \ntwo Alaskans here. We are so dedicated to this issue. I can tell you \nhaving this opportunity to have these four treaties ratified is \nincredibly important for us.\n  I know lots of times we talk about illegal, unreported, unregulated \nfishing. I like to simply call it pirate fishing. These are people who \nsteal our fish out of our waters and then try to sell them back to us. \nClearly it is what it is: stealing our stock and packing our fisheries \nand passing, as was just mentioned, the cost to our markets of $23 \nbillion a year nationwide--worldwide--because of these pirate fishermen \nand fisherwomen.\n  Alaskan crab fishermen, for example--for people who like to watch a \nreality show, ``The Deadliest Catch'' is one of those. ``The Deadliest \nCatch'' guys tell me that there is over a half a billion dollars in \nlost crab because of illegal imports that are coming in. They may be \nstolen or labeled incorrectly.\n  The human impact is even more appalling, when you think about it. The \nworking conditions on those boats are deplorable. They do not call them \n``rust buckets'' for nothing. They are. They are dangerous. They are \nunsafe. There is forced labor, human trafficking, slavery. You name the \nlist; it is everything you can imagine in these ships.\n  Again, you can call it what you want, but at the end of the day, what \nis happening is pirate fishing. They are stealing the fish. Again, \nillegal fishing is a stateless criminal enterprise. There are no flags. \nThey steal fish with impunity. They victimize their workers. We need to \nfight back. These treaties help do it.\n  The Coast Guard--we love our coasties. It does not matter if they are \nin Alaska or around the country. They do an incredible job. They track \ndown these criminals on the high seas and chase them down. You can see \nin this picture where they have caught one of the ships--our Coast \nGuard cutters in the North Pacific a few years back.\n  There is no question when they catch these ships what should happen \nto them, from my perspective. I am a little more radical on this. I \nknow we will have these treaties, which are important. But you know, in \nmy view, if they catch a ship like this, they should take the crew off, \ntake the hazardous waste off, and sink it to the bottom of the ocean. \nThen we are done. The people will get a clear message.\n  I know some lawyers object to my idea. I recognize that. But let me \ntell you, we had some ships--this one, for example. As you can see, it \nis not only a rust bucket; you can see the rust bleeding off of it. \nThis is one of these ships that was washed into our waters from the \ntsunami in Japan. You can see a well-placed artillery shell hit it in \nthe middle because they decided to sink it.\n  So after the Coast Guard's lawyers thought it was not a good idea, we \nhad a piece of equipment that they then went ahead and sunk. I will \ntell you, you do this kind of activity, and I guarantee you the pirates \nof this country who are trying to steal our fish will get a clear and \nsimple message.\n  But it is important to go after these pirates. The Coast Guard--in \nthis case it was an old rust bucket they sunk to the bottom. I have \ntaken to the floor many times to say they need better tools, more \ncutters, more patrol aircraft to do their job and increase their \ncapacity in going after these pirates--not only pirates on fishing, but \nalso smuggling drugs and all the other work that these illegal ships \nare doing that they need to go after. We need to have tougher laws. \nThat is what these treaties do. They strengthen the laws. They\n\n[[Page S2157]]\n\nare bipartisan. The Port State Measures Agreement tightens rules on \nseafood imports, provides for better inspection, and lists the pirate \nboats so we know who to keep out of our waters.\n\n  Others deal with protecting high seamounts and other needed \nprovisions specific to the North Pacific, the South Pacific, and the \nAtlantic. They have been in years of negotiations. I applaud our teams \nat the State Department and NOAA and the many Senators who have engaged \nin this issue to solve this problem, to create more tools for us to \nenforce.\n  We need to do our part. We need to support these treaties. Again, it \nis a bipartisan effort. We need to support these treaties because it \nwill support our fishermen, support our economies throughout the ocean \nStates and the Gulf States and throughout the States that impact with \nfisheries. We also need to do it because of the rule of law and \nprotecting and respecting the rule of law and human dignity that we \ninsist on.\n  When we think of the impact of these individuals who are trapped on \nthese boats--literally, the human trafficking, slavery, and forced work \nthat these guys are taken to on these pirate ships is appalling. We \nshould be appalled just by that fact alone, besides the billions they \nsteal from the waters and try to resell from their harvest in our \noceans illegally.\n  So let me just sum up by saying again that I know my idea of sinking \na pirate ship may be a little radical. But the Coast Guard did it on \none ship. My view is, why not more? But at least we will have some \ntreaties, maybe with this work on the floor tonight. Again, to Senator \nWhitehouse, I thank him for organizing all of us who care so deeply \nabout the fishing industry and these treaties that will make a \ndifference. When you put more tools in the toolbox, it will have an \nimpact.\n  You can rest assured I will do everything I can to gather the support \nnecessary to make sure these treaties pass. I will stop at this point. \nI appreciate the effort. Thank you for allowing me to have visual aids. \nSometimes words are great, but visual aids make impact. Hopefully, \npeople can see. Hopefully, these pirates will see we are serious and \nthis is not some movie that Johnny Depp is in either. We are going \nafter those pirate ships.\n  Thank you for the opportunity to say a few words.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Mississippi \nand the two Senators from Alaska for participating in this bipartisan \neffort. Let me conclude by reading something that Chris Lischewski, who \nis the CEO and President of Bumble Bee Foods, wrote to me:\n\n       Everybody loves a tuna fish sandwich. And Bumble Bee has \n     been in that industry for a long time. They are a proud \n     American company. But tuna travel great distances. They are a \n     fish, that if foreign pirates go after them and fish them \n     illegally, and fish them unsustainably and knock that \n     population down, that comes home to roost for good old Bumble \n     Bee Foods.\n\n  Here is what the CEO of that company said:\n\n       IUU fishing is a multi-billion dollar industry that \n     undermines our global conservation and sustainability \n     efforts.\n\n  By that he means his company.\n\n       Illegal fishing penalizes legitimate fishermen and \n     processors and it must be stopped. While the United States \n     has done a good job at developing laws to detect and deter \n     IUU fishing, other nations have not. We strongly support the \n     agreement on Port State Measures to prevent, deter and \n     eliminate the illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, \n     because it creates an obligation for other nations to take \n     action against IUU fishing.\n\n  I yield the floor. If any of my colleague wish to speak, let me just \nsay that they do so with my gratitude for this bipartisan moment in the \nSenate and in support of the jobs that the fishing industry provides \nfor our constituents.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I think we are waiting here for a \ncouple of minutes. I will use a couple of minutes to speak again to \nthose who come to our assistance when it comes to the enforcement of \nour fisheries laws--the men and women of our Coast Guard, NOAA, and our \nother enforcement agencies.\n  Senator Begich has somewhat dramatically shown some of the scenes. \nThis is not easy stuff out there. When you have somebody who we have \nreason to believe has been operating illegally in violation of our \nagreed fisheries laws, more likely than not they are not just going to \nstand by and let you board and take a peek. They are going to take \nchase.\n  As we are hearing, as we are trying to find some evidence of the \nmissing Malaysian jetliner, the oceans out there are pretty darn big. \nUsually, the conditions are not ones in which you would want to go out \non a pleasure cruise.\n  Our men and women who are engaged in those enforcement efforts are \ntruly heroes to us in terms of the efforts that they make, the energy \nthat they expend, and the risk that they place themselves at.\n  So day after day, as they cover our waters, as they work to ensure \nthat there is a effective management of our fisheries, their efforts to \nenforce these laws, their efforts to provide for a level of protection \nand safety, their efforts to bring the pirates to justice are truly to \nbe applauded.\n  I thank the Senator for the opportunity to make that brief statement. \nI see my friend and colleague is at the ready, hopefully to announce \nthat we will be able to move to passage of these significant treaties.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. It appears that we will shortly be able to do that. \nThis is a happy coincidence in which four Senators in bipartisan \nfashion have come to the floor to support action on four treaties that \nwill help protect our fishing industry, and it turns out that at this \nmoment the treaties have been cleared for ratification on both sides of \nthe aisle. In a moment I will be able to take us through those \nparliamentary steps, but on behalf of all four of us, I should express \nmy appreciation to Chairman Menendez and to his ranking member Senator \nCorker for the leadership they have shown in getting these treaties \nthrough the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. I know it was in a \nstrongly bipartisan fashion. I think it was in a unanimously bipartisan \nfashion.\n  The Presiding Officer is a member of that distinguished committee, \nand I want to express my appreciation to the Presiding Officer, Senator \nCoons of Delaware.\n  It is good to be able to do these kinds of things in a bipartisan \nfashion. It reminds me a little bit of our friend Senator Enzi's 80/20 \nrule: We get 80 percent done in the Senate without incident, but then, \nof course, nobody notices. The other 20 percent we fight over, and the \nfight gets 80 percent of the attention.\n  So it is a happy moment when we can do something good for our \nindustry, good for our fisheries, do it in a bipartisan fashion, and do \nit smoothly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/03/senate-section/article/S2157-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2157-S2158]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   AGREEMENT ON PORT STATE MEASURES TO PREVENT, DETER, AND ELIMINATE \n              ILLEGAL, UNREPORTED, AND UNREGULATED FISHING\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    CONVENTION ON THE CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT OF THE HIGH SEAS \n             FISHERIES RESOURCES IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC OCEAN\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n CONVENTION ON THE CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT OF HIGH SEAS FISHERIES \n                  RESOURCES IN THE NORTH PACIFIC OCEAN\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n AMENDMENT TO THE CONVENTION ON FUTURE MULTILATERAL COOPERATION IN THE \n                      NORTHWEST ATLANTIC FISHERIES\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE.

The story of Kansas is one that involves many people, many \njobs, much ado about caring for others. Our State is a State of \nmanufacturing workers, factory workers, teachers, farmers, and people \nwho work hard every day to make a difference in their community and to \nmake a difference in our State and Nation. Today I wish to pay tribute \nto one of those unsung heroes. In this case, it is a businessman, a \nvolunteer, a husband, and a father who lived a full life before passing \naway in December of last year.\n  Alvin Brensing was born and raised on a farm outside of Hudson, a \nrural Central Kansas town with a population of 125. After high school, \nBrensing graduated with honors from Salt City Business College in \nHutchison and in May 1937, at the age of 21, started working as a \nbookkeeper at the Stafford County Flour Mills.\n  As German immigrants, the Krug family realized that their American \ndream was going to be accomplished by establishing the flour mill more \nthan a century ago. Alvin worked under William Krug and then Leonard \nBrim to help grow the company before being named its president in 1986. \nUnder his leadership, Stafford County Flour Mills doubled its capacity \nand grew 2\\1/2\\ times its size. It was one of the last independent \nflour mills remaining in the United States, and the mill produces \nHudson Cream Flour. Many of my colleagues and many Americans will have \nseen the bag of flour with the great symbol and emblem--Hudson Cream \nFlour. Hudson Cream Flour has a reputation around the Nation as a top-\nnotch baking flour for its consistency and texture. It also serves as a \ntradition for this West Virginia family who wrote the company saying:\n\n       After using Hudson Cream Flour for all the years I have \n     cooked . . . and can remember even my grandmother and mother \n     using nothing else . . . I read for the first time the \n     ``absolute satisfaction guarantee'' and really had a good \n     laugh! I thought, if those people in Kansas only knew the \n     absolute satisfaction my family has enjoyed from their \n     product. The things we pass down in our family are good \n     morals, good cooking, and Hudson Cream flour!\n\n  After Alvin's wife died in 1993, he came to miss the smell of fresh \nbread and soon began experimenting with ingredients. Alvin came up with \nthree\n\n[[Page S2159]]\n\nrecipes, including ``Al's Cinnamon Raisin Bread,'' which is included on \nthe back of every Hudson Cream Flour bag.\n  Alvin always put farmers and customers first. Current Stafford County \nFlour Mills president Reuel Foote reflected that Alvin often said, \n``Our word is our bond--if you agree to do something, you do it.''\n  While Alvin dedicated most of his life to ensuring the success and \nfuture of the mill, he was also a tireless volunteer in the Hudson \ncommunity. Brensing took it upon himself to maintain Hudson's Trinity \nCemetery, where his parents and his wife Zelda are buried. In fact, he \nupgraded a shed on the property into a building where loved ones can \nnow comfortably look up the location of their loved ones' graves.\n  Alvin was also known as the local weatherman, collecting data for the \nNational Weather Service from a local grain elevator. His daughters \nremember their dad turning the furnace on each Sunday morning to heat \nup the Trinity Community Church.\n  His legacy of leadership and volunteerism is what will live on as the \nStafford County Flour Mills continue to support the community and \neducate youth, whether through the county 4-H Program or through the \ndozens of mill tours each year. The mill also continues Alvin's \ntradition of giving each schoolkid a 5-pound bag of flour after each \ntour to encourage them to experiment with recipes and baking.\n  Alvin taught through his actions that satisfaction in life comes from \nwhat you do for others rather than what you do for yourself. This is \nthe legacy I want to pay tribute to today, and this is the legacy he \nlived and leaves behind for the next generation.\n  We want those who follow him and us to know they have their chance to \nreturn home, put down their roots, and raise their own families in \nplaces such as Hudson, KS. Our Nation faces so many challenges today, \nbut we must remain committed to doing what it takes so that tomorrow \nand every day thereafter our children and grandchildren have the \nopportunity to enjoy that special way of life in places like Kansas and \nto pursue their own American dream.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in paying tribute and remembering the \nlife of a great Kansan, Alvin Brensing.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/03/senate-section/article/S2159-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2159]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

It is \nan honor to know our fraternity's mission--to develop ethical leaders \ninspired by the principles of love, honor, and truth--has prevailed for \nnearly a century.\n  The Delta Xi Chapter of our fraternal network is a standout among \nchapters in the Nation. Established by the Nevada Club at the turn of \nthe 20th century, the brothers of Delta Xi have since initiated well \nover 1,900 members and awarded more than 100 deserving scholarships.\n  Their members not only prioritize their academic involvement within \nthe University of Nevada system, but also give back to their local \ncommunity through service. Their achievements and contributions to the \ncommunity will only continue to grow as Sigma Nu is dedicated to \nfostering the personal growth of each man's mind, heart, and character. \nThrough its dedication to leadership and philanthropic commitments, our \nfraternity has sustained a nationally renowned reputation.\n  As Delta Xi celebrates its centennial year, its members have much to \nbe proud of and look forward to for many years to come. I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in congratulating the Delta Xi Chapter of Sigma \nNu.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/03/senate-section/article/S2159-3", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2159]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/03/senate-section/article/S2159-4", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2159]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/03/senate-section/article/S2159-5", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2159-S2160]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   REPORT RELATIVE TO THE ISSUANCE OF AN EXECUTIVE ORDER DECLARING A \nNATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO THE UNUSUAL AND EXTRAORDINARY THREAT \nTO THE NATIONAL SECURITY AND FOREIGN POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES POSED \n       BY THE SITUATION IN AND IN RELATION TO SOUTH SUDAN--PM 38\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 \nU.S.C. 1701 et seq.)

A bill to amend the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch \nAct to require the Secretary of Agriculture to make loan guarantees and \ngrants to finance certain improvements to school lunch facilities, to \ntrain school food service personnel, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join my friend from \nNorth Dakota, Senator Heitkamp, in introducing the School Food \nModernization Act to assist schools in providing healthier meals to \nstudents throughout the country.\n  School meals play a vital role in the lives of our young people. More \nthan 30 million children participate in the National School Lunch \nProgram every schoolday. In Maine, 40 percent of children qualify for \nfree or reduced-price meals based on household income.\n  The food served to these children has a demonstrable effect on their \nhealth and well-being. Many children consume up to half their daily \ncaloric intake at school. In fact, children often get their most \nnutritious meal of the day at school instead of at home.\n  At the same time, too many of our children are at risk of serious \ndisease. One-third of the children in this country are overweight or \nobese, which increases their risk for heart disease, high blood \npressure, type 2 diabetes and other chronic diseases. These ailments \nmay have a lifelong effect on their health as they grow to adulthood.\n  Given the concerns about the health of our children, the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture has issued updated school\n\n[[Page S2165]]\n\nmeal nutrition standards that call for increased servings of fruit, \nvegetables, low-fat products, and whole grains while limiting the \nintake of fats, sugar, salt, and excess calories.\n  In response, our schools have stepped up to the plate. Nationwide, \nschools are working diligently to meet the standards and serve \nhealthier meals. For example, in the New Sweden Consolidated School in \nAroostook County, ME, food service manager Melanie Lagasse prepares \nmeals from scratch instead of opening cans or pushing a defrost button. \nThe school's 64 students, ranging from preschool to eighth grade, have \ngrown to relish the chicken stew, baked fish, and whole grain pasta and \nmeatloaf that she makes fresh every day.\n  Many schools, however, lack the right tools for preparing meals rich \nin fresh ingredients and must rely on workarounds that are expensive, \ninefficient, and unsustainable. Schools built decades ago lack the \ntools and the infrastructure necessary to comply fully with the new \nUSDA guidelines. In fact, many lack any capacity beyond reheating and \nholding food for meal service.\n  To serve healthier meals to their students, 99 percent of Maine \nschool districts need at least one piece of equipment and almost half--\n48 percent--of districts need kitchen infrastructure upgrades. While \nsome of the needs appear quite simple--food processors, knives, \nserving-portion utensils, scales, utility carts--there is still a cost. \nThe median equipment need per school is $45,000.\n  Even more costly would be making the required changes to \ninfrastructure. Forty-eight percent of Maine schools need some kind of \ninfrastructure change to serve healthy meals. For example, 41 percent \nof schools need more physical space, 22 percent need more electrical \ncapacity, 21 percent need more plumbing capacity, and 19 percent need \nmore ventilation. In addition, for Maine, 82 percent of school \ndistricts are in areas defined as rural.\n  Add the equipment costs together with the infrastructure costs and it \nis estimated that overall, $58.8 million would be needed just in Maine \nto serve healthy meals to all of our students. That far exceeds the \n$74,000 grant the USDA awarded Maine in March for new equipment.\n  Our bill aims to make better use of current resources by authorizing \nloan guarantee assistance and grants for school equipment and \ninfrastructure improvements and by helping food service personnel meet \nthe updated nutrition standards. First, it would establish a loan \nguarantee assistance program within USDA to help schools acquire new \nequipment to prepare and serve healthier, more nutritious meals to \nstudents. School administrators and other eligible borrowers could \nobtain Federal guarantees for 80 percent of the loan value needed to \nconstruct, remodel, or expand their kitchens, dining, or food storage \ninfrastructure.\n  Second, it would provide targeted grant assistance to give school \nadministrators and food service directors the seed funding needed to \nupgrade kitchen infrastructure or to purchase high- quality, durable \nkitchen equipment such as commercial ovens, steamers, and stoves.\n  Finally, to aid school food service personnel in meeting the updated \nnutrition guidelines, the legislation would strengthen training and \nprovide technical assistance by authorizing USDA to provide support on \na competitive basis to highly qualified third-party trainers to develop \nand administer training and technical assistance.\n  We need to start our schoolchildren off on the right food every day. \nIf they are going to compete in the global arena, they need to be \nhealthy and their minds and bodies fully nourished. This bill will help \nus achieve that goal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/03/senate-section/article/S2165-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2165]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 410--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE \n                  ANNIVERSARY OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself and Mr. Kirk) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 410\n\n       Whereas the Armenian Genocide was conceived and carried out \n     by the Ottoman Empire from 1915 to 1923, resulting in the \n     deportation of nearly 2,000,000 Armenians, of whom 1,500,000 \n     men, women, and children were killed and 500,000 survivors \n     were expelled from their homes, and the elimination of the \n     over 2,500-year presence of Armenians in their historic \n     homeland;\n       Whereas, on May 24, 1915, the Allied Powers of England, \n     France, and Russia jointly issued a statement explicitly \n     charging for the first time ever another government of \n     committing crimes ``against humanity and civilization'';\n       Whereas Raphael Lemkin, who coined the term ``genocide'', \n     and whose draft resolution for a genocide convention treaty \n     became the framework for the United Nations Convention on the \n     Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, \n     recognized the Armenian Genocide as the type of crime the \n     United Nations should prevent and punish through the setting \n     of international standards;\n       Whereas Senate Concurrent Resolution 12, 64th Congress, \n     agreed to February 9, 1916, resolved that ``the President of \n     the United States be respectfully asked to designate a day on \n     which the citizens of this country may give expression to \n     their sympathy by contributing funds now being raised for the \n     relief of the Armenians'', who at the time were enduring \n     ``starvation, disease, and untold suffering'';\n       Whereas Senate Resolution 359, 66th Congress, agreed to May \n     11, 1920, stated that ``the testimony adduced at the hearings \n     conducted by the subcommittee of the Senate Committee on \n     Foreign Relations have clearly established the truth of the \n     reported massacres and other atrocities from which the \n     Armenian people have suffered'';\n       Whereas House Joint Resolution 148, 94th Congress, agreed \n     to April 8, 1975, resolved, ``That April 24, 1975, is hereby \n     designated as `National Day of Remembrance of Man's \n     Inhumanity to Man', and the President of the United States is \n     authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon \n     the people of the United States to observe such day as a day \n     of remembrance for all the victims of genocide, especially \n     those of Armenian ancestry . . .'';\n       Whereas House Joint Resolution 247, 98th Congress, agreed \n     to September 10, 1984, resolved, ``That April 24, 1985, is \n     hereby designated as `National Day of Remembrance of Man's \n     Inhumanity to Man', and the President of the United States is \n     authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon \n     the people of the United States to observe such day as a day \n     of remembrance for all the victims of genocide, especially \n     the one and one-half million people of Armenian ancestry. . \n     .'';\n       Whereas the United States Holocaust Memorial Council, an \n     independent Federal agency, unanimously resolved on April 30, \n     1981, that the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum would \n     document the Armenian Genocide in the Museum, and has done so \n     through a public examination of the historic record, \n     including lectures and the maintenance of books, records, and \n     photographs about the Genocide;\n       Whereas the Government of the Republic of Turkey has \n     continued its international campaign of Armenian Genocide \n     denial, maintained a blockade of Armenia, and continues to \n     pressure the small but growing Turkish civil society movement \n     for acknowledging the Armenian Genocide;\n       Whereas, in April 2011, the month of remembrance of the \n     Armenian Genocide, the Government of the Republic of Turkey \n     demolished a 100-foot-high statue in the city of Kars which \n     was erected to promote reconciliation with Armenia;\n       Whereas the denial of the Armenian Genocide by the \n     Government of the Republic of Turkey has prevented the \n     meaningful advancement of a constructive political, economic, \n     and security relationship between Armenia and Turkey;
