Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 294, the \nflood insurance legislation.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 294, S. 1926, a bill to \n     delay the implementation of certain provisions of the \n     Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 and to \n     reform the National Association of Registered Agents and \n     Brokers, and for other purposes.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on this issue alone we have been trying for \nmonths to move this vote. On our side we have heard constantly, \npersistently, and always from Senator Landrieu indicating how important \nthis is to her State and to our country. So I would hope we can finally \nhave a pathway forward on this today with a consent agreement.\n  It is my understanding Senator Isakson of Georgia is going to come to \nthe floor soon and we will try to do that. I just want to alert \neveryone to the fact if that isn't going to work out, we are not going \nto delay this any more. We will file cloture and move on it when we get \nback from our next work period.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Following my remarks, Mr. President, and those of the Republican \nleader, the Senate will resume consideration of the House message to \naccompany H.R. 3547, which is the legislative vehicle for the Omnibus \nappropriations bill.\n  The filing deadline for first-degree amendments to the House message \nis 1 p.m. today. Under the rule, the cloture vote on the motion to \nconcur in the House message to accompany the omnibus will be an hour \nafter we come in tomorrow morning. There have been requests by both \nDemocrats and Republicans to move the vote forward, and if that is \npossible--I am happy to cooperate with all Senators, if the majority of \nthe Senators would like to do this early--I will be happy to see if we \ncan get a consent agreement to do that.\n  We are also working, as I have indicated, on the flood insurance bill \nand we will continue to work on that.\n\n\n                Measure Placed on the Calendar--S. 1931\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, S. 1931 is due for a second reading, I am \ntold.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will read the bill by \ntitle for the second time.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1931) to provide for the extension of certain \n     unemployment benefits, and for other purposes.\n\n  Mr. REID. I object to any further proceedings with respect to this \nlegislation.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard. The bill will \nbe placed on the calendar.\n\n\n                    Unemployment Insurance Benefits\n\n  Mr. President, on this side of the aisle, we have not put to one side \nand forgotten about unemployment compensation extensions for 1.5 \nmillion desperate Americans. I wish to just spend a minute or two on \nthis issue, but we have not forgotten this and I want to direct \neveryone's attention to an editorial in one of America's leading \nnewspapers of today. Here is what it said.\n\n\n[[Page S384]]\n\n\n       Republican Senators are pulling out every fake excuse they \n     can think of for filibustering an extension of jobless \n     benefits for the long-term unemployed. . . . The majority \n     leader, Harry Reid, was mean to us and wouldn't let us offer \n     amendments, they say.\n\n  We have heard that a lot. I am really a mean person.\n\n       Democrats refused to pay for the benefits. It's President \n     Obama's fault because people can't find work because he won't \n     approve the Keystone XL oil pipeline.\n\n  The article goes on:\n\n       The truth is the Republican Party simply does not believe \n     that job seekers who have been out of work for 6 months or \n     longer deserve government assistance. The most hardhearted \n     believe cutting benefits will give people an incentive to get \n     back to work. The most cynical are hoping for widespread \n     misery, which they can pin on ``Obama's economy'' for \n     political gain in the elections this fall. Whatever the \n     reasons, nearly five million unemployed people will go \n     without benefits by the end of 2014, unless the party backs \n     down.\n       The most appalling demand from Republicans was that \n     benefits be paid for with cuts to other programs.\n\n  That is certainly the truth. The article continues:\n\n       For example, Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire proposed \n     requiring that parents have a Social Security number to \n     receive the child tax credit--a move that would eliminate an \n     important anti-poverty measure for millions of children who \n     are citizens though their parents are not.\n\n  We will have more to say about this. We are not going to leave this \nissue. This is a cutting-edge issue for the American people. \nRepublicans outside Congress believe this is the right thing to do--the \nmajority of Republicans.\n\n\n                          House-Passed Omnibus\n\n  The Senate today will consider the House-passed omnibus spending \nbill, an important bipartisan agreement that keeps our country on a \nresponsible path while preventing another manufactured crisis--and we \nhave had so many of those.\n  I cannot say enough about the work of the senior Senator from \nMaryland Ms. Mikulski. We came to the Senate together. She is someone \nwho identifies with the people of Maryland as no one has ever \nidentified with the people of Maryland, but in the process she also \nidentifies with people around America. That is why she is revered in \nMaryland. She has been to Nevada, and we love her in Nevada also.\n  I don't know of anyone else who could have done what she did, working \nwith the Republicans in the House. I admire her so very much, and I am \nvery happy to have reached the point where we are today. After 3 years \nof damaging cuts to vital social programs, this bill finally increases \ninvestments in the middle class.\n  Is it perfect? Of course not. There is so much good to say about this \nbill. But Senator Mikulski, who represents the State where the \nheadquarters of the National Institutes of Health resides, got an extra \n$1 billion for them--more than they got last year. It is too bad the \nRepublicans' cost-cutting whacked them $1\\1/2\\ billion in the year \nbefore, but what she did with the NIH is exemplary of what she has done \nto help America.\n  So enough about her, but she has done something no one else could do.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                               Free Trade\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, yesterday, I said there were a number \nof things the President could announce in his North Carolina speech \nthat would draw bipartisan support and actually boost the economy. One \nof the things I was particularly disappointed he didn't push--at least \npush harder--is trade.\n  As I said, this is one of the brightest areas of his economic agenda, \nbut if we as a nation don't act quickly and decisively, the world is \ngoing to literally pass us right by. We are going to miss opportunities \nto benefit economically, to open foreign markets to American goods and \nto America's political and cultural influence.\n  When we look at the rest of the developed world, from Europe to \nCanada to Australia, they are practically falling all over themselves \nto negotiate more and better opportunities, while we basically have sat \non our hands, a consequence of the President's inability to persuade \nhis own party--his own party--to expand trade-related jobs.\n  So we need to catch up, but we can't do that without leadership from \nthe President, the kind of leadership as we have seen in the Senate \nfrom the chairman of the Finance Committee, who himself obviously is a \nDemocrat. He has been a tireless advocate for trade and for American \nagriculture. Yet with his retirement looming on the horizon, I am \nafraid there might not be many Democrats left in the Senate willing to \nhelp lead on this issue. That is why we need the President to be deeply \ninvolved. We need him to step up for American workers and increase \nexports by bringing his own party on board with a trade promotion bill \nthat was introduced just last week.\n  The authority in that legislation is key to enabling the \nadministration to conclude critical trade negotiations that hold \nincredible promise for American jobs and economic growth. With our \neconomy in such dire straits these days, opening new opportunities for \nAmerican goods through trade should be a real no-brainer. It is an \nissue that used to be fairly bipartisan around here, and it can be \nagain, if the President is willing to lead. Millions of middle-class \nfamilies and small businesses are counting on him to do just that.\n  So I look forward to him promoting the benefits of trade and the \nlegislation I mentioned in his State of the Union Address. I hope we \nwill hear about that. When he does so, Republicans will be right there \nwith him to move the trade promotion bill through Congress in a \nbipartisan fashion.\n\n\n                             EPA Coal Regs\n\n  Last week the Obama administration published a regulation that would \neffectively ban coal-fired powerplants from being built in the future.\n  The head of the EPA, who will be testifying on this regulation today, \nbasically admitted as much herself when she called it ``significant \neconomic lift.'' She knows the technology this regulation requires is \nprohibitively expensive; that her own agency knows it is nowhere near--\nnowhere near--ready for adoption; that even some White House officials \ndo not believe her plan is feasible, and that is the point. The point \nis to eliminate coal jobs in America.\n  That is why I wasn't surprised by emails that recently came to \nlight--emails which appeared to show EPA officials colluding with \nextremist special interests in devising impossible-to-achieve \nregulations. The emails even referred to previously shuttered \npowerplants as ``defeated,'' making the intent behind coal-related \nactions abundantly clear.\n  Here is the other thing. This new regulation is not even expected to \nreduce emissions in a meaningful way--not even expected to reduce \nemissions in a meaningful way. What it will do, however, is trigger a \nsection of the law that would allow the administration to eventually \nshut down coal-fired plants that exist today.\n  In other words, it would allow the administration to achieve its true \naim of eliminating coal jobs completely. For struggling middle-class \nfamilies across eastern Kentucky, this is just the latest punch in the \ngut from Washington, from an administration whose own advisers seem to \nbelieve that ``a war on coal is exactly what is needed,'' from one of \nthe President's advisers.\n  Some call this regulation outrageous. Some say it is extremism at its \nworst. Here is what I call it. It is absolutely cruel because here is \nwhat is lost in this administration's crusade for ideological purity, \nin its crusade for approval of coastal editorials--human lives are \naffected, the lives of people I represent, folks who haven't done \nanything to deserve a war being declared on them.\n  These are the Kentuckians who just want to work, provide for their \nfamilies, and deliver the type of low-cost energy that attracts more \njobs to Kentucky. And coal is what allows so many of them to do all \nthat. It provides well-paying jobs. And, as Jimmy Rose of Bell County, \nKY, who has now become a rather famous country singer, puts it in his \nhit song, ``Coal Keeps the Lights On.''\n  I remind my colleagues that coal does more than keep the lights on in \nKentucky; it keeps the lights on here too, both figuratively and \nliterally. From the anti-coal blogger tapping out a tweet to the EPA \nstaffer cooking up a meal, millions of Americans rely on coal to power \ntheir homes and their offices. In recent years, coal has accounted for \nabout 40 percent of the\n\n[[Page S385]]\n\nelectricity generated in our country. That compares to just 3.5 percent \nfor sources such as wind and solar. So even if the administration were \nto achieve its dream of eliminating every last coal job, it is not as \nthough they could just fire up a few windmills to cover the gap. It is \ngoing to take a very long time--decades--for alternative sources to \neven come close to providing the same level of jobs and energy as coal. \nIn other words, the administration's ideological crusade doesn't even \nseem to have a logical end game. It is basically just ideology.\n  Here is the thing. Republicans agree that alternative and renewable \nenergy sources are necessary for fuel diversity, but we believe wind \nand geothermal and solar should be part of an ``all of the above'' \nenergy strategy which also includes coal and natural gas and the oil we \ncan get right here in North America, with Americans providing the \nworkforce.\n  Another key difference is this: Republicans look at Kentucky coal \nminers and see hard-working men and women, not obstacles to some \nleftwing fantasy. That is why I, along with 40 Republican cosponsors--\nincluding my friend and fellow Kentuckian Rand Paul--intend to file a \nresolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act to ensure \na vote to stop this devastating rule. We believe the EPA regulation in \nquestion clearly meets the definition for congressional review under \nthis statute, and I am sending a letter to Comptroller General Dodaro \noutlining the reasons why that is the case.\n  If the majority leader were serious about helping Kentuckians, he \nwould stop blocking the Senate from passing my Saving Coal Jobs Act. It \nis commonsense legislation that would give elected representatives of \nthe people a greater say in how coal is regulated in this country. \nThere is no reason for him to keep it bottled up a moment longer.\n  Look. Kentucky is facing a real crisis. The Obama administration \nappears to be sending signals that its latest regulation is actually \njust the beginning in a new, expanded front in its war on coal. Already \nthe administration's regulations have played a significant role in \ncausing coal jobs in my State to plummet. These are good jobs which pay \nmore than $1 billion in annual wages to my constituents. For every \nminer with a job, three more Kentuckians will hold a coal-dependent job \nas well.\n  The majority leader and his Democratic caucus now have a choice: Are \nthey going to stand with the coal families under attack in places such \nas Kentucky and West Virginia and Colorado or are they going to \ncontinue to stand with the powerful leftwing special interests who want \nto see their jobs completely eliminated? That is the choice. It is \npretty clear where I stand and where most of my colleagues on this side \nof the aisle stand.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I come to the floor today as the \nchairperson of the Appropriations Committee--a committee I am honored \nto chair--to support the Consolidated Appropriations Act for fiscal \nyear 2014. This bill passed the House on Wednesday with a stunning and \namazing vote of 359 to 67. The purpose of this agreement is to fund the \noperation of the Federal Government for the remainder of fiscal year \n2014.\n  The vote in the House, which I hope will be paralleled here in the \nSenate, shows what working together based on civility, listening to \neach other, being willing to compromise but not capitulate on \nprinciple, negotiating on what are the appropriate fiscal levels--this \nshows we can get the job done.\n  In today's era of shutdown, slowdown, slamdown politics, where \nnegotiating occurs on cable TV rather than in committee rooms, we \nworked together. Setting aside partisan differences, working across the \naisle and across the dome, we looked to find how we could put together \na bill both sides of the aisle and both Houses could agree upon.\n  This is what the American people deserve: Us doing the business of \nthe country, legislating in due diligence and regular order. They want \na government that works as hard as they do, and working under a very \nstringent deadline, we were able to do this. After 3 years of damaging \ncuts that have hurt our efforts to help people, this agreement turns \nthe corner.\n  We recognized that we needed to focus on growth in jobs and lower the \nunemployment rate but not increase our debt or our deficit. We worked \nvery hard to do that, to increase the kinds of public investments the \nAmerican people would approve of--keep America strong, keep our economy \nstrong--and to do the diligent work we need to do.\n  This bill is something called an omnibus bill which includes all 12 \nappropriations bills. That means we have 12 subcommittees--defense, \nhealth and human services, labor and education, energy, water, \nfinancial services--and each one has to do their funding work. \nOrdinarily, we would bring one bill up at a time, but that was not to \nbe. So where we are is this is a consolidated bill of all 12.\n  We have been working on this since the President sent his budget to \nus this spring. We held over 50 hearings, listened, did due diligence, \nand marked up our bills. We were ready to come to the floor in the \nfall, but it was not to be. We had to wait for the Budget Committee to \ndo its work to give us a top line so we could get to our bottom line.\n  On December 18, just before Christmas, Congress gave us that cap on \ndiscretionary spending. We knew what we wanted to spend, but, again, we \nknow we have to be a more frugal government. We know we have to be \nsmart not only about spending but about saving, getting rid of dated, \nduplicative, and dysfunctional programs, and we were able to do just \nthat. On December 18 we were given a cap on discretionary spending of \n$1.02 trillion. We met that cap. We worked nonstop over the holidays, \nresolving differences in both money and in certain policy areas.\n  What we do today is we come here with an agreement that is \nbipartisan. I emphasize that. The agreement is bipartisan. It is \nbicameral; that means both sides of the Capitol. It has also been one \nof compromise but not, on either side, capitulating on principle.\n  I am proud to say this agreement meets our national security needs \nand ensures the readiness of our troops and keeps us safe at home. It \nalso meets the compelling human needs of our middle class and our most \nvulnerable. At the same time, it also invests in America's future by \nstrengthening our physical infrastructure and also supporting research \nand development to save lives, spur growth and innovation and \neverything from lifesaving biosciences to aeronautics. And we want to \nmake sure we are looking not only at jobs today but jobs tomorrow.\n  Before I give more detail about this agreement, I will highlight one \nof the reasons I am very proud of something we have done in this bill. \nOur legislation pending before the Senate restores the full cost-of-\nliving adjustment for our working-age disabled military retirees and \nsurvivors of our departed servicemembers. Their COLAS were mistakenly \nreduced by 1 percent in the recent budget agreement. This agreement \nfixes that error.\n  I wish to make this note: It is limited in scope. It fixes the error \nfor disabled\n\n[[Page S386]]\n\nmilitary retirees and departed servicemembers. It is not the \ncomprehensive pension reform necessary. We will await the Presidential \ncommission which will come before the Senate, and we will be able to \nimplement and work on their recommendations in due time.\n  I encourage my Members that to vote for this bill is to support the \nfix that helps our most vulnerable patriots. It is limited in scope but \nan important downpayment to restoring full COLAS for military retirees \nof working age who are either disabled or are part of the departed \nservicemembers.\n  This agreement provides for our national security. It has $11 billion \nmore than current levels for operation and maintenance, $1 billion for \nthe National Guard and Reserve so that our units are ready for missions \noverseas and/or at home. The resources also support the Defense \nDepartment's 3 million Active-Duty, Reserve, and civilian employees. \nThis bill, if it passes, eliminates the need for civilian furloughs in \n2014, and it also prioritizes readiness.\n  The agreement funds important areas in other protections of national \nsecurity--an area I am very keenly interested in. An increasing threat \nto our people and our economy is cyber security. One need only look at \nthe headlines. From Target to Neiman Marcus, 40 million Americans or \nmore were hit by hackers whom we expect came from a non-NATO member \ncountry. There is a growing nexus between organized crime and those who \nhave other predatory intents to the United States. We have $11 billion \nin here for cyber security for the Department of Defense, the FBI, \nHomeland Security, and important research agencies.\n  This agreement also keeps its promises to veterans in terms of health \ncare, and we pay particular attention to the VA disability backlog. We \nbelieve that if you were on the frontlines over there, you shouldn't \nface a long line here when you have applied for your disability \nbenefits. Working with the relevant authorizing committee, we believe \nwe have been able to come up with it.\n  This bill also makes important investments in America's human \ninfrastructure and meets compelling human needs in health care, \neducation, and childcare. We have increased our investment in Head \nStart by $1 billion, making sure 90,000 more kids across the Nation are \npart of early childhood education programs that improve their school \nand reading and math readiness. We have also increased the childcare \ndevelopment grants by $154 million, meaning 22,000 more lower income \nfamilies will be able to afford childcare--about 24,000 children in \nMaryland alone.\n  In our committee, we believe welfare should not be a way of life but \nshould be a way to a better life. Childcare development grants enable \nwomen to move from welfare to work.\n  Also, for those who are working at a minimum wage where often full-\ntime work means full-time poverty, if you are going to work, childcare \nshould not eat up half of your already modest income. The child care \ndevelopment grant is a tool, along with the child care tax credit, to \nenable people to be able to work and make sure work is worth it.\n  We are also very conscious, on both sides of the aisle, of the need \nof Federal support for special education. We do not want a continued \nunfunded Federal mandate, where we require certain programs for special \nneeds children but do not meet the Federal responsibility for paying \nfor it. We have money in the bill for this.\n  Energy assistance and help with food and housing we have been able to \ndo here. But we believe the best social program is a job. There is no \ndoubt about it. To be able to work at a full-time job that supports a \nperson's family and let's them get on the opportunity ladder for the \nAmerican dream is what we hope to do. We believe, many of us, that with \njobs helping build America's infrastructure we meet two needs. We have \nan aging, decrepit, sometimes even dangerous infrastructure. The money \nin this bill will go to important programs such as the harbor \nmaintenance trust fund and also TIGER grants to help with \ntransportation, so we can rebuild America's infrastructure and at the \nsame time put Americans to work on rebuilding our infrastructure.\n  Also, at the same time we believe we need to look at the jobs of \ntomorrow, where we fund the kind of basic research that only government \ncan do, that leads to new ideas, that will lead to the new thinking in \nthe private sector that will create the new jobs tomorrow. That means, \nfor example, for the National Institutes of Health, we increase it $1 \nbillion. It means they will be able to do 400 additional studies. It \nwill also deal, not only with our cures for cancer but also the brain \ninitiative will help speed along finding a cure or cognitive stretchout \nfor Alzheimer's. This is good public investment.\n  When we look at Medicaid funding, a cure for Alzheimer's or cognitive \nstretchout will not only save families the awful consequences of \nAlzheimer's--my father died of that--but it will also help our budget. \nWhen we look at Medicaid, 80 percent of the beneficiaries on Medicaid \nare children, but 80 percent of the money goes to long-term care for \npeople who have either Alzheimer's or other neurological impairment \ndiseases such as Lou Gehrig's disease, Parkinson's, and so on. When we \ncan find a breakthrough on Alzheimer's, it will also help lower the \ncost of Medicaid, and we will be able to put it in other programs.\n  There is much more to be said about this bill and I will say it \nlater. I see my vice chairman is on the floor and he will want to speak \nand there are others who are also present. I will speak during the day, \nbut I want you to know I am proud of this bill. We did the job that was \ngiven us. We played the hand that was dealt us, and what we have come \nup with is a good deal for the American people. We tried to be smart \nabout where we spent the money and we tried to be very smart in how we \nsaved money.\n  I yield the floor and look forward to continued debate and passage of \nthis bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Booker). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I will join my friend and long-time \ncolleague, the senior Senator from Maryland and chair of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee Senator Barbara Mikulski, who has just spoken, \nin strongly supporting passage of the Consolidated Appropriations Act \nfor fiscal year 2014. This bill is a product of a bipartisan and very \ncollegial negotiation between both parties in both Houses of Congress. \nIt is in very large part a compromise of what the House and Senate \nproduced in their respective committee processes last summer.\n  We, of course, have our differences and each of us would like to have \nmany features in this bill different, but that is the nature of a \nnegotiation and ultimately of a compromise, and that is where we are \ntoday.\n  There is much we would like and much we do not like in this bill, but \non balance I believe it represents a middle ground upon which we can \nall comfortably stand. It is certainly far better than the alternative, \nwhich would be another confrontation, another government shutdown, and \nanother giant step further away from establishing some sense of regular \norder.\n  It is a matter of record that I did not support the Bipartisan Budget \nAct of 2013. It is and remains my strong preference that we continue to \nreduce our discretionary spending levels and, more importantly, our \nlong-term mandatory spending levels. As I have said many times, once \nthe Congress has decided what our spending levels are to be, I believe \nit is the responsibility of the respective appropriations committees to \ndecide how those funds will be spent. The bill before us does exactly \nthat.\n  This legislation adheres to the statutory budget caps for defense and \nnondefense spending set by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013. It \ncarries forward a spending level for defense programs that avoids a $20 \nbillion sequester for 2014. The bill funds total discretionary spending \nbelow the 2004 level when adjusted for inflation.\n  Enacting this funding measure will allow Congress finally to advance \nits current priorities instead of relying on the spending priorities of \nthe past, which of course is the unavoidable consequence of a \ncontinuing resolution. Seven out of twelve bills in this omnibus have \nbeen relying on appropriations priorities dictated by the fiscal year \nappropriations for 2012. Instead of giving the executive branch \nvirtually\n\n[[Page S387]]\n\nunfettered discretion, this bill includes hundreds of limits on how the \nexecutive branch can spend taxpayer dollars. It provides continuity for \nkey government functions and avoids the uncertainty of additional \ncontinuing resolutions.\n  Since the President took office, we have enacted 20 continuing \nresolutions. This bill today provides no new money to implement \nObamaCare by holding flat the funding for certain accounts at the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services and the Internal Revenue \nService. It funds the financial regulators who implement Dodd-Frank at \na level that is $424 million below the President's request.\n  We will hear many times today that this bill is not the bill any \nindividual Senator would have written, and that is true. It includes \nconcessions that many would not like to make. But it also contains \nfunding or limits on funding for priorities that are important to \nMembers of both sides of the aisle. In my view, this is the \nprerequisite for a legislative compromise and is what we have achieved \nwith this bill.\n  I again thank the chair of this committee Senator Mikulski and \ncommend her for setting a tone that made this agreement possible. I \njoin with her in strongly urging our colleagues to support this \nmeasure, just as the Members of the House did yesterday by a vote of \n359 to 67.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a \ncolloquy with my colleagues, Senator Graham, Senator Ayotte, and \nSenator Roberts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I bring to the attention of my colleagues \nthe front page of the Washington Post this morning: ``Hill balks at \nshifting CIA role in drone war.''\n\n       Congress has moved to block President Obama's plan to shift \n     control of the U.S. drone campaign from the CIA to the \n     Defense Department, inserting a secret provision in the \n     massive government spending bill introduced this week that \n     would preserve the spy agency's role in lethal \n     counterterrorism operations, U.S. officials said.\n       The measure, included in a classified annex to the $1.1 \n     trillion federal budget plan, would restrict the use of any \n     funding to transfer unmanned aircraft or the authority to \n     carry out drone strikes from the CIA to the Pentagon. . . . \n     ''\n\n  The Appropriations Committee is supposed to appropriate. The \nAppropriations Committee has no business making this decision. How many \nof my colleagues knew that this provision was in this mammoth \nappropriations bill? I bet a handful. The job of the Armed Services \nCommittee and the job of the Intelligence Committee is to authorize \nthese things. There was no hearing in the Armed Services Committee, \nthere was no hearing in the Intelligence Committee on this issue. \nInstead, a major policy decision that has to do with the ability to \ndefend this Nation against the forces of violent Islamic extremism is \nnow being decided in a secret annex of a mammoth appropriations bill.\n  It is not the first time I say that the appropriators have \nauthorized. The appropriators have gotten into the business of the \nauthorizing committees in a way that is a violation of every procedure \nand process this Senate is supposed to be pursuing.\n  I believe Senator Levin, the chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee, will be as outraged as I am. I believe the chairperson of \nthe Intelligence Committee will be as angry as I am. This is a \nfundamental function of government that has to do with national \nsecurity and it is hidden in a provision, in a secret provision of the \nmammoth appropriations bill. I say to the distinguished chairperson and \nranking member, that is not their business.\n  Some of us have been speaking out for more than a year about the \nterrorist attack of September 11, 2012, which took the lives of four \nAmerican public servants in Benghazi, Libya, including U.S. Ambassador \nChris Stevens. We have spoken out because of the many questions that \nstill remain unanswered to this day.\n  We have spoken out and will continue to speak out despite efforts of \npartisans and proxies of the administration to sweep all of this under \nthe rug. The latest snow job came in December, from the New York Times, \nthat ever-reliable surrogate of the Obama administration, which \npublished a long report challenging some key facts about the Benghazi \nattack. But as Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan used to say, everyone is \nentitled to their own opinions but not to their own facts. The facts \nare stubborn. In reality, what the Times report does is propagate \nmyths. Let's review some of the facts.\n  The Times claims the following:\n\n       Months of investigation . . . centered on interviews with \n     Libyans in Benghazi who had direct knowledge of the attack \n     there and its context, turned up no evidence that Al Qaeda or \n     other international terrorist groups had any role in the \n     assault.\n\n  The Times goes on to claim:\n\n       Benghazi was not infiltrated by Al-Qaeda. . . .\n\n  Here are the facts. Al Qaeda-affiliated groups were present in \nBenghazi, and they were involved in the attack of September 11, 2012. \nThe New York Times itself reported on October 12:\n\n       American officials said [the attack] included participants \n     from Ansar al-Shariah, Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, and \n     the Muhammad Jamal network, a militant group in Egypt.\n\n  All of these groups are affiliated with Al Qaeda. The New York Times \nclaims:\n\n       Republican arguments appear to conflate purely local \n     extremist organizations, like Ansar al-Shariah with Al \n     Qaeda's international terrorist network.\n\n  Again, here are the facts. In an interview yesterday with CNN, the \nSenator from California acknowledged correctly that Ansar al-Shariah, \nwhich played a major role in the attack, is linked to Al Qaeda. We are \ndrawing on the work of our Intelligence Committee which yesterday \nreleased its report on the Benghazi attack and its aftermath.\n  In that report you will find numerous references by the intelligence \ncommunity before the attack that make clear the nature of the Al Qaeda \nthreat in Benghazi. The claims that Al Qaeda had not infiltrated \nBenghazi rests on the same rhetorical sleight-of-hand that holds that \nwhile groups may align themselves with Al Qaeda, may seek and receive \ndirection from Al Qaeda, may share similar terrorist goals of Al Qaeda, \nand may even call themselves part of Al Qaeda, but if they are not \nsitting along the Pakistan-Afghan border or are not part of so-called \ncore Al Qaeda or Al Qaeda senior leadership, then somehow they are not \nAl Qaeda.\n  This is the same bizarre language and logic that may have led then-\nAmbassador to the United Nations Susan Rice to claim just days after \nthe attack that ``we have decimated Al Qaeda,'' this despite the fact \nthat Al Qaeda-affiliated groups are proliferating and gaining traction \nall across the Middle East and North Africa, including in Benghazi.\n  The fact is that the attack against our diplomatic facility in \nBenghazi on September 11 was carried out in part by Al Qaeda-affiliated \nterrorists who had a safe haven in parts of eastern Libya. As the \nSenate Intelligence Committee report finds, the Intelligence Committee \nprovided ample strategic warning about the negative security trends in \nBenghazi and the likelihood they would further deteriorate. This was \nthe opposite of an intelligence failure; this was clear as day.\n  Despite these clear warning signs, the State Department was \nunprepared. Our diplomatic facility in Benghazi was insecure and had \nalready been attacked multiple times. Our military was not postured and \nready to respond to contingencies in a part of Libya where attacks \nagainst westerners and western interests had already occurred and where \nthe threat of more attacks was growing.\n  The false narrative the New York Times is furthering just so happens \nto align with the Obama administration's account of events, but, again, \nfacts are stubborn, and the Senate Intelligence Committee report \nclearly supports the conclusion that the administration knew or should \nhave known of the terrorist threat in Benghazi during the relevant \nperiod and should have pre-positioned assets or made other preparations \nto better protect our people serving there.\n  The administration and its allies will continue to try to sweep \nBenghazi under the rug--including the fact that we have still not \nreceived testimony and the presence of the individuals who were present \nand moved to Germany the day following the attack on the\n\n[[Page S388]]\n\nEmbassy and the deaths of four Americans.\n  Contrary to the President's repeated claim that the tide of war is \nreceding and contrary to his administration's talking point that Al \nQaeda has been decimated, the reality is that Al Qaeda-affiliated \ngroups are emboldened now from central Asia to the Middle East and \nnorth Africa, all the way to west African countries such as Nigeria and \nMali. Indeed, nothing brings this home more tragically than watching \nthe black flags of Al Qaeda hoisted over the Iraq city of Fallujah. \nNinety-five brave soldiers and Americans died in Fallujah, 600 were \nwounded, and today we see the black flags of Al Qaeda hoisted over the \ncity of Fallujah. The problem is getting worse, and that is in large \npart due to this administration's disengagement from these regions.\n  Look at Libya today. It is a country that we and our NATO allies \nintervened to save from the wrath of an anti-American tyrant, and it is \nnow characterized by chaos, lawlessness, and ungoverned spaces that are \nexploited by those who seek to do harm to our Nation and our interests. \nAccording to the Senate Intelligence Committee's report, 15 Libyans who \ncooperated with our investigation into the Benghazi attack have been \nmurdered.\n  The administration can blame the Libyans for these problems, just as \nthey blame the Iraqis for Iraq's problems, but they can't escape their \nshare of the blame for failing to support these people who want and \nneed our help to secure their countries. That is why Chris Stevens was \nin Benghazi. That is why he risked and ultimately gave his life. He \nbelieved it was in our interest to lead events in the world and support \nour friends and those who wish to be our friends in their effort to \nbuild stable, successful societies with effective democratic \ngovernments. The greatest way we can honor his sacrifice, and those of \nhis colleagues, is by recommitting ourselves to their mission.\n  Unless America actively supports those in the broader Middle East who \nwish to replace despair and extremism with hope and freedom, I fear the \ntide of war will eventually get us again.\n  I note that my colleague the Senator from New Hampshire is on the \nfloor, and I would ask her and my colleague from South Carolina, is it \nnot true that in this Intelligence Committee report, which is very \nencompassing, except for one mention in the minority views, there is no \nindividual who is held responsible? So now we have a situation where \nbureaucracies are responsible but individuals are not. I find that \nintriguing.\n  Also, my friend from South Carolina has been trying to interview \nwitnesses for a number of months, if not years, who were at the scene \nof the attack and then moved to Germany the following day. Isn't it \ntrue that we have never been able to interview those witnesses, which \ncould have cleared up any arguments or any doubt about what the attack \nwas all about?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank my colleague for the question. I finally got to \ninterview a survivor about a month or so ago with Senators Menendez and \nCorker. I have only been able to interview one witness after all of \nthese years and months.\n  If I could, I wish to thank the Intelligence Committee for doing a \nlot of hard work, but let's not lose sight that this is not just about \nthe State Department. My focus is going to be comprehensive, and \nSenator McCain has called for a joint select committee, along with \nmyself and Senator Ayotte, for over a year now. Why? You don't want to \nstovepipe this. The Intelligence Committee tells us in pretty good \ndetail about the failures of the State Department, but here is my \nquestion: In the September 14 White House meeting where the \nIntelligence Committee prepared talking points for the White House that \nclearly established that this was a terrorist attack with Al Qaeda \npeople involved--who changed those talking points in that White House \nmeeting?\n  I have an email--which I hope will be here in a moment--from General \nPetraeus. Basically, somebody in that meeting or before the meeting is \nsaying to General Petraeus that the White House wants to take \nreferences to Al Qaeda out and basically sanitize the talking points. \nHe is upset, but he says: Well, go ahead and do what they want. Nobody \nadmires General Petraeus more than I do, but, quite frankly, somebody \nneeds to revisit that.\n  Where was the intelligence community for 2 weeks when the President \nof the United States--not Susan Rice--was telling the entire world: We \nthink this was a protest caused by a video, when the intelligence \ncommunity knew differently? To my friends in the intelligence \ncommunity, you need to answer that question. What input did you give? \nDid anybody pick up a phone and call somebody at the White House? They \nneed to tell the President to quit doing that because it is not \naccurate.\n  Another question: On September 15, 16, and 17 of September, all the \nsurvivors were interviewed by the FBI in Germany. I have talked to one \nsurvivor. I can tell you, in a quick summary, the man was brave and the \npeople on the ground in the State Department deserve medals for going \nthrough what they did. But let me tell you this: He said there was no \nprotest. There was not one report from Benghazi about a protest around \nthe Embassy.\n  The Turkish Ambassador left not too long before the attack. Do you \nthink he would have walked out in the middle of a protest? Do you think \nthe Ambassador would have gone to bed if there was a protest? The \npeople in charge of security never reported a protest because there was \nnot one, and he said there wasn't one. He said: I saw on my screen--and \nhe was in charge of security at the time--16 to 20 heavily armed \npeople running through the gate and carrying a banner in Arabic. At the \ntime, I didn't know what it said. I now know it was the banner of Ansar \nal-Sharia, the Al Qaeda affiliate.\n\n  And to my friends the New York Times, journalism has died at that \npaper. Do you really believe this wasn't a preplanned terrorist attack \nwith Al Qaeda affiliates in charge? The gentleman said there were four \ngun trucks around the compound. It was a coordinated military attack, \nand they were lucky to have survived.\n  Who started this? Who planned this? The man's name was Qumu, the \nformer Gitmo detainee. I can't say his last name, but I think it is \nQumu. The man who started Ansar al-Sharia came from Gitmo. He was a \nformer Gitmo detainee, a Libyan who went back to Libya and started this \ngroup. The ``60 Minutes'' report identified him and a Mr. Khattala as \nthe organizers of this attack. All I can say is that there is no \nmystery about who planned this. It was an Al Qaeda affiliate in Libya.\n  On August 16 a cable was sent back from Chris Stevens to Washington \nat the State Department saying: We can't defend the consulate because \n10 training camps of Al Qaeda exist in Benghazi; the Al Qaeda flag is \nflying.\n  By the way, the Red Cross had left Benghazi and the British had left \nBenghazi because of attacks by terrorist groups. This was long before \nSeptember 11.\n  Don't tell me we don't know. We do know. It was terrorists. It was a \nformer Gitmo detainee who was bin Laden's bodyguard. What did he have \nto do--have a card? The guy who was in Gitmo whom we let go was core Al \nQaeda. He was bin Laden's bodyguard. They caught him in Pakistan. He \nfought in Afghanistan.\n  Now, what we don't know from this report is who in the White House \nchanged the talking points.\n  You want to know what Chris Christie did? Fine. Absolutely fair game. \nWe know what he did when he found out what his people did about the \ntraffic jam. He fired them. He got up in front of the whole world and \nsaid: I am embarrassed. It is my fault. I am going to fire the people \nwho did this bad thing.\n  Name one person who has been held accountable for this bad thing \ncalled Benghazi. Name one person at the State Department who has been \nfired for ignoring repeated requests for additional security on the \nconsulate coming from people in Libya.\n  By the way, the Accountability Review Board--what did I learn in my \ninterview with the survivor? I found out for the first time that villas \nB and C--the places that were attacked in Benghazi, the State \nDepartment consulate--had their lease renewed in July for an entire \nyear for hundreds of thousands of dollars. I didn't know that. It was \nleased for well over half a million\n\n[[Page S389]]\n\ndollars. So you are going to tell me they were going to close the \nconsulate in December? That was the conclusion of the Accountability \nReview Board. That is not accurate.\n  I will tell you what I think they were going to do. I think Hillary \nClinton was going to go down in December and announce that the \npermanent facility would be open in Benghazi.\n  To Hillary Clinton's and Susan Rice's credit, these two women pushed \nthe President to keep Benghazi from being overrun during the war with \nQadhafi. They got involved, and to their credit they pushed the \nPresident to get involved militarily to prevent the slaughter of \neverybody in Benghazi.\n  I have been told that the plan for Benghazi was to have a permanent \nfootprint and for Secretary Clinton to go down there as one of her last \nacts to say: We are here, and we are here to stay. The problem with \nthat scenario is that the security had deteriorated because we had \nabsolutely no plan to fall on after the fall of Qadhafi.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I think a lot of people who are observers really have to \nview this and the actions on the part of the administration--the \nstatement by now-National Security Adviser Susan Rice on every Sunday \ntalk show was that this was the result of a hateful video, a \nspontaneous demonstration, and that Al Qaeda has been decimated. We can \nonly view that and some of these actions in the context of the fact \nthat it was a political campaign. There was a Presidential campaign \ngoing on, and the rhetoric time after time and rally after rally from \nthe President of the United States and his surrogates was this: Bin \nLaden is dead. Al Qaeda is on the run. The tide of war is receding.\n  All of these events that took place at the consulate in Benghazi and \nthe death of Christopher Stevens contradicted that storyline. Still, I \ncannot understand why 2 weeks later the President of the United States \nwas before the United Nations and still talking about how this was due \nto a spontaneous demonstration and hateful video. You can only \nunderstand that, in my view, it was in the context of a storyline that \nwas propagated throughout the 2012 Presidential campaign.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I think the White House, in my view--this is a reasonable \nconclusion but not a fair conclusion because we don't know exactly what \nhappened yet. But I can tell you this: Somebody at the White House on \nSeptember 14 pressured the intelligence community to change the story \nof Benghazi. And on September 15, why did they pick Susan Rice? She \nsaid that Secretary Clinton was tired and had gone through a lot of \ntrauma. I am sure that is true, but I know Secretary Clinton pretty \nwell. I think she is tough.\n  Let's put it this way: She could not be on TV to talk about what \nhappened at the State Department because she was distraught? I don't \nbuy that. Does anybody believe that about Secretary Clinton? And if it \nis true, it is something the American people need to consider. I don't \nbelieve it is true. I don't believe she was incapable of going on \ntelevision, as Susan Rice says. I believe they picked a person very \nloyal to the President who would say whatever needed to be said. What \nshe said was so far away from the truth that it needs to be \ninvestigated. What she said was so beneficial to the President's \nreelection that it needs to be investigated.\n  She was speaking definitively about Benghazi on September 15 while \nthe FBI was interviewing survivors on the 15th, 16th, and the 17th. Why \nwould any administration go on national television and tell the world \nwhat happened in Benghazi while the FBI is still interviewing people \nwho were in the attack? And where did the FBI's interviews go?\n\n  I talked to the Deputy Director of the FBI who is now retired. He \nsaid not one person interviewed by the FBI in Germany ever said there \nwas a protest; all of them said it was a terrorist attack. So how could \nthe FBI have interviews from every person on the ground in Benghazi who \nworked for the State Department saying that there was no protest and it \nwas a terrorist attack, and that not get into the system? Did the FBI \njust sit on these interviews? Who did they give those interviews to? \nHow could Susan Rice tell the American people and the world we know \nwhat happened in Benghazi before the interviews were over? She went on \ntelevision to spin this story. How could the President of the United \nStates, after the interviews were taken, go before the American people \ntime and time again for weeks and tell a story about a protest that \nnever occurred? This may not be a big deal to my colleagues, but it is \na hell of a big deal to me.\n  When Abu Ghraib blew up, Senator McCain and myself said: This is not \na few rotten apples; this is system failure. Before the surge, when \nIraq was falling apart, we said: This is not working, no matter what \npeople in the Bush administration are telling us. We know better. We \nhave been there. When Gitmo was a mess, we didn't sweep it under the \nrug. We worked with Senator Levin and Senator Feinstein, two great \nAmericans, to get the definitive truth as best we could about failures \nat Abu Ghraib, about Gitmo, and we spoke truth to power when it came to \nIraq.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Regarding Iraq, we called for the resignation of the \nSecretary of Defense because of the failures in Iraq.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes, we did.\n  Now here we are, years later, and the families have no clue as to \nwhat happened to their loved ones. Quit blaming the dead guy. This \nsuggestion that Chris Stevens had fault for his own death--Chris \nStevens was in Benghazi because that is where he was supposed to be \ndoing what America wanted him to do: Try to hold Libya together. So \nthere is not going to be any blame on the dead guy.\n  I wish to ask a question of Senator Ayotte. The Senator from New \nHampshire has followed this as well as anybody. Can the Senator \ndescribe for us from her point of view the unanswered questions and \nwhether she thinks there is evidence that this was a preplanned \nterrorist attack versus a protest?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I wish to thank my colleagues, the Senator from South \nCarolina and the Senator from Arizona, who have been relentless in \nfinding the truth about what happened in Benghazi where our ambassador \nand three brave Americans were murdered.\n  There are so many questions, but I would start with the \naccountability question the Senator from South Carolina raised. No one \nhas been held accountable. Who has been held accountable for the \nfailures?\n  If we look at this intel report, it is very clear the intelligence \ncommunity, according to this report, provided ample strategic warning \nthat our people in Benghazi were at risk. There were failures, and no \none has been held accountable. Why?\n  As I look at these talking points, the question was raised: Why was \nthe reference to Al Qaeda removed from the talking points? Who did that \nin the context of a Presidential campaign? But also, take a look at \nthese talking points. There is no reference in these talking points to \na video. Look at the actual language of the talking points.\n  Why is it that the spokesman for the President, on September 13, is \nout there saying that this is a reaction to this movie? Why is it that \nSusan Rice, the Ambassador, is on television on multiple shows blaming \nthe video? Not only was it absolutely wrong when she said Al Qaeda was \ndecimated--and it was misleading, particularly the fact that Al Qaeda \nhad been removed from the talking points, but there is no reference in \nthe talking points to a video. So who in the administration made up the \nvideo story?\n  That is important for the American people to know because it wasn't \njust Ambassador Susan Rice who relied on the video story. It was our \nPresident of the United States who talked about the video and talked \nabout it, frankly, after the Ambassador went on all of the Sunday shows \non September 16. In fact, the President said as late as September 18 \nwhen asked--basically, he talked about the video and said: You had a \nvideo that was released by somebody who lives here, sort of a shadowy \ncharacter--here is what happened--who had made an extremely offensive \ncomment. So we have the President of the United States, as late as \nSeptember 18, and then again on September 20--we have the President \nsaying on Univision Network, responding to the possible involvement of \nAl Qaeda: Is Al Qaeda involved? Here is what we do know: That the \nnatural protest that arose because of the outrage from the video were \nused by the extremists to see if they could harm U.S. interests.\n  Where did the video come from? Even what the intelligence community \ncame\n\n[[Page S390]]\n\nup with, which was deficient and which was clearly subject to political \ninfluence because it removed the reference to Al Qaeda, has no \nreference to a video. So I think there are a lot of questions that need \nto be answered.\n  Here is the most important question: Why has no one been brought to \njustice? The President, I believe it was on September 12, said: We will \nfind out who did this, and we will bring them to justice. For those \nfamilies, those victims, no one has been brought to justice. In fact, \nwe have people such as Abu Khattala, who was a former commander of \nAnsar al-Shariah, who is believed to have been there that night sitting \nin cafes in Libya giving press interviews, and yet there is much \nevidence to suggest that he is likely to be involved in this, and many \nother terrorists, but no one has been brought to justice. So why is \nthat? Why doesn't anyone have the curiosity not only to answer the \nquestions of what happened that night but also to ensure that justice \nis done?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. If the Senator will yield, I am trying to find the press \nstatement of the White House official that says the President has \nconsulted with his national security team--I am paraphrasing--about the \nthreats we face throughout the world and that we are ready. This is on \nSeptember 10. What does this report tell us about September 11? We were \nso far away from being ready that it is unnerving. So there is a lot to \nbe asked. Why would somebody in the White House issue a statement on 10 \nSeptember talking about being ready for any contingency anywhere and \nbasically assuring the American people the President is on top of this \nwhen, clearly, he was not?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Another question for my colleagues: The attack went on \nfor a period of some nine hours, as I recall. Over that period of time, \nwith the hundreds of airplanes, aircraft that we have and the ships and \nother military capabilities we have in the area, in the Mediterranean, \nwe were not able to get any real significant help. There are a number \nof accounts of where a team supposedly landed, were held at the \nairport, were not allowed to move in, and all of that. All of these are \nquestions that have not been answered.\n  General Ham told the Senator from South Carolina and me over the \nphone that he didn't have any assets that were capable of reaching \nBenghazi. Does he mean we don't have the capability over an 8- or 9-\nhour period to get some relief to an ongoing attack? Again, what was \nthe hangup that kept people at the airport who finally did get there?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. If I could follow along with that thought, because it is \na very good question, No. 1, if the Secretary of Defense and the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff publicly testified they knew it \nwas a terrorist attack from the moment it started and told the White \nHouse, how did that get lost? How can they start talking about a \nprotest and video when our own Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff in real time tell the White House, but they \nonly spoke to the President once with a prescheduled meeting just when \nthe attack started? The Secretary of Defense----\n  Mr. McCAIN. We still don't know what the President did that evening.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. We know he has answered one question. He said he wanted \nto be transparent and open and let everybody read the story of \nBenghazi. We have deployed a small force asking questions, and the \nanswer to one question, finally: Did you call anybody in Libya, Mr. \nPresident, that night? No. We have a rescue team held up at the \nBenghazi Airport for 2\\1/2\\ hours.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. May I also add to that the President--we heard testimony \nthat obviously the Secretary of Defense and others knew right away this \nwas a terrorist attack. Let's not forget the 16-minute interview where \nhe is asked about that on September 12, and he said it is too early to \ntell exactly how this came about. When he is asked directly if this is \na terrorist attack, he would not identify it as a terrorist attack.\n  I will also add this. What is so sad about this is no one has been \nheld accountable. The warnings were there. Not only were the warnings \nthere from the August 16 cable that came from the embassy, from \nAmbassador Stevens, saying that the consulate could not withstand a \ncoordinated attack, but what has been lost in all of this? When we talk \nabout the New York Times trying to erase Al Qaeda from this, the day \nbefore, Ayman al-Zawahiri, the head of Al Qaeda, released a video just \nbefore September 11, 2012, just before this terrorist attack--which, by \nthe way, occurred on September 11, of course, which should have given \nus a pretty direct clue that this was a terrorist attack. But al-\nZawahiri issued this video acknowledging and eulogizing the death of \nAbu Yahya al-Libi in a drone strike and calling for terrorist attacks. \nAl-Libi was a Libyan who served as the second in command in Al Qaeda \nunder Zawahiri and was a top leader in the Libyan Islamic fighting \ngroup.\n  Think about the evidence that was there before, not only what we \ndidn't do to protect that consulate but the warnings that a terrorist \nattack was coming.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. If I may, who was the person who decided to approve a \nyear's lease on this piece of property in July after it had been \nattacked in June? They blew a hole in the wall that 40 people could go \nthrough on June 10. So somebody said: Hey, this is a great site; let's \nextend the lease for another year, to July 2013. They never reinforced \nit, never added any appreciable security, and denied all the security \nrequests. This goes on and on.\n  If we want to know about the bridge, that is great. If we want to \nknow about what Chris Christie knew when and what he should have known, \ngreat, go for it. All fair. Does anybody care about what our President \ndid that night? Does anybody really care if the President of the United \nStates, for two weeks, talks about a protest that never happened, while \nall of the evidence suggests otherwise? Does anybody really care that \nthe consulate was a death trap and nobody in Washington ever responded? \nDoes anybody care that nobody has been brought to justice? Does anybody \nin this country care that somebody in the White House, on September 14, \nobviously for political reasons, took the intelligence and turned it \nupside down? Does anybody care that Susan Rice, who has nothing to do \nwith Benghazi, was the spokesman for the country, telling a story not \nfounded in fact, founded in political advantage? I think Americans do \ncare.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Let me ask the Senator from South Carolina this. Does \nanyone care that the Secretary of State claimed she knew nothing about \nthis August 16 cable? She didn't know about these cables leading up to \nwhat had happened in Benghazi, about the warning the Red Cross left and \nthe French left, the hole blown through the consulate, and the August \n16 cable. Yet Secretary Panetta was aware of it. Chairman Dempsey was \naware of it when he came before the Armed Services Committee, but the \nSecretary of State wasn't aware of it.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. How can the Secretary of Defense know about the security \nenvironment in the Benghazi Consulate and the Secretary of State not \nknow? All I can say is it does matter.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The fact is no one, no one to this day has been held \nresponsible for the tragic deaths of four brave Americans--no one. The \nIntelligence Committee report I appreciate. The whole bureaucracy is \nresponsible. Individuals are the ones that run bureaucracies.\n  I am disappointed that the Intelligence Committee did not have the \ncourage to name the names of the people responsible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, let me first thank Senator \nShelby and Senator Mikulski for their very hard work on this Omnibus \nappropriations bill. That is what I am down here to speak on. The \nAmerican people sent us to make choices, sometimes very tough choices. \nThey do not expect perfection, but they do expect us to be fair and to \nget the job done.\n  Americans are tired of shutdowns and sequestration and stopgap \nfunding. Today we are making decisions we were sent here to make. The \nannual appropriations process is the right way to do the people's \nbusiness. Instead of kicking the can and passing the buck, lurching \nfrom crisis to crisis, I think we are making some significant progress.\n\n[[Page S391]]\n\n  This was my first year on the Appropriations Committee. I especially \nwanted to thank Chairman Mikulski for her leadership, her unfailing \nsupport, and for doing such an amazing job. She once said, ``It is not \nhow long I serve but how well I serve.'' Senator Mikulski has proven \nonce again on both counts she is truly exceptional.\n  This bill returns some sanity to the budget process in Washington. I \nam pleased that for the most part it does well by New Mexico. New \nMexico plays a unique role in our Nation's national security. This bill \nprovides strong funding levels for the safety and security of our \nNation's nuclear deterrent, including the important B61 project at \nSandia National Labs. The President's request of $537 million is fully \nfunded. The highly qualified employees at Sandia will continue their \nvital mission making sure these weapons are managed safely and \nsecurely. This is not something we should shortchange.\n  This bill also provides equally important funding for Los Alamos \nNational Laboratory in northern New Mexico. The workforce there has \nbeen reduced in recent years. This bill will stabilize things for 2014. \nBoth of these labs are critical for nuclear security. But they are much \nmore than that. They are also engines for the innovation in aerospace, \nbiotech, cyber security, and new energy technology.\n  New Mexico is proud to host both of these labs. But the Department of \nEnergy also has an obligation to our State and other States on legacy \ncleanup. The funding levels do not fully meet our request, but they do \nprovide strong increases over 2013 for cleanup at Los Alamos and at the \nWaste Isolation Pilot Plant in Carlsbad, NM. These cleanup activities \nare a serious obligation of the Federal Government and are a source of \nskilled, well-paid jobs for man New Mexico families.\n  New Mexico is also home to three Air Force bases and the Army's White \nSands Missile Range. This bill contains nearly $150 million in \nconstruction and infrastructure projects, including $60 million for a \nTRICARE facility at Holloman Air Force Base. These projects will \nbenefit national security, they will create jobs, and will meet our \nobligations to the men and women who are serving their country.\n  The Federal Government also plays a very important role in New \nMexico's water infrastructure. We are an arid, Western State. Prudent \nwater management is crucial for our economy. We cannot afford the waste \nthat comes from neglected infrastructure. This bill contains over $120 \nmillion in funding for Federal water assets in our State and includes \nthe Navajo-Gallup pipeline, and the Middle Rio Grande Project.\n  We have been struggling with intense drought. Rural areas and small \ntowns in particular have been deeply affected. Some small communities \nare seeing their wells run dry. They need help and they need it now. \nThe $1.7 billion in USDA rural development water funding is absolutely \nessential. This historic drought requires that we rethink how we use \nwater throughout the West. We need to be smart about our strategy. We \nneed strategies that work for individual communities. That is why I \nadvocated for greater funding for the WaterSMART grants, helping local \ngovernments and water districts improve water efficiency.\n  The conference report promotes an innovative drought water-sharing \narrangement along the Rio Grande, where we are facing difficult \ntradeoffs between agriculture, the environment, and urban uses.\n  This bill also helps meet our obligations to our Nation's veterans. \nThe backlog at the VA is unacceptable. Frankly, it is an outrage. No \nveteran should wait 1 year or more on their claim. This bill funds a \n10-part plan to resolve this problem: improving IT infrastructure, \nbetter training, and hiring additional personnel. We dedicated $250 \nmillion specifically to carry out the VA's rural health initiative to \nensure that veterans in rural and remote areas are not left behind, \nutilizing telehealth solutions and mobile clinics, bringing veterans \nthe care they deserve without long drives.\n  I will keep fighting for veterans in New Mexico, including those in \nrural areas, making sure they have access to the health care they have \nearned. Many veterans are understandably upset with the recent change \nin the COLA for working-age military retirees. I am outraged too. This \ncut was included in the recent 2-year budget agreement passed in \nDecember. I did not support this provision and I am working hard to \nrepeal it. Thankfully, this bill ensures disabled veterans and spousal \nbenefits will not be subject to the cuts. Congress has the rest of 2014 \nto do the right thing. We need to fix this mistake for good for all \nveterans.\n  This year, I have had the privilege to chair the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Financial Services and General Government. I am proud \nof the work we have done to safeguard our financial system, protect \nconsumers and support job creation and to strengthen our Federal \ncourts.\n  The bill provides $112 million for the Financial Crimes Enforcement \nNetwork, fighting terrorist financing, money laundering, narcotics \ntrafficking, and other illicit financial activity.\n  To protect the public and consumers, the bill fully funds three key \nagencies. For the CPSC, $118 million to help protect the public against \nrisk from injury of consumer products; for the FTC, $298 million to \ncombat consumer fraud, fight identity theft, and promote consumer \nprivacy; for the FCC, $340 million to maintain robust networks for \nemergency communications, political debate, social interaction, and \nbusiness transactions.\n  To support job creation, the bill provides $929 million for the Small \nBusiness Administration. It also supports the Small Business \nDevelopment Centers to provide critical guidance to small businesses \nand emerging entrepreneurs. The bill supports community development in \nunderserved areas, including tribal nations, providing $226 million for \nthe CDFI Fund.\n\n  For the Federal courts, the bill provides a much needed increase, \n$6.5 billion in discretionary funding, 5 percent above the fiscal year \nlevel of 2013. Budget cuts have forced the courts to downsize and \nfurlough staff. This bill provides the judiciary the staffing and \nresources it needs for court offices, probation, pretrial services, and \nin particular Federal defender offices will be adequately staffed.\n  The bill also calls for significant investments in the government's \ncapital projects. For the first time in 3 years, it provides the \nGeneral Services Administration a total of $1.653 billion for \nconstruction and repair of Federal buildings and courthouses. I would \nlike to thank my ranking member Senator Johanns for his effort this \nyear. He was friendly, honest, and straightforward. It has been a real \nprivilege to work with him.\n  Finally, I must thank our subcommittee staff, Marianne Upton, Diana \nHamilton, Emily Sharp. Like all the committee staff, they have spent \ntime over the holidays, on weekends, and uncounted long hours to help \ncomplete the final bill.\n  In closing, I am very happy to be here talking about the good work of \nthe Appropriations Committee and that good work that has been produced \nin this bill that is before us for New Mexico and for the Nation.\n  But I must mention one problem that remains. It is a great concern \nfor many of us from the West. Funding for the Payment in Lieu of Taxes \nProgram, known as PILT, has expired. These funds compensate counties in \nNew Mexico and throughout the country where the Federal Government owns \na good deal of land, land that cannot be taxed, cannot be developed, \ncannot be used to help pay for services such as roads and schools and \npublic health and public safety.\n  PILT is a lifeline to my constituents in many rural communities in \nNew Mexico. I joined with my friend Senator Enzi of Wyoming urging that \nthis crucial funding be included in this bill. Unfortunately, it was \nnot. I realize PILT has not been in the appropriations bill for several \nyears. In fact, it is preferable for it to receive mandatory, long-term \nfunding. But we must find a solution and we must find that solution \nsoon. I am calling for PILT to be included in the upcoming farm bill \nconference report.\n  It is a commonsense solution to this very real problem. PILT is a \nlong-term funding program. Our rural communities across the West need \nconsistency. They need to be able to plan for long-term projects. \nMandatory long-term funding is the only real solution.\n\n[[Page S392]]\n\nI hope my colleagues will work with me.\n  With that, I would urge all of my colleagues to vote yes on the \nOmnibus appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, if I might respond to the very generous \ncomments of the Senator from New Mexico about the work of the \ncommittee, I would also like to respond to his comments about PILT. The \nSenator from New Mexico has spoken very eloquently, as have other \nSenators from the West, about the need for this Payment in Lieu of \nTaxes.\n  The Presiding Officer is a newcomer. I am sure he finds that we speak \na different language and our constituents say: We use TILT and PILT. \nThey wonder if we are tilting in the right direction. But to use plain \nEnglish and plain needs of States that have a large amount of land that \nis held by the Federal Government, PILT stands for Payment in Lieu of \nTaxes.\n  So there is tremendous land owned by the Federal Government in New \nMexico; am I correct?\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. The Senator is absolutely correct. In some \nof our counties, 70 percent of the land in the county is Federal \nGovernment land. So what happens, as the chair pointed out, is the \nFederal Government says because that cannot be developed and it cannot \nbe taxed, we are going to pay you in lieu of taxes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. But they have not been paying?\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. No. The program which has been in place a \nvery long time has expired. We have run out of money. These counties \nneed to be able to plan for their projects. So that is where we are.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I think this is an issue of fairness and justice. I \nknow the Presiding Officer comes to the Senate as a mayor. I came \nthrough the route of starting on the city council. We are local \ngovernment people. We know how we had to struggle with unfunded \nmandates. Many of us have large Federal institutions in our State that \nwe love, such as the U.S. Naval Academy in my district.\n  That does not pay taxes, but, my gosh, we are happy to have them. I \nthink we have to resolve this PILT issue. I would say to the Senator \nfrom New Mexico, who has spoken to me frequently about this issue, and \nto all of the Senators from the West on both sides of the aisle: Let's \nwork on this.\n  I pledge to you that as we move on fiscal year 2015, if it is \nappropriate to be in appropriations, we will be doing it. But I will \nalso work with other relevant authorizing committees. We have to crack \nthis problem. It has been languishing far too long. I think it is a \njustice issue, that if the Federal Government owns land on which it \ndoesn't pay taxes, prohibits it then from being placed in other \ndevelopmental use that could be taxed, we have to in some way pay our \nfair share.\n  Isn't that the Senator's perspective?\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. That is exactly my perspective. In these \ncounties, the programs run out. The counties have planned on this money \nbecause they have been getting it year after year, and we have to find \na way to do this.\n  I wish to applaud Chairwoman Mikulski. They are our people, as the \nSenator knows--there are Western Senators, Democrats, Republicans, and \nthey have all talked with the chairwoman. We have been talking to the \nauthorizing committees. We have talked to Senator Stabenow in \nAgriculture in terms of the farm bill. We think there is a way this can \nbe worked out.\n  I am very encouraged to hear that the chairwoman also believes it can \nbe worked out, is willing to look at this next year in the \nappropriations process, and work with the authorizers to see this gets \ndone.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. As the Senator's colleague and also someone who comes \nout of local government who knows the challenges local governments \nface, we have worked on this, again, on a bipartisan basis.\n  I have spoken to Senator Stabenow and believe she is willing to \nproceed on how we could do this as well.\n  I thank the Senator for his comments. I think we have a path forward \nto talk with Senator Stabenow, with others who are involved in the farm \nbill, and to move forward, and yet move forward on this bill and lay \nthe groundwork for 2015 so we don't have this recurring problem.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I wish to tell the Senator how much all of \nthe Senators on this issue appreciate the chairwoman's hard work. I \nthink we need to stay focused. What happens with these counties is they \nwish to know early on whether the money is coming and how much. If they \ndon't know, they aren't able to spend it wisely.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. If I could respond to the Senator.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Please.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Municipal government is usually in a different fiscal \nyear. Baltimore City Council began January 1, the Federal Government, \nof course, is October 1, and we are finally getting settled on January \n16. We are a little behind the schedule, but we are not behind the \neight ball. We are going to work on this.\n  I thank the Senator for his work, along with Senator Johanns, a \nformer Agriculture Secretary and Governor, I might add, and the way the \nSenator worked on the Subcommittee on Financial Services.\n  The Presiding Officer, a Senator from New Jersey, took the seat of \nthe late and beloved Senator Frank Lautenberg, and Senator Udall took \nSenator Lautenberg's seat as the chair of the Financial Services \nSubcommittee. Senator Lautenberg would be very pleased to see this \ntoday. Although he would want to be here, the fact that the two \nSenators are in the Senate is very good.\n  Senator Udall essentially had a battlefield promotion. The Senator \nproceeded with such diligence and had constantly in his mind the \nmission of the agencies, enormous controversy at IRS, and had to step \ninto some very complicated issues. The Senator's faithfulness to duty, \nthe way he went about it with such diligence and verve, is indeed to be \ncommended. I know Senator Lautenberg would believe that his gavel \npassed into very competent hands. We thank the Senator. We also wish to \nthank Senator Johanns because he helped to carry the momentum.\n  This is the way the Senate ought to be. Even in a time of great \nsadness we were able to do our job.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Unemployment Benefits\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. As the chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee \nleaves, I thank the Senator for her tremendous leadership. I thank the \nSenator for her leadership in getting this bill to the floor.\n  I come to the floor today to talk about another topic, and that is \nthe 1.4 million Americans who have lost their unemployment benefits and \nthe over 70,000 people who continue to lose them each week. The Senate \nhas found itself in an all-too-familiar place. Once again, some \nRepublicans are refusing to be able to say yes even to the most \nreasonable of offers, and it is a problem we have seen in this body too \nmany times.\n  Over the course of the 16-day shutdown last October, we tried time \nand time again to find compromises to end that manufactured crisis, \nreturn Federal workers to their jobs, and reopen our Federal parks and \nbuildings. But for too long Republicans refused to listen to the \nAmerican people and embrace compromise. Instead, they were standing \nfirmly in a partisan corner--and it is a pattern of what we saw last \nyear in our efforts to pass a budget.\n  In March of the past year--as every Senator, I am sure, will \nremember--we spent a week on the Senate floor in a very open process \ndebating and voting on amendment after amendment until the very wee \nhours of the morning. On March 23 we finally passed our budget after \nthe House had passed theirs the\n\n[[Page S393]]\n\nday earlier. I thought at that time the next step would be to start a \nconference as quickly as possible. I thought it was a no-brainer.\n  This is what the American people were expecting, the two sides to get \nin a room, work out our differences, and avoid another crisis. Every \ntime we tried to start that budget conference--21 times in the Senate--\na Senate Republican stood up and said no. They no longer wanted to go \nto conference, they no longer wanted to follow regular order, they only \nwanted to obstruct. That took us to a government shutdown, a debt limit \ncrisis, and a lot of pain for families and communities across the \ncountry before we could get them in a room with us in a budget \nconference and agree to a deal the American people expected.\n  That has been sort of the Republican playbook in the Senate. They say \nno for as long as they can, they play politics for as long as they can, \nthey hold out and obstruct as long as they can, until the pressure from \nangry Americans finally reaches a fever pitch, and then, when it is far \ntoo late, hopefully come to their senses.\n  It is getting to be far too late for every single American who lost \ntheir unemployment benefits. In fact, as last week's unemployment \nreport showed, nearly \\1/2\\ million Americans recently gave up \nentirely. Those who haven't given up spent every single day desperately \nworking to get on a job. Unemployment benefits make all the difference \nfor them and their families while they scour the want ads, pound the \npavement, and send out resume after resume.\n  In fact, I have heard from many people in my home State of \nWashington, story after story from men and women. One of those was from \na man named Gary who lives in Spokane. Gary wrote to me about his wife \nLinda and how at ``56 years young'' with a degree in accounting and an \nMBA in finance Linda is still unable to find work. After exhausting her \nunemployment benefits, Gary and Linda are now forced to live off of his \nSocial Security disability insurance. They are now facing monthly \nmedical expenses and rent of over $1,000 just to stay healthy and keep \na roof over their heads. Gary's benefits cover about $900 of those \nexpenses.\n  With each passing day this Congress fails to act Gary and Linda find \nthemselves further and further behind. Gary concluded in his note to me \nin a simple plea, written in all capital letters, that said: ``PLEASE, \nPLEASE, PLEASE HELP!''\n  I also recently heard from a woman who was laid off from her job at a \nplant in Keyport, WA.\n  She said:\n\n       This year, I have applied for over 200 jobs and, in spite \n     of a stellar resume, have only gotten 4 phone interviews.\n       I have lowered my standards throughout the year and applied \n     for jobs far below my pay grade to no avail . . . my husband \n     and I have had to claim bankruptcy . . . [and] I truly worry \n     about losing my home and displacing my children.\n\n  These are real people, as the Presiding Officer well knows.\n  I have heard from Traci, a former executive assistant with 20 years \nof experience, in Everett, WA. After taking time off from work because \nshe had to care for her dying mother and a daughter who was suffering \nfrom bipolar disorder and drug addiction, Traci found herself without a \njob.\n\n  After her mother passed away, Traci fell ill, and it made it very \nhard for her to look for work. While Traci was receiving unemployment \nbenefits that were barely enough to cover the care her daughter \nrequired, she was just barely making it. She told me that now she \ncannot afford food and has lost over 50 pounds. She spends every day \nsearching high and low for one break. She said: ``I just need time for \nsomeone to give me a chance.''\n  A chance. That is all she is asking us for. That is all they are \nasking, all of these people. They don't want a handout, they don't want \nto be a burden. They need support while they get back on their feet and \non the job.\n  We in the Senate need Republican support to do that. We are ready and \nwilling to move forward. We have worked to find compromise. When \nRepublicans wanted this extension to be paid for, even though it has \nbeen extended time and time again without pay-fors under Republican \nCongresses and Republican Presidents, we said OK, we will try and find \nthat.\n  That wasn't enough. When Republicans signaled that they didn't want \nto pay for an extension by closing tax loopholes for the wealthiest \nAmericans, we again looked to find a compromise.\n  When we put forward savings from policies that have either been \nagreed to by both sides or have been taken from proposals championed by \nRepublicans, they once again said it wasn't good enough.\n  When they asked for amendments, we offered amendments. They again \nsaid no.\n  Unfortunately, Republicans have now reverted once again to pure \npolitics aimed not at the vast majority of American people who want to \nsee this extended, but instead squarely at their most conservative \naudience possible. Nowhere is that more evident than in the pay-fors \nthey have offered--whether it is the minority leader's amendment that \npredictably seeks to undercut health care reform or the Ayotte \namendment, which is a very disturbing signal in that after joining us \nin passing comprehensive immigration legislation, Republicans are now \ndoing a complete 180 on immigration in an election year. With that \namendment, Senate Republicans are indicating that they are actually \ngoing to begin targeting U.S. citizens, children who are U.S. citizens, \nsimply because they were born to undocumented workers. I think that is \nshameful, and I am shocked that we have reached this point.\n  These policies aren't going anywhere. Republicans know that. In the \nend, all they amount to is nothing more than delaying tactics while \nAmerican families' lives are hanging in the balance.\n  Make no mistake, families across the country are teetering on the \nbrink today. In fact, nowhere is that more clear than the last \nheartbreaking story I came to the floor to share with you. I received \nthis yesterday from a woman named Shiela, who for the last 13 years has \nworked a middle-management job at a national corporation in my State. \nShe started her letter by saying: ``I've never written to any \ngovernment official, but I'm compelled to do so today.''\n  Then she told me how she, her husband, and two children had lived a \nfairly comfortable life, but all of that changed last year when her \nemployer decided to downsize, and she was one of the many Americans who \nwas laid off.\n  Her husband, who works in real estate, was struggling in a very weak \nmarket, as we all know. Suddenly, Shiela's family of four found \nthemselves relying on just over $500 a week in unemployment assistance.\n  Having graduated from college and business school, Sheila--like so \nmany others--found herself in need of these benefits, and she said \nnever in a million years did she think she would be in that spot.\n  These are her words:\n\n       I've worked for so many years, paid my taxes, did the right \n     thing for others . . . and now I need help.\n\n  In October, Sheila's family lost their house. They are now renting. \nThey do not know if their daughter will still qualify for the student \nloans she is currently receiving. Sheila's checking account is now \noverdrawn. Her car payments are past due. She started getting notices \nfrom her utility companies. And as my staff talked with her yesterday, \nshe said she was headed out the door to apply for food stamps.\n  Because of the Republicans' refusal to work with us, we will once \nagain be going home to constituents such as Sheila to explain why this \nextension hasn't gotten done. I know I will be pointing out the fact \nthat we have compromised time and time again to try to get something \ndone here; that we have all but begged Republicans from the start to \nwork with us on this effort, but I can't help but wonder how \nRepublicans are going to explain their actions.\n  While I normally don't come to the floor to give advice to my friends \non the other side of the aisle, I would certainly like to suggest they \ndo not stare into the eyes of someone who just had to apply for food \nstamps for the very first time in their life and explain that they \ncan't act until ObamaCare is destroyed. And I hope they do not tell \nthose who are about to lose their home they can't help them until they \nfind a way to cut childcare credits for U.S. children. And I hope they \ndo not tell Americans who spend their days working hard and applying \nfor jobs that pay a fraction of what they have been making they will \nonly be willing to help\n\n[[Page S394]]\n\nthem if all of their political demands are met. And I especially hope \nthey do not think making arguments about procedure or amendments or \narcane rules of the Senate that only people here in DC pay attention to \nis an excuse for walking away from 1.4 million Americans at a time when \nall they want to see is results.\n  What I do hope is that the experiences they have coming face-to-face \nwith these families will change their tone when they come back here in \na week. I hope the stories, such as the ones I shared here today, will \nonce again be the pressure that Republicans have required over and over \nto finally act. And I hope that soon they will join us in passing our \nnonpartisan, commonsense bill and finally delivering some certainty and \nsome security for struggling Americans who deserve it.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Yes, I will.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. First, I thank the Senator for the work she did in the \nBudget Committee, because that budget she worked so diligently on on a \nbipartisan basis with Paul Ryan has enabled us to have the allocation \nfor discretionary spending that has enabled our coming here today to \nmake sure the government will function, that it will work as hard as \nthe taxpayers who pay for it, and that we will have no government \nshutdown and no crisis environment. So I really want to thank the \nSenator for that.\n  The question I have for the Senator is in regard to her role as the \nchair of the Subcommittee on Transportation and Housing, Urban \nDevelopment, and Related Agencies. Has the Senator had a chance to look \nat what she thinks will be the positive job impact of what she has been \nable to do? Because the Senator funds transportation for the United \nStates. There are TIGER grants that are so important to Maryland and \nthe Port of Baltimore, and also the issues related to housing. In my \nown hometown the renovation of housing for the elderly--most of it \nbuilt in the 1970s and 1980s under Carter and Reagan--needs to be \nrehabilitated. They need to be reformed so they meet new ADA standards, \nall of which would put men and women to work where, in my State, the \njob rate among construction workers is enormously high. So building \nbridges and building homes would sure go a long way. Has the Senator \nhad a chance to look at any of that?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Let me respond to the chairwoman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, Mr. President.\n  I came to the floor today to talk about the millions of Americans who \nare in need of extended unemployment benefits, but I would tell my \ncolleague that everyone I have ever talked to on unemployment would \nmuch rather have a job. As to the question the Senator has asked me in \nrelation to my role as chair of the subcommittee on transportation and \nhousing and the bill we are about to pass here in the Senate, it will \nhave an impact on creating jobs and building that infrastructure so \npeople will have that job certainty. It is extremely important.\n  On the transportation side of my appropriations bill, the TIGER grant \nprogram the Senator has described will bring not only jobs to \ncommunities but real projects that will help build a foundation for \nfuture economic growth.\n  There is no one who questions that transportation infrastructure \nbrings jobs today, provides economic development for the future, and is \nabsolutely the way people get to work and home in a timely manner, \nbringing certainty for so many families we know. That is a critical \npart of my subcommittee.\n  The other part of my subcommittee, as the Senator mentioned, is \nhousing. Those issues are so important. I think most people forget if \nyou don't have a place to live it is pretty hard to go to work. \nProviding some of these programs we do, such as section 8, and some of \nthe reforms we have put in here, is absolutely critical for so many \nAmericans to be able to have the stability and to get out and get a \njob, so that we don't have to be arguing over unemployment extension \nhere but actually how we can make the investments so this country can \nwork and survive.\n  I hope we can provide those extensions today, as we struggle to get \nback on our feet, but meanwhile pass this critical bill the Senator has \nauthored so we can provide jobs and economic support, which is what \npeople want.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Senator for her tireless effort.\n  I want to comment on the work the Senator from Washington State did \nin her role chairing the subcommittee on transportation and housing. \nWhat a bipartisan effort that subcommittee put forth. Senator Murray \nand the Senator from Maine Ms. Collins worked on a bipartisan basis on \ntransportation, which is what the committee funds, and on housing.\n  When I speak of housing, this is housing that is primarily related to \nmeeting compelling human need. It also has the money for Community \nDevelopment Block Grants.\n  Going back to the days when I referred to the Senator as ``Mr. \nMayor,'' now ``Mr. President''--the Presiding Officer--we know--City \nCouncil Barb and formerly Mayor Booker--what Community \nDevelopment Block Grant money means in our local communities. In my \nState, Community Development Block Grant money is key to local \ngovernments solving local problems without a ``one size fits all'' from \nWashington.\n\n  What I like about the Community Development Block Grant money is that \nits criteria for funding is it has to deal with blight, it has to deal \nwith unemployment, and it has to meet compelling human need. And \nwhatever they do, it also usually results in good-paying jobs in \nconstruction. But it is not decided by Washington: Thou shalt build \nsuch-and-such under such-and-such Washington rules. It is decided in \nNewark, in Baltimore, in Phoenix.\n  What is so important about the CDBG money in transportation and \nhousing is money comes locally. There is Federal criteria--again, \neliminate blight, deal with unemployment, and it has to meet a \ndocumented need--but it is decided locally by mayors and city councils, \nby county commissioners, or whatever the form of local governance.\n  So this is what they did. They worked on a bipartisan basis for \nadequate funding for CDBG to meet compelling need in the area of \nhousing, particularly housing for the elderly--the so-called section \n202s, many of which were built a long time ago and now need to be \nretrofitted and remodeled. Again, this meets need--coming up to the \ncompliance of what we now know in things such as universal design to \nkeep people out of long-term care or assisted living. This is a \nwonderful way to meet human need and also generate jobs. So they have \ndone a great job.\n  I wish also to comment on the leadership they provided, and it was \nacross all of the appropriators in this committee. We are not a \ncommittee that makes a lot of fuss; we are not usually a bunch of \nchest-pounders harrumphing about a policy. We were once referred to in \na major historical work about our work as the quiet guardians of the \npurse. We are not quiet while working with each other, but the work is \nnot well known or well noticed because we have done it in a tone of \nsolving problems and keeping the problem the problem, and not making \npersonalities the problem. That has been done by every single \nsubcommittee of the Appropriations Committee in the Senate. I am proud \nof them. I think transportation and housing has been an exemplary one, \nbut we will hear this today from others who will be coming up to speak \nabout it. We have done a good job, and I hope other Senators will come \nto the floor to talk about the work of the committee. If they have any \nquestions, if they want to debate or comment, we are open to those \ndiscussions.\n  I do hope we can move the bill along. I know cloture doesn't expire \nuntil tomorrow, but, gosh, if we all come and everyone could have their \nsay, I think we could finish it today. It might be late, but I think we \ncould finish, and then go on with other pressing Senate business. So I \nurge those who wish to speak on the bill to come to the floor.\n  I know other Senators will be coming, but until then, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S395]]\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the business on the \nfloor, which is the Omnibus appropriations bill. Let me start by \nthanking Chairwoman Mikulski for her leadership. She has put long hours \nin on this over the Christmas and New Year's break. When most people \nwere home with families and doing things in their home State, on \nvacation, she never stopped working. Her team, her staff on the \nAppropriations Committee, never stopped working. The staff, as always, \nis kind of the unsung hero around here. They did so many great things \nto put this together, both Democrats and Republicans, House and \nSenate--everybody had to work together to get this done and I am proud \nthey did.\n  I am also proud to be one of the appropriations subcommittee chairs \nwho was able to work on this legislation. As you know, I am chairman of \nthe Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee. I have worked with my \ncounterpart Senator Blunt, the ranking member of the subcommittee, to \ncraft part of this bipartisan bill. Again, Senator Blunt has been \nwonderful to work with. We appreciate him and his staff as well.\n  When people hear agriculture appropriations, they often think about \nfarming. That is understandable. We all understand why. That is \ncertainly a key part of the bill, but that is not all it does. Our bill \nhelps farmers with operating loans, conservation practices, marketing. \nIt funds programs that benefit rural communities such as clean drinking \nwater and rural housing, and it supports nutrition programs that help \nkids across the country.\n  It also funds international food assistance such as Food for Peace \nthat allows crops grown here at home to be distributed around the \nworld.\n  This bill, in addition, touches on the Food and Drug Administration. \nThat is an agency that is vitally important to the United States. Here \nagain, just like agriculture is one of the core strengths of the U.S. \neconomy, pharmaceuticals is another area where America leads the world. \nIt is critically important that we have a highly functioning FDA in \norder for us to keep that competitive advantage.\n  This bill overall has a huge impact over the U.S. economy, but my \nsubcommittee's part in this bill also has a very significant bearing \nover the U.S. economy that will continue this recovery. Getting people \nback to work, getting people focused on domestic jobs and the fact that \nwe make things here and grow things here is critically important for \nour future.\n  For example, look at what it is doing to my home State. If I could, I \ncould go around to each one of these desks in the Senate and talk about \nspecific things it is doing in everyone's State, but just in my home \nState, it is providing funding for many of our universities, including \nthe University or Arkansas at Fayetteville and Arkansas State \nUniversity in Jonesboro, to conduct cutting edge agricultural research. \nIt is supporting economic development grants for the Delta Regional \nAuthority, which is in our region of the country, to boost the quality \nof life in the Delta region. It is providing our kids with a safe and \nstable food supply by supporting, again in our State, the Arkansas \nChildren's Nutrition Center in Little Rock, and it is investing in the \ntechnology of tomorrow by funding the National Center for Toxicological \nResearch in Jefferson County, AR.\n  The NTCR, which is part of the FDA, is also very important and people \ntake it for granted because they don't know what it does, but it is \nvery important. Now they have a new focus on nanotechnology, which they \nhave been doing in the last few years, and that will be a game changer \nas well. Those are just a few of the challenges.\n  I could stand here for an hour or so talking about the benefits of \nthe bill and talking about all the provisions and lots of matters that \nare contained in this bill, but I think overall it is most important to \nnote the agriculture appropriations bill and the omnibus bill overall \nare an agreement reached because of bipartisanship. We have to look \nback at what Senator Murray and Congressman Ryan did. I appreciate what \nthey did. They laid the groundwork for us to be here today. It was a \nbipartisan effort, went through both Houses, bipartisan, big votes, and \nwe saw a huge vote in the House of Representatives yesterday. I hope we \nwill see a large vote in the Senate today or tomorrow or Saturday, \nwhenever we get this done. Certainly I hope it is going to be today. \nNonetheless, this is a victory for bipartisanship and the agriculture \nappropriations part of that is important.\n  But overall, the fact is that Congress is back in business. We are \ngetting things done. We are getting back to what our chairwoman would \ncall regular order. We are working together and that is the only way we \ncan get things done in Washington. But it is also the only way we can \nsecure our Nation's economic future. I hope we will see a lot more \nbipartisanship in 2014. I know it is an election year. All the talking \nheads tell us it is going to be hard to do, but certainly I hope we can \nget that done and 2014, I hope, is a much more productive year in the \nCongress than 2013 was.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. King). The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, again I rise to compliment a \nsubcommittee chairman. The Senator from Arkansas took over this \ncommittee for the first time this year, so he is a new chairman, but he \nwas not new to the issues. I thank him for the work he did and the \nbipartisan tone which he set. Again, he has done an excellent job, \nworking with the Senator from Missouri Mr. Blunt. What was impressive--\nwhen we say agriculture, that is one word, but agriculture in this \ncountry is very diverse. Am I right that the Senator handles everything \nfrom artichokes to catfish?\n  Mr. PRYOR. We sure do. We handle, as the Senator says, everything \nfrom artichokes to catfish and everything in between. In our bill we \ntake the entire Department of Agriculture, with the exception of \nforestry--that goes to another subcommittee--and we also do FDA. If you \nlook at--for example, I mentioned, agriculture is one of the core \nstrengths of the U.S. economy. It may not be very exciting. We may take \nit for granted because in this country we have always had productive \nagriculture, but if we look at the different advantages it gives us as \na nation in lots of different ways, we need to keep that core strength \ngoing, just like the pharmaceuticals and the Federal Drug \nAdministration; it is critically important.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I also thank the Senator for what he and the Senator \nfrom Missouri did, what Mr. Blunt did, in terms of food safety. I \nbelieve when we did the continuing resolution we were--and also when we \nwere shut down--food safety faced the need for inspectors. We both \nshare, in our States, chicken. Chicken is a $2 billion industry over on \nthe Eastern Shore. A lot of good people have good jobs because of good \nchicken. But without those inspectors, our poultry industry would have \nbeen halted.\n  What were the consequences in those days and what has the Senator \ndone in this bill?\n  Mr. PRYOR. That is exactly right. Had we not had those food \ninspectors, it literally could have shut down the poultry plants--but \nalso the beef and pork and other types of facilities--overnight. It \ncould have shut them down and been very disruptive.\n  One of the great things about agriculture in the United States is we \nhave created a lot of efficiencies in the agriculture economy. So when \nyou have something disruptive such as this, these inspectors can't \ninspect the meat and they just cannot operate, you start to cause all \nkinds of disruptions, all kinds of inefficiencies.\n  Then what happens is the price of that chicken fillet at the grocery \nstore goes up. When we go to a restaurant it goes up.\n  We do not need to jeopardize our food supply, either on food safety \ngrounds or on supply grounds, because we have--if we look at the United \nStates and what we spend as a per-capita share of our income, we spend \nless on food than any country in the world. It is in relative terms. We \nhave to use that per capita, because if we have a higher standard of \nliving here, and we do, but it is something we are very fortunate about \nand because of this legislation and because of what Senator Stabenow is \ndoing with the farm bill--it is all a team effort--we are going to keep \nthat advantage and keep that food and fiber cheap.\n  Those are all domestic jobs. That is very important. This is growth \nhere,\n\n[[Page S396]]\n\nraised here, processed here, and served here. It is great for domestic \njobs. It has a huge ripple effect on the U.S. economy. This bill is \npart of that and I am proud to have a hand in it.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. The Senator from Arkansas as well as his ranking \nmember, the Senator from Missouri Mr. Blunt, has done a great job. \nSometimes Congress gets the rap when we grow the deficit, but here in \nagriculture, the subcommittee grows good jobs and they grow them by \nmaking sure we have a solid approach to agriculture itself, where \nfarmers and producers and distributors are able to do their job. And \nthe work of the FDA, through food safety, has not only kept America \nsafe, but it enables those who produce food in our country to have the \nright inspections so we have the right confidence to go out to the \nsupermarket.\n  We are very proud of what they do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I would say in conclusion, as I look on the \nfloor and I see Senators from Alabama, from Maryland, from Maine, from \nConnecticut, agriculture touches each of these States. It touches them \ndifferently. Agriculture is truly a matter of national pride. Every \nState contributes, basically every person benefits from it.\n  Again, I was honored to be part of this. The chairwoman deserves a \nlot of credit for working in a bipartisan way and getting it through \nboth Houses.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I am pleased to follow my colleague \nfrom Arkansas and join him in applauding the chairwoman of the \nAppropriations Committee Senator Mikulski for her extraordinary and \nhistoric work on this measure which serves so well our values and goals \nand our traditions in the Senate of bipartisan service, putting America \nfirst over partisanship. I join my very distinguished colleague from \nArkansas who has highlighted so well the values served by agriculture \nin America and served well by this appropriations bill and by the \nmeasure Chairwoman Stabenow is seeking to forge, again through \nbipartisan work involving both Houses of this body.\n  Agriculture serves so many of our basic values in this Nation--\nenvironmental and consumer values, patriotism and pride in a way of \nlife. In Connecticut, we know deeply and urgently how threatened are \nthese values and traditions, this way of life and the environmental \nconsumer issues at stake.\n  I am pleased that we are near a compromise, on the verge and the cusp \nof an agreement on the farm bill that will serve the interests of \nfarmers in Connecticut and around the country.\n  The dozens of dairy farmers with relatively small farms around \nConnecticut have said to me again and again that they need help and \ncertainty. That was the message they gave me as I visited their farms \naround the State of Connecticut time and again, and now apparently help \nand certainty are on the way.\n  I am pleased that the farm bill conferees have reached a compromise \non the dairy provisions in the farm bill. We are going to be studying \nthem very closely. They have only just been announced. Apparently, the \nnew deal announced by the farm bill conferees would keep the margin \ninsurance program but remove the Dairy Market Stabilization Program. In \nplace of that Dairy Market Stabilization Program, the deal revives the \nrecently expired Milk Income Loss Contract Program known as the MILC \nProgram. The Milk Income Loss Contract Program is a transitional \nprogram while the new margin insurance plan is being set up by the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture.\n  Without going into all of the details, I think this agreement \nrepresents progress, and I am going to carefully scrutinize it and seek \nto improve it from the standpoint of Connecticut's dairy farmers. But \nthere can be no doubt--none whatsoever to anyone in this body, which I \nthink we would all agree--as to the importance of the milk industry, \nbeginning with the dairy farmers. Indeed, reflecting the importance of \nmilk to America is the fact that it is the only beverage, other than \nwater, that is permitted on the floor of the Senate, as far as I know.\n  I am pleased and proud to have a glass of milk on the floor today. \nThis is a first for me in my young experience as a Senator. I am not \nsure if it is a correct parliamentary inquiry, but I say to the \nPresiding Officer: Got milk? I'm willing to share.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. This issue is a very serious one because the lives \nand livelihoods of our farmers are at stake. There is the open space \nthat may be sacrificed if dairy farms surrender and are forced to \nabandon this way of life due to the increasingly high costs of feed, \nfuel, and labor that are pressing them as they also encounter potential \nprice reductions. So they are squeezed. Dairy farmers are squeezed.\n  In Connecticut we mostly have small family-owned farms like the \nFairvue Farms in Woodstock, Hytone Farm in Coventry, Mapleleaf Farm in \nHebron, Fort Hill Farms in Thompson, Cushman Farms in Franklin, and \nGraywall Farms in Lebanon. I have visited a number of them. I know \nfirsthand how hard these farmers work simply to keep their farms going. \nThese six farms make up the Farmer's Cow, a group of Connecticut \nfamily-owned farms dedicated to producing some of the very best milk in \nAmerica.\n  Their milk is so good, in fact, they opened a milk bar--that is \nright, a milk bar--in Mansfield called the Farmer's Cow Calfe & \nCreamery where you can choose from five or six different types and \nflavors of milk to help wash down their delicious and fresh sandwiches, \nsalads, cheeses, and ice creams.\n  Visit Connecticut and visit the Farmer's Cow Calfe. These are the \nfarms we need to support and keep going. These are the hard-working men \nand women we need to support. We can and must support our dairy farmers \nin Connecticut and around the country.\n  In fact, in Connecticut we have more than 150 dairy farms on 70,000 \nacres--18 percent of our State's land--which translates into $2 billion \nin economic activity for the State of Connecticut alone. These farmers \nneed help. They need stability and certainty. Unfortunately, some \nMembers in the House of Representatives have delayed the farm bill for \nfar too long, leading dairy producers to wonder whether the Federal \nGovernment is a friend or a foe to their businesses.\n  Even though Connecticut's dairy industry is a significant contributor \nto the State's agricultural industry and general economy, the \nindustry's strength and survival depend greatly on the support that the \nFederal Government can and must provide.\n  In Connecticut, in 1975 there were 817 dairy farms. Today there are \n150 dairy farms. I think that experience is probably reflected by every \nState represented in this body. Every one of my colleagues, perhaps, \ncan attest to the diminishing number of dairy farmers and farmers in \ngeneral. Connecticut is doing its part and doing its share so that \nfarms in our State are sustained, and the Federal Government ought to \ndo its part as well.\n  According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Connecticut ranks 45 \nout of 50 States in receiving agriculture-related subsidies. \nConnecticut received $127 million between 1995 and 2010 compared to the \n$22 billion received by Iowa and the $24 billion that went to Texas. I \nhave nothing against those States. I am not criticizing those amounts, \nbut the amount we received in Connecticut is a fraction--a small \nfraction--of what is needed to sustain our dairy farmers, and that is \nwhy I will be urging and advocating for dairy farmers in Connecticut \nunder this deal. Their interests are shared nationwide. We need to make \nsure that the agreement announced yesterday by the farm bill \nconferees--keeping the margin insurance program, but removing the Dairy \nMarket Stabilization Program and reviving the MILC Program--truly \nserves milk producers in our Nation, not just the processors but \nconsumers and farmers. We must do right by America's dairy farmers, an \noften under-represented group in this body, and make sure we do right \nby our farmers and consumers by giving them the certainty and help they \nneed to continue a way of life and a product that is vital to our \nhealth and well-being as a Nation.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Will the Senator from Connecticut yield for a question?\n\n[[Page S397]]\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I am pleased to yield for a question.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. First, let me thank my colleague for his generous words \nabout the work of this committee. What is on the Senator's desk? I am \ndrinking water.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I have milk. I offered to share my milk with the \nPresiding Officer. I know that Maine has its share of farmers. I \nunderstand the Presiding Officer is not allowed, under our Senate \nrules, to respond in substance, but I would be glad to share with the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I say to the Senator from Connecticut: I have been in \nthe Senate for 25 years, and I have seen a lot of Senators try to put a \nlot of different drinks in those glasses, but I have never seen milk on \nthe Senate floor. Is that permissible?\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I am told it is a permissible beverage on the floor. \nIf it is not, I am sure I will be subject to appropriate disciplinary \naction.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. For all of us who just yearn for a calcium-rich diet, \nit is refreshing to see that. We salute Connecticut and its strong \nagricultural presence in our economy, and I thank the Senator for \nbringing a nutritious beverage to the Senate floor that is allowed \nunder the rules. If it is not allowed, I am sure we can have the \nappropriate committee of jurisdiction allow it.\n  I think what the Senator is saying is we have a lot of people in our \ncountry who work in agriculture, and agriculture is not one field. \nAgriculture in the United States of America is diverse, and we can't \nlet these small farmers fade away.\n  I am seeing new, emerging farmers in my State--whether it is for \ndairy or beef, and so on. With the so-called farm-to-fork movement, \nthis could be the dawn of a new age in agriculture while we preserve \nthat which has been traditional and fed America during good times and \nbad. So I thank the Senator for his work and his advocacy, and I look \nforward to working with him.\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I thank the chairwoman for her remarks. I wish to \nexpress to her, as I do to all of my colleagues, that agriculture and \nfarming really are a way of life. We need to make sure our family farms \nand all farms are sustained. We sometimes tend to neglect or take them \nfor granted.\n  Again, I thank the distinguished Senator from Maryland for the time \nand attention she has devoted over the many years she has been here to \nthe farms of Maryland and the farms of America. I think it is a cause \nwe share. Whether it is Alabama or Georgia or Maine or any other State \nrepresented on the floor here today, we need to make sure we provide \nthe safety net where it is necessary and the support when it is due but \nalso keep in mind that consumers ultimately are the beneficiaries, the \nmen and women and children, having four children myself. Also, having \nfor a time actually worked on a farm, I know this product is central to \nthe American existence and the American way of life.\n  I thank the chairwoman, and I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Arizona is on the \nfloor, and I would inquire of the Senator if at 12:30 he is planning to \nspeak on the War Powers Act.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the chairwoman. I was awaiting the arrival of my \ncolleague from Virginia, who was going to speak first.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I say to the Senator from Arizona, I think this is an \nimportant discussion. We will do it any way the Senator from Arizona \nwishes. If my colleague wishes to proceed, that would be fine with this \nside of the aisle. Whatever way the Senator from Arizona wishes to \nproceed on this important topic is fine.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Maryland. I hope the Presiding \nOfficer will chastise the Senator from Virginia for being tardy. I know \nhe is very capable of that. So I will go ahead and begin, although I \nhad planned on the Senator from Virginia being first. He is the sponsor \nof the bill which I am cosponsoring. I thank the chairwoman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. McCain and Mr. Kaine pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 1939 are printed in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I wish to talk about the omnibus for a \nbrief time before Senator Leahy has some remarks to be made.\n  First of all, I thank the chair and ranking member of the \nAppropriations Committee and their staffs for their hard work to draft \na sensible funding bill that I think meets the needs of the American \npeople, a bill that helps us move past the stalemate and disagreements \nof the past few years and does what the American people sent us to do; \nthat is, roll up our sleeves, work together, work hard, and govern.\n  Recently, folks have put politics and partisanship ahead of our \nconstituents and our responsibilities, and the results have not been \npretty. But thanks to Chairman Mikulski and Ranking Member Shelby and \ntheir counterparts in the House of Representatives, we now have a \nresponsible bipartisan bill we can work with, one that invests in our \nfuture to strengthen our economy but that makes tough choices so we can \ncontinue to get our fiscal house in order.\n  Approving this bill helps avoid another round of devastating \nsequester cuts, avoid a government shutdown, and avoid some of the \nbitterness that is dragging down economic growth.\n  In Montana, our seniors, children, women, and civilian members of the \nmilitary--to name a few--felt the sequester cuts head on. Kids could \nnot go to Head Start. The elderly could not get meals, women faced cuts \nto reproductive health programs, Defense Department employees were \nforced to stay home, and our military was dangerously close to being \nhollowed out.\n  This bill makes smart choices to continue to reduce our deficit, \nwhile investing in core national priorities--those being education, \nhealth care, infrastructure, research and development, and defense.\n  At the same time, it continues our fiscally responsible approach to \ngoverning by reducing or eliminating funding for dozens of programs \nthat had been left on autopilot after 2 years of continuing \nresolutions, and it repeals the recently enacted reduction in the \nannual cost-of-living adjustments for disabled military retirees and \nfor survivors of military retirees.\n  This particular change is very important for folks who have been \nmedically retired and for survivors, the folks who are more likely to \nbe on a fixed income, and it was done without any fanfare and without \nany grandstanding. Senator Mikulski and Senator Shelby figured out how \nto fix it.\n  Let's be clear. This is one step in a two-step process. We have more \nwork to do to address the military pension issue to make sure it works \nfor the men and women of the military who have made great sacrifices on \nour behalf.\n  I also thank Chairman Reed and Senator Murkowski for putting forward \na smart Interior bill. By ending sequestration, we are able to make \nsome real progress in Indian Country and in protecting some of \nAmerica's most unique landscapes.\n  The Interior bill increases funding for the Indian Health Service, \nwhich is necessary, it increases funding for Indian education and for \npromoting good stewardship of our public lands.\n  This Interior bill is critically important to States such as Montana. \nIt will improve the quality of life for folks on our seven \nreservations. It will create more tourism and recreational \nopportunities throughout Montana. I am concerned, however, by the \nabsence of one measure. It is a measure approved by the Senate \nAppropriations and Rules Committees. It is bipartisan. It saves money. \nIt brings more transparency and accountability to a town that needs \nmore of both. More than one-third of the Senate is a cosponsor.\n  This act is called the Senate Campaign Disclosure Parity Act. Right\n\n[[Page S398]]\n\nnow, candidates for the Senate do not have to electronically file their \ncampaign finance reports with the Federal Elections Commission. Now \nthey can voluntarily e-file. Maybe the Presiding Officer did. But many \nof our colleagues do not.\n  Instead, all a Senate candidate has to do is take a big stack of \ndocuments, drop them at the office door of the Secretary of the Senate, \nand head back to the campaign trail. Then what happens? The Secretary \nof the Senate then sends the documents to the FEC which spends time and \nmoney hiring contractors to put those reports on line where they can be \nviewed by the public. This costs taxpayers nearly $500,000 and God \nknows how many staff hours each year to make this information \navailable. But the biggest cost is to the American people, particularly \nto our voters, who have the right to know who is funding the campaigns \nof their elected officials. It is not as if I am proposing a new idea. \nCandidates for the House of Representatives must electronically file \ntheir financial reports. Presidential candidates e-file. Yet the Senate \nis stuck in the dark ages. In an era of smart phones and cars that \ndrive themselves and combines that harvest fields using GPS, today the \nSenate is dropping stacks of paper at officials' doorsteps.\n  I proudly voluntarily e-file my campaign finance reports. I know many \nof our colleagues do as well. But that is not enough. Ironically, we do \nnot know why my bill to improve transparency and save money did not \nmake it into the funding bill. I am told it was blocked by the House of \nRepresentatives. A few folks over at the House are pointing fingers \nback over here. That is finger-pointing instead of accountability, \npolitics instead of governance. We can do better.\n  Here in the Congress, we consistently demand transparency from \nFederal agencies. That is the right thing to do. But we need to also \nlook in the mirror. We are not doing what we demand of others. But \nAmericans are demanding this funding bill as well. It is a step forward \nto responsible government. It makes tough choices to getting our fiscal \nhouse in order while investing in the future.\n  This Omnibus is a good bill. It puts our country on more solid \nfooting. It delivers more certainty to small businesses so we can count \non them to grow and create jobs. Our constituents sent us here to find \ncommon ground. This kind of responsible bill is why we are here. So, \nonce again, I thank the chairwoman and the ranking member for their \nhard work in bringing this bill to the floor. I look forward to seeing \nits final passage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I want to address my remarks, first, to \nthe chairman and the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee. I \nthink you have done a lot of hard work. You have done something that \neven though I am not in the consensus, you have done what the Senate \nwas designed to do, build a consensus around a bill. There is no \nquestion this bill will pass today. So my congratulations to you and my \nsincere thanks for some of the things you put in the bill that we have \nbeen working on that are good governance projects. So I want to say \nthat from the start.\n  I am not going to talk specifically about the bill. I am going to \ntalk in bigger, broader terms of the problems that are facing us as a \ncountry. I have in my hands a book that contains $9 trillion worth of \ncuts. Hardly anybody in the Senate has read it. They may not agree with \n50 or 60 or 70 percent. But there is certainly somewhere in here \nconsensus for us to actually save a whole lot more money than we are \ndoing.\n  In 2009, a young lady by the name of Madeline showed up outside the \nSenate. This is what she had draped around her neck. ``I am already \n$38,375 in debt and I only own a dollhouse.''\n  Since that period of time, we have managed to markedly change that \nsituation for her for the worse, because today, if she were outside, \nshe would have this sign on her neck. It would say $54,602 and she \nwould only own a dollhouse.\n  The point I am trying to make is this hole is getting deeper and \ndeeper and deeper. Although I did not vote for the budget agreement, \nbecause I think it could have been done better, it was an agreement and \nhad a consensus as well. My criticism is not that the Members of this \nbody worked a consensus, which is exactly what the Senate is supposed \nto do, but I think as we have done these things we might have lost \nsight of the big picture. So I want to share with you for a minute what \nthe big picture looks like, because it is not pretty.\n  According to generally accepted accounting principles, that is not \nthe way we run the government, by the way. We do not use real \naccounting principles. We use all the tricks and smoke and mirrors we \ncan. This number is indisputable.\n  The unfunded liabilities for the Federal Government are $127 \ntrillion. Think about that. We cannot even imagine how much that is. \nOur national debt is $17.33 trillion as of last night. I checked it. \nThere are 14 million households in America. If you take the Federal \nliability per household, it comes out to $1.11 million. So $1.11 \nmillion is what the debt plus the liability is for every family in this \ncountry. It is growing. I know we cannot solve this problem over 1 year \nor 2 years. I am so thankful to the Senator who is leading the \nAppropriations Committee in her position. I have the most wonderful \nrespect for her. She is a listener. She wants to do right.\n  But what we have to do is change the direction of this. It needs to \ngo the other way. That requires everybody. If you think about it, if \nthe average family per capita income--this is what it was last year in \nthis country, $53,000--can you imagine how we are going to leverage and \nafford just the interest cost on $1.11 million?\n  If you add 5 percent on a million bucks, that is $55,000. That is \nmore--just the interest costs are more than the median family income in \nthis country. So there are parts of this bill that are in front of us \nthat I am highly critical of. I do not like the fact that we play a \ngame with CHIMPs, change it to a mandatory program. To me it is not \nstraightforward to the American people. It is not being honest about \nwhat we are actually doing.\n  What we are actually doing is digging the hole deeper. Let me outline \nsome things we could have done that we did not do before we had the \nbudget agreement, before we had this appropriations bill. The GAO over \nthe last 3 years has identified about $250 billion we could take a \nlarge portion away from by eliminating duplication and by putting \nmetrics on programs. Now think about that. That is $250 billion a year.\n  I have been out here giving speeches on all of this and everything \nthat is duplicative. But the problem is that the appropriate committees \nhave not met to look at the GAO recommendations. They have not acted on \nthem. They have not responded to them. The administration, I will give \nthem credit; in their budget the last few years, they have looked at \nthose GAO reports and made recommendations in their budgets for \nelimination and consolidation. But we have essentially ignored them.\n  I know how tough it is to build a consensus in the Appropriations \nCommittee that will get you the votes you need to accomplish that. From \nthe parochial concerns to the budget concerns, I understand that. I am \nglad we have a number now. I am glad we have a bill that has a number. \nI think the number is too high if we are ever going to do anything \nabout this. But the fact that we do not do anything that will make a \ndifference in the future in terms of driving this number down--just \nthink. Let's say the GAO is 50 percent right. Let's say they are only \n50 percent right. What if we consolidated, put metrics on programs and \nstreamlined them as they recommend and we saved $150 billion a year. \nThat starts going in the right direction. It changes. We start going in \nthe right direction. Now think for a minute. If we have no recessions \nover the next 20 years and we have great economic growth, 4 percent, we \nstill do not solve this problem. Because the interest costs are greater \nthan the GDP growth associated with our country.\n  I wanted to give the background of why I come out here all the time \nand raise the issue of why we are stealing the future from our \nchildren. Nobody can deny the fact that we have not done the work. The \nreasons we have\n\n[[Page S399]]\n\nnot done the work are multiple. But most of it is we just will not do \nthe work. We do not have the leadership that requires us to do the \nwork.\n  Think about Madeline. Let's say she gets a great college education \nand is in the upper quintile in our country in terms of her earnings \nwhen she is 25. With normalized interest rates, she is going to fall \nbehind. So I know we are talking out in the future, but one of the \nthings Thomas Jefferson wanted out of the Senate was for us to be long-\nrange thinkers, not to think about the problem right now, think about \nwhat the problem is going to be.\n  In my 9 years here, I have failed in my ability to convince my \ncolleagues that we ought to be worrying about this problem. Because the \npromise of America was opportunity. The promise of the poor house is no \nopportunity. What we have set up for the average American family in the \nfuture is the poor house.\n  It does not have to be that way. We can fight among the priorities, \nbut the one thing we should not by fighting about, the one thing that \nwe should know that we can fix is why would there be 679 different \nrenewable energy programs? Can anybody give any possible justification \nfor that? It is just $15 billion a year, but if you consolidated them \ndown to 20, you could save $5 billion a year. That is $50 billion over \n10 years.\n  Why are there 253 different Department of Justice crime prevention \ngrants? Each of them has an overhead. What we found when we studied \nthis is people get a grant from one, then use the same grant \napplication to go to another grant overhead in DOJ, get the grant from \nanother section, another program, for exactly the same claim. The right \nhand does not know the left hand. If you consolidated them, one, you \nwould get more money to each individual grant, and, No. 2, you would \nnot have the duplication and fraud and lack of compliance we know these \ngrant programs are loaded with. We have done the work. We have done the \noversight.\n  We have actually studied them--or why are there 209? Think about \nthis--science, technology, engineering, and math incentive programs, \neducation programs, 13 different agencies, $3.5 billion a year. Why do \nwe allow that to happen? This is the real face of who it is going to \naffect. Yet we won't do the hard work.\n  It is not the appropriators' job to do that work; I understand that. \nBut one of the things appropriators could do is say we are not going to \nfund any of these programs unless we consolidate them and put metrics \non them. Finally, if they expected to come out in March--and I am so \npleased the chairman wants to run the appropriations bills and to get \nback to normal--to say to the Judiciary Committee, if you want these \njustice grants run, consolidate them, put restrictions on them, \nstreamline them, and then we will fund them.\n  So everybody will know, we are prorating 1 year about $480 billion of \nmoney for programs that aren't authorized at all. One of the strengths \nof the Appropriations Committee could be that we could put some demands \non the authorizing committee to clean this up.\n  I want to state a couple more.\n  Health care has been in the news. How many of us realize we have 91 \ndifferent health care training programs spending $14 billion a year? \nSome of my colleagues probably know that, but in the committee of \njurisdiction they have done nothing about it.\n  I don't object to spending $14 billion on health training programs or \nany of these other things as long as we are doing it wisely, but what I \nwould suggest is for the 91 different programs--which should be \nprobably 4 or 5--the overhead associated with the others is saved for \nthe American public. We could save a significant amount of money for \nMadeline. Because the real story is our excesses, our lack of work, our \nlack of consolidation, our lack of streamlining, our lack of \nelimination and duplication, our lack of demanding the metrics so that \nwe know the programs we are funding out there are working.\n  We are not going to pay the price for it, nobody in this room. The \npeople who are going to be paying the price for it are Madeline's \ngeneration. How are they going to pay for that? What is going to \nhappen? What is the real cost associated with that? It is not a pretty \npicture. This is what it is: It is a markedly declining standard of \nliving.\n  Most people don't know that median family income in real dollars in \nAmerica today is at the exact same level it was in 1989, and it is \ngoing backward. Even with a growing economy, it is going backward. The \nassets available to a family are declining while the obligations for \nthat family are increasing, and we are responsible for that. It is not \nsomething we can't fix, it is something we choose not to fix.\n  I also would say that I have one large concern in this bill. We \nincreased NIH back to $1 billion. We are still not where we were 2 \nyears ago, but we started with $800 million more at the Defense \nDepartment, duplicating programs that are already running at the NIH. \nWe are making my list bigger, not smaller. We are going in the wrong \ndirection.\n  We have great people at the NIH. We have a great leader in Francis \nCollins. They have markedly improved the management of their grants, \ntheir oversight of their grants. Yet we are going to take $800 million \nand move it over to another set of overhead--with people not nearly as \nexperienced, not nearly as knowledgeable. We are going to be spending \nmoney in the Defense Department to study things we are spending money \nfor for the exact same type of thing at NIH. So we are not going to get \ngreat value for this money. What we are going to do is waste it. That \n$800 million should have gone to NIH and every other nonmilitary-\nrelated medical program over there. That money should have gone to the \nNIH.\n  When we talk to the Senators who started this, both Tom Harkin and \nour former colleague, now deceased, Ted Stevens, they would admit to us \nin private that it was a mistake to ever start it this way, because we \nare wasting a ton of precious dollars that could be used to save \nsomebody's life, but somebody has a reason for that. I don't know what \nit is, but I will say in this bill we have $68 billion of \nappropriations for the Defense Department that have nothing to do with \nthe defense of this country. We don't get all of these savings if we \ntake it out of the Defense Department, but we get $3 billion or $4 \nbillion if we take it out of the Defense Department. That $3 billion or \n$4 billion could fund NIH back at a level it should be funded or \nprotect Madeline from further decline in her standard of living.\n  I have made my point. I understand my perspective is not in the \nmajority, but I will guarantee my perspective is with the majority of \nAmericans, that we ought not to have 679 renewable energy initiatives. \nI don't think we would find anybody in the country who would disagree \nwith me that they ought to be consolidated. They ought to be run \nefficiently. They ought to have metrics on them, as well as the other \nhundreds of sets of duplications.\n  We are going to get another report next month from the GAO, actually \nin March. It will be their fourth. They are so discouraged because they \ndo all this hard work, make recommendations, and then we sit on them. \nWe don't act.\n  If I were to have a challenge to my colleagues, it is first to read \nthe reports over the past 4 years and look at the data that shows where \nwe are really wasting money. Then, please, for Madeline and the sake of \nher generation, act on it. Don't ignore it.\n  I know it is not easy work. It is hard work. I have done oversight \nfor 9 years in the Senate. But it can be done, it should be done, and \nthe Madelines of America are worth it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hirono). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. The remarks by the Senator from Oklahoma are very \ninteresting and telling. I listened to him carefully, and I believe \nbasically he is right on the point. I believe basically that we all \nagree with the Senator that it is important to reduce the waste and \nduplication in our government. He points out a lot of it. GAO has done \nit too.\n  Our staff has met with the GAO several times on ways to address this \nproblem. We know the problem; we have to act on it, and we have to take \nit very seriously. GAO, as Senator Coburn said, is coming out with a \nnew report. If we work on this, the government is going to be more \nefficient. We\n\n[[Page S400]]\n\nare going to save money, and we are going to respond to problems in \nAmerica much better. We are a long way from doing this. I appreciate \nhis remarks this afternoon and I hope a lot of my Senators were looking \nat that and listening to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. I ask unanimous consent to speak for approximately 12 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  TPA\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. I rise today to discuss a bill my colleagues and I \nintroduced to establish trade promotion authority, otherwise referred \nto as TPA. Senators Baucus and Hatch, along with Congressman Camp in \nthe House, introduced the Congressional Trade Priorities Act only last \nweek. The Senate Finance Committee held a hearing on it today.\n  This bill would resurrect the partnership between Congress and the \nadministration to promote a robust trade agenda. That partnership, \nknown as TPA, came about as a way to thoughtfully and pragmatically \nexercise Congress's constitutional authority to regulate foreign \ncommerce. TPA effectively combines this authority with the President's \nauthority to negotiate treaties.\n  Congress therefore provides the marching orders to the President, and \nthe President, in turn, gets an up-or-down vote on the agreement that \nis negotiated. Some might ask why would we do this? Why should Congress \nset rules for itself to consider trade agreements through a very \nspecial legislative process? Simply put, negotiating modern trade \nagreements would be virtually impossible without providing some \nassurance that agreed-upon provisions, negotiated provisions, won't be \npicked apart after the negotiators shake hands.\n  Trade agreements span a multitude of issues affecting international \ncommerce. To reach these agreements there needs to be extensive \nnegotiation by representatives of the countries involved, but Congress \nis hardly equipped to engage in multilateral negotiations with foreign \ncountries. We know that. We can hardly negotiate with each other these \ndays.\n  TPA allows Congress to set priorities for trade agreements and engage \nwith the President throughout the process. During floor consideration, \namendments cannot be offered because it would undermine our Trade \nRepresentative. It would undermine our Trade Representative's hand in \nnegotiation.\n  Imagine our negotiators signing a deal, shaking hands with our \ncounterparts from other parts of the world, and then bringing the deal \nto Congress. Then, after 535 people offer a plethora of amendments, \nthey have to go back to the other countries and try to reopen \nnegotiations because everything has been changed. No one would ever \nnegotiate a trade deal with the United States again.\n  So why is that a bad thing? Should we negotiate trade agreements at \nall? I would argue, unquestionably, the answer is absolutely yes. White \nHouses from Reagan to Obama would agree.\n  Furthermore, the overall benefit of free trade is undisputed by the \neconomists. A free rules-based trading system is much better for \nAmerica than a system where the government picks winners and losers, \nand it is better for American jobs when the playing field is a level \nplaying field.\n  I want to give an example: Colombia. In 2011 Congress passed a trade \nagreement with Colombia--already one of our most important allies in \nLatin America. That trade relationship is thriving as a result of that \nagreement. Consider this: Between 2011 and 2013 U.S. goods exports to \nColombia have increased 18 percent. At the same time U.S. goods exports \nto the rest of the world have decreased by 2 percent. Trade agreements \nare a great benefit to Americans as well as in corners of the world \nwhere they need a strong ally.\n  Unfortunately, that is a message that doesn't always make it through. \nInstead, we hear a chorus of scare tactics about job losses, \nenvironmental concerns--whatever it is. Critics ignore the proven power \nof trade to expand job opportunities and to improve the standard of \nliving, not only here but around the world. At the same time the lives \nof millions of people around the world improve. Almost all economists \nwould agree that countries should move toward more free trade, not \nless.\n  One need only examine tariff rates to understand why it is in our \nbest interests to pursue trade agreements. U.S. barriers to trade are \nalready very low by global standards. Our average tariff rate is 3.5 \npercent. Compare that to our current trade negotiating partners. \nVietnam has an average tariff rate of 10 percent. Malaysia's average is \n6 percent. Japan and the EU both have average tariff rates of 5.3 \npercent. Only New Zealand has a lower rate than we do. So trade \nagreements help to level the playing field by bringing down tariffs \nimposed on our goods by our competitors. Put simply, trade agreements \nknock down barriers. They open doors for U.S. producers and \nmanufacturers to get our economic engine going again.\n  Critics falsely claim we are going to experience a flood of cheap \nimports as a result of new agreements.\n  My friends, that simply doesn't make sense when our tariffs are \nalready low. Trade agreements bring down our competitors' high tariffs. \nThey level the playing field.\n  The benefit to trade is especially clear for agricultural products--\nhuge drivers of the economy in my State. Our average tariff on these \nimported products is 5 percent. Malaysia's is 11 percent, the European \nUnion's is 14 percent, Vietnam is at 17 percent, and Japan has an \nagricultural tariff rate of 23 percent. These countries all already \nhave a number of trade agreements in place with other countries. That \nmeans we face restrictions while our competitors reap the benefits of \nthe open market. We are on the sidelines while other countries are \nfilling the orders and creating the jobs. Trade Promotion Authority \npaves the way to lowering these barriers and, in some cases, \neliminating them altogether.\n  Of course, tariffs are not the only barriers our exporters face, and \nTPA would help us address the others too. Countries also impose \nnontariff barriers, often claiming some illegitimate basis in science, \nand they have brought our industries to their knees. Modern trade \nagreements address those barriers as well, and we cannot get good trade \nagreements inked without TPA.\n  In general, the U.S. abides by true science-based trade standards. \nThis is less common, however, in the rest of the world, to say the \nleast. Trade agreements help bring export markets in line with the same \nkind of science-based standards that we apply to our imports. So if you \nare concerned about foreign countries blocking American exports, you \nshould support TPA. Without TPA it becomes much harder to open those \nmarkets for American workers.\n  We should all get behind this TPA bill and get it across the finish \nline so that new trade agreements can clear the way for more Americans \nto be hired as export demand increases.\n  I am pleased President Obama now recognizes the immense benefit that \ntrade provides to our great Nation. Despite being all talk and no \naction on trade early on, this administration is currently negotiating \nthe two largest trade agreements in history. In my opinion, it is time \nfor the partisan bickering to end. There are clear job-creating \nbenefits to our country, and it is time for the President to make that \ncase to the American people and to his allies in Congress.\n  In a couple of weeks the President will have an opportunity to do so \nin the State of the Union address. I hope he follows through. Given the \nambition of potential agreements across the Pacific and the Atlantic, \nthe President must lay the groundwork, the vision, for the passage of \nthis legislation. Creating jobs in this Nation is too important to \nleave at the mercy of electioneering politics. It really is time to \nact. So my hope is we will pass TPA quickly so we can put Americans \nback to work.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S401]]\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. My late colleague Senator Byrd liked to say there have \nbeen two great Senates in the history of the world: The U.S. Senate and \nthe Roman Senate. He understood the special and crucial role the Senate \nfulfills in our constitutional Republic. The Senate is where the great \nissues of our time are supposed to be examined, reviewed, and discussed \nbefore the whole Nation, in public. Yet in the last few years we have \nwitnessed the dramatic erosion of Senators' rights and the dismantling \nof an open process.\n  We fund the government through massive omnibus bills. This is the \nbill before us now--1,583 pages stacked up here before us that no one \nreally has a chance to read or evaluate or analyze. Senators are \nstripped of their rights to offer amendments. We won't have amendments. \nBills are rushed through on the threat of panic, crisis or shutdown. \nPass it today or the government shuts down. Secret deals rule the day. \nWork is done outside the public view, and so millions of Americans are \nessentially robbed of their ability to participate in the process by \nexamining what their Senators do.\n  Under the tenure of Majority Leader Reid, the Senate is rapidly \nlosing its historic role as that great deliberative body. If this \ncontinues, America will have lost something very precious.\n  One of the tactics by which Majority Leader Reid has suppressed \nSenators' rights and blocked open debate is the technique called \n``filling the tree.'' This basically means that when a bill comes to \nthe floor, the leader will use his right of first recognition to fill \nall the available amendment slots on a bill and then block anyone else \nfrom offering an amendment. One man stands in the way of his 99 \ncolleagues.\n  I say one man, but not really all alone does he stand there. His \npower exists only as long as his Democratic colleagues support his \nblocking of amendments.\n  This prevents the body from working its will. It prevents legislation \nfrom being improved by amendment, and it prevents Senators from being \naccountable to their voters on the great issues of the day. This is, of \ncourse, why it is done. It has nothing to do with time. It is done \nbecause the majority leader does not want to have his colleagues vote.\n  Our majority leader has used this tactic--filling the tree--80 times \nalready. To put this in perspective, the six previous majority leaders \nfilled the tree only 49 times combined. Senator Reid has filled the \ntree on 30 more occasions than the six previous leaders combined. In so \ndoing, he denies the citizens of each State their equal representation \nin the Senate. Majority Leader Reid, in his efforts to protect his \nconference from casting difficult votes in order to shield them from \naccountability, has essentially closed the amendment process. He has \nshut down one of the most important functions that Senators exercise to \nrepresent the interests of their constituents.\n  Recently, this tactic manifested itself in a dramatic way. To the \nsurprise and shock of many, the December spending agreement contained a \nprovision to cut the lifetime pension payments of current and future \nmilitary retirees, including wounded warriors, by as much as $120,000 \nover their retirement period. Other Senators and I have had many ideas \nabout how to fix this problem, but we were blocked from offering them \nby the majority leader. I tried to offer an amendment to replace the \ncuts by closing a fraud loophole used by illegal immigrants--cited by \nthe Department of the Treasury--to claim billions of dollars in free \ntax credits they are not entitled to--billions. It would more than pay \nfor this. But Senator Reid and his conference Members, save one--one \nbroke ranks--stood together to block my amendment from a vote.\n  So I would ask my colleagues: Are you comfortable with this? Do you \nlike having to beg and plead with one person for the right to offer an \namendment in the Senate? Do you believe the Senate should operate \naccording to the power of one man?\n  This omnibus bill, though it restores pensions for our heroic wounded \nwarriors, leaves more than 90 percent of those cuts in place. Shouldn't \nwe be allowed to offer amendments to provide a fair fix for all our \nwarriors and veterans?\n  But blocking amendments is only one of the many abuses. The other \nerosion of the Senate has also been front and center in the budgeting \nprocess. We are now in our fifth year without adopting a budget \nresolution. We went over 4 years without the Senate even passing a \nbudget, as required by plain law in the 1974 Budget Act. Instead, \ntaxpayer dollars are being spent through a series of late-minute \nnegotiations and legislative pay caps that are driven through the \nSenate.\n  Then we face a massive omnibus bill--this 1,583-page monstrosity--\nwhich is rushed to passage without any amendments or meaningful review. \nThe American people have no real ability to know what is in it or to \nhold us, their elected representatives, accountable. That is, of \ncourse, why it is being done.\n  Today the Senate and the House are considering another omnibus bill, \none that will spend more than $1 trillion, with thousands of items of \ngovernment spending crammed into this single legislative proposal. The \nbill will be sped through under the threat of government shutdown, with \nvery little debate and no ability to amend.\n  If you don't accept what is in the bill and vote for it and pass it, \nSenator Reid says, I will accuse you of blocking the bill and shutting \nthe government down. You don't dare vote no. So it is yet another time \nwhen we must pass it to find out what is in it. My staff and I have had \nless than 48 hours to digest this behemoth, but already we have found \nprovisions that would not survive if considered in the regular order \nwhere we have amendments.\n  How is the process supposed to work? Each year, Congress is supposed \nto adopt a budget resolution. The law requires it. Then, based on \nspending levels contained in the budget resolution, individual \ncommittees report 12 authorization bills. I serve on the Armed Services \nauthorization committee. Based on the expertise and experience of \nMembers serving in those committees, they authorize spending. Senator \nLevin is our Armed Services Committee chair. Senator Inhofe is the \nranking member. Senator McCain is on the committee. These are people \nwho have given years of their life to understanding the challenges of \nmilitary matters.\n  Then the 12 subcommittees of the Appropriations Committee are to \nproduce appropriations bills for their area of the budget, such as \ndefense, homeland security, and agriculture, which are then to be \nindividually considered, debated and amended on the Senate Floor. So \nthey actually appropriate the funds that the authorization committees \nauthorize to be funded. That is the way the process is supposed to \nwork. This gives each Member, when the appropriations bill hits the \nfloor, a chance to review and analyze each part of the budget and offer \nsuggestions for saving money, improving efficiency, and better serving \nthe taxpayers. That is the way it is supposed to work.\n\n  But under the tenure of Senator Reid the budgeting process has been \ntotally mismanaged. We have ceased consideration of appropriations \nbills altogether, basically, relying more and more on autopilot \ncontinuing resolutions and catch-all behemoth spending packages like \nthis one. In fiscal year 2006, for example, every single appropriations \nbill was debated, amended, and passed in the Senate. In 2006 every one \nwas passed, considered, and voted on, and that was good. That is better \nthan we had been doing in the previous years. There were failures \nduring the previous years.\n  But in 2013--here we are, here--the red indicates that no bill was \npassed in the Senate. In 2013, again in 2014, none were individually \npassed. All the funding was done as part of this omnibus process.\n  I want my colleagues to look at this one more time. The green shows \nthat the bill was brought forward to the floor and was passed. The \nyellow shows it was brought forward out of committee but not passed on \nthe floor. The red shows it was not even brought to the floor, brought \nout of committee to the floor to be considered. Do you see how the red \nhas continued in the outyears?\n  What is happening today is contrary to good policy. It is contrary to \nthe whole idea of what a Senate and a Congress ought to be doing. We \nhave to stop it. I know we have had a lot of frustrations lately, but \nthat does not excuse this trend. It has to end.\n\n[[Page S402]]\n\n  In my first year as a Senator--I guess the second year I was a \nSenator, 1998--every bill was passed. Every bill was passed in 2010. \nBut we have gotten away from that completely. We can go back to that. \nIt is not impossible. Those bills when I first came here were all \ndebated and amended on the floor and went to conference with the House \nto settle our disagreements, and then a bill was sent to the President \nfor his signature or veto. Over time, however, that has happened less \nand less frequently, to the point that nowadays we do not debate \nappropriations bills at all.\n  Look, Senator Mikulski is a great leader in the Senate and one of the \npeople I admire greatly, and so are Senator Shelby and others. How we \ngot into this process I do not know. But I will just say this: I think \nit is fair to say that Republicans have clearly advocated for bringing \nthe bills to the floor and having debates on them. I--ranking on the \nBudget Committee--have clearly advocated we process a budget the way we \nare supposed to do. But Senator Reid has made the decision, backed by \nhis conference, to not bring up these bills. It is a political \ndecision. It is a decision to avoid having to take votes on disputed \nquestions of what should be funded and what should not be funded. That \nis the problem we are in. So we have crammed all these appropriations \ninto this huge bill under threat of a government shutdown.\n  A more ominous development, however, is the breakdown of the \nappropriations process in the Senate and how it is infecting the House \nof Representatives. It is spreading like the plague over there. In the \nfirst year of their majority, the House passed--worked and marked up 6 \nof the 12 appropriations bills and sent them to the Senate, but the \nSenate did not consider a single one of them. Last year the House \npassed eight appropriations bills and sent them over to the Senate. \nAgain the Senate did not act, refused to consider them individually. \nThis year the futility of the efforts of the House began to show as the \nHouse passed only four bills. Why should they pass them and send them \nto the Senate if they are not going to be considered on the floor in a \nnormal, regular order? So they are beginning to erode what they have \nbeen doing.\n  All of us, both parties, have a responsibility to reverse these \ntrends. All of us have a responsibility to return to regular order. It \nis in the national interest. It is the right thing to do. All of us owe \nour constituents an open, deliberative process, where the great issues \nof the day are debated in full and open public view. Each Senator must \nstand and be counted on these issues, not hide under the table and \navoid being held accountable. The democratic process is messy, \nsometimes contentious, and often difficult. People disagree. But it is \nprecisely this legislative tug-of-war, this back-and-forth which forges \na national consensus.\n  While secret deals may keep the trains running on time in the short \nrun, sometimes they keep the train running in the wrong direction--a \ndirection different from what the American people would like to see. \nSometimes it hides bad spending, bad appropriations, bad legislation \nthat ought to be exposed in the light of day.\n  Secret deals rushed through without public involvement only deepen \nour divisions, delay progress, increase distrust, and make it harder to \nachieve the kinds of real reforms the American people have been \nthirsting for and demanding.\n  Having to cast many votes on tough issues really does clarify those \nissues and what the differences are amongst us. That process, I truly \nbelieve, openly conducted, can lay the groundwork for more progress \nthan we have today and reduce contention. It will clarify facts and \nthen lead to the finding of common ground. Only through an open \nlegislative process can we create the kind of dialog, the kind of \ndebate, and ultimately the kind of change necessary to put this country \nback on the right track.\n  I am going to continue to work to restore the regular order. I really \nbelieve it is important. I respect my colleagues. I am hearing more and \nmore my Democratic colleagues expressing these same concerns, and I \nthink there is some unease at the extent to which this process in the \nSenate has been undermined.\n  Maybe we can make progress and return to the great open debate and \nregular order that has made the Senate the wonder of the legislative \nworld.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, pending before the Senate is something \ncalled the consolidated appropriations bill. It is consolidated because \nit consolidates the work of 12 separate subcommittees. As the chair of \nthe full committee, I also chair a subcommittee called commerce, \njustice, science. I would like to say that what we did in our bill \nadvanced, really, the protection of the United States in terms of \nFederal law enforcement, important domestic violence programs, but also \nwe promoted trade and new ideas in science. I would like to share what \nwe did. Before I do, I want to explain--many people do not understand, \nat this point, the Budget Committee and the Appropriations Committee.\n  The Budget Committee gives us the macro picture, what should be spent \non discretionary spending, mandatory spending--spending for veterans \nbenefits, which I believe ought to be mandatory--and also what our tax \npolicy should be. Senator Murray of Washington State led that effort. \nWe passed that bill in April. We tried to go to conference, but there \nwas objection to it. Finally, after 3 weeks of shutdown, we were able \nto get a budget.\n  This committee was given the job, after the budget was passed, to do \nthe work of the Appropriations Committee. The Appropriations Committee \ntakes the work of the Budget Committee and puts it in the Federal \ncheckbook, line by line.\n  I would like to elaborate on that, but I know the Senator from New \nHampshire has come to the floor--one of our newer members of the \ncommittee, but she is not new to good government. She comes to the \nSenate with an incredible background of serving New Hampshire, \nparticularly in the executive branch as Governor. She brings a sense of \nwhat government can do--that Yankee frugality for which New Hampshire \nis known.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I thank the esteemed chair of the \nAppropriations Committee for her kind words, and especially for all of \nthe work she has done to get us to this point where we have an \nappropriations bill before us. I know she has worked very hard with \nRanking Member Shelby, the House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal \nRogers and Ranking Member Lowey.\n  It was Senator Mikulski's leadership on this bill that got us to an \nagreement to fund the government for the rest of 2014, and to do it in \na way that will support job creation, economic growth, and our national \nsecurity. So I thank the chairman.\n  I am a new member of the Appropriations Committee. I am currently the \nchair of the Legislative Branch Subcommittee, and so I also want to \nthank Senator Hoeven, the ranking member of our subcommittee. It has \nbeen a real pleasure to work with him to draft the subcommittee work \nfor the Legislative Branch Subcommittee.\n  For New Hampshire, this bill includes funding for the continued \ndevelopment for the new KC-46A aerial refueling tanker, of which we are \nvery proud. The first round of those tankers will be based at Pease Air \nNational Guard Base in New Hampshire.\n  It also makes investments in the new military construction project at \nthe Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. We are very proud in New Hampshire of \nboth Pease and the shipyard because they play a very important role in \nour national defense. These strategic investments will create jobs, \nboost the State's economy, and support our men and women in uniform.\n  I am also very pleased that this omnibus bill funds the Beyond Yellow \nRibbon Program. This is a program that connects service men and women \nand their families with community support, training, and other \nservices. As\n\n[[Page S403]]\n\nwe look at the men and women coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan, the \nBeyond Yellow Ribbon Program has been a very important program to help \nreconnect those returning servicemembers to their community. It has \nalso been very important in New Hampshire. The Beyond Yellow Ribbon \nProgram has been critical in States such as New Hampshire with many \nmembers of our National Guard and Reserve returning from duty overseas.\n  The legislation before us also funds the complete activation of the \nBerlin prison, just as it funds the Bureau of Prisons. In New Hampshire \nthat funding is going to allow us to get to a full complement of about \n340 local jobs in northern New Hampshire, which is very critical to the \nnorthern part of our State. It is going to provide a $40 million annual \nboost to the economy in northern New Hampshire.\n  I am especially appreciative to the chairwoman of the committee and \nto all of the members for the effort to help the fishing men and women \nin New Hampshire who have just been devastated by declining fish \npopulations. The bill authorizes $75 million in disaster relief for \nthose members of our fishing community, so many of whom have had their \nwhole livelihoods taken away from them. This disaster relief money is \ngoing to help them during these difficult times. It will help them to \nrecover and rebuild what I believe is one of the most critical economic \nsectors still in New England. It is certainly one of the oldest.\n  I am also pleased that this bill reverses some of the reckless cuts \nfrom sequestration and instead makes important investments in the \nfuture of this country--in our education, infrastructure, and in \nscience and innovation.\n  Yet it also makes strategic cuts. For example, one of my favorites in \nthe bill is that it prohibits taxpayer-funded expenditures on oil \npaintings for public officials. This is an idea that Senator Coburn and \nI have been working on over the last year, and I think it is exactly \nthe kind of government spending we need to get rid of. It sends a \nmessage--a signal. Even though it is not a lot of money, it is symbolic \nfor the public to know we are trying to address anything we can, and \nthis is one piece we can agree on, and hopefully it will lead to \nothers. The bill also requires all Federal agencies to become better \nstewards of taxpayer dollars because it invests in inspectors general \nin agencies across the Federal Government. Inspectors general help \nthose agencies better identify waste and cut spending.\n  While making smart cuts, the bill also invests in priorities, such as \nscience and innovation. It provides more funding for medical and energy \nresearch and development. Very important efforts are under way at the \nNational Institutes of Health. They are finally going to see some \nrelief in this bill.\n  It supports education, including funding programs such as Head Start, \nwhich have been cut under sequestration. Head Start has been cut in New \nHampshire. It is particularly important because the more we learn about \nthe importance of how children learn, the more we understand how \ncritical early childhood education--programs such as Head Start--are to \ntheir future development.\n  The bill also makes infrastructure investments, something on which we \nhave been too far behind in this country. It is going to help us as we \nlook at rebuilding our Nation's deficient roads and bridges and \ncreating jobs.\n  As we all know--and I know the chairwoman would readily admit--this \nbill is not a perfect bill, but the legislation before us is a product \nof the kind of bipartisan compromise that we have to have more of in \nWashington these days.\n  While I am very pleased that the bill addresses military retirement \ncuts for some retirees--survivor widows, survivor benefits, and for the \ndisabled--we still need to keep working until those cuts are repealed \nentirely for all military retirees. It is something that I have \nintroduced legislation on, and I will continue to work on it. I know \nthere is a commitment from so many of us here in the Chamber to address \nthat.\n  I will also continue to work to provide full funding for the Low \nIncome Home Energy Assistance Program, LIHEAP, which helps seniors and \nlow-income New Hampshire families pay their heating bills, especially \nduring the cold winter months. This bill makes a small increase in that \nprogram, but unfortunately, it is not enough to address the challenges \nso many families in New Hampshire and in the cold parts of this country \nare facing as we continue through this very cold winter.\n\n  Small businesses in New Hampshire have not forgotten that during the \nshutdown they faced uncertainty and declining revenues. Federal \nemployees in New Hampshire struggled to make ends meet while being \nfurloughed, and that shutdown--a completely manufactured and \nunnecessary crisis--cost this economy $24 billion.\n  I think--in talking to business people around New Hampshire and \naround the country--one of the most important things that this bill \ndoes is it takes the prospect of another manufactured crisis off the \ntable. It puts in place a responsible plan to grow this economy, create \njobs, and it takes away the uncertainty that has so plagued families \nand businesses across this country.\n  I had the opportunity this week to meet with the head of the business \nroundtable. One of the things he pointed out to me is that right now we \nare seeing the lowest percentage of private investment in our economy \nthat we have seen in a very long time--in decades. It is most important \nthat we in Washington provide the business community some certainty so \nthey will make those investments because that is how we create jobs.\n  We need to put people back to work, and I think this legislation goes \na long way to create that certainty and say to the business community \nand to those people who are unemployed: We are going to keep working on \nyour behalf. We are going to try to make those investments and make \nsure we create the jobs to put you back to work, to keep this economy \nstrong and growing, and to keep this country competitive.\n  In closing, I just want to say to my colleagues that now is the time \nfor us to build on this bipartisan success we have seen and that the \nchairwoman has been able to accomplish with all of her other \nnegotiators. We have this opportunity to build on that and to further \npromote job creation and economic growth.\n  Our country needs us to work together on behalf of small businesses, \non behalf of the middle class, and on behalf of families. We need to \npass this bill. We need to keep working together and address the \nchallenges this country faces.\n  I urge all of my colleagues in the Senate to support this bill.\n  I yield the floor, and again I thank the chairwoman for her efforts.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. The Senator from New Hampshire is very generous with \nher remarks, and I want to respond by saying a few things.\n  First of all, the way the Senator speaks about New Hampshire is the \nway I also speak about Maryland. When people think about government \nspending, they think it just goes out in the ether and doesn't generate \nanything. As the Senator has said, what is spent by the Federal \nGovernment really creates jobs in the private sector.\n  She spoke about prisons. First of all, we appreciate New Hampshire's \nwillingness to accept a prison. Many States don't want them, shy away \nfrom them or are afraid of them. New Hampshire has really met a \nnational need, and we know that the staffing that will be provided by \nthe exceptional, patriotic work ethic of the people of New Hampshire \nwill keep our country safe.\n  Those same guards and administrative staff will be out in their \ncommunity spending money on housing, at the local grocery store, maybe \nneeding a wedding planner or whatever. So that is one area.\n  In terms of New England fisheries--for those of us who are coastal \nSenators, we know what that means. Fishing and seafood is part of our \nhistory, and it is actually part of our State's identity. For us in the \nSenate, the coastal Senators have kind of an affinity with each other \nfor it.\n  We thank the Senator from New Hampshire for what she has done.\n  I also want to comment that the subcommittee on legislative affairs \nthat you chair also--it is not like it funds legislators. It funds \nthings such as the Capitol Police, who are sentry here doing their job.\n  I thank my colleague for her work, and we are so pleased to have her \non the committee.\n\n[[Page S404]]\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I thank the chairwoman very much.\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, would the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I just want to take this opportunity to \nthank the two Senators who are present. In America's space program, \nwhich was potentially on a downward slope, the two Senators have \ncrafted an appropriation that will keep us with a very robust American \nspace program, including the first ``A'' in NASA, which is aeronautics. \nFrom science to the new big rocket, its capsule Orion, to the \ncommercial, to the unmanned program exploring the heavens, the \nchairwoman and the ranking member have it right. I wanted to take this \nopportunity to express my profound thanks. The Senators are continuing \nthe dream that we built on 3 years ago.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Senator from Florida. It is wonderful for \nboth me and Senator Shelby. Senator Nelson is an astronaut Senator. To \nhear an astronaut Senator say he thinks we are doing the job right \nmeans a lot.\n  The Senate has been blessed by having three astronaut Senators: \nSenator Jake Garn, a Republican from Utah, Senator John Glenn of Ohio, \nand Senator Bill Nelson.\n  Some of us have been in orbit a long time, but Senator Nelson \nactually knew what he was doing. So I thank my colleague very much. We \nare trying to add gravity to this bill.\n  Mr. NELSON. The Senators are doing it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I want to pick up on what Senator \nMikulski was talking about. Senator Nelson has not only been an \nadvocate for the space program for NASA--and he is. As most everybody \nknows, has been up there. I was traveling with him one time, and I \nbelieve we were over Asia, and he was showing me from the plane--we \ncouldn't see as well as he could--the rotation. I was very impressed.\n  He has been a stalwart in the advancement of the space program. We \nboth worked hand in glove with him.\n  I do believe this is a pretty good appropriation considering where we \nare. I am hoping we will get back to regular order since Senator \nMikulski and I have advocated for this. We are hoping maybe later today \nwe can vote this bill out with a vote like the House had yesterday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I am pleased to come to the floor \ntoday to follow-up on the very eloquent remarks by the Senator from New \nHampshire and the ranking member and chairwoman.\n  I am here today to offer a few comments about the appropriations \nbill. But before I do, I thank the chairwoman and the ranking member \nfor really being a great inspiration to all of us. Amidst all of the \ncontroversy and dustups and toxic atmosphere and nonpartisanship going \non--or lack of cooperation going on--it is wonderful to see the two of \nthem working so closely together on a bill that is so important to the \ncountry.\n  As the great Senator from New Hampshire said: This is a bill for the \npeople, for jobs, and for our economy. It sends very positive signals \nacross a breadth of industries where the Federal Government is stepping \nup to be a more reliable partner in these public-private partnerships \nthat are represented in the funding of this bill--whether it is \nbuilding our highways, building our space programs, funding our \nDepartment of Defense, sending money to cities and counties that are \ndoing all sorts of innovative and remarkable things with community \ndevelopment block grant funding with a lot of private partners.\n  Contrary to popular belief and contrary to some things you might hear \non the radio and on television these days, the Federal budget does a \nlot more than fund the government. It does a lot more than funding \ngovernment employees. It is sending out literally millions of green \nlights to small business contractors and to large businesses saying, \nLet's go. The yellow light was blinking a few days ago; the red light \nhas been on for the last couple of years. This bill literally sends out \nmillions of blinking green lights saying: Get to work. Let's go to \nbusiness. Let's build highways. Let's build levees. Let's build a space \nprogram. Let's invest in the middle class.\n\n  In addition, I wish to say how proud I am that under the leadership \nof Senator Mikulski, she has managed to do this within budget \nconstraints. This is not a free spending bill; this is a smart spending \nbill within constraints so we are also mindful of reducing our debt \nover time, mindful about paying down our bills.\n  That is what is so remarkable about this and why I am so proud to \nsupport it. I hope we can get as strong a vote as the House did on this \nbill to show strong bipartisan support, because while it does address \nour debt and our deficit, it does so in a smart way with investments in \nwhat we have agreed to that make a difference to the private sector.\n  I can tell my colleagues that in Louisiana this is going to have \nimmediate positive effects, and I wish to highlight a few of those now \nin terms of the Homeland Security bill. I am proud and happy to be the \nchairwoman of the Homeland Security appropriations bill. I have worked \nvery closely with my colleague Senator Carper, who is chair of the \nauthorizing committee, and our ranking members, Senator Coburn and \nSenator Coats, as we authorize stronger parts of Homeland Security and \nthen fund some of these initiatives. I will hit the highlights of just \nthree or four.\n  One of them is the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard is in our Homeland \nSecurity bill. It is a very important component of our government. It \nis one of the most popular components of our government--popular \nbroadly with business and with people. It is, of course, very popular \nwith the people the Coast Guard has saved from drowning or from wrecks \nin our open seas, but also for the hundreds of companies and businesses \nthat have contracts with the Coast Guard to provide some real cutting-\nedge shipbuilding that needs to go on in this country. The Senator from \nAlabama knows this, the Senators from Mississippi know this, the \nSenators from Maine, the Senators from Louisiana. We have lost a great \ndeal of shipbuilding in our country to other countries. It is important \nthat we keep as much shipbuilding here through the Homeland Security \nbill and through the Defense bill here in America--ships that are made \nin America, ships serving Americans, providing good, solid jobs.\n  I am proud to support this, along with the tremendous support of \nSenator Cochran, who is a member of my committee, and particularly \nSenator Begich, from Alaska, who fought very hard for a good outcome on \nthe Coast Guard budget, which is above the administration's request and \nhas a modest increase and will be supporting so many important projects \nfor our Coast Guard and the men and women of our Coast Guard. It \nprovides $10.2 billion overall, which is a significant increase, and we \ndid so within our budget constraints.\n  Another piece I wish to highlight is our enforcement of Immigration \nand Customs laws. We are in a big debate about immigration reform and \nthe importance of finding common ground on immigration reform for the \nbenefit of our businesses and our economy here in America that demand \nclear rules of the road, clear processes for people to become citizens \nand to pay their taxes, who have come here legally, and for people who \nare here without the current legal papers to give them a path to \ncitizenship once taxes are paid, once they get in line behind people \nwho have come here legally. Protecting our borders is an important \ncomponent of that as well. In our bill we have put the resources \nnecessary behind enforcing those tough immigration standards and \nrequirements.\n  We are protecting our border, providing resources for the bill, and \nthat is important to many people in this country as well as people in \nLouisiana, to have an immigration system that makes sense as well as to \nprovide appropriate jobs and labor to come in and help with so many of \nthe jobs we have in Louisiana today.\n  We also had a focus in our bill--I think the chairwoman will be happy \nto hear this--about stepping up an additional 2,000 Customs officers at \nour airports. We have an international airport in New Orleans. We get a \nlot of international travel. We may be a little\n\n[[Page S405]]\n\ncity, but we fight way above our weight, as does our State, when it \ncomes to international travel. We are a very sought-after destination \nand we are very happy about that. But there are other States such as \nNew York and Nevada and Chicago that have international travel. Even \nthe State of the Presiding Officer, North Dakota, which is a smaller \nState--there is a tremendous amount of business coming into the State \nof North Dakota, both domestic and international, because of their oil \nand gas jobs and their energy sector jobs. What a howdy-do it is, \narriving at our airport or to work with businesses here, or to partner \nwith businesses here to create jobs, and one has to wait in line in \nCustoms for 5 hours. That is no way to greet business men and women \nbearing gifts of investment and money for our country.\n  I have taken a strong leadership position on this with the travel and \ntrade organizations, both in hospitality and in international business. \nI wish to thank their coalition for fighting hard to make sure this \nbill reflects the fact that business is global, it is international. \nOur business people are out and in all the time, building wealth for \nAmerica and, hopefully, the world, but for America, and business people \ncome here to help create wealth and help our middle class to grow. \nHaving Customs agents who operate, making lines shorter, will certainly \nhelp that, while keeping our country safe, but also keeping it open for \nbusiness. Louisiana is a trading State and we are a big port State. We \nunderstand trade, we understand international business, and I am happy \nto be able to fight hard for those priorities.\n  I wish to mention two other issues. Many committees are working on \ncyber security. Homeland Security does not take the lead on cyber \noverall; the Department of Defense and National Security Agency do. But \nwhen it comes to securing our government and our government private \nsector partners, Homeland Security does take the lead. We have stepped \nup some investments in cyber security. As the Senator from Alabama most \ncertainly understands in his leadership role, this is a real threat not \nonly to our government, to the Department of Defense, to our government \nas a whole, but to many businesses in America--private, large \nbusinesses, and medium and small. They are feeling the effects of these \nsaboteurs and attackers. The government has to stay focused and well \ninvested, working with the private sector, to make sure our defenses \nand our security are up, and our bill recognizes that.\n  Finally, something close to my heart and close to my home is the \nfunding for disaster relief. I hope no one ever has to go through what \nwe went through along the gulf coast for Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. I \nknow everybody has had terrible storms and floods. But there has never \nbeen a storm or a disaster such as this, and I pray to the Lord there \nwill never be another one after it. The damage that was done in dollar \namounts, the damage that was done across a vast stretch of land, from \nAlabama to Texas, the devastation it caused in terms of numbers of \nhomes and businesses lost is unparalleled.\n\n  Sandy was a terrible superstorm, and because the northeast is more \ndense than we are down South, they lost more homes technically than we \ndid, because the dollar damage is still far exceeding in the aftermath \nof Katrina and Rita. But whether it is Sandy in the east or whether it \nis floods in North Dakota, which they have had their share of, or \nColorado or whether it is storms on the gulf coast, we have to be ready \nwith money to send immediately when people need help.\n  I am going to say this because it has been a matter of argument \nbetween some here: When a disaster strikes, I am not going to look for \nan offset. I am going to look for the Coast Guard and FEMA to show up \nwith the equipment they have to help people who are either drowning, on \ntheir roofs, or watching their houses burn to the ground. I am not \ngoing to look for an offset. So as long as I am chairman of this bill, \nwe will have money in this bill to use on an emergency basis when \nemergencies occur, as they do fairly regularly, unfortunately, in the \nStates we represent down in the gulf coast. Because we are right in the \nmiddle of that hurricane alley, these storms are getting bigger and \nmore fierce, and we have to be at the ready.\n  We have helped Maryland. We have money in for Sandy recovery and \nthere is money in here still for the ongoing recovery. It is phasing \nout now in the gulf coast, but there are still some projects that have \nongoing work, even 9 years after Katrina and Rita.\n  Let me say it has been a pleasure to work with my colleagues. I wish \nto thank the members of my committee, particularly my ranking member \nDan Coats from Indiana, and I really want to thank Senators Begich and \nCochran for their great work with the Coast Guard and helping me \nnegotiate this through the process. Again, I think these are just some \nof the highlights of our bill. Nothing would have been possible without \nSenator Mikulski and her determination to get the green light on, \nbecause people in my town, in my State are tired of yellow and red. \nThey want to work. They want to go to work. They want to build \nbuildings and build roads and get projects underway. We have lots of \npermits pending that the money in this bill will allow to be released. \nSo I am proud to vote for it. This is all about jobs, economic \ncompetitiveness for America, and good jobs for Louisiana. I am sure \nevery Senator, or almost every Senator, will say the same about this \nbill, because it was well done. It is a job well done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I rise today to again express my great \ndisappointment about a matter of importance to Wyoming and many other \npublic land States that have not been properly addressed by this \nomnibus bill in the Senate. Instead of producing a legislative solution \nbased on discussions with our colleagues, debate and consideration in \ncommittee, and a fair and complete process on the floor, we have a bill \nbefore us that was put together by making another deal. Simply put, the \nSenate fails to do its job when we refuse to allow a fair, free, and \nopen debate about an issue that is of such great concern to the people \nwho will be affected by the decision.\n  It is no secret; anyone who has seen the Senate in operation as we \ntake up this legislation will know that the back-room deal does not \ninclude critical funding that nearly 1,900 counties in 49 States--49 \nStates; that is all but 1--and 3 U.S. territories rely on. One would \nthink this kind of participation would draw an extraordinary amount of \ninterest by us all to make sure this bill was written with the best \ninterests of all the States and all of our constituents in mind. \nUnfortunately, that doesn't appear to be the case.\n  So what program is it that draws such interest from 1,900 counties, 3 \nterritories, 49 States--concern from such a widespread portion of our \nNation? I am speaking, of course, of payments in lieu of taxes. It is a \nprogram that has been in place for decades; it is not an issue that is \nnew to the Senate. That is why I recently led an effort by several of \nmy Senate colleagues urging that appropriators include this critical \nfunding in the Interior appropriations. If they had done that, we would \nhave already completed the work to produce a well-reasoned, well-\nthought-out answer to an issue of such importance to the States. \nUnfortunately, our efforts seem to have fallen on deaf ears, so here I \nam before my colleagues hoping with all my heart that I can make the \nSenate understand how crucial this funding is to almost every State in \nthe Union.\n  This body often overlooks the important role of local government in \nthe lives of our constituents. I know this because before I came to the \nSenate I served as a mayor, as did another handful of people in this \nbody, and I know there are several others who have been county \nofficials. Communities and counties are responsible for providing fire \nprotection, law enforcement, sanitation, public health, and education, \njust to name a few. They provide these services largely by raising \nrevenue. One common source is through property taxes. In States where \nthere is little federally owned land, local communities have a large \nnumber of private homeowners to help provide these services. However, \nthere are States where the Federal Government decided to retain most if \nnot a majority of its ownership of the land. The problem is that these \nFederal lands cannot be taxed.\n\n[[Page S406]]\n\nYet local governments must still provide critical fire, law \nenforcement, and health services in these areas and for the people who \nwork on them. In order to make up this shortfall, Congress created \npayment in lieu of taxes to compensate local governments to offset the \nlosses caused by having nontaxable Federal lands within their \nboundaries.\n\n  For decades, the Payment in Lieu of Taxes Program has provided \ncounties and local governments with funding to help meet critical \ncommunity needs. One of the reasons the Payment in Lieu of Taxes \nProgram was instituted was because of the creation of the Federal Land \nPolicy and Management Act, which placed a major hurdle on the Federal \nGovernment from disposing of public lands. In place of the Federal \nGovernment's ability to move land from Federal to private ownership \nCongress decided to reimburse county and local governments with \npayments that would replace the revenue lost from the property taxes \nthey would have received if those Federal lands had been transferred to \nprivate ownership. It seemed the only fair thing to do back then, and \nit is still only fair to live up to our obligations as a nation to \nprovide the States with the revenue they are losing because of the laws \nwe have enacted.\n  I have to tell you, we are talking about 1,900 counties in the United \nStates; 49 States. In some of those counties, it is 40 percent to 80 \npercent of their total revenue. That is a big cut to make--in 1 year. \nNo transition, just boom, gone. How do you adjust to that if you are \nthose local government people trying to figure out how to balance your \nbudget? After all, I am not aware of anybody who lives at the Federal \nlevel. They all live at the local level. So it is the local folks who \nhave to take care of the people.\n  If we fail to adequately address this issue, we are forcing our \ncommunities to make do with less--a lot less--because we are breaking a \npromise we have made. By doing so, we are forcing them to reduce--or \neven eliminate--the vital resources upon which their citizens rely.\n  I wish to emphasize and make it clear that this is not an additional \nsource of revenue. It is not a bonus. County and local governments \ndepend on this revenue when they plan their budgets each year. It is \npart of the law. They count on it, and without it, their budgets are \nstretched and strained and they will be bankrupt.\n  The decision by the Appropriations Committee to not include the vital \npayment in lieu of taxes funding in the omnibus will place counties \nacross the country in very difficult positions and great financial \nhardship for them all, especially since there was no transition, there \nwas no warning. It was just done.\n  We need to stop playing games with the Payment in Lieu of Taxes \nProgram and find a way to ensure it is adequately and fairly funded now \nand for years to come. We could learn a lesson from local governments. \nI remind you, that is where everyone lives. Many are obligated to have \na balanced budget. That forces communities to budget in advance, debate \npriorities, and stick to considering spending measures through the \nnormal legislative process.\n  As we look for ways to adequately fund payment in lieu of taxes, we \nalso need to be sure we are not robbing Peter to pay Paul. I was \nextremely disappointed about the provision in the conference report--\nnow, a conference report comes to us for an up-or-down vote. We do not \nhave any chance to debate them on the floor. We do not have a chance to \namend it. But the conference report for the highway reauthorization in \n2012 robbed the abandoned mine land trust fund--trust fund--to pay for \nthe payment in lieu of taxes obligation that time. They got paid, \nthough, but we stole from a trust fund to do it. Again, it was a \nconference report, so there was no opportunity for amendments on it--\njust like this omnibus. States rely on those funds to clean up high-\npriority abandoned mines. We should not pit those funds against each \nother.\n  Yes, the Federal Government is out of money. We are going to have to \nprioritize. We are going to have to move some things around. We are \ngoing to have to bring down the deficits so eventually we can hopefully \nbring down the debt. This is not the only time we have been doing this \nsort of thing.\n  Twice now we have robbed the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. \nWhere do they get their money? Any private company--private company, \nnot Federal company--any private company that has a pension fund has to \npay a tax into this Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation so that in \ncase they go out of business, the people who were promised a retirement \nwill be compensated. They will get compensated 60 percent of what they \nwere promised--just 60 percent. But we have raised that amount \ndramatically twice now on private corporations that were providing \nretirement for their workers.\n  That is all voluntary. They do not have to provide retirements for \ntheir workers. If we keep raising that amount, and it does not go to \nprovide assurance that their employees will get their retirement, why \nwould they keep their retirement going?\n  People are going to lose retirement in the United States. Nobody is \nstarting defined benefit plans right now because of the extra taxes we \nare putting on it. Twice now we have raised that price, and we have put \nit to something other than it was promised for. Here is the real \nkicker: We said that for the next 8 years we are going to steal that \nmoney, so we can spend that amount this year.\n  I am not sure it is legal. How do we force future Congresses to be \nsure to pay the money--no, we will have already spent the money--so we \nare asking them to pay back the money, and we are asking them to steal \nit out of a trust fund. We have to quit stealing from the trust funds. \nThat is the same thing with the abandoned mine land trust fund. That \nwas stealing for 10 years to pay for 2 years. We cannot keep doing \nthat.\n  Somehow we have to have the kind of budgeting we are expecting these \nlocal governments, these towns and cities and counties to do, where \nthey have to balance their budget. We do not have to balance our \nbudget. We just steal the money. But there is a point at which we \ncannot steal the money anymore.\n  What do we do now next time on the Transportation bill, when we have \nalready obligated 8 more years of the Pension Benefit Guaranty \nCorporation to the current highways? We will not have collected that \nyet. Where do we steal it from next time?\n  Infrastructure is extremely important. We are going to have to \neventually prioritize around here. We are going to have to do the same \nthing we expect of those towns and counties that we are stealing the \npayment in lieu of taxes money from in order to keep this business \nafloat.\n  The Payment in Lieu of Taxes Program represents a promise we made to \ncounties and local governments all across the Nation. They are looking \nto us to see how we will act and to see how we will keep that promise. \nIf we fail to do so, it will have an impact on almost every one of us \nwho will surely hear about the repercussions when we go back home to \nmeet with our constituents. I encourage and urge the Senate in the \nstrongest terms to reconsider the Payment in Lieu of Taxes Program and \nthe impact we may be bringing to people across the Nation by failing to \ninclude it in this legislation.\n  These are governments that--they have property taxes on the private \nproperty. What happens if the people with the private property do not \npay their taxes? The local government gets to put a lien on it and gets \nto put it on the market. Maybe that is what we ought to do with this \nFederal land: put a lien on it, put it on the market.\n  It is a debt the Federal Government said they would pay and they are \nnot paying. It is payment in lieu of property taxes. If the property \ntaxes are not paid, there is a way the local government can make up for \nit, but there is not if the Federal Government just decides to quit \npaying, and that is kind of what we did. We said taxes are hard to pay. \nIf everybody in America said taxes are hard to pay and quit paying \nthem, we would be in one heck of a fix. We cannot do that to the towns \nand counties either.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, before the Senator from Wyoming leaves \nthe floor, I wish to comment about some of the things he said about\n\n[[Page S407]]\n\nPILT and assure him that should the ambassadorship go forward for \nChina, should Ron Wyden become the chair of the Finance Committee, I \nwill become the chair of the Energy Committee, and he has my commitment \nnow to help him work on that.\n  I am very well aware, having served on that committee for 10 years, \nhow important PILT is--payment in lieu of taxes--to some of the States \nin the West, primarily less populated States. Their tax base is very \naffected by the fact that the Federal Government owns a great deal of \nland.\n  The Senator knows only 2.5 percent of my State is Federal land. \nThrough the Chair, I would like to ask the Senator what percent of his \nState is Federal land.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, 49 percent of Wyoming is Federal land. We \nunderstand the value of having some Federal land. We like the people \nwho come to visit it. But there are a lot of expenses that go with \nthat, and to just jerk the money away--right away.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes.\n  Mr. ENZI. In the committee the Senator is talking about with Senator \nWyden, what we have always talked about is a transition to do anything. \nThere are a number of ways we could transition this that I do not think \nwould hurt the Federal Government or hurt the local counties, but it \nrequires a lot of flexibility, it requires going through the regular \nprocess in committee and then coming to the floor and making some \ndecisions. This is wrong to just steal it one time.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. If I could be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I want to commit to work with the Senator. I am very \nsympathetic and understand his position, and we will be talking to the \nleadership on both sides to see what we can do. It is very hard for \nthat money to come away at such an abrupt time, and there are some \nissues that I know are pending before the committee where that could \npotentially get resolved. So I just wish to offer my help and support \nat the appropriate time.\n  (The further remarks of Ms. Landrieu are printed in today's Record \nunder ``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                         Unemployment Insurance\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, 4\\1/2\\ years ago the United States went \nthrough a terrible recession, what we now know as the great recession. \nBut since that time we have had the slowest economic recovery since the \nGreat Depression, and our labor force participation rate, which is a \nfancy way of saying the number of people, the percentage of people who \nare actually in the workforce looking for work, is much lower than it \nwas at the height of the recession. So even though the unemployment \nrate is coming down little by little, the main reason that is true is \nbecause people, many people, are simply giving up looking for work. \nLast month alone 345,000 people dropped out of the workforce. Even when \nwe look exclusively at workers between the age of 25 and 54, their \nparticipation rate is significantly lower than it was when President \nObama took office.\n  Meanwhile, 4 million people who are still in the workforce have now \nbeen jobless for more than 6 months. As I mentioned, if the Obama \neconomic recovery had been as strong as the Reagan recovery in the \n1980s, we would currently have millions more private sector jobs. So \nwhat is the President's big idea for helping the economy getting back \non track? Last night, according to published news reports, he was \ndrinking martinis and plotting his 2014 political strategy with his \nfellow Democratic Party members.\n  He apparently told the Democrats present--at least reportedly--that \nhe would continue to go it alone if he could not get bipartisan support \nfor his agenda by issuing more Executive orders. He would do that if \nRepublicans did not cave in and give him every single thing he wants on \nevery issue.\n  So rather than talking to Republicans in bipartisan discussions about \nhow we can come together on real solutions to the problems that face \nour economy and people being out of work, the President instead has \ndefaulted in favor of poll-tested ideas and political gimmicks leading \ninto the runup to the 2014 election.\n  Sipping martinis and plotting politics while millions of Americans \nare out of work shows how out of touch the President has become, and \nunfortunately so many of the folks who vote with him on each and every \nissue that comes before the Senate. But putting last night's party \naside for a moment, I would ask my friends across the aisle a few \nquestions about the recent Senate debate about unemployment insurance.\n  The first question: If extending unemployment insurance benefits for \nthe long-term unemployed is so important, why did the majority leader \nnot schedule a vote last month before those benefits expired on \nDecember 28? That is the first question.\n  Second question: Why would you want to add $6.4 billion to the \nnational debt, when the national debt is already $17.3 trillion? Why \nwould you want to do that if you knew the bill had no chance of \npassing, because Republicans were not going to agree to a bill that \nadds to the national debt?\n  You might ask whether it is hard to find $6.4 billion in an annual \nspending budget of $3.8 trillion. I will do the math for you. The $6.4 \nbillion is roughly .0017 percent of what the Federal Government spends \nin a given year. It seems to me that would be relatively easy to do.\n  In fact, Republicans had amendments that would pay for the 3-month \nextension as well as restore the pension benefits for the military that \nwere cut in the earlier budget deal. But the majority leader refused to \nallow an open amendment process that would have allowed a vote on \neither one of those. I would ask the majority leader, rhetorically--he \nis not here in the Chamber, but I am sure he has people listening--why \nis it the majority leader refused to allow any progrowth measures to \nthe final bill? Republicans had a number of amendments that would have \nimproved the education and training component of our unemployment \ncompensation system.\n  If you look at the three major causes of long-term unemployment, one \nis education. We need to deal with that. The other is family choices, \nharder for government to have an influence on. But the third is jobs \nand the job environment.\n  But the majority leader blocked every single opportunity to address \neither education reforms or job training or to deal with progrowth \nmeasures which have actually created more jobs so fewer people would \nhave to be on unemployment and more people would be able to find work, \nas I know they would prefer to do.\n  So if the majority leader and our Democratic friends who joined in \nblocking every Republican idea to either pay for it or to help improve \njob training or to improve the private sector's ability to create jobs \nand allow people to go to work, I would like to hear the answer to \nthose.\n  There is a much better way to fuel job creation, reduce unemployment, \nand promote upward mobility that does not involve playing politics \nwhile millions of Americans are looking for work. For starters, let's \npick some of the low-hanging fruit. I bet the Presiding Officer, based \non some of the remarks I have seen attributed to her, would agree with \nthis one: The Canadian Government has spent years urging President \nObama to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline, which would create thousands \nof well-paying jobs, middle-class jobs right here in the United States. \nThis administration, this President, actually promised Republicans in a \nmeeting he had with them last year that he would make a decision by the \nend of last year, 2013. We are still waiting for his decision. All we \nhear is the sound of crickets when it comes to the Keystone XL \nPipeline. But this President and this White House, this administration, \ncould effectively create those jobs with the stroke of a pen approving \nthe Keystone XL Pipeline. It does not get much easier than that.\n  Indeed, even the President's own former National Security Advisor has \nsaid publicly he thinks the President ought to do this, because this is \nnot just an economic issue, this is not just a jobs issue. Every barrel \nof oil we transport on the Keystone XL Pipeline from a friendly country \nsuch as Canada means less oil we have to import from\n\n[[Page S408]]\n\nvolatile regions of the planet such as the Middle East.\n  But beyond the pipeline issue, which is the lowest of the low-hanging \nfruit in terms of creating jobs and getting the economy moving again, \nthe Obama administration should generally stop hindering our domestic \nenergy production. We have had a renaissance in energy in America \nthanks to innovation in the private sector, primarily the now some six-\ndecades-old practice of fracking, which has gotten a bad rap in some \ncorners, but also horizontal drilling, pioneered by none other than \nGeorge Mitchell of Texas who recently passed on.\n\n  This combination of fracking and horizontal drilling has led to a \nproliferation of domestic energy supply, natural gas and oil right here \nat home. Again, every barrel, every MCF of gas we produce here \ndomestically means less energy we have to import from abroad.\n  We all know that nationwide the oil and gas industry represents a \nrare bright spot in the U.S. economy. According to one study, by 2035, \nunconventional oil and gas resources alone will be supporting 3.5 \nmillion jobs and contributing $475 billion to our economy. Why would \nnot the President and our Democratic friends embrace something like \nthat, that would create so many jobs right here in the United States, \ninstead of playing political games and plotting out the next election?\n  Yet on top of that, to make matters worse, the administration is \nproposing a proliferation of new regulations on fracking that occurs on \nFederal lands. I think my friends who perhaps are not familiar with \nthis process should listen. Fracking has been going on for at least 60 \nyears in Texas under the regulatory authority of the Texas Railroad \nCommission and local jurisdictions. But if you drill a well and you put \nthe casing in and you cement it properly, there is absolutely zero \nthreat to groundwater or drinking water, because the target of the \nfracking is deep below the surface. So by using good drilling practices \nand cementing of the casing, there is virtually zero threat to drinking \nwater and the concerns that many people have expressed but which are \nnot grounded in experience.\n  Think of it this way: If the Federal Government has made such a hash \nout of health care after ObamaCare by taking over one-sixth of the \neconomy and our national health care, what I worry about is what they \nwould do if the Federal Government decides to take over regulation of \nfracking. Because it has been handled appropriately at the State and \nlocal level. I am afraid they will make a hash out of that as well.\n  In addition to the other regulations I am concerned about, the \nadministration has announced new regulations that would impose massive \nadditional costs and deliver very little in the way of economic or \nenvironmental gains. More regulations are never a good idea if they put \nan additional burden on business and produce no tangible benefit to the \nenvironment. But they are especially harmful at a time when our \neconomic recovery is so anemic and our economic recovery remains so \nfragile. We simply need to stop placing additional burden by additional \nregulations on the vital sectors of our economy that we need in order \nto grow and prosper and create new jobs, especially when there is no \ndemonstrable environmental benefit.\n  For that matter, let's eliminate all new regulations that do not pass \na simple cost-benefit analysis. One new study shows that the Obama \nadministration has imposed more than $112 billion worth of net \nregulatory costs on the U.S. economy and added an equivalent of 158 \nmillion hours of additional paperwork on American businesses.\n  My colleagues Senator Portman and Senator Roberts have each sponsored \nnew legislation that would introduce safeguards against unnecessary \njob-killing regulations. This brings me to ObamaCare. One of the things \nthat organized labor, which was one of the biggest supporters of \nObamaCare, has now come back to the White House and complained about is \nthe fact of the incentives for employers to take what was full-time \nwork, a40-hour workweek and make it part-time work.\n  Indeed, that is because the President's health care law defines full-\ntime employment as a 30-hour workweek, so people even working part time \nhave to be provided full benefits that those on full-time work \nordinarily would qualify for.\n  But as a result, as many of these labor leaders told the President a \nfew short months ago, many Americans have had their full-time jobs \nreduced from full time to part time. This trend will only get worse as \nthe administration decides to enforce the employer mandates.\n  If the majority leader would allow, we have two bills on our side of \nthe aisle that would address that. Senator Collins of Maine and Senator \nScott of South Carolina have proposed defining full-time employment as \na 40-hour workweek that would provide some benefit and some relief to \npeople who have seen their hours cut.\n  One more example of low-hanging fruit: Republicans and Democrats both \nagree that education is a critical need to allowing for upward \nmobility.\n  With that in mind, we should be doing everything possible to support \nsuccessful education reform initiatives across the country. Yet the \nObama administration has done frequently the opposite. Witness what has \nhappened in Louisiana where the administration is trying to derail \nLouisiana's school voucher program where parents get to choose where \nthe money goes, not the government.\n  This is all very easy. Some things would be harder, such as major tax \nreform, although I would point out that until recently Members of both \nparties agreed that the goal of tax reform would be to lower marginal \nrates as we eliminate a lot of the tax expenditures or deductions or \nsubsidies or the like.\n  We want to adopt those kinds of progrowth tax reforms, but we are \nnever going to make any real progress as long as our friends across the \naisle insist on using this to raise more money for the Federal \nGovernment to spend and not reduce marginal rates--in other words, to \nbasically undermine the benefit of progrowth tax reform only in order \nto get an additional $1 trillion or $2 trillion to spend.\n  The stalemate on tax reform reflects a broader problem in Washington. \nDespite the long-term unemployment crisis and despite the massive drop \nof people in the workforce and actually looking for work, the President \nhas still failed to put forth any serious job creation agenda. Sure, he \nwants the government to take more of your hard-earned tax dollars and \nspend them, because he thinks the government can do a better job than \nyou can spending your own money, but it hasn't worked. Jobs and the \neconomy remain Americans' top concerns. Yet, unfortunately, the \nPresident is already now in full reelection mode, recognizing that in \nhis second term his ability to get things done is going to be highly \ndependent on the midterm elections in November 2014. Hence, rather than \nworking with Republicans to try to address these problems, there are \nteam meetings at the White House sipping martinis and planning strategy \nfor November 2014.\n  Americans deserve better. They deserve a comprehensive job creation \nagenda that includes serious tax reform, serious regulatory reform, and \nserious health care reform, an agenda that makes it easier for business \nto hire workers and easier for families to pursue the American dream. \nWe have done our best to propose such an agenda but, unfortunately, we \nare still waiting for the majority leader and the President to take us \nup on that offer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I am going to speak briefly. My Republican colleague \nacross the aisle has noted he would like to speak next.\n  I want to take a moment and talk about what has been unfolding on \nCapitol Hill, with the House, Senate, the Republican caucus, and the \nDemocratic caucus working together to produce an appropriations bill, a \nspending bill, a bill we refer to in Congress as an omnibus, meaning \nthat it covers all 12 sections that are normally allocated within the \nappropriations or spending bill world.\n  I am a new member of the Appropriations Committee. This is the first \ntime I can stand on the floor and feel as though I have gone through a \nprocess that is something similar to what our colleagues have done in a \nbipartisan way over many generations. But that bipartisan collaboration \nhas been sorely missing in the time since I first\n\n[[Page S409]]\n\ncame to the Senate. I am pleased to see in this particular moment it is \na ray of hope that perhaps we can restore a rational budgeting and \nspending bill process to address the issues facing America.\n  I was delighted that Senator Murray led the Senate, working with \nCongressman Ryan, to produce a budget that went through both Chambers.\n  I am very pleased that our two leaders in the Senate, the Senator \nfrom Maryland and the Senator from Alabama, brought the two sides \ntogether to work with the House to produce this spending bill, because \nin the absence of a spending bill that has been deliberated on, what we \nhave is a continuing resolution--which means we might continue to keep \nspending the money as we did in the past, even though the needs of the \npresent have diverged from the needs of the past. That is inherently \nwasteful to keep doing the same thing we did before when different \nchallenges are presenting themselves to our Nation.\n  I wanted to note a few of the things that were done in the course of \nthis bill that I think are very relevant to the challenges we face in \nOregon.\n  Let me start with the Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program. When I \nwent over to visit Oregon's men and women in uniform in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, they said: When we come home, we hope we will have a job, \nand we hope our public leaders will work to try to help those jobs be \nthere.\n  Indeed, when someone comes out of that theatre of war and back into \ncivil society, the structure of a job is very important to your sense \nof purpose, your sense of rhythm, your financial stability, your role \nin the family. So we have in Oregon a robust Yellow Ribbon \nReintegration Program to help bring employers together with our men and \nwomen who were in uniform overseas but have now come home. We have so \nmany who serve in the Guard who have gone overseas. They don't come \nhome to work on a military base and still have a daily rhythm, they \ncome home to civilian life.\n  Restoring and preserving this Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program \nthat was done in this bill is very important to many of our men and \nwomen who were in uniform overseas and have come home. It was zeroed \nout in the President's budget. It was restored in this process. I was \ndelighted to be part of the effort to make sure that happened.\n  A second item that is very important to Oregon is hazardous fuels \nreduction in our national forests. Our forests are dryer than they were \nbefore. We have more lightning strikes due to the changing weather \npatterns and, therefore, we have had more acres, thousands of acres, \nburning.\n  We need to invest not only on the back end when there is a fire, we \nneed to invest in the front end to thin out the forests that are \novergrown, to get rid of the fuels that are on the floor of the forest \nthat increase fire intensity and make it more likely that the fire will \ngo from the ground of the forest to the canopy and be out of control. \nThose funds were dramatically cut by the administration and largely \nrestored in the appropriations process. We need more in that area. We \nneed to do more on the front end, but it was a big step forward to do \nwhat was done in this bill.\n  A third issue affecting Oregon is small ports. The last fiscal year \nthere was no set-aside for small ports. I have many small ports on the \nPacific coast of Oregon, as I know many States have ports on either \ncoast or the gulf coast. These small ports are very important to our \neconomy, and they shouldn't be neglected. The set-aside is very \nimportant to make sure they have the chance to repair their barriers, \ntheir breakwaters, to dredge out the slips or to dredge the anchorage \nin general, and so this is very good.\n  What about the debris that has been floating over from the tsunami in \nJapan and then cleaned up on the Oregon coast? Yes, this bill says yes, \nthe funds that are available can be used to reimburse the communities \nthat had to do this on their own because we had not yet acted in this \nChamber to provide them with resources. That too is addressing an \nevolving issue.\n  I want to speak particularly to the investment in education, the \nextra $1 billion for Head Start and the extra $1 billion that will go \nto support IDEA and title I funding, large formula allocations.\n  We have 200 school districts in Oregon. Those school districts are \noften way too small to have a grant writer to compete in some \nnewfangled competition for X, Y, or Z. They need core funds to reduce \nthe number of students in the classroom, to address the challenge of \nproviding education for students with disabilities. This budget helps \nsignificantly in that direction.\n  I wish to say thank you again to the leadership that was displayed, \nthe bipartisan leadership of the Senator from Alabama and the Senator \nfrom Maryland. Well done. I am honored to be part of this process of \ntrying to shape our Senate spending plan, our congressional spending \nplan, to address emerging challenges in America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n\n\n                                Benghazi\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Earlier today Senator Graham and Senator McCain spoke to \nthis issue. I could not speak at that time as I had a conflict, but my \nremarks are pertinent to the issue they spoke about.\n  It has been an agonizing 16 months. But this week, through the \ninvestigation efforts of the House Armed Services Committee and the \nSenate Intelligence Committee, we have learned that circumstances \nsurrounding the terrorist attacks on our U.S. consulate in Benghazi and \nthe murder of four Americans, as told by this investigation, simply are \nnot factual.\n  A year of news reporting and these congressional findings confirms an \negregious disconnect between what the administration has alleged and \nthe facts of what happened. As we say in Kansas, simply put: It just \ndoesn't add up.\n  We now know this tragedy did not have to happen and, most certainly, \nthe hard-to-understand actions and behaviors of those involved have \nadded unneeded hubris, scandal, and conduct difficult to comprehend. \nThis is a mess that still has to be cleaned up. It demands clarity, \nhonesty, and simply owning up to the truth.\n  I come to the floor to discuss this tragedy not so much as a \nRepublican Senator from Kansas, but always a Marine. I fear our lack of \ntruth and understanding has broken a bond that those who risked their \nlives for our Nation all share and believe in--the bond that if they \ncome in harm's way, we have their backs, and we will be there for them. \nThis is a speech I wish I never had to make. But I feel compelled to \nmake my plea to this administration yet again--specifically to \nPresident Obama--to give the American people and the families whose \nlives were lost in Benghazi a full accounting. It is long overdue.\n  A month after the attacks I wrote the President, as a Marine, with \nthe deepest concern regarding his personal handling, and that of his \nadministration, of the Benghazi attacks and the damage it continues to \ndo to that sacred bond our men and women in uniform have of sacrifice \nfor each other. That extends to those who serve our country overseas in \na civilian capacity as well.\n  I am once again asking this President, our Commander in Chief, to \nactively restore the trust and sincerity once made with that promise \nnever to leave anybody behind. If he and others responsible for this \ntragedy do not restore this trust, I truly believe the future morale \nand effectiveness of our military services are at stake.\n  As I travel through Kansas and speak with my constituents, regardless \nof their background, they want to know what really happened in Benghazi \nand why. Why has it taken so long to get the answers?\n  Many asked me directly, when will the President be forthright with \nthe families of those killed and injured in the attacks? When will the \nPresident stop covering up the bad decisions made on September 11, \n2012? Most emphatically they say, please, please, do not forget about \nBenghazi.\n  However, the response has been a dogged all too familiar tactic of \ndelay, nonresponse, and the hope that somehow tomorrow it will all go \naway. Well, this is not going away.\n\n  I applaud my colleagues on the House Armed Services Committee for the \nrecent release of 450 pages documenting these classified hearings held \nover the\n\n[[Page S410]]\n\npast year. I applaud my colleagues on the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence for their report released yesterday detailing the events \nsurrounding the attacks. The headlines from this report now read: \n``Benghazi could have been prevented.''\n  While the results of these investigations have brought more truth to \nlight, they have also brought more questions to mind. As a Marine, I \nknow there is no mission our Marines cannot accomplish or complete. If \npress reports are accurate, I do not understand why our Marine rapid \nresponse unit was delayed by an hour--required to change out of their \nuniforms into plain civilian clothing--and then, ultimately, simply \nturned away.\n  Our commanders have testified it was the State Department that \ndeclined the Marines in Benghazi, yet they have been reluctant to point \nthe finger at the State Department. Somebody made this call. Someone \ngave this order. Facts are stubborn things, and as more relevant facts \nare now becoming public, the obvious questions increase.\n  In the Senate Intelligence Committee's report--and I urge every \nMember to read this report because it is a good report--it is made \nclear that individuals within the administration have continued to \nstonewall Congress from the truth. I am not going to go into every \ndetail here on the floor--it is all here in this report--but enough is \nenough.\n  Congress has the constitutional duty to ensure the Executive Branch \ndoes not abuse its power. That power has been abused. No one who has \nplayed a role in this debacle has been held accountable--no one--let \nalone brought to justice, as promised by the President. In fact, just \nthe opposite. We have released individuals who have returned to start \nworking on the next terrorist attack.\n  Likewise, this report makes it clear U.S. personnel raised alarms for \nmonths before the attacks. Requests for additional security were made \nby the previous Ambassador as early as February 2012. Yet, the State \nDepartment's Deputy Assistant Secretary for International Programs, \nCharlene Lamb, rejected the request because Libya was a ``political \ngame,'' and the administration did not want to ``look bad,'' according \nto the Senate Intelligence Committee's report.\n  The absurdity and egregious behavior of putting politics before \nsecurity is overwhelming. Lives were at stake. It has been confirmed \nthat our top military leaders, General Ham, General Dempsey, and \nSecretary Panetta, knew immediately--immediately--this was a terrorist \nattack and not a protest. And so did the President.\n  We knew AQIM, AQAP, the Muhammad Jamal Network, and Ansar al-\nShariah--founded by Sufian bin Qumu, a former detainee--were all \ninvolved. This just raises more questions. Why were there no \ncontingency plans in place? We had actionable intelligence. The British \nleft. The Red Cross left. There certainly were no flags flying in \nBenghazi by any western nation, and the consulate had already been \nattacked.\n  Why didn't we deploy immediately, with the assumption there would be \nfollow-on attacks? Why were those who paid the ultimate sacrifice left \nto their own devices that day--on September 11--that anyone could \nanticipate would bring trouble?\n  Our generals have testified the United States was not even looking at \nLibya, but rather Tunisia, Egypt, and Sudan. Less than 1 year after \nQadhafi, and no one was concerned about safety in Libya? Does anyone \nbelieve this assessment? Given the turmoil and danger, did the State \nDepartment really believe that we could normalize Libya? That the \ncountry was stable?\n  This has been an incredible example of condescending arrogance and \nelitism, putting politics and personal agenda ahead of protecting the \nlives of Americans. The insult is that 16 months later we still can't \nget the truth. We now know, without a shadow of doubt, there was \nactionable intelligence. Yet no action was taken. I personally, as a \nSenator and, yes, as a Marine, am fed up with the lack of \naccountability this administration has taken in response.\n  I am fed up with the stonewalling by several of those in the State \nDepartment who have ignored a request from the Intelligence Committee \nfor testimony.\n  When then Secretary Clinton came before Congress to testify, she \nreplied: ``What difference does it make?'' The difference is our \nAmbassador and three other patriots did not have to die. The families \nof Ambassador Stevens, Sean Smith, Tyrone Woods, and Glen Doherty \ndeserve better from this country. They deserve more from this \nPresident.\n  With that in mind, I want to make a simple and very respectful \nrequest of the President. I simply ask that he take the opportunity \nduring his State of the Union speech on Tuesday, January 28, to give \nthose families and all Americans the whole story.\n  Mr. President, I simply ask that you be forthright with the American \npeople. Help us get beyond this tragedy. Help us restore confidence and \nfaith for our personnel serving overseas and in harm's way, that the \nsacred bond of always having their back is not gone.\n  Yesterday I had the opportunity to speak with 40 young Marines, all \nsecond lieutenants, who are just about to finish The Basic School at \nQuantico, VA. They are going to be great officers. I hope someday some \nof them will be Senators and Congressmen. I looked each one of them in \ntheir eyes and let them know, because they needed to know, that a \nbipartisan majority in this Senate has not forgotten about that \npromise--the same promise that was made to me when I joined the Corps. \nI say to President Obama: I hope you can make that promise again soon, \ntoo.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Madam President, the omnibus funding \nbill before the Senate today is a remarkable accomplishment and a \nwelcome reminder that Congress can function effectively when Members \nare willing to sit down and work through their differences. The large \nmargin by which the omnibus passed in the House is a testament to the \nbipartisan nature of the agreement and to the determination, skill, and \nleadership of Chairwoman Mikulski and Congressman Rogers.\n  With passage of this bill in the Senate, the threat of another \ngovernment shutdown is averted and the crippling effects of the \nsequester will be reversed.\n  America's vets are well served by this agreement. As chairman of the \nSenate's Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and \nRelated Agencies, I worked to provide the VA with robust funding to \nensure our vets receive the benefits they have earned and deserved.\n  The bill provides $63.2 billion for the VA, $2.3 billion above last \nyear. It fully funds a host of vital programs, including compensation, \npensions and health care, and it targets funding for crucial \ninitiatives for homeless vets, rural health care, medical research, \nsuicide prevention, women vets, and Iraq and Afghanistan vets, to name \njust a few.\n  Of major importance, the agreement also includes a comprehensive plan \nto address the massive backlog of vets' disability claims. In 2013 the \nbacklog of compensation claims for service-related disabilities soared \nto record levels. In March of 2013 the backlog of claims pending for \nmore than 125 days had grown to over 630,000 claims--more than 70 \npercent of the total claims pending. As of this week there are 403,761 \nclaims in the backlog.\n  The Department has made substantial progress over the past several \nmonths, but thousands of vets continue to face lengthy delays in having \ntheir disability claims processed. In response to this problem, I \nincluded in the omnibus a 10-point action plan to give the VA \nadditional tools to address the claims backlog and to strengthen \ntraining, oversight and accountability. This includes important \nupgrades to computer hardware in VA regional offices and $100 million \nin overtime and training money to work through the backlog in \nprocessing vets' disability claims.\n  It is critical we do not sacrifice accuracy in the name of \nexpediency, and my plan also includes quality review teams, spot \naudits, and additional training for claims processors.\n  Of special importance to South Dakota, I have worked hard to expand \nVA health care to rural vets. Nationwide, nearly 30 percent of \nAmerica's vets live\n\n[[Page S411]]\n\nin rural areas that are often far from major VA medical centers or \nclinics. The omnibus appropriations bill builds on the rural health \ninitiative I launched in fiscal year 2009 to close gaps in VA medical \ncare in rural and remote areas. The bill provides $250 million for \nrural health care, including telehealth and mobile clinics for vets in \nrural and highly rural areas, including Native American populations.\n  Our vets deserve the best and highest quality care from the VA. The \nfiscal year 2014 omnibus appropriations bill provides the VA with \nsignificant new tools and funding to carry out its mission, and I look \nforward to the bill's prompt passage.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I thank the Senator from South Dakota \nfor all the great work he has done at the subcommittee level. He has an \nenormous responsibility in that subcommittee. It is all about military \nconstruction--over there and here.\n  Many don't realize our military bases are really towns, and they need \nroads and water supplies. If you talk to a garrison commander, such as \nthose in Maryland, they are small cities. Fort Meade employs over \n35,000 people in Maryland--that is a lot of people--from those who work \nin the commissary to some of our most sensitive national security \nprojects.\n  So he has done a great job. But what he has really thrown his heart \ninto is veterans. His son is a veteran. One of the things early in my \nchairmanship we discussed was this issue of the veterans' disability \nbacklog. Senator Johnson led the way, along with Senator Mark Kirk, his \nranking member, on extensive hearings and due diligence, where we don't \nthrow money at the problem, but we really work on solving the \nproblem. There are very specific line items here that should help with \nthis review process. But, as Senator Johnson has said, also accuracy, \nbecause if they are not accurate then they present other problems, \neither for the veteran or for the taxpayer.\n\n  He has done a great job. In another way he chairs the Banking \nCommittee as the authorizer, of which the Presiding Officer is well \naware, and his wise counsel for many of the aspects we needed to deal \nwith on financial services was most welcome.\n  I must say to the Senator he is a great Member. The way he and \nSenator Kirk worked was outstanding. Senator Kirk himself is a veteran, \na Naval Reserve officer. They knew just how to tackle the problem, and \ntackle it they did. I think veterans all over should know we are going \nto meet their health care needs. We are going to deal with the \ndisability backlog area. We are also going to make a downpayment on \nthis working-age military COLA for both the disabled and the survivors. \nAnd we are going to say: Promises made, promises kept.\n  I thank the Senator and his counterpart Senator Kirk. We appreciate \nwhat they have done. I think it has been an enrichment to the overall \nbill to have done what has been done in the Military-VA.\n  Madam President, we are waiting for other Senators to come to the \nfloor. I have to talk about my own subcommittee.\n  I chair the Commerce, Justice, Science Subcommittee, and my ranking \nmember is also the vice chairman of the full committee, Senator Shelby. \nWe worked very hard on this bill, also with our counterparts in the \nHouse, Chairman Frank Wolf and Ranking Member Chaka Fattah. The CJS \nbill we agreed upon provides $51.6 billion in discretionary spending. \nIt focused on community safety, on our jobs and our economy. We used \nthose priorities to guide funding decisions, from Federal law \nenforcement to space exploration. What could keep America safe? What \ncould make America great? We cannot have vital communities unless they \nare safe.\n  The CJS bill has money in here for key grants to help State and local \npolice departments. The legislation we worked on adds money toward the \nCOPS Program that will put cops on the beat.\n  We also want to deal with the prevention of violence as well as the \nprevention of crime. This bill includes money for the Violence Against \nWomen Act, $29 million more than sequester. What it will mean is more \nhelp to local enforcement to prosecute, more money to help with \nprevention for those who are victims of domestic violence and to be \nable to provide lifesaving shelters and then transitional housing. We \nare very proud of that.\n  As we add more police to the streets and neighborhoods in our \ncommunities, we want to make sure the police are safe, and we were able \nto have funding in here to provide a grant program to buy bulletproof \nvests. We are often disturbed when we talk to our local police chiefs \nthat the crooks and drug dealers and bums have better equipment, \ntechnology, better guns, more rapid guns, or they have bulletproof \nvests while our police officers are out there defending us without \nvests. We wanted to make sure our officers have what they need.\n  We also have money in here to deal with prevention. We have money for \nyouth mentoring programs but also to tackle gang violence in our \ncommunities.\n  This is where bipartisanship really worked. Our colleague Senator \nKirk of Illinois, who struggled with terrific gang problems in Chicago, \nacknowledges we have gang problems in every city. He worked very hard \nto present to the committee a gang violence program and we were able to \nput money in that so that there can be local solutions.\n  Acknowledging that indeed schools need to be safe, we also helped \ncreate a grant program, modest in funds, where local police departments \nworking with the Department of Education and the parents can come up \nwith ways to keep those schools safe.\n  This bill also has a strong focus on cyber security where we have \nmoney in here to fund the Department of Justice, to prevent attacks in \ncase criminals, particularly organized crime, are behind the keyboard. \nBefore it was Al Capone raiding banks. Now it is hackers, both in this \ncountry and around the world, stealing credit cards, stealing our \nidentity. Over 46 million people were victimized. This provides money \nparticularly to the FBI and the National Institutes of Standards to \ndevelop the tools and techniques and actually implement them to do it \nand to work with the private sector on advice and guidance on what \nsteps they could take voluntarily to be able to protect themselves.\n  We also funded Federal law enforcement. In this legislation we have \nadded more money for the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Agency, and the U.S. \nMarshals.\n  What is the U.S. Marshals? Is this the days of Wyatt Earp? Do they \nride the range? Actually they ride our roads, making sure they are \ngoing after the most-wanted fugitives. When we have on TV the 10 most \nwanted, it is the marshals who are in hot pursuit, with the authority \nto go across State lines. They do it. They also have the legislative \nmandate to implement the sexual predator laws. They are the ones who \nare charged with actually finding, identifying, to make sure they are \nfiling their registration, and keeping our children safe. Then they are \ncharged with the responsibility of keeping our courthouses safe. You \nmay recall a few years ago the terrible shootout in Atlanta. Many of \nour courthouses themselves could be in danger. Because of the violence \nwhen you have these types of prosecutions, they can also invite \nviolence against the judges. These marshals do that job. We believe \nwhile the high profile agencies may be the FBI and DEA, and we \nrecognize that, there is also the Marshals Service.\n  In the area of science, Senator Shelby of Alabama, my ranking member, \nand I also funded America's space program. This total funding will be \n$17.6 billion. Working with Senator Shelby, we wanted to have a \nbalanced space program to assure America's premier leadership in human \nspace exploration and in space science and also in aeronautics. We \nworked with the SLS rocket, which will take human beings beyond the \nEarth orbit. The bill has $1.6 billion for that development. But we \nalso funded operations and research on the International Space Station.\n  The Presiding Officer might have read recently that NASA has extended \nthe duration and operation of the space station. It costs a lot of \nmoney to build it and there was a lot of risk of human lives to go up \nthere and assemble it. ``Gravity'' might win in the Academy\n\n[[Page S412]]\n\nAwards, but we have real-life astronauts who keep that space station \ntogether, kept it operating, and now that we have been able to \naccomplish it, it is time to do the compelling research that could be \ndone only by a lab in the sky in microgravity or no gravity at all, to \nbe able to do this. We look forward to being able to conduct the \nresearch.\n  Also, because we are Americans and we believe in the private sector, \nwe now will have commercially crewed vehicles going to the space \nstation. It is going to be amazing.\n  We had the space shuttle. What a workhorse the space shuttle was. It \ntook astronauts, researchers, up to the space station. That useful life \ncame to an end. We depend on the Russians, with the Soyuz, to do that. \nWe appreciate that, making the Soyuz available--I might add at a really \nhefty, hefty, hefty price. But we know we wanted to have our own way of \ngetting up there. Thanks to the development of commercial crews--again \nthe American way of competition for the best, most safe vehicle, at the \nbest price--they are going to be able to do it.\n  I am very proud that a company based in Virginia but hiring \nMarylanders, Orbital, has a rocket being launched from Wallops Island \nthat now takes cargo, an unmanned vehicle taking cargo--not risking the \nlife of an astronaut, taking cargo to the station.\n  We also have funding for space science to understand and protect the \nplanet. We think we have done a very good job in that.\n  Also in the area of science, yes, funding for the National Science \nFoundation and also in weather, what we have done in terms of weather. \nMost people think they get weather from the Weather Channel. I bet if \nthey are from Boston, like the Presiding Officer, you are mesmerized by \nit. But the Weather Channel gets its information from the Weather \nService that is operated by NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration. We want to make sure we have the best mathematical \nmodels and the best satellites working with international partners to \nmake sure we make the best weather forecasts. It saves lives and it \nalso saves money.\n  For every mile we can be accurate in the prediction of a hurricane, \nwe save $1 million in evacuation costs. In Maryland, Ocean City, we are \nvulnerable. So every dollar we can save--and Key West--all of us, \nhurricanes, or a nor'easter--we will understand that. We have put money \nin there. And we have done other things to promote the economy. I am \nproud of what we did in Commerce, Justice to keep America safe, to do \nthe jobs today and the jobs tomorrow.\n  I note the subcommittee chairman on Labor, Health and Human Services, \nand Education is here.\n  I yield the floor and such time as he may use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I come to the floor to speak in favor of \nthe Omnibus appropriations bill we now have before us. First and \nforemost, it is noteworthy that this is a bill, not a continuing \nresolution. For the first time in years, Congress has returned to \nregular order in the appropriations process. Senior members of the \nAppropriations Committee from both parties have come together to \nnegotiate their priorities, program by program.\n  As the chairman of the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human \nServices, Education, and Related Agencies, I view this as a huge step \nonto a better path. The Labor-H bill, as it is sometimes called, has \nbeen in continuing resolution every other year since 2009. This is an \nirresponsible way to allocate $160 billion in taxpayer funds, and I am \npleased that we are putting a stop to that kind of destructive trend \ntoday.\n\n  For the past year I have had people come up to me and say: There is \nno way you are going to have an agreement on Labor-HHS. Labor-HHS will \nbe left behind, and it will be folded into a continuing resolution.\n  I guess no one could imagine that Democrats and Republicans would be \nable to sit down and come to a fair agreement on health and education \nissues. I think that attitude sold our subcommittee short. I am proud \nto say we have worked out a fair agreement with my ranking member \nSenator Jerry Moran from Kansas, as well as my colleagues on the House \nside, including Chairman Jack Kingston and ranking member Congressman \nRosa DeLauro. No one got 100 percent of what they wanted in this bill, \nwhich is often a sign of a pretty good deal.\n  Despite the fact that I wanted to do more to alleviate the disaster \ncuts for 2013, I would like to speak about a few of the essential \ninvestments in this bill that I hope my colleagues will join me in \nsupporting.\n  First, the bill advances my long-standing priority of shifting the \nAmerican health care system--so-called--from a sick care system to a \ngenuine health care system, emphasizing prevention, wellness, and \npublic health. It provides a $1 billion increase for the National \nInstitutes of Health, as well as major new funding for brain research \nand a new initiative to discover ways to prevent and cure Alzheimer's \ndisease.\n  In addition, this bill allocates nearly $1 billion from the \nPrevention and the Public Health Fund, which I created in the \nAffordable Care Act, title IV, which I was in charge of drafting. There \nhas been some confusion about this fund in news reports, so I will \ncorrect the record.\n  In the past years resources from the fund have been diverted to other \nhealth care purposes. This year, however, this omnibus allocates 100 \npercent of the resources from the fund to prevention and wellness \nactivities. It has been reported that the omnibus cuts or eliminates \nthe fund. I read that in the paper this morning. I read that the \nprevention and wellness fund was cut by $1 billion.\n  Well, that is just not so. That is a misinterpretation. Believe me, \nif they cut $1 billion from prevention and wellness, I would not be \nhere supporting the bill. Section 219 of division H of this bill \nallocates the money, so that is what we did. Far from eliminating the \nmoney, we identify where that money is to go, including $160 million \nfor immunization programs, $104 million for cancer screenings, and $105 \nmillion for smoking cessation programs. On October 1, another \nappropriation of $1 billion will be deposited in the fund under the \nAffordable Care Act, and, again, I intend to allocate the fund just as \nwe did in this omnibus.\n  If there is any doubt in anyone's mind that the fund is alive and \nwell and fulfilling the purpose for which it was intended, consider \nthis: The American Public Health Association has praised this Omnibus \nbill specifically for allocating the prevention fund. They said:\n\n       We are also pleased that the bill fully allocates available \n     funds from the Prevention and Public Health Fund for the \n     first time.\n\n  As the author of that fund, I consider the allocation of these \nresources to prevention and wellness as a major achievement in this \nbill.\n  This bill also includes significant new investments to support early \nlearning initiatives. We included an increase of over $1 billion for \nHead Start, which will more than restore cuts from sequestration. \nNearly half of that increase will be used to expand early Head Start \nfor kids from birth through age 3. In addition, the bill provides $250 \nmillion which can be used to help States develop high-quality early \nlearning programs for low- and middle-income 4-year-olds. Both of these \ninvestments improve access to high-quality early learning experiences \nfor children from birth to kindergarten. I truly believe these \ninvestments lay the foundation for future prosperity by preparing \nAmerica's next generation.\n  One of the reasons it is important to reassess programs every year is \nto respond to current events and changing needs. The Nation was \ndevastated by the tragic shootings that occurred last year in Newtown, \nCT. This bill provides increased resources for providing the mental \nhealth and school safety activities we have been talking about for over \na year. The bill includes $140 million--an increase of $29 million--for \nspecific activities that support safe school environments. The bill \nalso provides $1.13 billion--an increase of $213 million--for mental \nhealth programs, such as mental health first aid training grants, the \nNational Child Traumatic Stress Initiative, suicide prevention, and the \nmental health block grant.\n  Other highlights of this bill: It supports the economic recovery by \nproviding workers with job training and by protecting workers' rights. \nIn education, it makes it possible for the\n\n[[Page S413]]\n\nmaximum Pell grant to rise by an estimated $85, to $5,730 this year. It \nallocates an additional $700 million for community health centers, \nwhich is so important to my State of Iowa and, quite frankly, to every \nState in this Nation. It provides higher funding for activities that \nsupport safe and healthy workplaces and, as I said, school \nenvironments.\n  Most in Washington know that the staff of the Appropriations \nCommittee worked diligently on this bill all through the holidays. We \nall appreciate and commend their excellent work. I would like to thank \nthese unsung heroes for all of the long days and nights and weekends \nthey worked.\n  I first wish to thank my clerk, the head of my group on Labor-HHS, \nAdrienne Hallett, and her team: Mark Laisch, Lisa Bernhardt, Mike \nGentile, Robin Juliano, Kelly Brown, and Teri Curtin. On the minority \nside, I thank Laura Frih-Dell, Jennifer Castagna, and Chol Pak.\n  I also thank Chuck Keifer and Gabriel Batkin--on the full committee--\nfor their hard work and diligence and for sticking with us through this \nto make sure we got it done. On the minority side, I thank Bill Duhnke \nfor all his hard work.\n  I also thank the two principals who are here today. First, I will \nthank my longtime friend, going back to our days in the House together, \nSenator Dick Shelby from Alabama. These were long and tough \nnegotiations, but the one thing I have always appreciated about my \nfriend from Alabama is that he is fairminded and willing to negotiate. \nHe understands it is a two-way highway around here. You give a little, \nyou take a little, and we work these things out. Again, I thank my \nfriend for hanging in there and getting this hammered out.\n\n  There are not enough accolades in my book or any book I know that has \nbeen written to say what a great job Senator Barbara Mikulski did. She \ngave it her all and really worked hard with Senator Shelby and her \ncounterparts on the House side to bring this bill to fruition.\n  There were a lot of doubters who said: No, we won't get it done; they \nare not going to be able to hammer it out.\n  Barbara Mikulski never gave up. She was willing to stay there for \nlong hours days on end to get this job done. Again, I think a lot of us \nwho served on the Appropriations Committee for a long time--30 years \nfor me--I guess in all the time I was on appropriations, we had four \nchairmen. We had John Stennis from Mississippi when I first got here \nand, of course, Senator Byrd, Senator Ted Stevens from Alaska, and \nSenator Dan Inouye from Hawaii. We think of them as sort of the giants \nof the Senate, which is a well-earned accolade or praise, I might say. \nPeople probably wondered what would happen now that they are gone. We \nhad the sad passing a year ago of Dan Inouye. Well, I can tell you, no \nlonger are they wondering who is going to take over the Appropriations \nCommittee. Senator Mikulski has stepped in and pulled us all together--\nI think on both sides of the aisle--and worked this out. Again, I give \nmy highest compliments to Senator Mikulski for her hard work, her \nintellectual approach, and her rigor in working with others to make \nsure we got to this point.\n  Most in Washington, as I said, know that our staff works very hard, \nbut there is just one other person I want to single out. He is not \nhere. In fact, he is not even on the Senate side, but I worked with him \nfor a long time, going back to when Congressman Obey chaired the House \ncommittee on Labor-HHS back in the early 1990s. He has been a longtime \nmember of the House appropriations staff. David Reich is currently the \nminority clerk for Labor-HHS. He is retiring once this bill passes. \nDavid has spent nearly his entire career working on the issues in this \nbill. He has been on or around the Labor-HHS subcommittee since 1996. \nHis collaborative nature, his insightful questions, and his thoughtful \napproach to the drafting of this bill will be sincerely missed. I wish \nDavid well and thank him for his dedicated public service to our \ncountry and especially to this committee.\n  In light of the investments I mentioned, plus many more that I simply \ndon't have time to talk about, I urge all of my colleagues to support \nthe Omnibus appropriations bill. Given the tight overall budget, these \nare all remarkable achievements.\n  I have always taken pride in the fact that the Labor-HHS bill, as it \nis called--Labor, Health and Human Services, Education bill--is a bill \nwhere we invest in America's human infrastructure, and that is what \nthis bill does. We have had to make some tough choices, but this new \nbill lives up to that high calling of investing in America's human \ninfrastructure.\n  Again, I thank my friend and colleague from Alabama. We were together \non the Labor-HHS committee until he took the position as the ranking \nmember on the full Appropriations Committee, but we always had good \ncomity of working together, and I appreciate it very much.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I would like to respond to some of the \nremarks by my colleague and friend from Iowa. I think he is right on \npoint when he said this is the first time we have been able to bring \nthe appropriations process--I hope--back to regular order, which is \nwhat we need. No one wants to shut the government down. My goodness, \nneither side wants to do that. It is no good, and the American people \ndon't want it. This is a good bipartisan effort. Senator Mikulski and \nother members of the Appropriations Committee have worked together.\n  I have been at odds sometimes--and a lot of times together--with \nSenator Harkin. I first met him 35 years ago when I first went to the \nHouse. He had been there a couple of years--a veteran. We have worked \ntogether on a lot of issues.\n  Senator Harkin is absolutely right when he says we can't say enough \nabout the leadership of the chairperson of this committee, Senator \nMikulski. She has reached out to both sides. She wants the process to \nwork, as do most of us, and this is an example of that.\n  I hope later this afternoon that we are going to get a good vote, \njust as the House did, on this bill. This a big step in how we should \nbe running the government.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                         USE OF FUNDS FOR GUAM\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I rise today together with Senate Armed \nServices Chairman Levin and Senator McCain to clarify the intent of \nsection 8102 of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act contained \nin the consolidated appropriations bill, 2014. This language should not \nbe interpreted to supersede section 2822 of the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014.\n  I concur with the reporting requirements and limitations established \nby section 2822 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal \nYear 2014 and fully expect the Department of Defense to comply with \nthem prior to obligating funds for projects in Guam.\n  We have also sent a letter to Secretary Hagel from me, Vice Chairman \nCochran, and Chairman Frelinghuysen and Ranking Member Visclosky of the \nHouse Defense Appropriations Subcommittee directing the Department to \ncomply with the requirements in section 2822 prior to obligating funds.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the joint letter sent \nto Secretary Hagel on this subject be printed in the Record.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator from Illinois for addressing this \nimportant issue. I appreciate both his assessment and his clarification \nof the relationship between the provision in the National Defense \nAuthorization Act and the provision in the DOD Appropriations Act. \nSenator McCain and I have spent a long time working on this issue, and \nwe believe that the reporting requirements and limitations established \nby section 2822 are in the best interests of the Department of Defense \nand the country. I appreciate the willingness of the Senator from \nIllinois to work with us to ensure that the Department abides by this \nprovision.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank Senate Armed Services Chairman Levin for working \nwith me to clarify language in the consolidated appropriations bill of \n2014 that directly contravenes section 2822 of the Fiscal Year 2014 \nNational Defense Authorization Act. To date, Congress has not received \nsufficient cost-analysis supporting the Department of\n\n[[Page S414]]\n\nDefense's proposed movement of troops from Okinawa to Guam. For this \nreason, in the authorization bill, the Armed Services Committees \nexplicitly prohibited any premature investments in Guam until the \nSecretary of Defense provides Congress with, among other things, a \nreport on military resources necessary to execute the U.S. force \nposture strategy in the Asia-Pacific region.\n  I also appreciate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman Durbin \nfor agreeing that the reporting requirements in section 2822 of the \nNDAA must be satisfied before the Department of Defense can obligate \nfunds for investments in Guam if the report finds they are needed. In \nfurtherance of these requirements, I fully expect the Senate Armed \nServices Committee will provide close and careful oversight over the \nuse of any monies that may be appropriated for the transfer of forces \ncovered in this section and obligated by the Department for that \npurpose and, specifically, hold hearings to determine the extent to \nwhich any plan to realign forces from Okinawa to Guam will sufficiently \nsupport our operational requirements in the Asia-Pacific region.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chairman and Senator McCain for their \nleadership on this issue.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 15, 2014.\n     Hon. Chuck Hagel,\n     Secretary of Defense, U.S. Department of Defense, The \n         Pentagon, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Hagel: We are writing to clarify the intent \n     of Section 8102 of the Department of Defense Appropriations \n     Act contained in the Consolidated Appropriations Bill, 2014. \n     This language should not be interpreted in any way to \n     supersede Section 2822 of the National Defense Authorization \n     Act for Fiscal Year 2014 (Public Law 113-66).\n       We concur with the direction contained in the National \n     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 and fully \n     expect that funds will only be obligated for projects in Guam \n     once the Department complies with Section 2822.\n       Thank you for your attention to this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n     Thad Cochran,\n       Vice Chairman, Senate Committee on Appropriations, \n     Subcommittee on Defense.\n     Richard J. Durbin,\n       Chairman, Senate Committee on Appropriations, Subcommittee \n     on Defense.\n     Pete Visclosky,\n       Ranking Member, House Committee on Appropriations, \n     Subcommittee on Defense.\n     Rodney Frelinghuysen,\n       Chairman, House Committee on Appropriations, Subcommittee \n     on Defense.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President. The bill before us is an important \ncompromise. Neither side got exactly what it wanted, but this \nlegislation will provide much-needed certainty across the government. \nIt keeps the government open for business and helps us turn a corner \ntoward a more regular funding process. It represents much-needed relief \nfrom the cycle of crisis and shutdown which has dominated here for too \nlong.\n  This bill will fund a strong military, cutting edge research \nprojects, and investments in our Nation's families and young people.\n  For Michigan, the bill will provide much needed funding exciting new \nresearch at Michigan State University, for long overdue harbor \ndredging, to prevent Asian carp from entering the Great Lakes, for new \ntransportation projects, and for small airports.\n  This bill isn't perfect. It shortchanges our financial regulators, \nzeroes out funds for some local communities with large amounts of \nFederal land, and leaves some other programs at lower levels than is \nrequired. Hopefully the PILT funding will be authorized in the farm \nbill.\n  This bill is a significant improvement from years of shutdown threats \nand continuing resolutions that have put our Nation's government on \nautopilot. This is the first time in 3 years that we will have \ncompleted all 12 appropriations bills to properly allocate funding for \nall Federal agencies.\n  For the military, the bill provides $487 billion in base DOD \nappropriations--the funding level established in the budget agreement--\nand $85 billion for overseas contingency operations. As a result, it \nappears that DOD's operations and maintenance funding will be reduced \nby about $9 billion this year--a substantial reduction, but less than \nwe feared would be the case. While this is a tight budget, I am more \nconcerned at this point about the much greater reductions in DOD \nfunding that will be required in fiscal year 2015 and subsequent fiscal \nyears.\n  I am pleased that the Defense appropriations bill is consistent with \nkey actions that we took in the National Defense Authorization Act, \nincluding provisions on Guantanamo detainees, measures to address \nsexual assault in the military, and the implementation of the New START \nTreaty. I also commend the Appropriations Committee for amending the \nmilitary retired pay COLA change included in the budget agreement to \nexempt medical retirees and survivor benefit plan annuitants. The Armed \nServices Committee will be holding hearings to review this issue.\n  While I have concerns about a few specific provisions, I believe that \nthis is a good Defense appropriations bill and one that deserves our \nsupport.\n  For cutting-edge research, the bill restores $1 billion of much-\nneeded funding for the National Institutes of Health that was cut last \nyear due to sequestration. This funding is needed to avoid further loss \nof promising research and make the investments needed to ensure that \nNIH can continue to support the next generation of scientists and fund \ncutting-edge research.\n  For families and children, the bill will fully fund Head Start. Last \nyear, 1,800 children across Michigan were forced out of early childhood \nprograms due to sequestration, and the new funding in this bill is \nexpected to restore and even grow this important early childhood \nprogram.\n  In addition to Head Start funding, the bill also includes a \nsignificant increase in funding to educate children with disabilities.\n  Now, I'd like to talk about a few specific projects that are \nespecially important to Michigan.\n  First, the bill includes the full $55 million requested for the \nDepartment of Energy for fiscal year 2014 to help fund the Facility for \nRare Isotope Beams, FRIB, at Michigan State University. FRIB will let \nscientists, for the first time, create rare isotopes like those \nproduced in supernovae.\n  These isotopes will be studied, advancing our knowledge of the \norigins of elements and the universe, as well as furthering applied \nscience fields like biomedicine, nuclear physics and nuclear chemistry.\n  The facility will attract top scientists from around the globe, and \nis a key piece in attracting and training the next generation of \nnuclear scientists. FRIB will help keep Michigan, and the United \nStates, at the forefront of cutting edge science.\n  Second, the bill provides important funding for Great Lakes projects. \nI'm pleased that restoration and protection of our treasured Great \nLakes will advance with the funding provided in the bill.\n  Appropriators fully responded to a request from the Senate Great \nLakes Task Force, which I co-chair by including $300 million for the \nGreat Lakes Restoration Initiative which strategically targets funding \nat the most significant problems facing the Great Lakes.\n  In addition, the bill provides more than $30 million for the Corps of \nEngineers to fight Asian carp and other invasive species from getting \ninto the Great Lakes. The bulk of that funding will be used for the \nelectric dispersal barrier, which was designed to keep the carp from \nadvancing through the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal. We need to \nrecognize that this barrier is only a short-term fix, however, and \nfocus on separating the two basins for a permanent solution. I'm \npleased the omnibus includes $3 million for the Corps to refine its \ndesign of such a solution and I will press to speed its implementation.\n  I'm also glad the bill includes language that I requested that would \nauthorize the Corps of Engineers to implement emergency measures to \nprevent invasive species from dispersing into the Great Lakes by way of \nany hydrologic connection to the Mississippi River basin.\n\n[[Page S415]]\n\n  I'm also pleased the bill increases funding by about $12 million from \nlast year for dredging of Great Lakes harbors and channels, operation \nand maintenance of locks, and repair of breakwaters. The Great Lakes \nnavigation system handles over 160 million tons of cargo, and it is \ncritical this system operates effectively to support our economic \ngrowth and international competitiveness.\n  I will continue to work with my Senate colleagues to restore the \npayments in lieu of taxes, which are used for such critical needs as \npublic schools, emergency response, and road maintenance.\n  The bill also restores funding for drinking and wastewater \ninfrastructure by providing about $2.4 billion to states for investing \nin these vital water projects, which will both protect public health \nand our water resources.\n  Finally, this bill includes important provisions to help our State's \ntransportation system.\n  I am pleased the bill again includes language allowing the M-1 Rail \nproject in Detroit to use private funds as a match to federal dollars.\n  In addition, I am pleased that the bill provides funding that for the \nFAA to keep open contract control towers at the W.K. Kellogg Airport in \nBattle Creek, the Coleman A. Young Airport in Detroit, and the Sawyer \nInternational Airport in Marquette.\n  This bill is an important compromise, and I am glad that Democrats \nand Republicans, from the House and Senate, were able come together to \ncraft this measure.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I first want to congratulate Chairwoman \nMikulski and Vice Chairman Shelby for their leadership in bringing \nthese appropriations bills to the floor for final consideration. While \nI would have preferred these bills to have been brought to the floor \nindividually so that they could be amended, this nevertheless is a \nnoteworthy achievement.\n  The 2-year budget agreement negotiated by Senator Murray and \nCongressman Ryan provided the framework for the bill we are considering \ntoday, allowing the Appropriations Committees to begin our work of \ndeveloping bills that will responsibly fund the government.\n  Since passage of the budget agreement, the Appropriations Committee \nmembers have worked tirelessly to craft a true compromise.\n  As the ranking member for the Transportation and Housing \nSubcommittee, I worked with Chairman Murray to negotiate a bipartisan \nTransportation and Housing bill. While this bill makes prudent spending \nreductions--it is $3.2 billion below the original Senate bill and \nnearly $1 billion below the fiscal year 2013 enacted level--it \ncontinues to invest in important transportation and housing programs. I \nwould like to mention a few highlights:\n  First, the TIGER program, which supports transportation \ninfrastructure and economic development in our local communities, is \nfunded at $600 million. Given the current state of our Nation's \nhighways and bridges with so many being structurally deficient, we \nincluded additional resources to help eliminate some of the backlog of \nvital construction projects.\n  Second, while the overall funding level for the FAA is reduced by \n$167 million from the fiscal year 2013 enacted level, we worked to \nprovide sufficient funding to ensure air traffic controller and safety \ninspector staffing losses are made whole. The bill also fully funds the \nContract Tower program to prevent administration officials from \narbitrarily closing towers as they attempted to do last year.\n  Further, the bill includes program reforms for the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development, which will streamline program \nrequirements, increase oversight, and reduce costs to the taxpayer.\n  I am proud that the THUD bill strikes the right balance between \nfiscal responsibility and meeting our Nation's housing and \ninfrastructure needs.\n  The other divisions of the bill are equally important--from national \nsecurity, to energy, to health and human services--and I would also \nlike to acknowledge the work of the other subcommittee chairs and \nranking members in completing action on their bills.\n  For our military and our Nation's security, I particularly appreciate \nthat this bill includes $100 million for the procurement of the fifth \nDDG-51 from Bath Iron Works, which Senator King and I advocated. This \nfunding will allow the Navy to send a tenth DDG-51 to sea that is \ncapable of performing many roles and missions in support of our \nnational defense. Not only will it add stability to the workforce at \nBath Iron Works in Maine, but it also will result in significant \nsavings for the taxpayers. The multiyear, 10-ship procurement will save \napproximately $1.5 billion--that is the equivalent of an extra \ndestroyer at no cost. I thank Chairwoman Mikulski, Vice Chairman \nShelby, Subcommittee Chairman Durbin, and Subcommittee Ranking Member \nCochran for this important funding.\n  I am also grateful to see the $11.5 million in military construction \nfunding that will go toward the consolidation of structural shops and \nimprove the efficiency of operations at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. \nWhile the Department of Defense has delayed or cancelled $4.1 billion \nin military construction projects during the next five budget years, \nthis project was accelerated to 2014 due to efforts by members of the \nMaine and New Hampshire delegations to increase investments to address \nlong overdue modernization needs at PNSY.\n  For our veterans, I am pleased this bill restores the full cost-of-\nliving increase for disabled military retirees and for survivor \nbenefits, rectifying provisions in the recently-passed budget agreement \nthat unfairly singled out current retirees. Unfortunately, this will \nnot protect all military retirees from a decreased cost-of-living \nadjustment on their pensions. We must continue to work on behalf of our \nretired servicemembers and their families to ensure that they receive \nthe full benefits they have been promised and have earned by their \nservice to this country. Congress should act quickly to pass \nlegislation I have cosponsored that completely restores the COLA for \nall military retirees.\n  This bill also provides several million dollars in additional funding \nfor medical research, including for Alzheimer's Disease research, \ntreatment, and caregiver programs. This is an important initial step \ntoward the goal of doubling funding for Alzheimer's research and \neventually reaching the level of $2 billion over five years, as \nrecommended by the Alzheimer's Advisory Council. We must continue our \nefforts in 2015 to increase Alzheimer's research given the tremendous \nhuman and economic price of this devastating disease. We are spending \n$142 billion annually in Medicare and Medicaid costs on caring for \npeople with Alzheimer's.\n  I also want to thank Agriculture Subcommittee Chairman Pryor and \nRanking Member Blunt for addressing the needs of our Nation's farmers \nand growers, providing critical support for research, and making \nimportant nutrition and food security investments during difficult \neconomic times. In particular, I am pleased that the agreement expects \nUSDA to amend its arbitrary decision to exclude the fresh white potato, \nthe only fresh vegetable or fruit to be excluded, from the Women, \nInfants and Children, or WIC program. Fresh white potatoes are a \nhealthy, affordable, and delicious food choice, and it only makes \ncommon sense to include this nutritious vegetable in the WIC package.\n  This bill also makes important commitments to our energy \ninfrastructure. I would like to thank Subcommittee Chairwoman Feinstein \nand Ranking Member Alexander for recognizing the potential for creating \njobs by providing robust funding for the Department of Energy wind \nprogram, which funds the offshore wind demonstration projects. Federal \nseed money is helping overcome barriers to the development and \nimplementation of new and innovative technologies, such as deepwater \noffshore wind, which can position the U.S. as a global leader in this \npromising clean energy field.\n  To help address the high cost of residential energy, particularly for \nthose living in northern, rural states such as Maine, funding is \nprovided in this bill for the weatherization program. This program \nplays an important role in permanently reducing home energy costs for \nlow-income families and seniors and training a skilled workforce.\n  Moreover, for our most vulnerable families and seniors, the increased\n\n[[Page S416]]\n\nfunding for LIHEAP will help ensure that recipients do not have to \nchoose between paying their energy bills and paying for other \nnecessities such as food or medicine. LIHEAP continues to be an \nindispensable lifeline for many Americans during these challenging \neconomic times and exceptionally cold winter.\n  Helping to meet the water infrastructure needs of smaller States and \nregions is another vital piece of our national infrastructure. I am \npleased this bill includes funding for the operation and maintenance of \nArmy Corps projects at ``small, remote, or subsistence harbors.'' Ports \nand harbors are the economic lifeblood for many rural communities--a \nfact not fully accounted for under the Corps' budget metrics, which \ntend to favor larger ports.\n  The bill also continues to support our Nation's fisheries, which are \nso important to the economies of our coastal communities, particularly \nin Maine. In September 2012, the Commerce Department declared a \ndisaster in the Northeast groundfish industry. A vital $75 million is \nincluded in this bill to help fishermen in Maine and in other areas of \nthe country who have had their livelihoods affected by fisheries \ndisasters in recent years. This funding could be used to provide both \nimmediate economic relief to Maine and the region's struggling \ngroundfish industry, and to make targeted investments that will allow \nthe fleet to survive and become more sustainable in the years ahead.\n  The American people are weary of watching a Congress that can't work. \nWe saw the result of this dysfunction when the government shut down in \nOctober. We simply must avoid another shutdown and put our Nation back \non sound financial footing. That is why I urge my colleagues to support \nthe compromises the Appropriations Committees worked so hard to \nachieve.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I come to the floor to discuss the \nconsolidated appropriations bill of 2014, upon which we will soon be \nvoting. While I am pleased that this bill will prevent another \ngovernment shutdown and hopefully signal to the American people that we \ncan actually work together, I will not be voting for this bill due to \nserious concerns surrounding specific policy riders and spending \nprovisions. I am also seriously concerned about the process whereby we \nare passing a 1,582 page, $1.012 trillion spending bill that we \nreceived at 8 p.m. Monday night--giving us very limited time to time to \ncarefully review or debate and no ability to amend.\n  Now, this is not a new occurrence in Congress. According to the \nCongressional Research Service, between 1977 and 2013, there were only \n4 years when all appropriations were enacted on time--fiscal year 1977, \nfiscal year 1989, fiscal year 1995, and fiscal year 1997: ``[O]ver half \nof the regular appropriations bills for a fiscal year were enacted on \ntime in only one instance (1978). In all other fiscal years, fewer than \nsix regular appropriations acts were enacted on or before October 1. In \naddition, in 12 out of the 37 years during this period, none of these \nregular appropriations bills were enacted prior to the start of the \nfiscal year.'' This is unacceptable and must change.\n  With our country facing a rapidly growing $17.3 trillion debt, which \namounts to more than $54,000 per citizen, it is time for Congress to go \nback to the ``regular order'' and consider each one of the 12 \nindividual appropriations bills in turn to fund the activities of our \ngovernment before the end of the fiscal year, with ample time for \ndebate and amendments, instead of ramming through a massive 1,582-page \nOmnibus appropriation bills like the one before us today. The American \ntaxpayer expects more and deserves better than what we are giving them \nin this bill.\n  The Omnibus includes appropriations policy riders and pork barrel \nprojects that should raise red flags for all of my colleagues. For \nexample, tucked away in the classified portion of this bill is a policy \nrider that has serious national security implications and is a prime \nexample of the appropriators overstepping their bounds. This provision \nwill halt the transfer of the U.S. drone counterterrorism operations \nfrom the CIA to the Department of Defense. In doing so, it summarily \nchanges a very important policy that guides how we do certain \ncounterterrorism operations abroad from a direction that the President \nhas specifically prescribed. And how did most of us become aware of \nthis major policy change? By reading this morning's Washington Post; \nthat is how. This is outrageous, and it should not have happened. While \nthere may be differing opinions on who should control drone \ncounterterrorism operations, we should be able to debate these \ndifferences in the committees of jurisdiction and eventually on the \nSenate floor. The fact that a major national security policy decision \nis going to be authorized in this bill without debate or authorization \nis unacceptable and should not be the way we legislate on such \nimportant national security issues.\n  The $1 trillion Omnibus also includes a wasteful provision directing \nthe U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA, to continue developing the \nduplicative Catfish Inspection Office--even though the FDA has a \nsimilar inspection office. According to the Government Accountability \nOffice, GAO, this duplicative office will cost taxpayers roughly $15 \nmillion a year once up and running. Both the Office of Management and \nBudget, OMB, and GAO have recommended that Congress repeal the catfish \nprogram because it is ``wasteful and duplicative'' of FDA's seafood \ninspection services.\n  The fact remains that the Catfish Office won't improve food safety. \nIts true purpose is to ban catfish imports for several years while USDA \nbureaucrats iron out their procedures with foreign inspectors. A New \nYork Times article from November 2013 explains how this program would \ndisrupt our trade relations with Asian countries. Some nations, \nincluding Vietnam, have threatened WTO retaliation against our \nagriculture exports, like beef and soybeans.\n  During the Senate debate on the farm bill, I was joined by Senator \nShaheen and 11 other Senators in offering an amendment to that bill \nthat would have eliminated the Catfish Office, but the managers blocked \na vote on our amendment. The House version of the farm bill includes an \namendment to eliminate the USDA Catfish Office, but Senate conferees \nare, likewise, blocking a vote in conference. I urge the Senate \nconferees to the farm bill to drop their opposition and allow a vote in \nconference on this important provision. Appropriators should have not \nincluded this policy rider in the omnibus. Instead, we should move to \neliminate the duplicative and wasteful USDA Catfish Office.\n  In addition, the Omnibus bill includes $120 million in unrequested \nfunding for Guam in direct contravention of the bicameral decisions of \nthe Armed Services Committees. There is absolutely no justification for \nthis. That is why the Armed Services Committees have expressly \nprohibited such funding in the NDAA. To date, Congress has not received \nsufficient cost-analysis supporting the Department of Defense's \nproposed movement of troops from Okinawa to Guam. For this reason, in \nthe authorization bill passed just last month, the Armed Services \nCommittees explicitly prohibited any premature investments in Guam \nuntil the Secretary of Defense provides Congress with the strategic \nplan which includes, among other things, costs associated with the \nmovement to Guam and a report on military resources necessary to \nexecute the U.S. force posture strategy in the Asia-Pacific region.\n  While this language will stay in the Omnibus bill due to the \ninability to offer an amendment to strip it, I am thankful to Senate \nArmed Services Chairman Levin for working with me to clarify the \nlanguage. I also appreciate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee \nChairman Durbin and Vice Chairman Cochran for agreeing that the \nreporting requirements in section 2822 of the NDAA must be satisfied \nbefore the Department of Defense can obligate funds for investments in \nGuam if the report finds they are needed. I fully expect the Senate \nArmed Services Committee will provide close and careful oversight, \nincluding hearings, over the use of any monies that may be appropriated \nfor the transfer of forces covered in this section and obligated by the \nDepartment for that purpose.\n  Yet another example of the abuse of the appropriations process is the \ncontinued inclusion of a misguided policy rider that prohibits the \nPostal Service from moving to 5-day mail delivery, which would save the \nPostal Service $2\n\n[[Page S417]]\n\nbillion a year. This congressional mandate was initially put in place \nin 1984 and is the only roadblock keeping the Postal Service from \ntransforming the way it delivers mail, while still being able to \nprovide universal service. The Postal Service continues to lose \nbillions of dollars each year; however, some in Congress have decided \nthat they know better than the Postal Service leadership and continue \nto prohibit the Postal Service from modernizing and transforming the \nway it does business. Congress must accept the fact that the Postal \nService's current way of doing business is no longer viable. The \nAmerican public communicates and conducts business in a completely \ndifferent way than they did even 5 years ago. We must allow the Postal \nService to adapt to changing times in order to have a Postal Service in \nthe future, and this includes 5-day mail delivery to save $2 billion a \nyear.\n  In addition to these unacceptable policy riders, the bill also \nincludes other examples of pork barrel spending for programs, some \nduplicative, such as $65 million for Pacific Coast salmon restoration \nfor States including Nevada, a program that even President Obama has \ncalled duplicative and mocked in his 2011 State of the Union Address; \n$80 million in additional funding for Amtrak, which continues to \noperate in the red year after year; $15 million for an ``incentive \nprogram'' that directs DOD to overpay on contracts by an additional 5 \npercent if the contractor is a Native Hawaiian-owned company.\n  There is language that makes it easier for the DOD to enter into no-\nbid contracts for studies, analysis, and unsolicited proposals. The \nlanguage in the bill makes it ripe for wasteful spending and earmarks \nfor pet projects. For example, Department of Defense may eliminate \ncompetition and use a no-bid contract for a ``product of original \nthinking and was submitted in confidence by one source.'' With the \nDepartment facing cuts now and into the future, this type of vague \nlanguage could lead to costly wasteful spending on programs that DOD \nneither needs or can afford.\n  There are $600,000 for a program at Mississippi State University to \nresearch how to grow trees faster for replanting after hurricanes.\n  There are numerous ``Buy America'' provisions that hurt competition \nand innovation, drive up the costs of procurement, and further \nincreases the taxpayer burden; $10 million for the USDA High Energy \nCost Grants Program that go to subsidize electricity bills in Alaska \nand Hawaii; $10 million for a DOD Youth Challenge Program that was \nneither requested by the President nor authorized to receive funding in \nthe fiscal year 2014 NDAA; and $3.3 million increase in the STARBASE \nProgram. According to the Internet, this ``nice-to-have'' but not \n``necessary-to-have'' program ``focuses on elementary students, \nprimarily fifth graders. The program's goal is to motivate these \nstudents to explore Science, Technology, Engineering and Math, STEM, as \nthey continue their education. Military volunteers apply abstract \nprinciples to real-world situations by leading tours and giving \nlectures on the use of STEM in different settings and careers.'' With a \nwar going on and budget crisis at our doorstep, this is how we elect to \nspend our increasingly scarce defense dollars? We should leave the \neducation of our children to our teachers and parents and not our \nmilitary.\n  There is a $7.7 million increase for the Civil Air Program, or CAP. \nCAP is a volunteer organization that provides aerospace education to \nyoung people, runs a junior cadet program, and assists when possible in \nproviding emergency services. Its members are hard-working and we are \ngrateful for their volunteerism. This year, as in the past, the Senate \nArmed Services Committee authorized CAP funding. However, CAP is \nauxiliary and thus should not be funded given the need for the military \nto tighten its purse strings and fund programs that are a priority to \nour national defense, not auxiliary.\n  The bill also includes $375 million for Army, Navy, and Air Force \n``alternative energy research'' initiatives. As I have stated in the \npast, this type of research has yielded such shining examples as the \nDepartment of the Navy's purchase of 450,000 gallons of alternative \nfuels for $12 million--over 26 dollars per gallon.\n  There is over $460 million in funding for Defense Department to do \nresearch dealing with research for alzheimer, autism, prostate and \novarian cancer, HIV/AIDS and numerous other diseases and illnesses. \nWhile this type of research is important, it should not be funded by \nDepartment of Defense. It should, instead, be funded by the National \nInstitutes of Health, the budget of which this bill more than doubles \nover last year's.\n  We cannot continue this process where massive, unamendable, thousand-\nplus page spending bills totaling trillions of dollars are voted on 2 \ndays after being made available to Members of this body. No Senator \ncould have read and fully understood the long-term impact the policy \nand spending provisions this bill will have on the future of this \nNation. It is a shameful way to do business. The American taxpayers are \ntired of Washington and our uncontrollable spending habits as well as \nour inability to cut wasteful, underperforming, and duplicative \nprograms. Furthermore, our refusal to reform our broken tax system and \nour unsustainable mandatory programs have contributed greatly not only \nto the current fiscal crisis in our country, but to Americans' \nunfavorable opinion of the institutions of our government. We must \nchange course and have a fair and open process to fund the Federal \nGovernment, not a closed process. For all of these reasons, I will not \nbe voting for this appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I appreciate the comments from my two \ndear friends, the Senator from Iowa and the Senator from Alabama. They \nhave been friends of mine for decades, and we have traveled and \nconspired together--always conspiring for the good of the country, of \ncourse. We have shared our thoughts, our philosophy, and our plans, and \nbecause we have joined together, we have better legislation.\n  I want to add my voice to those who have spoken in support of the \nOmnibus appropriations bill. I spoke about it earlier this week, so I \nwon't repeat others, but I want the American people to understand the \nimportance of what we are doing.\n  Only Chairwoman Mikulski could have said it as well as she did. This \ncompromised bill represents the end of--and hopefully for a long time--\n``shutdown, slowdown, slamdown politics.'' If I spoke for an hour, I \nwould not say it as well as the senior Senator from Maryland did. It \nshows that the people here want to govern. When they have had enough of \npolitical stunts and are no longer intimidated by extremists, they can \nwork together to get it done.\n  Chairwoman Mikulski, Ranking Member Shelby, Chairman Rogers, and \nRanking Member Lowey made it possible for the House and Senate \nAppropriations Committees to do what we all do if we are given the \nchance. Democrats and Republicans come together and we forge \nagreements.\n\n  Two days ago I spoke about the portions of this omnibus bill that \nfund the Department of State and foreign operations. But I also know--\nand I can say this as the most senior member of the Appropriations \nCommittee--the bill also provides funding for many vital domestic \nprograms that have suffered some very painful cuts in recent years. It \nprovides increased funding for public health, including mental health. \nIt is going to increase the National Institutes of Health budget by $1 \nbillion.\n  In Vermont, local community health centers are essential for rural \nfamilies. This bill includes nearly $700 million more for these health \ncenters nationwide. I know how important they are. I remember during my \nfirst term in the Senate helping to start one of our first community \nhealth centers in the tiny county of Grand Isle, with a beautiful \narchipelago of violets in Northern Lake Champlain. We also have Head \nStart Programs. These are some of the hardest hit by sequestration and \nthe bill will help rebuild these programs by investing nearly $1 \nbillion.\n  The bill invests $194 million more in the Women, Infants, and \nChildren Program, providing nearly 90,000 more mothers and children \nwith nutrition assistance. Talk about something that has a rebounding \neffect in this country. We all know a hungry child going to school is \nnot going to learn, and they\n\n[[Page S418]]\n\nare not going to be as productive a member of society later on. None of \nus in this Chamber goes hungry. No Senator goes hungry except by \nchoice, but a lot of children and a lot of infants go hungry. Now, \n90,000 more can be given nutrition assistance.\n  Many Americans are struggling to pay for college, and this bill \nmaintains funding for the Pell Grant Program and increases funding for \nTRIO and GEAR Up Programs that help low-income and first-generation \nstudents get a college education. Many of these programs reach \nVermonters through the Vermont Student Assistance Corporation. I am \npleased this bill includes investment in this and similar nonprofits \naround the country.\n  The omnibus includes funding for programs authorized by the Violence \nAgainst Women Act for grants to rural areas, for transitional housing, \nfor sexual assault services, for legal assistance for victims, and \nsupport for Native American victims.\n  I remember how we joined together in a bipartisan way to pass the \nViolence Against Women Act, and when they wanted to diminish it in the \nHouse of Representatives, some very brave Democrats and Republicans \nstood and said: No, let's pass the bill the Senate passed. We added a \nnumber of things, including Native American victims--something that \neven some of the previous supporters of the bill were going to take \nout. We kept it in.\n  The bill raises the cap on the Crime Victims Fund by $15 million, \nwhich is a historic high. It means more money for victims assistance \ngrants at the State and local levels. How I wish we had such money when \nI was a prosecutor so we could help victims of crime.\n  It also makes a lifesaving investment in the bill the former Senator \nBen Nighthorse Campbell and I wrote, the bulletproof vest program, to \nprotect police officers and other first responders. Every year we hear \nof police officers whose lives have been saved because of the \nbulletproof vest program.\n  We provide increases for homeless assistance grants and the Low-\nIncome Energy Assistance Program. We preserve funding for Rural \nEconomic Area Partnership Zones--something extremely important in the \nbasically rural State of Vermont.\n  The omnibus also lifts the pay freeze impacting thousands of Federal \nworkers in Vermont and millions across the country and all 50 of our \nStates.\n  The bill makes strong investments to support our National Guard. I \nwas the cochair of the National Guard Caucus, along with Senator \nLindsey Graham, who will agree with me on how important that investment \nis. It overturns a provision in the Bipartisan Budget Act that would \nhave reduced cost-of-living adjustments for medically retired \nservicemembers and survivor benefit plan recipients. It paves the way \nfor Congress to repeal the reductions for all impacted military \nretirees.\n  This bill is not exactly what I might have written, what Chairwoman \nMikulski would have written, what any one of us would have written if \nwe could write it alone. But after years and years of gridlock on \nappropriations, we wrote a bill that can pass. So there are \ncompromises. There are programs that are not funded at the levels many \nof us wanted, including some provisions important to Vermonters.\n  I am disappointed that because of limited budget caps we were unable \nto make larger investments in the Byrne JAG Program and the juvenile \njustice program, which continue to face steep cuts year after year.\n  I am disappointed the omnibus includes authorizing language we have \nbeen debating as part of the ongoing farm bill negotiation. This \nantifarmer policy rider will tie the hands of the Grain Inspection, \nPackers & Stockyards Administration and is an unfortunate case of \nlegislating on behalf of powerful corporations while leaving our family \nfarmers out in the cold.\n  But I would say that even on the things I would have wanted to \ninclude, and many of us would want to include, the alternative was \nanother continuing resolution and more sequestration, which, without \nquestion, would have been far worse, especially for programs that I \nsupport and I believe the distinguished Presiding Officer supports and \nmost of us support.\n  So we have taken an important step back from the destructive politics \nof the past few years. Let's hope it is only the first step. Let's hope \nwe can go on from here to make progress on other important issues the \nAmerican people sent us to address.\n  I do not see any Senators seeking recognition. I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Markey). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, as have so many of my \ncolleagues, I rise to speak to this important Omnibus appropriations \nbill that we have before us today, and I too wish to thank the Senator \nfrom Alabama, whom I count as a friend, and the Senator from Baltimore \nand the great State of Maryland, more broadly, for all the great work \nthey have done and their colleagues on the Appropriations Committee as \nwell. We are showing the country we can work together. We are going to \nstart the new year on a different note. I am excited to be a part of \nthat effort. I will support the bill.\n  I come to the floor, as have a number of my colleagues, to speak \nabout some of the business yet unfinished, to set the stage for more \nwork we can do going forward. But before I do that, I wish to mention \nsome of the specific good news in the bill.\n  I am looking at my good friend from Alabama. We have had a lot of \nfires in Colorado over these last number of years. This bill takes some \nimportant steps to help us combat the threat posed by what are now very \nfast-moving, indiscriminately burning, modern mega fires. We have had \nmega hurricanes and mega tornadoes. We have mega fires now in the great \nState of Colorado. We have seen those fires not just in my State but \nall over the West. In the Southeast we have seen increasing fires as \nwell. So the budget includes about $3 billion for firefighting and \nwildfire prevention programs, which is essentially the same level we \nhave seen in recent years.\n  I am a little disappointed that the bill doesn't include the \nbipartisan Wildfire Disaster Funding Act. This is a bill that I worked \non with Senators Wyden and Crapo. It is, therefore, bipartisan. It \nwould allow the U.S. Forest Service and the Department of the Interior \nto access funding to support emergency wildfire suppression efforts. It \nis a lot cheaper to suppress fires at the beginning than to let them \nget out of control. It is also a lot cheaper to prevent fires from \nhappening in the first place, and I will talk more about that. If we \nlook at current projections, they only suggest that fires are going to \nincrease in intensity and duration, and it underscores the need for us \nto get ahead of this growing threat to our communities--again, not just \nin Colorado but all over our country.\n  There are fiscally responsible reforms in this Wildfire Disaster \nFunding Act which would help us confront the skyrocketing threat that \nmodern fires pose to our States' fiscal health as agencies work to \nprotect life and property while being responsible stewards of taxpayer \ndollars. That is just one of the many reasons I am going to continue to \nlead the fight--it is a bipartisan fight, a bipartisan cause--to see if \nwe can't get this approach in place. This is a plan that will truly \nhelp us with these fires that threaten our communities.\n  I am also proud that Colorado is leading the way in pioneering \ncommonsense wildfire prevention strategies that cut through redtape and \nthen leverage private sector know-how to create jobs while reducing the \nfuel loads in our forests. We don't have enough Federal employees. We \ndon't have enough government moneys to do all we need to do in our \nforests. One of the ways we can do more of that with this private-\npublic sector type of partnership is to reauthorize the Good Neighbor \nAuthority.\n  The Good Neighbor Authority was a pilot project in Colorado \ninitially, and it has been successful. We want to expand it and apply \nit in other locales and in other States, and we have succeeded in doing \nthat. It will allow agencies to work collaboratively across arbitrary \nFederal boundaries to improve forest health and reduce wildfire risks.\n\n[[Page S419]]\n\n  This bill also reauthorizes the job-creating Stewardship Contracting \nAuthority, which allows the Forest Service and the BLM to partner with \nlocal businesses to improve fire safety on our public lands. This has \nbeen a critical tool in Colorado, and it is important that we include \nit in this bill.\n  So where do I think we have some shortcomings? I mentioned a couple \nof successes and important provisions in the bill. The bill doesn't \naddress several key needs in my State, including support for the \nEmergency Watershed Protection Program and Payment in Lieu of Taxes \nProgram. It is known as PILT. I listened to the Committee on \nAppropriations chairwoman and I listened to the Senator from New Mexico \nTom Udall and others speak about PILT today. I wish to touch on both \nthe EWP, Emergency Watershed Protection Program, and the Payment in \nLieu of Taxes Program. We had real devastation in my State last year \nduring the fall with historic amounts of rainfall and then the floods \nthat followed. We had enormous support from all over the country. We \ndeeply appreciate that outpouring. It was the most destructive natural \ndisaster in our State's history. Now the floodwaters have subsided, \nthankfully--some 3 months ago--but we are still learning the true \nextent of the damage. Families and towns are clearing debris from their \nneighborhoods and from their water sources. They are working to rebuild \ntheir communities house by house and business by business.\n  Yet, despite this widespread damage from the floods and the broad \nconsensus that more help is needed, this budget does not fund the \nEmergency Watershed Protection Program. This is a very important and \ncrucial flood recovery program, and it has been applied all over our \ncountry, I think in almost every State.\n  If we do not get support sooner rather than later, we could see \nadditional flooding this spring. We have a spring thaw that happens all \nover our State. Streams will overrun their banks, particularly because \nwe have so much debris still in many of those stream courses. So we \nneed these resources. It is simply not acceptable that we would not \nhave them in hand before the spring runoff.\n  The Federal Government's Natural Resources Conservation Service, the \nNRCS, estimates that we need at least $122 million to protect lives and \nproperty from future flood damage. That support, as I have said, is not \nincluded in the bill, but I am going to continue fighting to secure \nthis critical aid for Colorado's flood-ravaged communities.\n  Finally, I want to turn to the Payment in Lieu of Taxes Program. As I \nmentioned earlier, many of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle \nhave expressed their disappointment that the budget does not include \nPILT funding. It includes--when it works--funding for rural counties \nacross the country. Fifty-five of our 64 counties in Colorado qualify \nfor payment in lieu of taxes funding. Those counties qualify because \nthere are Federal lands within those counties.\n  Those lands are an important part of the character and heritage of \nthe West. But because Federal lands are not subject to local property \ntaxes, they do not support essential services such as schools, roads, \nteacher hires, our firefighters, and our police.\n  I want to give you an example of what I am talking about.\n  Ouray County is in the southwestern portion of Colorado in the San \nJuan Mountains. It is home to about 4,400 people. Over half that county \nis public land, and half of the local school kids are already on free \nor reduced-price lunch programs. That county's budget is picked to the \nbone. Without $400,000 in PILT funds, Ouray County will not be able to \nmaintain local roads or provide other basic services that residents \nthere depend on.\n  Those funds may seem small by the standards here in Washington, DC, \nbut they are indispensable for the rural communities in my home State \nof Colorado and across the West. That is why this week I introduced a \nbill that would fully fund PILT, and I am really pleased Senator Heller \nfrom Nevada has joined me. That fully funded PILT approach would give \nour rural communities certainty when it comes to their budgets and \ntheir futures. This is a commonsense approach. Let us pass it without \ndelay. I am going to continue to work with all of my colleagues who \nsupport the PILT Program to ensure that we do the right thing.\n  I want to take a minute to speak to my county commissioners all over \nColorado from those 55 counties I mentioned. I know you are wondering \nhow you are going to keep critical public services going over this next \nyear. To you I want to make this pledge: I will fight doggedly, I will \nfight every way possible, to make sure you have those PILT funds to \nwhich you are entitled and you need to make sure your communities are \nsecure, are safe, and are preparing for the future.\n  I want to conclude by saying, again, I intend to vote for this bill, \nin part because of the critical functions across our government that it \nsupports and because, as the Senator from Alabama mentioned just a \nwhile ago, it avoids another costly and unnecessary government \nshutdown. But I do raise some concerns. I know we will tend to the \nunfinished business that I mentioned. I am going to continue working \nwith everybody on both sides of the aisle. I am going to keep fighting \nfor the great State of Colorado in the process. We will do our part to \nbe a great State in the United States of America.\n  I appreciate the Presiding Officer's attention. I appreciate the \nPresiding Office's service.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, with the distinguished senior Senator from \nAlabama on the floor, I ask unanimous consent that the time until 4:45 \np.m. be equally divided and controlled between Senators Reed of Rhode \nIsland and Durbin; further, that the time from 4:45 p.m. until 5:15 \np.m. be controlled by the Republican leader or designee; that at 5:15 \np.m. there be 15 minutes equally divided between Senators Mikulski and \nShelby or their designees; that at 5:30 p.m. today the mandatory quorum \nrequired under rule XXII be waived and the Senate proceed to vote on \nthe motion to invoke cloture on the motion to concur; that if cloture \nis invoked, the motion to concur with an amendment be withdrawn, all \npostcloture time be yielded back, and the Senate proceed to vote on the \nmotion to concur; that if the motion to concur is agreed to, the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of H. Con. Res. 74; that the concurrent \nresolution be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SHELBY. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair hears none.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I tell the distinguished Presiding Officer, he can tell by \nall the various clauses of that why we Senators are merely \nconstitutional impediments to our staff who write it up, and why I held \nit in my hand to read it and make sure it was done right.\n  With that, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair notes the excellent work of the \nSenator from Vermont, and the clerk will please call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I never would have imagined that today the \nSenate would be meeting without one of our true heroes, a recipient of \nthe Congressional Medal of Honor, Senator Danny Inouye of Hawaii. He \nand Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska guided the Subcommittee on Defense of \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee for decades with a steady hand and \na commitment to working on a bipartisan basis.\n  I have been fortunate in working on this appropriations bill to have \nas my ranking member Senator Thad Cochran of Mississippi. He has \ncarried on that legacy of bipartisanship. He is my friend. We trust one \nanother. That has made this job so much more complete and satisfying. \nWe have conferenced a massive Defense appropriations bill on an \nexpedited schedule and we encourage our colleagues to vote for it on \nfinal passage.\n  Virtually 60 percent of all of the domestic discretionary spending of \nthe United States of America is included in this one appropriations \nbill. Now for\n\n[[Page S420]]\n\nnearly 2 years the Department of Defense has been in a state of \nparalysis because of budget uncertainty caused by the Budget Control \nAct, sequestration, the threat that was never supposed to become a \nreality, and, sadly, the 16-day totally unnecessary government \nshutdown.\n  This bill is the first step in regaining stability and providing a \nsolid foundation for our Department of Defense to plan for its future. \nIt represents a return to regular order for both the Budget and \nAppropriations Committees and for Congress. Finally, we are going to \nexert our constitutional responsibilities over the power of the purse, \nto make certain that every Federal tax dollar is spent responsibly.\n  We are really indebted in particular to two of our colleagues. \nChairwoman Patty Murray of Washington, chair of the Senate Budget \nCommittee, sat down with Paul Ryan, the House Republican chair, and \nhammered out a budget agreement, the first in I believe 5 or 6 years. \nThen the assignment was sent to the Appropriations Committee chair, \nBarbara Mikulski of Maryland. She was able to sit down with Chairman \nRogers from the House of Representatives. The two of them worked out an \nagreement on the actual spending that would follow this budget \nresolution. That was no small feat.\n  It is also a fiscally responsible bill. It provides $572 billion for \nthe current fiscal year in this appropriation, meeting the spending \ncaps that were established in the budget. It meets the spending target \n$25 billion before the President's request, by making 1,065 more \nstrategic and thoughtful reductions--1,065 reductions in spending from \nthe President's budget request.\n  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff warned us and the Nation \nseveral years ago: If we do not get the people right, the rest will not \nmatter when it comes to our national defense. This agreement implements \nthe wisdom of General Dempsey. It provides necessary resources to the 3 \nmillion men and women who proudly serve America in the Department of \nDefense. Passage of this bill means that nearly 800,000 civilian \nemployees at the Department of Defense finally will get the pay raise, \nat least some pay raise, which they certainly deserve, rather than face \nthe threat of furloughs which they faced over and over.\n  Unfortunately, this is the first pay raise since fiscal year 2010, \nbut it will make it a little bit easier for middle-class families who \nwork for our government in defense of our Nation to make ends meet. The \nagreement also contains a pay raise for our military. We all heartily \nsupport it.\n  It funds operations of readiness at $11 billion higher than it would \nbe under a full-year continuing resolution. It means our soldiers, \nsailors, airmen, and marines can get the training they need before \ndeploying into harm's way. Training and readiness means survivability.\n  It provides a $1 billion increase in the National Guard and Reserve \nequipment account, includes $218 million for TRICARE to ensure \nservicemembers and their families will not pay higher out-of-pocket \ncosts for medical care, $25 million to fully implement the \nimplementation of Senator Murray's Special Victims Counsels, so that \nthe victims of sexual assault in the military through this \nappropriation will have the advocates, have the counselors, and have \nthe champions they need.\n  We have increased an already robust budget for suicide prevention by \n$20 million, to encourage the Department to expand community-based \ninitiatives, offering greater support as well for the Guard and \nReserve. We made sure that the medical care our servicemembers receive \nwill still be the most advanced in the world. It adds $200 million to \npeer-reviewed medical research programs. No apologies.\n  Some Members may come to the floor and criticize the Department of \nDefense for being engaged in medical research. I can stand and defend \nevery single line item. I will tell you, it will not only benefit our \nmilitary and their families, it will benefit America and the world for \nthis medical research to take place.\n  It has $125 million for traumatic brain injury and psychological \nhealth, $10 million for prosthetic research. I want to thank \nCongresswoman Tammy Duckworth of Illinois. She has joined me in this \neffort. She, more than any other Member of Congress, understands the \ncritical importance to have the modern prosthetics and orthotics for \nthose members of the military who suffer a loss of limb during their \ncourse of serving our country.\n  For embassy security, which is a topic we hear from the other side on \nalmost a daily basis, we have added marine security guard detachments \nat 35 more State Department posts overseas, as well as Marine Corps \nresponse forces around the globe.\n  Finally, we add a technical correction. I want to make it clear, \nbecause this has been the subject of great debate on the floor of the \nSenate and the House, we added a technical correction to the COLA \noffset regarding military pensions to make it clear that Congress \nnever, ever intended this to impact medically retired personnel or \ntheir survivors. I appreciate the leadership of three of my colleagues \non this issue: Senator Murray, Senator Pryor, and Senator Shaheen.\n  We protect the Defense industrial base. We increase science and \ntechnology funding for all the branches by $400 million. We add $175 \nmillion for the Rapid Innovation Program and $75 million for the \nIndustrial Base Innovation Fund.\n  I had the good fortune of visiting Rhode Island during the course of \nthis week. Make no mistake. The men and women who work in these \nfacilities to build the most advanced, innovative, and technical \ndefense equipment in the world constitute a precious national resource. \nWe want to make sure we are committed to them so they will be ready to \nhelp us in the future to defend America.\n  There are two provisions in this bill I want to mention quickly that \nrelate to Illinois. The first is related to the James Lovell Federal \nHealth Care Center in North Chicago. It is a multiyear pilot program to \ntry to do something which seems so obvious, to blend the medical \nfacilities and hospital at the Great Lakes Naval Training Station with \nthe North Chicago Veterans Hospital. It is one of the most challenging \nthings I have ever seen in government. We are getting it done. This \nbill continues to invest in that concept. I want to thank Senator Kirk. \nHe has been my partner in making sure that this happens from the start.\n  Second, the bill takes a major step forward in preserving and \nsustaining the skilled workforce at manufacturing arsenals in support \nof the Department of Defense. Coming out of two wars, we know the value \nof these workers. When we had to put shields on humvees to save the \nlives of our servicemembers, we turned to the Rock Island Arsenal. In \ndramatic fashion they responded with the very best equipment to save \nour men and women in uniform. We want to make sure they are ready for \nthe next challenge, whatever it may be. So we have included $150 \nmillion in industrial mobilization capacity to stabilize their rates, \nto make sure they will continue to serve our military so well.\n  I see my colleague Senator Reed has come to the floor. I know we have \na limited amount of time. I want to make a point which I think he will \nappreciate. When it comes to major Defense programs, this bill contains \n$1.2 billion to fully fund two Virginia-class submarines under a \nmultiyear contract.\n  I visited with the engineers, welders, electricians, and machinists. \nThey have been worried about their jobs through the sequester, and \nfurther sequestration would have meant a major disruption.\n  The agreement also supports the strong view of Congress that we \nshould not retire 9 ships with a century of useful life left in them.\n  We fully funded Navy Growlers, P-8s, and other aircraft, as well as \nadded advanced procurement for additional Super Hornets.\n  In the Army, we protected procurement of Army Chinook, Apache and \nBlack Hawk helicopters, as well as provided an additional 14 \nhelicopters to the Army National Guard.\n  We also remain a steadfast partner with Israel. The bill fully funds \nU.S.-Israel cooperative missile defense programs. It adds an additional \n$173 million for the Arrow programs and David's Sling, and also fully \nfunds Iron Dome procurement.\n  We also had to make a lot of tough decisions to reach our spending \ncap.\n\n[[Page S421]]\n\nSome programs have significant cuts, and that is going to have an \nimpact somewhere.\n  But what is the alternative to this bill? The only answer is a full-\nyear continuing resolution. The Department of Defense has never \noperated under a full-year CR, and I hope it never does.\n  A full-year CR would mean untold billions of dollars would have to be \nrealigned from literally thousands of programs. It would be a financial \nmanagement nightmare. Programs might be forced to stop in their tracks \nbecause funds were not provided in the right lines, and the effects \nwould ripple throughout the defense industry and American jobs.\n  This bill takes care of our highest priorities, but not everything \ncan be a priority. I ask that Senators recognize that we had to make \nsome hard choices, that we managed to do more with less, and that the \nalternatives are much worse.\n  I inherited an awesome responsibility from Senator Inouye. I also \ninherited his tremendous staff.\n  They have worked especially hard this year over the holidays with no \nfanfare and at great personal sacrifice to ensure that we could get to \nthis day. So I would like to take a moment to thank them.\n  On the Democratic staff: Betsy Schmid, Colleen Gaydos, David Gillies, \nKaty Hagan, Kate Kaufer, Erik Raven, Jennifer Santos, Teri Spoutz, Andy \nVanlandingham, and Maria Veklich.\n  On the Republican staff, I would like to thank: Stewart Holmes, \nAlycia Farrell, Brian Potts and Jacqui Russell.\n  This defense bill provides for the national defense in a responsible, \nthoughtful way.\n  It reverses the harshest impacts of sequestration, and provides \nadditional funds to ensure that our troops get the training and \nequipment they need.\n  It also looks toward the future, boosting research in medical care, \nscience and technology, and manufacturing innovation.\n  I hope all of my colleagues who support a strong military and a \nstrong national defense will support this good bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, first let me thank the Senator from Illinois \nfor his great leadership on the Appropriations Defense Subcommittee and \nfor joining me in Rhode Island to see those great workers at Electric \nBoat and many other defense industries in Rhode Island.\n  I too want to commend Chairwoman Barbara Mikulski and Chairwoman \nPatty Murray. We would not be here today without their extraordinary \nefforts, Herculean efforts by two extraordinary individuals. I also \nwant to thank my colleague from the great State of Alaska, Lisa \nMurkowski, for her work. She is an extraordinary colleague, \ncollaborator. We have worked together to make this Interior \nsubcommittee bill a very good one.\n  Chairman Ken Calvert of the House, ranking member Jim Moran, both \nsuperb participants and collaborators in this effort. Jim is retiring. \nI want to thank him for his distinguished service to Virginia and to \nthe Nation.\n  I am very pleased in particular in this Interior subcommittee bill \nthat we could make a strong investment in clean water and drinking \nwater through the revolving fund or, as it is known, the SRF fund. This \nis not only about the environment and public health, it is about jobs. \nIn fact, adopting our provisions in contrast to the House's lower \nnumbers will keep approximately 97,000 more Americans on the job this \nyear. That, I think, is significant. It is not just about the \nenvironment, it is also about keeping people at work.\n  We have also ensured that we can staff all of our agencies, including \nthe EPA, so they do not have to face furloughs, so they can have \ncontinuity of operations, so they can do their jobs more efficiently \nand more effectively.\n  For the Department of the Interior, the bill provides solid funding \nfor resource agencies, including the National Park Service, Fish and \nWildlife Service, the Bureau of Land Management, the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs, as well as the U.S. Geological Survey. The bill also includes \n$306 million for the Land and Water Conservation Fund.\n  With respect to our cultural agencies, we have also been able to \nrestore sequester cuts to the National Endowment for the Arts and \nHumanities, and we increased funding of the Smithsonian, which will \nhelp them complete the National Museum of African American History and \nCulture for its opening in 2015.\n  One challenge in the Interior bill is the firefighting costs. These \nare costs that cannot be avoided and they continue to increase. We have \nfully funded these costs and we have done that by increasing resources \nsignificantly. But we have to be aware, if these costs continue to \ngrow, it will be something that is very difficult to sustain. So we \nhave to apply our efforts going forward to see if we can, through \nsuppression efforts, through other efforts, begin to control the cost \nof firefighting. This is something, particularly for our Western \ncolleagues, that is absolutely essential. We responded to this need \ncompletely and thoroughly.\n  I want to also commend my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee \nfor the other aspects of the bill, Senators Harkin, Feinstein, Murray, \nand Durbin. Their subcommittees produced great results. The Low Income \nHeating Assistance Program, LIHEAP, the Weatherization Program has been \nadequately funded, funding for Job Corps, TIGER grant funding, and \nChairman Mikulski particularly effectively added $75 million for \nfisheries disasters, which the Presiding Officer from Massachusetts and \nmyself are very keenly aware of and very appreciative of.\n  Funding for the Securities and Exchange Commission, funding for the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission. This is going to help make sure \nthe Dodd-Frank legislation that we passed is actually implemented and \nthe markets are operating efficiently. This is critical to our economic \nviability and our economic progress.\n  As Senator Durbin mentioned, I am extremely pleased that two \nVirginia-class submarines were included in this appropriations bill. \nThey are built in Groton. They all begin in Quonset Point, RI, but they \nare built in Groton finally and often in Newport News. This is a \nprogram vital to our national security, vital to employment. About \n2,800 people in Rhode Island will benefit from these important \nprograms.\n  I think we have to do more to invest in our people, invest in our \neconomy, infrastructure, et cetera, but this bill goes a very long way.\n  Let me also pay tribute to people who really deserve, as they say, a \nshoutout. That is the staff members who did this work: Rachael Taylor, \nRyan Hunt, Virginia James, Rita Culp, and Tiffany Taylor on my side. \nSenator Murkowski's extraordinary staff: Leif Fonnesbeck, Brent Wiles, \nand Emy Lesofski. They did extraordinary work.\n  Before I leave the floor. Let me conclude one point: We will come \ntogether this evening on a strong bipartisan basis to pass this \nappropriations bill. But we still have remaining work to do on the \nunemployment insurance bill. I hope in the intervening days that we can \nfind a path forward to pass an unemployment insurance bill on a \nbipartisan basis because if we do not, there are 1.5 million Americans \nwithout benefits, 70,000 more a week lose their benefits, and our \neconomy is losing out, because it is approximately $600 million a week \nthat is being sapped from the economy, as estimated by Professor \nLawrence Katz at Harvard if we do not act.\n  Now is the time not only to put these appropriations to work, but \nalso to put our UI programs to work, so that not only can we help \nAmericans, but we can also help our economy. I want to thank in this \nregard, with respect to the UI efforts, Senator Heller and Senator \nCollins. They are extraordinarily thoughtful Members, who are \ncommitted, as I am, to helping their constituents and doing it in a \nwise and prudent way.\n  With that, let me recognize the chairwoman who has come to the floor \nand say, thank you, chairwoman, for an extraordinary bit of work. Not \nsurprising coming from a giant like yourself. Thank you.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for his comments. \nI appreciate them. They were well said. But the compliments should be \nreversed. This is a committee effort. What I am so excited about for \nthis bill is that it is bipartisan, bicameral. It\n\n[[Page S422]]\n\nwas agreed upon in the House by an overwhelming vote of 359 to 67.\n  I look forward to this same type of vote in the Senate, but we did it \nbecause we listened to each other, we functioned with maximum respect, \nand saw where we could compromise without capitulating on principle.\n  I note that other Senators will be coming shortly.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRUZ. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRUZ. I rise to speak of pragmatism and irresponsibility.\n  Four years ago, when this body was debating the law known as \nObamaCare, reasonable minds perhaps could have differed as to whether \nthat law might work. The essence of pragmatism is looking to the facts \nas they are today and responding.\n  Today reasonable minds can no longer differ in terms of whether \nObamaCare is working.\n  Today it is abundantly clear that millions of Americans are being \nharmed right now by this failed law.\n  Today it is the essence of pragmatism to acknowledge the facts of the \nfuture of ObamaCare and for Congress to step up and act to stop the \nharm that has been caused by this body.\n  Irresponsibility, on the other hand, is seeing undeniable harm, \nundeniable facts, and saying, nonetheless, we will do nothing.\n  What are the facts from the American people?\n  The facts that we now know today are that already at least 4.7 \nmillion Americans have received cancellation notices, have had their \nhealth care plans cancelled because of ObamaCare.\n  This was, of course, after President Obama repeatedly looked in the \nTV cameras, spoke to the American people, and made the promise: If you \nlike your health care plan, you can keep it, period.\n  We now know that promise was false, and for over 4.7 million people \npainfully false in their lives.\n  Pragmatism is responding to the facts and doing something about it. \nUnfortunately, what have the Senate majority leader and the Senate \nDemocrats done to protect Americans from ObamaCare? Nothing.\n  These facts are known and Senate Democrats have done nothing. At \nleast 4.7 million Americans lost their health insurance because of this \nbody. The omnibus bill that this body is galloping to approve does \nnothing for the 4.7 million Americans who have had their health \ninsurance canceled.\n  It is not only health insurance plans. What else are the facts that \nwe know now?\n  As Time magazine observed: ``Keeping your doctor under ObamaCare is \nno easy feat.''\n  President Obama looked at the American people and said: If you like \nyour doctor, you can keep your doctor, period.\n  We now know that promise too was deliberately, repeatedly, false. \nMillions of Americans are facing the very real prospect of losing their \ndoctor.\n  A good friend of mine, a cancer survivor, is facing the very real \nprospect--because Texas Oncology has suggested it does not intend to \nparticipate--of losing his cancer doctor, not being able to go to the \ndoctors who saved his life. This is the father of two young children \nfacing the terrifying reality of losing his doctor because of the \nconduct of the Congress.\n  In response to millions of Americans losing their doctors, what have \nthe Senate majority leader and Senate Democrats done? Nothing. The \nessence of irresponsibility is seeing a harm, seeing the facts, and \nrefusing to act.\n  What else do we know? We know ObamaCare is killing jobs all across \nthe country. Indeed, ObamaCare is the biggest job killer in this \nNation.\n  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has said:\n\n       Of small businesses that will be impacted by the employer \n     mandate, one-half of small businesses say they will either \n     cut hours to reduce full-time employees or replace full-time \n     employees with part-time workers to avoid the mandate. 24 \n     percent say they will reduce hiring to under 50 employees.\n\n  The President has recently been talking about income inequality. This \nexacerbates income inequality. It is why the rich have gotten richer \nunder President Obama. But the people who are struggling--young people, \nHispanics, single moms, people like my dad, who 56 years ago washed \ndishes for 50 cents an hour as a teenage immigrant--those are the \npeople getting their hours reduced because of ObamaCare; those are the \npeople getting laid off because of ObamaCare.\n  Income inequality is increasing. What have the Senate majority leader \nor Senate Democrats done to protect Americans from ObamaCare? The \nanswer is simple: Nothing. In response to the millions of Americans \nbeing forced into part-time work, losing their jobs, nothing from \nSenate Democrats.\n  What else do we know? The New York Times front-page headline \nexplained ``New Health Law Frustrates Many in Middle Class.''\n  I recognize that not everyone is inclined to listen to a Republican \nfrom Texas. So let me instead quote that famed rightwing rag, The New \nYork Times, discussing ObamaCare.\n\n       Ginger Chapman and her husband, Doug, are sitting on the \n     health care cliff. The cheapest insurance plan they can find \n     through the new federal marketplace in New Hampshire will \n     cost their family of four about $1,000 a month, 12 percent of \n     their annual income . . .\n\n  Mr. Chapman is a retired fireman who works on a friend's farm and he \nand his wife have two sons. Mrs. Chapman had this to say about the cost \nof that insurance:\n\n       That's an insane amount of money. How are you supposed to \n     pay that?\n\n  In response to the middle class, frustrated at getting hit with \nskyrocketing premiums, what have the Senate majority leader and Senate \nDemocrats done? The answer is the same: Nothing.\n  But going beyond that, it is not just the middle class that is \ngetting hurt. If we were to look at one demographic group that is \ngetting hammered the worst by ObamaCare, it is young people. ObamaCare \nis a law designed to be a massive wealth transfer from young people to \nolder wealthier Americans.\n  Forty percent of young Americans today believe ObamaCare will bring \nworse care, 51 percent believe it will bring higher costs, and 57 \npercent of young people disapprove of ObamaCare. And what is the source \nof this information? Another famed rightwing institution--Harvard, a \nHarvard Institute of Politics poll.\n  Young people in particular are getting hammered by ObamaCare, and \nwhat have the Senate majority leader and Senate Democrats done to \nlisten to the young people who are losing their jobs, who are forced \ninto part-time work, who are facing skyrocketing premiums? The answer \nis simple: Nothing.\n  Looking beyond that, Forbes reported that ObamaCare is to increase \nindividual market premiums by an average of 41 percent--41 percent. \nThat is real money from hard-working people who are being hurt because \nof the failures of this body. And what have Senate Democrats done in \nresponse? Nothing.\n  Looking beyond that, in my home State of Texas, the average premium \nincrease for Texans will be 26 percent in the individual market. But \nlet's take a 27-year-old Texas man. The average premium increase will \nbe 70 percent; for a 27-year-old Texas woman, 22 percent. These are \nyoung people who are struggling, who are starting to build a family, \nand their premiums are going up because of ObamaCare. What have the \nSenate majority leader and Senate Democrats done to listen to young \npeople who are being hurt? The answer is simple: Nothing.\n  Let's look beyond that, though. Let's look beyond Texas and let's \ntalk about State by State some of the very real harm. Let's take a \nState picked at random--the State of Nevada. If we look at the State of \nNevada, 24,600 policies have been canceled in Nevada; in the individual \nmarket, a 179-percent premium increase.\n  One might hope that these 24,600 people who had their health \ninsurance canceled would have Senators representing them. One might \nhope these people paying 179-percent premium increases would have \nSenators representing them standing up and saying: Let's act right now. \nBut what have the Senate majority leader and Senate Democrats done to \nrespond to the people of Nevada? The answer is absolutely nothing.\n\n[[Page S423]]\n\n  Let's look at some other States. The State of California. In \nCalifornia, that bright blue State on our west coast, 1.1 million \npolicies have been canceled; a 27-percent increase on average premiums. \nWhat have Senate Democrats done to respond to Californians suffering \nbecause of ObamaCare? The answer is simple: Nothing.\n  Let's take another State: Arkansas. Arkansas people are hurting \nbecause of ObamaCare. The State is not tracking cancellations, but in \nthe individual market in Arkansas a 138-percent increase in premiums.\n  For the millionaires, many of whom populate this Chamber, 138 percent \nmay not be that much. But if you are struggling in Arkansas, you need \nhelp. You need relief. And what have Senate Democrats done for the \npeople hurting in Arkansas because of ObamaCare? The answer is nothing.\n  Let's look at another State: Louisiana, 92,790 policies canceled \nbecause of ObamaCare; a 53-percent increase in average premiums because \nof ObamaCare in the individual market.\n  I will note, one Senator from Louisiana has fought hard for those \n92,790 people in Louisiana who have had their health insurance \ncanceled, and another Senator in this Chamber has fought hard to ensure \nthe response is not to relieve them from ObamaCare. What have Senate \nDemocrats done in response to the people in Louisiana who are hurting? \nThe answer is simple and it is tragic: Nothing.\n  Let us look at another State: New Mexico, 26,000 policies canceled; \n142-percent increase in the individual market. What have Senate \nDemocrats done to listen to the citizens of New Mexico being hurt \nbecause of ObamaCare? The answer is nothing.\n  Let's take one more State: The State of North Carolina, 183,800 \npolicies canceled.\n  I want my colleagues to think of the single mom raising three kids \nwho receives a notification in the mail that her policy has been \ncanceled not because of anything she has done but because of Congress's \nlaw that is not working.\n  A 136-percent increase. I want my colleagues to think of the \nimmigrant struggling hard--like my dad was when he was washing dishes--\nwho discovers his premium has gone up 136 percent. What have Senate \nDemocrats done to respond to the people of North Carolina who are being \nhurt because of ObamaCare? The answer, tragically, is nothing.\n  Four years ago, reasonable minds might have differed, but today these \nare the facts. And the facts are Senate Democrats are not listening to \nthe American people. They are not responding to the harm they have \ncaused. I am going to suggest that is the essence of irresponsibility.\n  I have filed two amendments. One amendment to the omnibus bill would \nsimply provide that ObamaCare would be defunded so long as it is the \ncase that ObamaCare is causing Americans to lose the health insurance \npolicies they wish to keep, increasing their premiums, and preventing \nthem from seeing the doctors they want to see.\n  All of those, by the way, were promises President Obama and Senate \nDemocrats made to the American people that ObamaCare wouldn't do, and \nit is exactly what they are doing.\n  This amendment, if Senate Democrats disagree that they have done \nnothing, presents the opportunity for them to do something. Right now \nthey can step in and say: It is the essence of pragmatism to recognize \nthis isn't working, people are hurting, so let's start over.\n  So, accordingly, I am going to ask the first of two unanimous consent \nrequests:\n  I ask unanimous consent that my amendment No. 2685, to prohibit the \nfunding of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act so long as \nthe Act is harming the healthcare of Americans, be called up and agreed \nto.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hirono). Is there objection?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I want to turn to a second amendment I \nhave introduced. This second amendment provides real relief to the \nmillions of Americans who are being hurt because of ObamaCare, but it \nalso corrects something this body did just recently that was wrong. \nRecently, this body acted to decrease the pensions of millions of \nveterans--millions of men and women who have served our Nation, who \nhave fought for our Nation, and who have bled for our Nation. This body \ndecreased their pensions irresponsibly. So this second amendment I \nwould introduce defunds ObamaCare because millions of Americans are \nhurting, and it uses the savings from defunding ObamaCare to restore \nthe pensions to the hard-working men and women of the military, which \nnever should have been taken away in the first place.\n  This is an opportunity for all 100 Senators to demonstrate we stand \ntogether with the working men and women in the military and with all \nAmericans who are struggling to make ends meet, struggling to achieve a \nbetter life.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment No. 2686, \nto prohibit funding of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \nand to fulfill our Nation's promise to our military retirees, be called \nup and agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, last year Members of this body could say \nthey didn't know. They didn't know people's plans would be canceled. \nThey didn't know premiums would skyrocket. They didn't know people \nwould be shut off from seeing their doctors. Now they know. Now they \nknow. And the response of the majority leader and Senate Democrats, \ntragically, is to do nothing.\n  This body faces a choice--a choice between pragmatism and \nirresponsibility. Once this body makes this choice, ultimately, in \nNovember, the American people will have a choice as well. At the end of \nthe day, every elected official should not ignore the facts but should \nlisten to the American people. We need to make DC listen.\n  The majority leader and Senate Democrats right now are not listening \nto the American people. Instead, they have chosen a course of conduct \nof doing nothing, that is not responsible, and I hope that, in time, \nthey reconsider.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, we have had a spirited debate today for \nvery important reasons, and I will conclude my remarks on this bill by \nobserving that, with very few exceptions, we have heard nothing but \npositive comments from our colleagues today here in the Senate.\n  We have also heard what an important step this will be to reestablish \nthe regular order of the Senate appropriations process. In the \nappropriations world, regular order means receiving the President's \nbudget, holding hearings, marking up bills, and bringing them to the \nfloor of the Senate with an open amendment process, which both sides of \nthe aisle need and want.\n  The passage of this omnibus bill will be a giant step, I believe, in \nthat direction, which is in the best interests, in the long run, of \neach individual Senator as well as this entire institution.\n  I would be remiss if I did not once again recognize the chair of the \nAppropriations Committee Senator Barbara Mikulski, my colleague, and \nthe leadership that she demonstrated in creating an environment in \nwhich a compromise could be reached here. Anyone who has attempted to \nbring a single bill to the floor of the Senate understands what a \ndifficult undertaking that can be. This particular legislation contains \n12 separate appropriations bills.\n  I also recognize the efforts of the respective ranking members of \neach subcommittee. The Christmas holiday, as we all know, is usually an \nopportunity to refocus their attention on their families and their home \nStates. This past year, however, we asked them to once again go the \nextra mile, to skip their\n\n[[Page S424]]\n\nholidays, to make this bill a reality. Because of that and their work, \nthey have done that--without hesitation.\n  As has already been mentioned by a number of my colleagues, no bill \never reaches the floor of the Senate without the effort of many \ndifferent staff members. In this instance it took the effort of \nliterally dozens of staff from both sides of the aisle to bring this \ntogether. I personally thank them all for their incredible dedication \nand professionalism and literally unceasing effort over the past \nseveral weeks.\n  I urge my colleagues once again to support this important \nlegislation, to fund the government and move this body one step closer \nto being the place we would all like it to be.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, we are coming to the end of a long day \nand a really long journey. This journey began last year when this \ncommittee was dealing with a crisis situation in December 2012 when our \nbeloved and esteemed chairman Senator Dan Inouye passed away. \nSimultaneously, we were dealing with the emergency legislation to fund \nHurricane Sandy relief. At that time I was asked by my colleagues, \nbased on our seniority system, to become the chair of this committee. \nIt was my goal in taking over the committee that I wanted to continue \nthe great tradition of Senator Byrd, of Senator Ted Stevens, of Senator \nDanny Inouye, of Senator Thad Cochran, that we would work on a \nbipartisan basis in the interests of the United States of America. \nAlthough we come from different places, different States, and have even \ndifferent priorities, we are one country. It requires us to make sure \nwe do our job.\n  An Appropriations Committee is one of two committees that are \nconstitutionally referenced. When our Founders wrote the Constitution, \nthey said that there should be a committee that has an annual \nAppropriations Committee for public review and public vote, and there \nshould be a finance committee to raise the revenue. They didn't call it \nthe finance committee, but a revenue committee to raise the money to \npay the bills.\n  This bill meets its constitutional responsibility. This is the bill \nthat funds the Federal Government for fiscal year 2014. We are a little \nlate, but we have gotten the job done, and we have done that job with \ndue diligence, starting with President Obama giving the Congress his \nbudget.\n  Remember, the President proposes, the Congress disposes. We took the \nPresident's budget request, and we held our due diligence hearings. \nHowever, we faced a real problem. The Budget Committee, which sets the \noverall cap on discretionary spending, had not passed that. Many said \nyou must have a budget. Thanks to the leadership of Senator Murray, \nthrough hard work, we voted on a marathon budget bill that \noverwhelmingly passed in March. I was so optimistic. I thought: Great, \nthe Budget Committee is done. They have an April 15 deadline. They are \ngoing to go right over to the House and begin negotiations, and we will \nget our allocation with our cap. Remember, we have a cap on \ndiscretionary spending. We cannot be wild spenders.\n  However, it was not meant to be. There are those in the Congress, in \nthe Senate, who did not allow the Budget Committee to meet. Some 22 \ntimes Senator Murray asked to go to conference. We were delayed. We \nmissed our October 1 deadline. We did not bring up our individual \nbills. But we did have all our bills marked up in full committee in \nfull view by August 1. That is what we operated on.\n  Then in the fall, when we did get our budget, we did get our \ndiscretionary spending and a very stringent deadline. On December 20 we \nbegan to move to work with the House to come up with an agreement.\n  We did. We worked across the aisle, and I thank the Senator from \nAlabama, my vice chairman, for helping me create the environment. Our \nmutual respect for each other enabled us to work in a mutual way to \nmove our bill forward.\n  We reached across the dome to the House Members. We have worked \ntogether, and we have finished the bill. We brought to the floor what I \nthink people could vote for. Yesterday it passed the House with 359 \nvotes, with only 67 votes against it. I hope we have a successful \nmargin today. These efforts show that we Democrats and Republicans can \nwork together for the good of the country; that we can avoid drama \npolitics with cliffhangers and fiscal cliffs; we can avoid shutdowns; \nwe can avoid government on autopilot.\n  Most of all, those are process arguments. I did not come to be a \nmember of the appropriations committee to be a process guru. Process \ngets you to the objective you seek, and the objective that I seek is to \nmake sure that the United States of America is the best country in the \nworld; that we lead the world in demonstrating American exceptionalism; \nthat the greatest deliberative body continues to deliberate rather than \ndelay; that the greatest country in the world, through American \nexceptionalism, knows how to resolve conflict, which we were able to \ndo.\n  We compromised without any side capitulating on principles--give and \ntake on money, give and take on policy. But that is what America is, \ngive and take.\n  We were able to do that. At the same time, when I say the greatest \ncountry in the world, we ensured national security. We met compelling \nhuman need. We continued the opportunity ladder that enabled my family \nto rise as an immigrant family, and the family of the Presiding Officer \nto rise as an immigrant family. The Senator from Texas, he speaks so \neloquently, often, and frequently about his father. We need an \nopportunity ladder in this country, and we have it in this bill.\n  We also wanted to make sure that we have jobs today and are looking \nfor those investments in research and development for jobs tomorrow. \nBut we will never forget our veterans. We have money in this bill for \nadequate funding for veterans health care, fixing the disability \nbacklog. I know earlier in this debate the COLA for disabled military \nretirees and survivors of working age was raised. We have fixed that, \nwaiting for a comprehensive solution later on in the year.\n  I think we have a bill that meets the test of working to ensure \nAmerica's exceptionalism, protecting our national security, continuing \nthat great opportunity ladder that made the United States of America \ngreat. At the same time, we made those public investments; we were a \nfrugal committee that kept an eye on public debt.\n  I urge my colleagues to pass this bill.\n  There have been many accolades for me today. I thank you for them. \nThis is a committee. This bill is not about a ``me.'' Behind a ``me'' \nthere is a whole lot of ``we.'' Working on a bipartisan basis, I thank \nmy vice chairman, the Senator from Alabama, Mr. Shelby, for being a \ngentleman of the old school, meaning courteous and civil. He was \ninsistent, he was persistent on those priorities that he represented, \nand also on keeping that frugal eye that he is known for. But we were \nable to work together to create a climate in our committee where there \nwas confidence that everybody could be at the table and everybody could \nhave their say.\n  I thank his staff for their professionalism: Bill Duhnke, Dana Wade, \nChris Ford, Jane Lee, and Shelby Begany.\n  My own staff were no slouches either, and I thank Chuck Kieffer, \nGabrielle Batkin, Melissa Zimmerman, Brigid Houton, Vince Morris, Kali \nMatalon, and Eve Goldsher who helped.\n  But also, all of us had fantastic subcommittee staff, and that staff \nhas backed those subcommittee chairmen. They worked every single day \nsince December 20, with the exception of Christmas Eve and Christmas \nday.\n  Now we are at the end of this journey. As we conclude and vote on the \nomnibus, the consolidated appropriations bill, I hope the overwhelming \nmajority of the Senate votes yes. Then, later on this month we will \nhear President Obama's State of the Union.

The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n\n\n                       Functioning of the Senate\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to continue the discussion \nabout the description of the Senate as a deliberative body and continue \nto echo the call for the distinguished minority leader for a return to \na functional Senate. I have spoken on this issue before. I think it is \nbest to go back to the Constitution and the people who wrote the \nConstitution for an understanding of what was intended when the Senate \nwas set up. So I do not intend to dwell on the use of the so-called \nnuclear option related to the filibuster.\n  The reason I am not going to spend my time on the nuclear option \ntoday as in previous speeches is the majority leader claims the \nSenate's dysfunction is related to some unprecedented use of \nfilibusters. I think that has been thoroughly debunked. This claim is \ndirectly refuted by the very source he has pointed to, the \nCongressional Research Service.\n  More importantly, it has been debunked by fact checkers in important \nmedia sources in America. Yet, as we know, the Senate is dysfunctional \nbeyond a doubt. To get to the bottom of how and, more importantly, why \nthe Senate is not functioning, we must have a clear understanding of \njust how the Senate is supposed to function. As I just said, we should \nturn to the Constitution.\n  For an understanding of what the Constitution means, there is no \nbetter source for this than going back to the Federalist Papers. I have \nreferenced the Federalist Papers before on this subject, but it is \nworth the detail about what the Framers of the Constitution had in mind \nwhen the Senate was created.\n  Federalist Paper 62, which is usually attributed to the Father of the \nConstitution, James Madison, begins to lay out the rationale for how \nthe Senate is to operate. He mentioned that the number of Members and \nthe length of terms are different between the House and Senate. Then he \nsaid this--but before I quote, I hope you understand that when \nsomething was written in 1787 and 1788, they use a little different \nform of English than what we use. But it is pretty clear what they \nintended to say about explaining the difference between the House and \nthe Senate. So here begins my quote of James Madison:\n\n       In order to form an accurate judgment on both of these \n     points, it will be proper to inquire into the purposes which \n     are to be answered by a Senate; and in order to ascertain \n     these, it will be necessary to review the inconveniences \n     which a Republic must suffer from the want of such an \n     institution.\n\n  End of that quote, but I will have several other quotes from the \nFederalist Papers. In this specific quote, in\n\n[[Page S426]]\n\nother words, Madison is going to tell us the purpose of the Senate, \nstarting with the problems a Republic would face without a Senate and \nhow the Senate is designed to correct those problems. As we hear from \nMadison about how our legislative process is supposed to work, I would \nencourage my colleagues to think about major legislation that has been \nconsidered in the Senate in recent years.\n  In fact, arguably the most major bill that has passed in recent \nyears, President Obama's health care law, serves as one example. When \nthat law was considered, one party held all political branches of \ngovernment: the Presidency, the House of Representatives, and even had \na supermajority in the Senate. That means they could run the Senate \nlike the House, without the need to compromise with any in the \nminority.\n  At that particular time, my party was then and still is in the \nminority. We are now dealing with daily problems caused by the way the \nhealth care law was written, which is something to keep in mind as \nMadison describes in these coming quotes. The problems the Senate was \ndesigned to prevent, here is the first problem Madison discusses. It is \na fairly long quote from the Federalist. First he says:\n\n       First. It is a misfortune incident to republican \n     government, though in less degree than to other governments, \n     that those who administer it may forget their obligations to \n     their constituents, and prove unfaithful to their important \n     trust. In this point of view, a senate, as a second branch of \n     the legislative assembly, distinct from, and dividing the \n     power with, a first, must be in all cases a salutary check on \n     the government. It doubles the security to the people, by \n     requiring the concurrence of two distinct bodies in schemes \n     of usurpation or perfidy, where the ambition or corruption of \n     one would otherwise be sufficient. This is a precaution \n     founded on such clear principles, and now so well understood \n     in the United States, that it would be more than superfluous \n     to enlarge on it.\n\n  Then Madison goes on:\n\n       I will barely remark, that as the improbability of sinister \n     combinations will be in proportion to the dissimilarity in \n     the genius of the two bodies, it must be politic to \n     distinguish them from each other by every circumstance which \n     will consist with a due harmony in all proper measures, and \n     with the genuine principles of republican government.\n\n  I see it this way: In other words, Madison is saying having a second \nChamber of Congress designed to operate differently from the House \nmakes it less likely that a partisan agenda that does not reflect the \nviews of Americans will pass. That is not a function the Senate \ncurrently performs, as it has been run on a purely partisan term since \n2007.\n  For example, we will recall that the President's health care proposal \ndid not enjoy widespread public support. Yet it passed the Senate along \nstrictly partisan lines with little input sought or accepted from the \nminority party. In fact, before a final bill could be passed \nreconciling the House and Senate bills, a special election was held in \nthe liberal State of Massachusetts, resulting in an election of an \nopponent of the health care reform proposal.\n  Instead of moderating the proposal based upon public will and doing \nit maybe just a little bit so it could attract even one Republican \nvote, the House passed a draft Senate bill, then they used a budget \ntool called reconciliation to ram another bill through the Senate with \na simply majority to change items in the first bill.\n  That is not how Madison intended a bicameral Congress to work. The \nnext point Madison makes:\n\n       Secondly. The necessity of a senate is not less indicated \n     by the propensity of all single and numerous assemblies to \n     yield to the impulse of sudden and violent passions, and to \n     be seduced by factious leaders into intemperate and \n     pernicious resolutions. Examples on this subject might be \n     cited without number; and from proceedings within the United \n     States, as well as from the history of other nations. But a \n     position that will not be contradicted, need not be proved. \n     All that need be remarked is, that a body which is to correct \n     this infirmity ought itself to be free from it, and \n     consequently ought to be less numerous. It ought, moreover, \n     to possess great firmness, and consequently ought to hold its \n     authority by a tenure of considerable duration.\n\n  That describes what he thought the Senate should be, what the Senate \nis. But my point is, the Senate is not functioning that way. In other \nwords, if we have just one legislative Chamber with a large number of \nMembers, it is likely to make laws hastily based on a partisan agenda \nwithout thinking through all the long-term consequences. A hastily \npassed partisan agenda that ignores the long-term consequences, does \nthat not remind you of the health care law? Remember how then-Speaker \nPelosi said the House had to pass a bill to find out what was in it?\n  They were in such a rush they could not be bothered to read it.\n  The Senate is intended, as Madison just said, as I quoted, to be \nsmaller, to be more deliberate, and to be less partisan. Imagine if the \nSenate had been allowed to operate in a deliberative fashion and craft \na truly bipartisan health care proposal. If that had happened, we \ncertainly could have come up with something more workable than the \ncurrent law.\n  Madison continues his explanation of the rationale for the Senate:\n\n       Thirdly. Another defect to be supplied by a senate lies in \n     a want of due acquaintance with the objects and principles of \n     legislation. It is not possible that an assembly of men \n     called for the most part from pursuits of a private nature, \n     continued in appointment for a short time, and led by no \n     permanent motive to devote the intervals of public occupation \n     to a study of the laws, the affairs, and the comprehensive \n     interests of their country, should, if left wholly to \n     themselves, escape a variety of important errors in the \n     exercise of their legislative trust. It may be affirmed, on \n     the best grounds, that no small share of the present \n     embarrassments of America is to be charged on the blunders of \n     our governments; and that these have proceeded from the heads \n     rather than the hearts of most of the authors of them. What \n     indeed are all the repealing, explaining, and amending laws, \n     which fill and disgrace our voluminous codes, but so many \n     monuments of deficient wisdom; so many impeachments exhibited \n     by each succeeding against each preceding session; so many \n     admonitions to the people, of the value of those aids which \n     may be expected from a well-constituted Senate?\n       A good government implies two things: first, fidelity to \n     the object of government, which is the happiness of the \n     people; secondly, a knowledge of the means by which that \n     object can best be attained. Some governments are deficient \n     in both these qualities; most governments are deficit in the \n     first. I scruple not to assert, that in American governments \n     too little attention has been paid to the last. The federal \n     Constitution avoids this error; and what merits particular \n     notice, it provides for the last in a mode which increases \n     the security for the first.\n\n  That is a long quote. But Madison is essentially saying that the \nHouse is to be composed of a representative slice of American citizens \nwhile the Senate is supposed to be composed of individuals who have \nmore experience and approach public policy more thoughtfully. I am sure \nmany people might question whether individuals in the House or even in \nthis Senate match those descriptions today that Madison lays out.\n  But it is true that the rules of the House allow for new ideas to be \nquickly translated into legislation.\n  By contrast, the process in the Senate has historically been slower \nand more deliberative to refine those ideas into law that can stand the \ntest of time. Note that Madison complains about all the ``repealing, \nexplaining, and amending laws'' that have had to be passed by the \nunicameral legislatures of that time--of the early days of our \nRepublic.\n  Our early experiences with passing bills quickly, without thinking \nthings through, led to the understanding that we should take our time \nand get it right in the first place.\n  Getting back to Madison and those quotes I gave, that is what the \nSenate is supposed to do. Failure of the Senate to take the time, \nexamine, and take time to revise legislation is quite obvious. It \nresults in bad laws that don't work.\n  We now have a situation with the health care law where the President \nclaims the authority to unilaterally suspend or reinterpret parts of \nthe law that are clearly unworkable.\n  That is very similar to the embarrassing situation Madison refers to, \nto have a constant stream of ``repealing, explaining, and amending \nlaws,'' except the President is doing all of the repealing, all of the \nexplaining, and all of the amending, unilaterally.\n  Our constitutional system is not designed to pass a lot of \nlegislation quickly, and that can be frustrating, particularly to any \nmajority party anxious to enact its agenda.\n  Still, our deliberative process is a design and not a flaw. Based on \nexperience, the Framers of our Constitution\n\n[[Page S427]]\n\ndetermined that it was better to get it right the first time than to \nsubject the American people to the upheavals of laws that need to be \nconstantly amended or repealed. The House was designed to act quickly. \nThe Senate was designed to be a deliberative body, implying a slower \napproach to legislating.\n  The fundamental problem is that the current majority leader is trying \nto run the Senate like the House, and the Senate was not designed to be \noperated in that way. Sure--with the majority then and now the \nmajority, the same majority when they had 60 votes--it was possible to \nram legislation through the Senate without any deliberation, but that \nis no longer the reality.\n  When the majority leader brings a bill to the floor, routinely \nblocking amendments and then rapidly moves to end consideration of the \nbill, that means the Senate is presented with a measure as a fait \naccompli and has to take it or, the opposite, leave it.\n  In other words, the majority leadership wants their agenda approved, \nno questions asked, or nothing at all.\n  The fact is, if the majority leader allowed the Senate to deliberate, \nwe could get a lot more done than we have been doing. Sure, we might \nnot get as many laws passed as some people might like. The full Senate, \nthrough its deliberation, may alter legislation somewhat from how the \nmajority leadership would prefer. Still, we would be able to accomplish \nsome important legislation. But, no, that is not acceptable, we are \ntold. One week ago today there was a strong debate on that very issue. \nFor all the talk about getting things done, the majority leadership has \ndemonstrated repeatedly with cloture motion after cloture motion that \nit would rather grind this body to a halt than allow the slightest \nalteration of their agenda.\n  The latest message from the majority leadership is that they will \nrespect the rights of Senators to offer an amendment only if they have \ncertain assurances about the final outcome. The senior Senator from New \nYork implied that is the way it used to be done.\n  Well, I want to assure that Senator that in the 33 years I have \nserved in the Senate, it has never been done that way. I have managed a \nlot of bills over the years, and if I had tried to impose that \nrequirement, I would have been laughed at, to say the least.\n  Since when did duly elected Senators have to negotiate for the right \nto represent their constituents? An open amendment process should be \nthe default situation, not something that is granted at the sufferance \nof the majority party leadership.\n  We must get back then to what we call in the Senate regular order. I \nwould say do things the way Madison intended. That means an open \namendment process without preconditions or special limitations on what \namendments will be allowed.\n  Cloture shouldn't even be contemplated until after a substantial \nnumber of amendments have been processed. That was the standard \npractice when the Senate got things done, when we accomplished things.\n  Again, Madison describes a Senate that is to represent all Americans, \nnot only one party. It was designed to be more thoughtful and \ndeliberative and, whether we like it or not, slower than the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  The Senate's purpose is to make sure that Congress passes fewer but \nbetter laws. We saw what happened when the Senate was controlled \nentirely by one party while the voices of the minority party and the \ncitizens they represented were ignored. We got a deeply flawed health \ncare law and the American people are paying the price. Yet the majority \nleader insists on running the Senate as if he still has 60 votes, \ndoesn't have to compromise, and even refuses to compromise. That is not \nhow the authors of our Constitution intended the Senate to work and, of \ncourse, it isn't working.\n  The Senate is facing a crisis, and the only way to solve it is to \nrestore the Senate as a deliberative body envisioned by the authors of \nthe Constitution and express it in an explanatory way in the Federalist \nPapers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n\n                           Senate Functioning\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I appreciate the fact that Senator Grassley has given us \nhis view of how the Senate ought to work. When the Senator says more \ndeliberative and knowing how many filibusters have been supported on \nthat side, that is what it says to me. As someone who didn't want to \nchange the filibuster rules because I thought maybe we would come to \nsome agreement, and we wouldn't be facing historic numbers of \nfilibusters, let me say what the majority leader did was the right \nthing. It was the right thing.\n  I have been in Washington a long time. I came to the House in 1983. \nThe Senate worked well. It isn't working well.\n  What the majority leader said is how can we have a President, be he \nor she Republican or Democratic, how can we have that President \nfunction without a team in place, a team, their team. One person can't \nrun a country; they need a team. One Senator can't run our offices; we \nneed a team.\n  My God, what if we were told that we couldn't put our team together \nunless we had a vote that wasn't a majority vote, it had to be a \nsupermajority? We would never get anything done. We would be running in \ncircles. It would be very difficult.\n  It sounds to me as if my friend wants to go back to the bad old days \nwhere we would have all of these nominees objected to, stalled. It took \n154 days to get the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \nAgency.\n  My view, having been here, loved this institution, loved my work, and \nenjoyed my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, the Senate has \nchanged because the parties have moved so far apart. Let's call it what \nit is. In my eyes Republicans have moved so far to the right that, \nunlike years ago when I came, it is very difficult to get anything done \nlegislatively.\n  That is why today is one of those bright, rare moments. My hat is off \nto Senator Mikulski, Senator Shelby, and their House counterparts. We \nactually got something done. Half of the Republicans joined all of the \nDemocrats to pass an Omnibus appropriations bill. This is a good thing \nfor America. No side got everything it wanted, we know that. Do you \nknow what the American people received? They got compromise, they got \nsecurity, and they got stability. In the near future we are not going \nto have shutdowns, shouting matches, and debates through the night on \nwhether we should have a government.\n  We need more legislating such as this. That is why I so look forward \nto getting the Water Resources Development Act done. This is so \nimportant to so many of our States. We need to do flood control. We \nneed to do adaptation. We need to make sure there is recreation on our \nwetlands and so on. We need dredging in our ports. Those are the \neconomic engines of our Nation.\n  We have a bill we passed. Over in the House they have a bill. We are \nnow in the middle of trying to conference the differences, and I am \nvery hopeful we are going to get it done. Senator Vitter and I are \nworking together to get it done. It is a little slower than we would \nlike in terms of progress, but I am convinced we are going to have a \nbill before this body. We need to take care of the people's business.\n  Guess what. The President of the United States has a right to get his \nteam in place. It is as simple as it is.\n  The people know it. I go home and the people say: Hooray, thank God \nyou people are doing something. You are getting people confirmed.\n  Then we have the courts. We have courts where the judgeships are \nvacant. Justice delayed is justice denied. We need those judges in \ntheir places. The Senator from Iowa, I remember, made a big, eloquent \nspeech about how we wanted to ``pack'' the courts. Anyone who knows \nanything about history knows pack the courts means wanting to add more \njudges and put your people in it. It doesn't mean filling vacancies. I \nthink he got off that. But that was something to listen to.\n  We need to take care of the people's business and not play politics \ndepending on who is in the White House. Unemployment insurance was a \nperfect example of this.\n  Under George W. Bush, between putting in place the unemployment \ninsurance and extending it, we did it five times, no offsets. Now all \nof a sudden the Republicans--people are struggling. I am stunned that \nwe couldn't come together and extend unemployment insurance for the 1.5 \nmillion people right\n\n[[Page S428]]\n\nnow and the 250,000 Californians included in that 1.5 million who have \nrun out of hope.\n  The Republicans said: Pay for it, even though the deficit has been \ncut in half. They have suddenly noticed the deficit. After George Bush \nit was $1.4 trillion. They put two wars on the credit card, and they \nput a huge tax cut for millionaires on the credit card. Oh, no problem. \nNow they have discovered the deficit even though it has been cut in \nhalf by this President. Oh, we have to pay for it.\n  OK, we said, we have to pay for it, we will pay for it. We gave them \nan offset that we took out of Paul Ryan's budget. It wasn't good enough \nfor them. Then they said: We want amendments. We have to have \namendments, just give us some amendments. I will give you some \nunemployment insurance for these struggling people.\n  Then Harry Reid: Twenty amendments, OK; 5 a side and 5 side-by-sides, \n20 amendments.\n  Oh, no, that wasn't good enough.\n  It is childish. People are struggling. They are deciding whether they \ncan put heat on in their house. They are wondering whether they can pay \nthe rent, whether they are going to lose their homes, whether they are \ngoing to have to beg other family members for their help. This is \noutrageous. Outrageous.\n  Income inequality is outrageous.\n  Does the Presiding Officer know that 400 families are worth more in \nwealth than 150 million Americans? Let me say that again: Four hundred \nfamilies in America are worth more than half the United States of \nAmerica. And when there were tax cuts for those people, I never heard \none word from one Republican about a pay-for. The deficit soared. They \nall voted to go to war. No problem. But we want to help these families \nwho are desperate--middle-class families, people who have paid into the \nworkers unemployment insurance fund, people who are looking for work \nbecause they can't get that extended unemployment unless they can prove \nthat--and no. Nobody is home over there.\n\n  I appreciate that some of my colleagues made a speech about poverty. \nGreat. How about doing something about it? How about doing something \nabout it, and not just speechifying? Where are they in raising the \nminimum wage? I don't know, maybe they will come with us. I don't see \nit. I really don't see it. I hope so. I pray so. I do. So far, I don't \nsee it.\n  In the last Presidential election of 2012, the Republican leader said \nhis top priority was defeating President Obama. That is what the \nRepublican leader said--not working for the people of this country, not \npassing legislation to make their life better, not moving forward and \nmaking sure the air we breathe is clean, the water we drink is safe, \nnot making sure our kids have a good education and workers get job \ntraining--no. Top priority: Defeating President Obama. President Obama \nwon; so why don't you wake up and smell the roses and understand we \nneed to work together. You have to accept reality.\n  Look. I have had my candidates in the past win and lose. I have been \nhere through tough elections. We lost the Senate, then we won the \nSenate. We lost the House, then we won the House. We won the \nPresidency, then we lost it. Guess what. I had to understand that when \nit comes to legislating, we put that aside. We fight hard during an \nelection, but once it is over you don't carry that over. You work \ntogether.\n  But too many on the other side are politically motivated. All they \nwant to do is hurt our President, day in and day out criticizing him \nendlessly, not working with him. He has offered that olive branch over \nand over, whether it is on economic recovery, jobs, health care, the \nenvironment, income inequality--even foreign policy--day after day.\n  Here is the thing you never hear from the other side, so I am going \nto talk about it tonight. When President Obama took office, the economy \nwas losing over 700,000 jobs a month. Now we have added 8 million \nprivate-sector jobs in the past 45 months. How does that compare to \nGeorge W. Bush? After 8 years in office, President Bush's record was \nthat we lost 665,000 private-sector jobs. So far we have added 8 \nmillion private-sector jobs in the past 45 months.\n  When President Obama took office--we remember those days, frightening \ndays with the stock market collapsing. Now the stock market has gone up \n10,000 points. That is unbelievable. The GDP--gross domestic product--\nwas contracting at a rate of 8.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008 \nas we said goodbye to George W. Bush. Now we just learned that the GDP \ngrew by 4.1 percent in the third quarter. Is this President satisfied? \nAre we? No. But have we turned it around? Yes. Does the President ever \nget one ounce of credit for any of this? No. No.\n  How about looking at our deficit. Let's look at that, something the \nRepublicans claim is a very central part of it. This is it--a $1.4 \ntrillion deficit down now to 680, going down to 560, and falling at the \nfastest rate in many, many years, just as health care costs are not \nrising the way they used to. Do you think we would hear one word about \nit from the other side? No. No.\n  Even on foreign policy, even on foreign policy, politics used to stop \nat the water's edge. Senator Grassley has a historic perspective. I do \ntoo. Politics used to stop at the water's edge when it came to foreign \npolicy. No more. No more.\n  But you would never know the deficit has been cut in half, and you \nwould never know that 8 million private-sector jobs have been created \nif you listen to my friends on the other side because they can't give \nany credit to President Obama. But history will. History will.\n  The last thing I am going to talk about is health care. I listened to \nmy colleague Senator Cruz go after this President and the Democrats on \nhealth care. So let us look at a few things.\n  First fact: Even though we had a horrible roll-out of the health care \nsite--not in California but the Federal site, healthcare.gov--and a \ncouple of States had a horrible roll-out, let's put that aside. This is \nwhat we know.\n  There are more now, but I didn't have a chance to make a new chart. \nWe are getting to 10 million Americans, but over 9 million Americans \nhave new, secure health insurance; 3 million young adults have stayed \non their parents insurance policies; 3.9 million are on Medicaid; and \nthere are 2.1 million exchange plans, the private plans.\n  Let me show this another way on the private plans--the 2.1 million. \nNow we think it is more. It is a little bit more. Here we are. Very, \nvery tough roll-out. Nothing worked. Now it is working, and it is \nspiking, and it is only going to get better.\n  But you wouldn't know that because Senator Cruz keeps saying over and \nover: What have the Democrats in the Senate done to protect the people \nfrom ObamaCare? I have to protect the people from him because if he had \nhis way, he would repeal ObamaCare. I ask you: What is going to happen \nto those young people if Senator Cruz has his way and we repeal \nObamaCare? What happens to the 3 million young adults? They are back on \ntheir own. They have no insurance. They are back at the emergency room. \nWhat happens to those on expanded Medicaid? Forget it. What happens to \nthe exchanges? They would be gone.\n  So while Senator Cruz says we have done nothing to protect the \npeople, the opposite is true. We stand in support of the people--the \npeople's right to get affordable health care. Do we have the perfect \nanswer on every front? No. Do we have to make corrections? Of course.\n  We had a meeting with the President yesterday. He is reaching out his \nhand to the Republicans and Democrats. If we can fix this in any way \nand make it work better, we will.\n  Let's look at some of our other charts as far as what our Republican \ncolleagues want to do when they say repeal ObamaCare. I am telling you, \n400,000 Californians have enrolled, and now it is 500,000. It is \n500,000 Californians who have enrolled in an exchange plan through--\ncoveredCA.com. This is working in my State. It is working.\n  I am not going to allow Senator Cruz to take the benefits away from \nmy people who are writing me letters--and I have some of them here, and \nI will read a little bit of those stories.\n  John Nunnemacher is a 43-year-old freelance graphic artist from San \nJose, and the last time he had health insurance was 15 years ago, when \nhis employer paid for coverage. But as of January 1, John is covered by \na plan he can finally afford. This is what he told the San Jose Mercury \nNews:\n\n       I hoped this day would come. I worried that it wouldn't. \n     And I'm very glad that it finally has.\n\n\n[[Page S429]]\n\n\n  So he is happy, and I am not going to let Senator Cruz take away his \ninsurance. Let's be clear. Let's be clear. He waited for a long time, \nand I am not going back. We can't go back to those days when there was \nno insurance for our young people. We can't go back to the days when \nbeing a woman was a preexisting condition, and you got charged double \nthat of a man. We can't go back to the days where kids were thrown off \ntheir parents' policies. We just can't go back.\n  Amy Torregrossa, 27, is from San Francisco. She had been without \ninsurance since July, when coverage through her partner's company ended \nbecause he changed jobs. She has a congenital heart defect and a \nhistory of high blood pressure. She no longer runs because she says \n``if I twist my ankle or get hit by a car . . . any doctor visit is so \nexpensive.''\n  She signed up on Covered California for a silver plan costing $310 a \nmonth. She made sure her cardiologist was in the insurer's network and \nplans to schedule a checkup for early this year.\n  Amy, I am not going to let anyone take this away from you. I am not.\n  Michelle Strong, 57, is a self-employed product designer. For many \nyears she could not afford any insurance at all because of a false-\npositive--a false positive--test for lupus, which incorrectly flagged \nher as having a preexisting condition. For the past 15 years she could \nonly afford catastrophic insurance. Now, thanks to a tax credit, she \nwill pay $55 a month, with no deductible, and a $3 copay. Here is what \nshe said:\n\n       It just blows my mind that I can get health insurance at \n     this price. I can finally afford checkups, tests, and age-\n     related visits.\n\n  Michelle, I am not going to let anyone take your insurance away from \nyou. You deserve it.\n  Elaine Post, 64, from West Hills, CA. She told CNN:\n\n       When I first got laid off, I tried to get private insurance \n     through the big companies. They all rejected me . . . wanted \n     to charge me really, really high premiums for not very good \n     insurance.\n\n  Now Elaine has coverage through a bronze plan through Covered \nCalifornia that costs $461 a month.\n  Elaine, you are going to keep your insurance and we are going to \nprotect you.\n  Judith Silverstein, 49, is a Californian who was diagnosed with \nmultiple sclerosis in 2007. Her family helps her pay the $750 monthly \ncost of her existing plan--which she only had because of Federal law \nrequiring that insurers who provide employer-based insurance continue \nto offer coverage if the employer goes out of business, as hers did; \notherwise, she would be uninsured because of her MS. ``I researched the \noptions,'' she says. ``Nobody's going to sell you insurance in the \nindividual market if you have MS.'' But next year she will get a \nsubsidy that will get her a silver level plan for $50 a month.\n  Last summer Ellen Holzman and Meredith Vezina, a married couple in \nSan Diego County, got kicked off their long-term Kaiser health plan, \nfor which they had been paying more than $1,300 a month. When they \napplied for a plan with a new insurer, they couldn't get coverage \nbecause Ellen disclosed that she might have carpal tunnel syndrome. \nThrough Covered California, they found a plan through Sharp Healthcare \nthat will cover them both with a subsidy for a total premium of $142 a \nmonth. Holzman says, ``If not for the Affordable Care Act, our ability \nto get insurance would be very limited, if we could get it at all.''\n  Jason Noble, 44, who has his own property management firm in Southern \nCalifornia, found a gold plan that will cover his wife and their three \nchildren for a little less than $1,300 a month. That is slightly more \nthan they would be paying this year for the plan they had in 2013, but \nthe benefits are much greater, including pediatric dental coverage. \nTheir family deductible will fall from $3,400 to zero. Last year, the \nfamily had a health scare that ran them $1,800 in out-of-pocket \nexpenses, but next year, a similar event would cost them nothing. \n``It's definitely a good deal,'' Noble says.\n  Barbara Neff of Santa Monica, who had been stuck in a bad plan \nbecause of a preexisting condition, said she is relieved that under \nObamacare, she will get life-saving preventive care at no cost. Neff \nsaid, ``I have been paying for my mammograms out of pocket, and that's \n$400 to $450 per year,'' Neff says. ``That type of care is 100 percent \ncovered under this new policy.''\n  Rakesh Rikhi of San Jose, CA, paid $950 a month last year to insure \nhimself, his wife and two children with Kaiser. Through Covered \nCalifornia, he will be able to get a similar Kaiser plan that saves his \nfamily $400 a month.\n  Tim Wilsbach, a 40-year-old TV editor who lives in Culver City with \nhis family, had been paying for a bare bones policy with an $11,000 \ndeductible for himself and his 4-year-old son, and another policy with \na $5,000 deductible for his wife. Wilsbach checked out his options on \nthe Covered California website, and was pleased to find a plan for the \nwhole family that offers broader coverage, a much lower $4,000 \ndeductible and a more affordable monthly premium. ``Our premium went \ndown, not quite 100 bucks, and just looking through what the plan \ncovers versus what used to be covered, yeah, I'm quite happy about \nit,'' Wilsbach said.\n  Allan Pacela, from Santa Maria, CA, is a retired engineer on \nMedicare. His wife was insured through Cigna, under a group plan \noffered by her husband's engineers' society, and because of preexisting \nconditions, could not leave the plan even though premiums had gone up \nto $20,000 per year, because no other plan would take her. This year, \nher insurer canceled her entire plan, leaving her with no insurance. \n``So we turned to Obamacare,'' Allan told his local paper. ``She found \nit simple and easy to sign up through an agent in a 10-minute phone \ncall. She obtained their best plan, providing much, much better \ncoverage than in the past. . . . My wife would not have insurance \ncoverage at all as of January 1, if not for Obamacare. And, here's the \nkicker--we now are saving $8,000 per year, for a very much better \nplan.''\n  Megan Foster, from Kern County, CA, said, ``My mom is finally able to \nget health insurance after being denied for so long because of her \nCrohn's disease and epilepsy, and it's for an affordable price. She \nworks full time but her job doesn't offer benefits and she can't work \nwithout her medicine. It's not a perfect solution, but I am happy that \nmy mom doesn't have to choose any more between medicine or groceries.''\n  Lori Greenstein Bremner is a cancer survivor, a single mother and a \nself-employed real estate agent in Sonoma, CA. Before the Affordable \nCare Act, she struggled to obtain and afford health insurance because \nof her pre-existing condition. Now Lori says, ``In January, for the \nfirst time since my diagnosis 36 years ago, I will have an individual \nhealth plan that offers quality coverage for me and my family. I will \nsave $628 every month on premiums. Best of all--I wasn't even asked if \nI've ever had cancer.''\n  Mr. President, I just want to say that when you listen to the \nnaysayers and the bad news bears and everyone who comes here and starts \ncriticizing, you should get to the bottom of it. Look at this 9 million \nnumber, headed toward 10 million, and understand what is happening in \nour Nation. People are getting health coverage.\n  Here is the deal. The way we did it, ObamaCare, is just like it was \nin Massachusetts when Governor Romney put it through. That is where the \nideas came from. We did not do another plan. We did that type of plan, \nand it is working in Massachusetts where I believe 95 percent of the \npeople are covered.\n  Now, I will close with a couple of other protections that are in \neffect, so that you can see why, when Ted Cruz and my other Republican \ncolleagues and friends come to the floor who want to repeal ObamaCare, \nI'm saying: No way. You want to work with us to make it better? \nAbsolutely. But I am not going to let my constituents lose their \ninsurance. You want to tell your constituents they can lose their \ninsurance, that is your business, but don't mess with California.\n  Look here: Already in effect, 3 million young adults insured through \ntheir parents' plans; 71 million Americans are getting free preventive \ncare, such as checkups and birth control and immunizations.\n  You want to take that away from Texans, be my guest. You are not \ngoing to do it because we are not going to let you do it.\n  Health reforms in effect: 17 million kids with preexisting \nconditions, such as asthma and diabetes, cannot be denied coverage. \nInsurers cannot cancel\n\n[[Page S430]]\n\nyour health insurance because you get sick. No lifetime limits on \ncoverage. No annual limits on coverage.\n  You can't deny coverage or charge more for preexisting conditions. \nYou can't charge women more than men. You can't put annual limits on a \nplan.\n  Women. Women. Two-thirds of women are on the minimum wage. Two-thirds \nof minimum wage workers are women. So if you don't support raising the \nminimum wage, you are taking on the women, and that is a fact. They are \nnot students. They are not youngsters.\n  Look. Women now can get contraception so they can plan their \nfamilies. Well-women visits, STD screening, breastfeeding support, \ndomestic violence screening, gestational diabetes screening, HIV \nscreening, HPV testing, this is all happening because of ObamaCare.\n  So I say to anyone within the sound of my voice--if I haven't put you \nto sleep--when anyone gets on the floor and starts complaining about \nObamaCare and wanting to repeal it, just say to them: Why do you want \nto hurt the people of this country who have waited so long to get \nhealth insurance, who have suffered so much, who have gone bankrupt \nbecause somebody had the misfortune of getting cancer? Why do you want \nto go back to those days? That is not good for America. Just because it \nwas President Obama who signed the bill?\n  The Affordable Care Act is now called ObamaCare. What a wonderful \nthing for this President. Anyone who stands and says they want to take \naway these benefits is hurting the American people and I am going to \ncollect these stories and I am going to come to the floor and read \nthem. This is about real people getting secure insurance for the first \ntime in their lives, and it is affordable. No one is going to turn back \nthe clock. We can't go back to those days.\n  So we have to deal with making this health care bill work the best it \ncan. We have to work on income inequality. We have to come back and \nstill work for unemployment insurance extension for the 1.5 million \nAmericans who desperately need help. We have to work on making sure \nthere is a bright future for our families.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                      Pensacola Naval Air Station\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I am going to get to another issue in a \nmoment, but there is a special anniversary in Florida I wish to \ncommemorate, and it is Naval Air Station Pensacola which is now \ncelebrating its centennial anniversary. NAS Pensacola, as it is more \ncommonly known, is a Florida institution and is known as the Cradle of \nNaval Aviation.\n  The first naval airplane flight from Pensacola took place on February \n2, 1914. Over 325,000 alums have gone on to bravely serve with honor in \nour wars, and they have also delighted crowds across the country as \npart of the Blue Angels. They have made their mark on the Florida \nPanhandle and on our Nation's defense in the process.\n  In fact, one of our colleagues, John McCain, trained there. He of \ncourse went on to serve our country heroically and admirably and then \nhas also served us in the Senate. Others who have passed through there \ninclude many NASA astronauts. Alan Shepard, Neil Armstrong, among \nothers, began their aviation careers at NAS Pensacola, and of course \neventually went on to become astronauts and made an immeasurable impact \non American and world history.\n  NAS Pensacola is also the final resting place for thousands of fallen \nwarriors at the Barrancas National Cemetery, a place which truly \nhumbles visitors and reminds us to be thankful that America has been \nblessed with so many courageous patriots throughout our history.\n  Today there are over 17,000 service men and women who continue their \nservice to America at NAS Pensacola, and there are an additional 7,000 \ncivilians who support the base's operations. They are part of a real \ncommunity, where parents are raising their kids, and where many \nveterans who once served there decide to make it their permanent home. \nWe are proud of this in the Florida Panhandle. It makes our State a \nbetter place.\n  So as the celebrations get underway this weekend, I join our State \nand our entire Nation in celebrating 100 years of military excellence \nat NAS Pensacola. We truly give thanks to all the brave men and women \nwho have made this military installation the crown jewel of our \nnational defense and contributed to America's exceptional history.\n\n\n               ObamaCare Taxpayer Bailout Prevention Act\n\n  I also wish to take a moment to talk about an emerging problem with \nthe health care law which has only begun to filter out in the news \ncycle but bears watching in the days and weeks to come.\n  As we all know, a key part of the health care law is the exchanges, \nwhich are theoretically supposed to be competitive private marketplaces \nwhere individuals can go online either through their State exchange or \nthe Federal exchange and buy health insurance at a competitive price, \nand they can choose between different plans. That is the idea behind a \nhealth exchange.\n  In and of itself, the idea of an exchange is not a bad one, if \nappropriately administered and it doesn't come accompanied with all the \nother things the health care law came accompanied with. But there is a \nproblem with the way the exchanges are now designed which has not yet \nreceived the attention it deserves but, I promise, we are going to be \nhearing a lot about in the days to come.\n  The technical term is risk corridors. What it basically means is \ncompanies that participate in an exchange or a marketplace of insurance \nare told there is a reinsurance plan in place which will protect them \nin case of loss or catastrophic loss.\n  For example, let's say you are an insurance provider and go into a \nmarketplace, and then it turns out the demographics of the groups that \nsigned up for your plans didn't turn out the right way or there was an \nenormous spike in health care costs, whatever it may be, and you \nsuffered dramatic losses. A risk corridor is in place to protect you.\n  The reason is, No. 1, a safety net per se for the industry on a \nshort-term basis. The reason that is important is because we want \npatients' bills to be paid and their providers' bills to be paid. The \nproblem is applying that to the health care exchange is going to prove \nextraordinarily problematic.\n  What has happened over the last few weeks, as we predicted would \nhappen, is not enough young people are signing up through the \nexchanges. In order for health insurance to work, you have to have \nenough younger and healthier people on it. If you have a health \ninsurance plan largely composed of people guaranteed to get sick, \neconomically it doesn't work. There is no dispute about that.\n  In fact, by the administration's own statistics, they say at least 38 \npercent of the enrollees in the exchanges had to be under the age of 34 \nin order for the exchanges to work in an actuarially sound way.\n\n  So based on the assumption that was going to happen, insurance \ncompanies bid on these exchanges, offered a product and have begun to \nsign up people. The problem is so far that figure is not being met.\n  The numbers are just starting to come in. We don't know the full \npicture yet, but the trends are troubling.\n  No. 1, not enough people are signing up. The target goal is a total \nof about 7 million people or more by a deadline which has now been \nextended to March 31. The number is less than 2.2 million. There are \nstill 8 weeks left or so, so we will see what happens, but the trends \nare not positive.\n  Here is an even more troubling trend: Only 30 percent of national \nenrollees are from that demographic I described. Only 30 percent are \nunder the age of 34. In Florida, it is only 25 percent.\n  Here is the fundamental problem we have right now with the exchanges, \nbeyond all the other ones we have already discussed ad nauseam: Not \nenough people are signing up and not enough people under the age of 34 \nare signing up.\n  The result is that the way this is trending now, the exchanges are \nbecoming more like a high-risk pool and less like a true competitive \nexchange. Here is why that is problematic: If companies lose money, as \nthey are going to if we look at these figures and as the companies \nthemselves anticipate--in fact, in some of the early disclosures these \ncompanies are making,\n\n[[Page S431]]\n\nwe are starting to see the forecast of losses.\n  If these trends continue and companies lose money because not enough \npeople under the age of 34 signed up for them and not enough people \nsigned up, under the ObamaCare law they will be entitled to a payout \nfrom the high-risk pool. This is a program in place for the first 3 \nyears of these exchanges.\n  What that means is a taxpayer-funded bailout of ObamaCare. For \ntaxpayers of the United States, this means your money is going to go \nfrom your pocket into the pocket of these private companies.\n  What the private companies will tell us is: Look. We bid on this \nproduct when you said the rules were going to be this. But since then \nyou changed the rules even more, and so what was already bad has gotten \nworse.\n  There is not enough awareness about this, but we are going to be \nhearing about it in the weeks to come. As we get closer to the reality \nthat billions of dollars in taxpayers' money is going to be used to \nbail out these exchanges, there is going to be growing outrage around \nthe country and people are going to want answers. I hope my colleagues \nare starting to think about what we need to do.\n  That is why I filed a bill in November called the ObamaCare Taxpayer \nBailout Prevention Act. What it would do is eliminate this provision \nwhich allows for the tax-funded bailouts of these exchanges.\n  As we get closer to this problem, the numbers are as bad or worse \nthan we anticipated. So in the months to come, here is what we can \nexpect to see:\n  First, we can expect to see that companies are now going to say: We \nneed our money. Under the law, we were promised this high-risk bailout. \nWe signed up for it under that assumption. Now we need taxpayer money.\n  I predict the second thing we are going to see is as companies begin \nto prepare their filings for next year, some companies are going to \ndecide that they are not participating in ObamaCare exchanges next year \nat all, which means less choice and less competition and, therefore, \nhigher premiums. Other companies are going to say: We will participate \nbut only at these premiums; and they are going to be significantly \nhigher than the ones we have seen this year, meaning it will be even \nless affordable, meaning even less people under the age of 34 will sign \nup, meaning even more money will have to go from the taxpayer to bail \nout these exchanges.\n  We are still in mid-January and these numbers could change, but \nnobody realistically expects them to. In fact, I have yet to hear from \nanyone knowledgeable about this subject who has said to me: Oh, don't \nworry. In the next 8 weeks, another 5 million to 6 million will sign up \nand we are going to get to over 30 percent of national enrollees. We \nare going to get to over 38 percent of the people signing up being in \nthe demographic of 34 or under.\n  So it is only mid-January. But I come to the floor to sound the alarm \nthat this is coming so people across this country know we are weeks and \nmonths away from transferring potentially billions of dollars from \ntaxpayers to private companies to bail out these exchanges. I promise \nyou, this will not be the last time we hear about this.\n  I encourage my colleagues, as they go home on this recess and talk to \npeople, get informed about this subject because we are going to be \nhearing a lot about it in the weeks and months to come. This is a very \nserious threat--to the law itself, by the way. This is unsustainable.\n  At a time that we have a $17 trillion debt, when so many Americans \nare struggling to find employment which pays them enough to live off \nof, when so many Americans have seen the jobs they once had disappear \nand cannot find a job to replace it, when so many Americans are \nstruggling with a growing cost of living in every aspect of their \nlives--childcare, student loans, utility bills, you name it--to be told \nthat at a time when all of these challenges are happening in the \npersonal economies of so many people that billions of dollars of \ntaxpayer money is going to go to bail out this law, there is going to \nbe collective outrage across the political spectrum in this country and \nrightfully so.\n  Here is the last point I would make: If this law has to be bailed \nout, it is one more reason why it doesn't work. These exchanges are \nsupposed to be private competitive marketplaces, where companies could \nactuarially and soundly price a product and sell it at an affordable \nrate. That is not where they are headed. We are headed toward a day \nsoon, as early as next year--and we will see the filings this year--\nwhen companies are going to decide either not to participate or to \nparticipate but only if they can charge substantially higher premiums \nwith higher copayments and higher deductibles; and, on top of that, the \nonly way they will participate is if they are promised this bailout.\n  We are going to hear a lot about this in the weeks to come, and I \nencourage my colleagues--irrespective of how you feel about this law, I \ncannot imagine any of us believing we are at a time in our Nation's \nhistory, given the challenges we face now, where we should be bailing \nout this plan with taxpayer money being transferred to private \ncompanies to keep them in business.\n  That is where we are headed and we better be able to do something \nabout it soon, because people are not going to stand for it.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                            Thanking Members\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, as chairman of the Senate Veterans' \nAffairs Committee, I take a moment to thank all the members of that \ncommittee for their hard work over the last year. At a time when there \nis obviously an enormous amount of divisiveness and partisanship here \nin the Senate, I am happy to report that by and large there has been a \ngreat deal of bipartisan effort being made in the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee, and I think very productive work as well.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Sanders and Mr. Blumenthal pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 1950 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n\n                        Thanks to Patrick Kilcur\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I spend long periods of time on the floor \ncompared to most Senators. That is my job. In doing so, I get to know \npeople more than probably a lot of people. Over these many years, I \nhave talked about a Senate family, and it really is a Senate family \nand, for me, it really is my family. I know I am being way too \nprotective, and a lot of people say it isn't my business, but that is \nhow I feel. When people leave, I really feel badly because you get to \nknow people and you feel comfortable with the people you know.\n  The reason I mention this today is because one of the people I have \nlearned to really admire and appreciate and joke with and have a good \ntime with is one of the Republican staff members who is leaving. His \nname is Patrick Kilcur. I have no idea whether I pronounced his name \nright, K-I-L-C-U-R. I really don't know the name very well, but I have \nknown him for a long time. We call him Patrick. He is a Republican \nfloor assistant. If I have an issue and there is not a Democratic floor \nperson around, I go to him, and he always gives me the answer that is \nhonest and truthful. That is how we are so well served by these people \nwho fill these spots in this wonderful, historic Chamber.\n  Patrick came to the Senate from Pennsylvania. He is from \nPennsylvania. He worked for a famous Pennsylvania Senator, Arlen \nSpecter. He spent time working with him and worked his way here to the \ncloakroom and became a floor assistant as he is now. He is going to \nleave to go to work with one of my dear personal friends--Chris Dodd.\n  I asked Patrick to come spend a few minutes with me this week before \nhe left and we had a nice visit. I talked about my relationship with \nChris Dodd. I said what a good opportunity to be working for one of the \ngreat orators we have had during the time I have been in the Senate and \none of the nicest people a person could get to know--Chris Dodd.\n  So Patrick will be missed here. I will miss him. I wish him the very \nbest. He is always--I have to be very careful; I don't want to bring \nhim any bad luck. He is engaged now. He is going to have a job. He can \nafford it. So I really wish him well. I will miss him, but I will say \nthis: At least he has a first name. The people he works with, they \ndon't even call him by his first name. They call him Duncan.\n  So, anyway, enough of that. I really will miss you. You have had such \na\n\n[[Page S432]]\n\npositive effect here. You are always happy, in spite of the pressure \nplaced on you from people in the well: How should I vote? How much \nlonger? Trying to get people here to go late--how much longer is it \ngoing to be? So thank you very much. You have been great, and I look \nforward to visiting with you and, hopefully, you and Dodd will let me \nwatch one of those movies some time, because Chris Dodd is the leader \nof the Motion Picture Association of America.\n\n\n                           Thanking the Pages\n\n  Mr. President, another short thing I wish to say. Over the years I \nhave come to admire so very much our pages. They sacrifice to come \nhere. It is not easy for them to come here and go to school for a \nsemester, but they do. This school they go to is no soft school. It is \nhard. They start school at 6 a.m.--I think it is 6 o'clock--and they go \nfor a couple of hours. I know they are supposed to get up around 5. It \nis such a good environment. We have gone out of our way to have a \npleasant place for them to live, the so-called dorm. They have monitors \nwho watch them so very closely. Their parents don't have to worry about \nthem. It is a good experience. They see what happens on a daily basis \nin the bowels of government, the Senate, and they all go different \nways. They are all juniors in high school. They will go back to their \nhigh school and then go on to college, but in their entire life they \nwill never forget their experience here.\n  I went just for a few days when I was a junior in high school--maybe \nI was a senior; it was right after my junior year--to Boys State, and I \nmade friends during the five days we spent there, and they are my \nfriends even today, after all those many years ago, and that is the \nrelationship these pages have developed.\n  So I say to them, thank you very much for the work you do.\n  I was walking out, as I do, this back door the last night or two, and \nI see one of the pages. They have a door open, and I see this list of \nstuff on the wall. So I say: What is that? What they have to know, \namong other things--each of us can be pretty--what is the right word--\ndemanding, although I don't know if that is the right word. Senator \nMcConnell and I have these podiums here all the time, but we are the \nonly two. So when a Senator comes to speak, they need a podium. But \nthey have to get the right podium and the pages have to know, when a \nSenator wants to speak, what podium to get. Is it going to be a low \none, middle-sized, half middle-sized, or a big one? Anyway, they have \nto know that. They have a big chart up there to make sure they don't \nmake mistakes.\n  They make sure we have water. I don't like warm water. I don't like \ncold water. I don't like ice. The pages have learned we all have our \ndemands for water--sparkling, half sparkling, half regular, half tap. \nAnyway, I am so grateful they took the time to leave their homes to \ncome here to go to school, to be students in the Senate.\n\n\n                            Flood Insurance\n\n  Mr. President, finally, we are going to have a vote when we come back \non flood insurance. Senators Menendez, Landrieu, and Isakson have \nworked on this for a long time. Senator Landrieu has been--what is the \nright word--persistent, and that is an understatement. She has been on \nthis as she can get on something and never get off of it. We have come, \nover the last several months, within just inches, we thought, of being \nable to have an agreement and move it to the floor. But she and Senator \nIsakson have worked hard to get a unanimous consent request to bring it \nto the floor, and they are always just a little bit short. So I am \nfiling cloture in just a few minutes on a motion to proceed on this \nmatter, and that will be the vote when we get back. If they are able to \nwork out an agreement, then we can always modify having that vote and \nmove forward. As I understand it, there are five or ten amendments they \nwant to have to that bill, and we have all agreed that is OK. So I hope \nwe can do that when we come back, and I thank those Senators for their \ngood work.\n  Mr. President, could I ask what the pending business is before the \nSenate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the motion to proceed \nto S. 1926.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. REID. I have a cloture motion at the desk relative to that \nmeasure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to calendar No. 294, S. 1926, a bill to delay the \n     implementation of certain provisions of the Biggert-Waters \n     Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012, and for other purposes.\n         Harry Reid, Robert Menendez, Mary L.

Mr. President, I would like to say a fond farewell to \nPatrick Kilcur, a Republican floor assistant who has decided to move on \nafter 7 very eventful years here in the Senate. Patrick has been a real \nasset to the conference but also just a great guy to have around. And \nthat is something that has been true for everybody from the pages to \nthe Senators. Anytime morale stated to flag in the late hours around \nhere, Patrick was usually the one who gave everybody a lift. He has got \na great spirit and a great sense of humor, qualities that we are always \nin great need of on the floor, especially late at night or during the \nvarious crises we have had to deal with over the past several years. \nAnd he has just been a very thoughtful member of the team. On a trip to \nChina a few years back, Patrick returned not just with some new custom \nshirts but with a panda hat for all the Senate pages. He has always \nbeen quick to offer guidance to the pages and to thank them. And he \nalways made time when the end of their terms arrived to take them out \nto lunch and send them off the right way. Patrick is a proud native of \nWest Chester, PA. He first came here as a floor monitor for Senator \nSpecter in 2006 and moved to the cloakroom 2 years later. He became \nfloor assistant in 2012. We will miss his ready smile and his knowledge \nof the floor. I know the pages will miss him too. On a happy note, we \nare glad that Patrick found his future wife Julie here in the Senate. \nPatrick and Julie just got engaged last month, and we wish them all the \nvery best in their future life together. So to Patrick, I say thank you \non behalf of the entire Senate. Best wishes in all your future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/16/senate-section/article/S432-3", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S432-S433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ELECTIONS IN BELARUS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, 3 years ago, the country of Belarus held a \npresidential election that marked--instead of finally joining the rest \nof democratic Europe--a brutal crackdown on freedom of expression and \nbasic democratic principles. There was a glimmer of hope that perhaps \nthis would finally be an opportunity for the Belarusian people to \nfreely choose their own president in an honest and open election. No \nlonger would the Belarusian people have to endure under the ``Last \nDictator of Europe,'' strongman Alexander Lukashenko.\n  Tragically, those hopes were quickly dashed when Lukashenko simply \nclaimed another term as president amid elections described by \ninternational monitors as seriously flawed.\n  On election night, December 19, 2010, hundreds of Belarusian citizens \nwere beaten and arrested by KGB henchman--that is right, Belarus still \nhas a KGB security service--for having the\n\n[[Page S433]]\n\nnerve to run in the election or peaceably demonstrate for an honest \naccounting of the election results. It was the worst crackdown in \ndecades--although certainly not the first under Lukashenko's iron first \nin which he uses a combination of repression, intimidation, and torture \nto cling to power.\n  I have come to the Senate floor a number of times during the past 3 \nyears to talk about the tragic events in Belarus, where the Lukashenko \nregime has imprisoned and mistreated numerous political and human \nrights activists. Let me add with great irony and sadness--that Russia \nis presently trying to strongarm our friends in Ukraine to join a \nRussia, Belarus, Kazakhstan trade bloc instead of letting it sign an \nassociation agreement with the European Union. Sign up with the last \ndictatorship of Europe or the European Union--not much of a choice if \nyou ask me.\n  I have been glad to see that with a push from the international \ncommunity, some of Belarus's political prisoners have been released, \nincluding most of the 2010 presidential candidates who had the temerity \nto run for office.\n  Some of you may have seen an op-ed in the Washington Post last month, \nwritten by one such presidential candidate from the 2010 election in \nBelarus, Andrei Sannikov. Mr. Sannikov was sentenced to 5 years in jail \nfor having the nerve to run against Lukashenko. At his trial, Sannikov \nsaid prison guards threatened to harm his wife and small son in an \neffort to secure a confession. Lukashenko's henchmen even threatened to \ntake custody of his son, who was then 3 years old. Yet, he has not \nstopped working for a democratic Belarus. In his December 27 op-ed, he \nargues,\n\n       . . . it is important to remember that Ukraine's northern \n     neighbor Belarus, [is] a country that lies geographically in \n     the heart of Europe but politically is more akin to a Soviet \n     backwater. The majority of its citizens want to be free, but \n     they are repressed by a brutal dictator .It is not a question \n     of if but when Belarusians will rid themselves of Europe's \n     last dictatorship and join the community of European \n     democracies.\n\n  He reminds us that there is still work to be done.\n  Take for example, president candidate Mikalai Statkevich. Statkevich, \nwho was sentenced to six years in a medium-security prison following \nthe 2010 election, remains in jail. He can barely receive medical \nassistance or meet with his family or lawyers. He is constantly \nharassed and pushed to sign bogus confessions for crimes he never \ncommitted.\n  Or for example, Ales Byalyatski, a prominent human rights activist \nstill in jail. He is Vice-Chairman of the International Federation for \nHuman Rights and President of the Human Rights Center Viasna, an \norganization that offers financial and legal assistance to political \nprisoners and their families. I don't think Ales or his wife, Natalia, \nwho has visited with my office, ever thought their family would be \namong the ones they typically helped.\n  Moreover, the Lukashenko government targeted not only various \npolitical and human rights activists after the December 2010 election \nand protests, but it did so even before anything had happened, \narresting for example, Eduard Lobau who had been a member of the youth \ndemocracy movement. Lobau was arrested and assaulted for peaceably \nprotesting in the days leading up to the election.\n  Considering what they have fought for and what they have been \nthrough, it is no wonder that Statkevich, Belyatsky, and Lobau had been \nshort-listed for the Sakharov Prize by the European Parliament, as well \nas receiving a wide variety of international attention. While the \nSakharov prize ultimately went to Malala Yousafzai, a worthy recipient, \nwe cannot forget these three men and the others who rot in Belarusian \nKGB jails on dubious and trumped up charges. Their families, too, are \ncontinuously denied basic legal rights.\n  In 2012, I joined with my colleagues in the Senate to introduce \nSenate Resolution 105, which passed unanimously, condemning the sham \nelections and calling on the Belarusian regime to release all political \nprisoners. The resolution also called for new elections in Belarus that \nmeet international standards, supported the tightening of sanctions \nagainst the Belarusian state oil and petrochemical company, and urged \nthe International Ice Hockey Federation to suspend the 2014 Ice Hockey \nChampionship in Minsk until all Belarusian political prisoners are \nreleased.\n  Sadly, our calls have gone unheeded by the International Ice Hockey \nFederation, which still plans to hold its 2014 championship in Minsk \nwhile political prisoners languish in KGB prisons. I simply cannot \nunderstand how the International Ice Hockey Federation can give hockey-\nloving strongman Lukashenko such a propaganda hook amid his country's \nhuman rights travesty.\n  I visited Belarus just weeks following the sham elections. I met with \nthe family members of many of these jailed activists. The stories of \nmissing or harassed loved ones, including children, were heartbreaking.\n  But the perseverance we have seen from civil society groups and human \nrights defenders in Belarus has been deeply inspiring. Despite \nintimidation and threat, these activists continue to fight for their \nfreedoms. They did so through parliamentary elections during September \n2012, also decried by international observers, and they do so through \nthe many anniversaries of the election and ensuing protests. And they \npersevered most recently, when Lukashenko signed a law that requires \nfuture parliamentary elections to be held in single rounds and bans any \ncalls to boycott elections.\n  I can only hope their efforts come to fruition in 2015 when Belarus \nis slated to host its next presidential election.\n  Until then, I will continue to stand in the Senate to call on \nLukashenko to release the remaining political prisoners and stand with \nthe people of Belarus in their quest for democracy and justice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/16/senate-section/article/S433-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S433-S434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am not anyone would call a ``blue \nblood''--at least not in the conventional sense of that term. My \nancestors did not come over on the Mayflower. My mom was an immigrant; \nshe came to this country from Lithuania when she was 2 years old. But I \ndo have some blue blood in my veins--Hoya blue--for Georgetown \nUniversity.\n  With help of affordable loans from the United States Government, this \nimmigrant's son from East St. Louis, IL was able to earn two degrees \nfrom Georgetown University--an undergraduate degree from the Walsh \nSchool of Foreign Service and a law degree from the Georgetown Law \nCenter.\n  In addition, it was a college internship while I was a Georgetown \nundergraduate 50 years ago that first brought me to the United States \nSenate. I had the amazing good luck to land an internship with Senator \nPaul Douglas of Illinois--one of the great ones. He had a brilliant \nmind and enormous moral and political courage. Had I not gone to \nGeorgetown, it is likely that I never would have met Paul Douglas and I \nwould not be here today. Had I not gone to Georgetown, I never would \nhave met some of my greatest teachers.\n  I owe Georgetown a great deal, so I would like to take a moment to \nsay thank you as this great university prepares to celebrate an \nhistoric milestone. Next week--on January 23--Georgetown University \nwill celebrate its 225th anniversary.\n  January 23, 1789. That was 6 weeks before the United States \nConstitution took effect and 6 weeks before the first United States \nCongress was seated.\n  Georgetown was founded by John Carroll, America's first Catholic \nbishop. It was America's first Catholic and first Jesuit college. In \nhis proposal for the new university, Father John Carroll wrote that in \nkeeping with ``the liberal Principle of our Constitution, the [school] \nwill be open to Students of Every Religious Profession.''\n  That steadfast commitment to religious liberty remains a hallmark of \nGeorgetown University. Today, only about 40 percent of Georgetown \nstudents identify as Roman Catholic. The other 60 percent are \nProtestants, Jews, Muslims, Baha'i, Buddhist, Hindu, Mormon and members \nof other faith traditions.\n\n[[Page S434]]\n\n  On November 22, 1791, Georgetown enrolled its first student, William \nGaston, from North Carolina. Due to illness shortly thereafter, William \nGaston was also Georgetown's first dropout.\n  But he turned out well. He eventually graduated from Princeton \nUniversity and returned to North Carolina, where he was elected to the \nState Senate . . . the state House of Commons . . . and the United \nStates House of Representatives, making him the first Georgetown \nstudent to serve in Congress.\n  Many other Georgetown graduates have gone on to serve in elected \noffice. Among them are are former President Bill Clinton, Supreme Court \nJustice Antonin Scalia, several members of this Congress, including the \nPresident Pro Tem of this Senate, Senator Patrick Leahy.\n  My State of Illinois may hold the current record for statewide office \nholders whose views of public service Georgetown helped to shape. Not \nonly are my Senate partner, Senator Mark Kirk and I both Georgetown \ngraduates but so are our Governor Pat Quinn, our Lieutenant Governor, \nSheila Simon, and our state Attorney General, Lisa Madigan.\n  In the years following the Civil War, Father Patrick Healy helped \ntransform Georgetown into a modern university. So profound was his \ninfluence that Father Healy is often called Georgetown's ``second \nfounder.''\n  Father Healy's accomplishments are all the more extraordinary when \nyou consider that the laws of Georgia, the State in which he was born, \nmade it a crime even to teach him to read. You see, Father Patrick \nHealy was born a slave. His father was a wealthy Irish American cotton \nfarmer and his mother was mixed race--half white and half African \nAmerican. His parents joined in a common-law marriage and gave all of \ntheir children excellent educations in Northern and European schools.\n  Father Healy's mixed-race background was not widely known until the \n1960s, when he was recognized as the first American of African ancestry \nto earn a PhD, the first to become a Jesuit priest, and the first to be \npresident of a predominantly white college.\n  Georgetown University today is one of the top research universities \nin the world. The university today has around 7,500 undergraduate and \nover 9,500 post-graduate students from every State and territory in the \nUnited States and more than 130 foreign nations. In 2001, Georgetown \ngained its first lay president, John DeGioia, a philosopher by training \nand a champion of civil discourse, for whom I have great respect.\n  Education at Georgetown is rooted in the Jesuit tradition: ``for the \nglory of God and the well-being of humankind.''\n  I am continually impressed by the commitment of Georgetown students \nto causes of social and economic justice.\n  Georgetown has the second most politically active student body in the \nUnited States according to the Princeton Review. Georgetown is also one \nof the top-10 yearly producers of Peace Corps volunteers. Georgetown \nstudents founded one of the first chapters of STAND, the student-led \nmovement to end mass atrocities in Darfur and elsewhere. And Georgetown \nfaculty, administrators and--especially--students remain fearless and \ndedicated champions of a cause that is very close to my heart, the \nDREAM Act.\n  I could not speak about my alma mater without bragging a little about \nits athletic teams and programs. The men's basketball team is \nparticularly noteworthy. In 1984, it was the NCAA championship under \nCoach John Thompson. All told, the Georgetown men's basketball team is \ntied for the most Big East conference tournament titles with 7, and has \nmade 27 NCAA tournament.\n  U.S. News & World Report lists Georgetown's athletics program among \nthe 20 best in the Nation. Perhaps even more impressive, Georgetown's \nstudent athletes have a 94 percent graduation success rate.\n  I did not start out at Georgetown. I spent my freshman year at \nanother Jesuit university, St. Louis University, just across the \nMississippi River from my home town of East St. Louis, IL.\n  Partway through my first year, I decided that I wanted to go away for \nschool. So, I went to the university guidance office, looked through \nsome pamphlets and chose two. I had never been to either place.\n  I told my mom that I wanted to go away for school and I had narrowed \nit down to two choices. I said the first is a school in California \ncalled Stanford. Mom said, ``No, if you go to California you'll never \ncome home.''\n  I said the other is a school in Washington called Georgetown \nUniversity.'' She thought for a minute and then said, ``OK. Your \nbrother goes to Washington frequently for his work. He can keep an eye \non you.'' That is how I ended up attending one of the best universities \nin America and the world.\n  My mom is gone now.

Mr. President, this week is the 50th anniversary of the \nSurgeon General's landmark report on smoking and health. I join with \nsome of my colleagues who have taken the floor this week to commemorate \nthis anniversary.\n  Surgeon General Dr. Luther Terry's report was groundbreaking. For the \nfirst time, the government warned that ``smoking is a health hazard of \nsufficient importance in the United States''. This fundamentally \nchanged how our country thought about smoking and was the basis for \nmany of the successful tobacco control efforts of the past 50 years.\n  Indeed, according to CDC data, in 1965 the year after the Surgeon \nGeneral's report--approximately 42 percent of American adults smoked \ncigarettes. By 2011, that rate had dropped by more than half to 19 \npercent. Hopefully this trend will continue, leading to better health \nfor millions of Americans.\n  Throughout my time in Congress, I have worked on initiatives to \ndiscourage our children from becoming smokers, supported measures to \nban smoking in schools, and worked to enhance the FDA's ability to \nregulate the sale and distribution of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco.\n  We have come a long way since I proposed legislation in the late \nnineties to deny tobacco companies tax deductions for advertising to \nchildren. I was an original cosponsor of the Family Smoking Prevention \nand Tobacco Control Act, which became law in 2009 and incorporated the \ngoals in my bill to keep the tobacco industry from targeting children \nas new customers. This law provides the FDA with the explicit authority \nto protect the public from deceptive cigarette advertisements, prevent \nthe targeting of minors, and remove certain harmful ingredients from \ncigarettes.\n  This was an important effort. But we also must continue to address \nnew tobacco-related concerns as they arise. For instance, I was pleased \nto join several of my colleagues last year in urging the FDA to issue \ndeeming regulations asserting its regulatory authority over e-\ncigarettes and other tobacco products, and it is my hope that it will \ndo so soon.\n  We have made great strides during the last 50 years in reducing \nsmoking rates and preventing tobacco-related illnesses, but we can and \nmust do more. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle to continue these efforts, which I believe are \ncritically important to our Nation's long-term health.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/16/senate-section/article/S434-2", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S434-S435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n            Chief Warrant Officer 3 Andrew Langston McAdams\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise today to express our Nation's \ndeepest thanks and gratitude to a Wyoming solider and his family. On \nJanuary 10, 2014, CWO3 Andrew McAdams of Cheyenne, WY, was killed in \nthe line of duty in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. Along with \nhis fellow MC-12 crew members, Chief Warrant Officer 3 McAdams died \nfrom injuries he sustained while conducting surveillance operations in \neastern Afghanistan.\n\n[[Page S435]]\n\n  Chief McAdams deployed with Wyoming Army National Guard Detachment \n53. He was attached to B Company, 306th Aerial Exploitation Battalion, \nTask Force ODIN-Afghanistan. Before graduating from Cheyenne East High \nSchool, he joined the Army National Guard and graduated from the U.S. \nArmy Warrant Officer Candidate School at Fort Rucker, AL. Andrew's \nfriends have described him as a kind man with an infectious sense of \nhumor. Those who served with Chief McAdams recall his passion for \naviation. It is that passion for flight which led him to serve Wyoming \nand our Nation.\n  Mr. President, it is because of individuals like Andrew McAdams who \nwear the uniform that we continue to live safe and free. Our men and \nwomen who answer the call to service deserve respect and recognition \nfor the enormous burden that they take upon themselves to protect our \nNation. They put everything on the line every day. Because of them and \ntheir families, our Nation remains free and strong in the face of \ndanger.\n  In the book of John, Jesus said that ``greater love has no man than \nthis, that he lay his life down for his friend.'' Andrew gave his life, \nthat last full measure of devotion, so we can live in a free nation. He \ngave his life defending his country and its people, and we honor him \nfor this selfless sacrifice.\n  Chief Warrant Officer 3 McAdams is survived by his wife Carol and \nbaby daughter, his mother Katherine and father Brien, sister Laretta \nand brother-in-law Erick. Andrew is also survived by his brothers and \nsisters in arms of the U.S. Army. As we say goodbye to a husband, a \nfather, a son, a brother, and an American soldier, our Nation pays its \ndeepest respect to Chief McAdams for his courage, his love of country, \nand his sacrifice, so that we may remain free. He was a hero in life, \nand he remains a hero in memory. All of Wyoming, and indeed the entire \nNation, is proud of him. May God bless him and his family, and welcome \nhim with open arms.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/16/senate-section/article/S435-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING WILFRED BILLEY\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, last month the flags of the \nNavajo Nation flew at half mast, in honor of Wilfred E. Billey. Mr. \nBilley was one of the legendary Navajo Code Talkers. He died at the age \nof 90 on December 12. His passing is an occasion to reflect on a truly \nheroic life, and on the vital contribution of the Navajo Code Talkers \nto America's victory in World War II.\n  Wilfred Billey was born on December 28, 1922, in Sanostee, NM. He was \nraised by his grandparents. In the summers, he herded sheep and farmed \nin the Chuska Mountains. In 1941, Wilfred was attending Navajo \nMethodist Mission School in Farmington when a Marine recruiter visited \nthe school. Still a teenager, Wilfred would travel half way around the \nworld with the all-Navajo U.S. Marine Corps Platoon 297.\n  The Navajo Code Talkers turned their language into an unbreakable \ncode. They would use the language of the Navajo people as a weapon to \ndefend our freedoms. In battle after battle, in ferocious combat, they \nused that code time and again to help secure Allied victory. Their \nservice was all the more remarkable in that they fought so bravely for \nfreedom in a world that did not always accord freedom to them.\n  Wilfrid's journey would take him throughout the Pacific theater. He \nwould witness some of the bloodiest, most brutal fighting of World War \nII at Tarawa, Saipan, and Okinawa. The code he spoke, however, would \nsave countless American lives, and help lead to allied victory.\n  Despite this work, this brave Marine never forgot those whom he \nbelieved to be the real heroes. His daughter, Barbara, in an interview \nwith the Indian Country Today Media Network, recalled her father's \nhumility. ``I'm not a hero,'' he said. ``The heroes are the ones we \nleft behind.''\n  While most Americans would learn about the battles at sea and on \nland, the story of the Navajo Code Talkers was kept a secret, until the \ntrue purpose of their service was revealed over 20 years later.\n  In 2001, Congress honored Wilfred Billey and his fellow Navajo Code \nTalkers with public recognition and Congressional medals. Wilfred \nhelped draft the words inscribed on the medals: ``The Navajo language \nwas used to defeat the enemy.''\n  Wilfred Billey defended our Nation during time of war and peril \nabroad, and he continued to serve by working to lead the youth of the \nNavajo Nation. He returned to New Mexico and obtained bachelor's and \nmaster's degrees, and embarked on a career as an educator. Wilfred \nworked for four decades in education, including at the Navajo Methodist \nMission School, and as principal at Shiprock High School. When he \nretired, he continued to ranch and farm, and to advocate for and \ninspire others in his community.\n  In Wilfred Billey's long and remarkable life, he exhibited impressive \nhumility and unwavering service to his people, his community, and his \ncountry. If we look for exemplars of courage and commitment, we need \nlook no further than Wilfred Billey and his band of brothers among the \nNavajo Code Talkers and the U.S. Marines. We are all forever in their \ndebt.\n  My wife, Jill, and I extend our sincere sympathy to Wilfred's family. \nHe will be missed by those who knew him, and he will be forever \nremembered by a grateful nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/16/senate-section/article/S435-2", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CONGRATULATING GREG MADDUX\n\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate one of \nNevada's own and four time Cy Young award winner Greg Maddux for being \nselected to the Baseball Hall of Fame. Greg ``Mad Dog'' Maddux excelled \nat the major league level, not only with refined skills and superior \npitching mechanics, but also a mental approach to the game that was \nunmatched. His pitching philosophy has made him one of the greatest \npitchers of the ``live-ball'' era.\n  A 1984 graduate of Valley High School in Las Vegas, Greg Maddux \nexcelled on the mound as a right-handed pitcher before being drafted by \nthe Chicago Cubs in the second round of the 1984 Major League Baseball \ndraft. Mad Dog then spent the next 23 seasons accruing 355 wins, 3,371 \nstrikeouts, and an unrivaled record of 18 Golden Gloves for the likes \nof the Chicago Cubs, San Diego Padres, Los Angeles Dodgers, and the \nAtlanta Braves, a feat that still remains unmatched. Mad Dog's prolific \nmajor league career also led him to be the only player in history to \nrecord 17 straight, 15-win seasons. It is no doubt that these numbers \nand records led to his near unanimous vote for entry to the Hall of \nFame.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Greg Maddux for a \ndistinguished playing career. It is my hope that he will serve as an \nexample of what great things Nevadans can accomplish when they work \nwith commitment and determination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/16/senate-section/article/S435-3", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S435-S436]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        REMEMBERING JOSE MONTOYA\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nhonoring the life of Jose Montoya, a husband, father, professor, \nactivist, artist, and poet. Jose Montoya passed away on September 25, \n2013. He was 81 years old.\n  Jose Montoya was born in Escobosa, NM and grew up in the farm towns \nof California's Central Valley. He served in the U.S. Navy during the \nKorean War before earning a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from the \nCalifornia College of the Arts and a Master of Fine Arts from \nCalifornia State University, Sacramento.\n  Cognizant of the plight of farm workers because of his own experience \npicking grapes as a boy in the fields of Delano and Fowler, Jose \nMontoya became an advocate for the rights of farmworkers. In 1969, Mr. \nMontoya co-founded the Rebel Chicano Art Front--later known as the \nRoyal Chicano Air Force--a highly influential collaboration of artists \nwho worked alongside Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta to generate public \nawareness of the struggles of migrant farmworkers.\n  Mr. Montoya also touched the lives of thousands of students during \nhis 27-year tenure as a professor of art, photography, and education at \nCalifornia State University, Sacramento, where he created the Barrio \nArt Program. Designed to provide students with hands-on experience \nworking with communities in the arts, this program continues to serve \nas a model for arts-based service learning programs at\n\n[[Page S436]]\n\nother universities. In addition to his contributions as an artist, \nactivist, and educator, Montoya was an accomplished poet who was \nselected as the city of Sacramento's Poet Laureate in 2002.\n  Jose Montoya's legacy was eloquently summarized by his son Richard in \nan op-ed written for The Sacramento Bee: ``Jose Montoya was a cultural \nfront liner and first responder. A doer. A creator who brought levity, \ndefiance and satirical wit to the bloody fields of the San Joaquin as \nwell as to the frigid halls of academe, all the way to the State \nCapitol and beyond.''\n  He is survived by his wife, Juanita Jue, along with eight children, \n19 grandchildren and one great-granddaughter. My heart goes out to his \nfamily and loved ones, and my thoughts and prayers are with them. We \nare indebted to him for his dedication to social justice and his \nimmeasurable contributions to the community and our society.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/16/senate-section/article/S436-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S436]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO AARON A. BAER\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I wish to offer my best \nwishes to a dear friend, the Honorable Aaron A. Baer, who will \ncelebrate his 100th birthday on Saturday, January 25. Judge Baer, known \nto his family as the ``centennial cowboy,'' was born in Baltimore on \nJanuary 25,1914, on High Street in what is now Little Italy. His father \ncame to the United States from Russia, landing in Baltimore's Fell's \nPoint in approximately 1890. His father became a tailor and worked in a \nfactory making clothing. Judge Baer graduated from Forrest Park High \nSchool in 1933. He attended the University of Baltimore Law School and \ngraduated in 1937. He supported himself and paid for law school by \nrepairing and replacing tar roofs.\n  Judge Baer passed the bar in 1937 and practiced real estate law for \nseveral years. He then became an assistant Baltimore City solicitor, an \nassistant attorney general, and a State senator for the 5th District in \n1959. He was appointed to the Municipal Court of Baltimore City in 1961 \nby then-Governor J. Millard Tawes. In 1971 he was appointed to the \nnewly created District Court of Maryland by then-Governor Marvin \nMandel. He retired as a district court judge in 1981.\n  Judge Baer married Judy Weinberg in 1941 and has two children. His \nfirst child is Susan Reichmister, who is married to Dr. Jerome \nReichmister. They happen to be neighbors as well as friends. They have \ntwo children: Beth, who is married to Bart Casper, and Jodi, who is \nmarried to Craig Kessler. Judge Baer has four great-grandchildren: \nNicole, Sloane, Mitchell, and Blair. His second child is the Honorable \nBarbara Baer Waxman, who is administrative judge of the District Court \nof Maryland for Baltimore City. She is married to Dr. Carl. Waxman. No \nlist of family members would be complete without mentioning Judge \nBaer's ``grand-dog,'' Shayna Waxman. Judge Baer and his beloved wife \nJudy were married for 66 years before she passed away shortly after \ntheir 66th wedding anniversary in 2007.\n  My father Meyer, whose parents were also Russian immigrants, also \nserved on the bench. He and Judge Baer were close friends, which is how \nI came to know Judge Baer. It has been a great privilege to know Judge \nBaer, to receive his counsel, and to count him not just as a close \nfriend of my father's but as my close friend too, and not just Judge \nBaer but the rest of his wonderful family, whom I have just mentioned.\n  Judge Baer has lived an exemplary life devoted to public service, the \ncommunity, and to his family. Judge Baer lives independently and spends \neach winter in Florida. He was an avid horseback rider for over 60 \nyears--hence, the cowboy nickname--and only stopped riding this past \nJuly.\n  It is an understatement to say that Judge Baer has lived an \nextraordinary life. He grew up without an indoor bathroom or electric \nlights. He drove one of the first cars and owned one of the first \nmotorcycles, the venerable Indian Scout. Now, he uses a computer and a \ncell phone. I am sure all of my colleagues here in the Senate will join \nme in congratulating Judge Baer on his 100th birthday and sending along \nour best wishes as he begins his second century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/16/senate-section/article/S436-2", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S436]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING BERNIE ANDERSON\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to remember the life \nof my colleague, assemblyman Bernie Anderson, who passed on January 10, \n2014. Serving with him as a fellow freshman in the Nevada Assembly was \na privilege, and I am fortunate to have had the opportunity to know and \nwork alongside such a dedicated public servant. As a longtime teacher, \nassemblyman, and member of the Nevada National Guard, Bernie honorably \nserved the Silver State for decades. I am proud to join the citizens of \nWashoe County and the State of Nevada to remember his legacy of service \nto his community.\n  A native Nevadan, Bernie was a graduate of Bishop Manogue High School \nand University of Nevada, Reno alumni. From 1991 to 2010, Bernie served \nin the Nevada Assembly, representing Washoe County. During his time in \nthe legislature, he served as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nwhere he displayed a passion for the committee's work and often served \nas a mentor to his colleagues, offering invaluable advice and support.\n  Bernie was also a teacher in Sparks, where he taught government and \nhistory in the city's schools for 32 years. As a longtime educator and \navid reader, Bernie dedicated his life and career to education. In \nOctober 1985, he received the Teacher of the Month award from the Reno/\nSparks Chamber of Commerce. Educators work tirelessly to ensure our \nNation's students are prepared to compete in the 21st century, and I am \ngrateful for Bernie's dedication on behalf of Nevada's youth.\n  Not only did he serve the citizens of Nevada as a legislator and a \nschoolteacher, Bernie was also a member of the Nevada National Guard. \nIn 2007, he was honored with the Charles Dick Medal of Merit in \nrecognition of his contributions to the National Guard. On behalf of \nall Nevadans, I thank Bernie for his many years of faithful, selfless \nservice.\n  Today, I extend my deepest sympathies to Bernie's wife Clyda, their \nchildren, and family and friends. I would ask my colleagues to join me \nin celebrating the life of a dedicated public servant who served the \nSilver State proudly. Nevada will miss him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/16/senate-section/article/S436-3", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S436-S437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING CHRISTMAS CAN CURE\n\n Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, today I wish to join the New \nHampshire chapter of the Military Officers Association of America, \nMOAA, in recognizing the work of Christmas Can Cure, a New Hampshire \norganization committed to helping disabled veterans and their families, \nespecially around the holidays. On January 25, 2014, Christmas Can Cure \nwill receive the Granite State Warriors Award, given by the MOAA to New \nHampshire organizations making the most significant contributions to \nthe Armed Forces of the United States.\n  Founded in 2008 by the Carrier family in their Jackson, NH, home, \nChristmas Can Cure was born from the simple desire to invite returning \nwarriors and their families to experience a white Christmas in New \nHampshire. As they further developed their idea, the Carrier family \nrealized that they could give back to wounded warriors and their \nfamilies by relieving the financial and emotional stress of planning a \nfamily vacation for the holidays. The mission of Christmas Can Cure is \nnot only to arrange a fun and memorable vacation, but also to provide \nservicemembers and their families the opportunity to relax and \nreconnect.\n  The organization has enjoyed great success, and has joined with the \nWounded Warrior Project to reach veterans around the country. The \nCarrier family has also recently partnered with the Lee family, owners \nof Eureka Resort, affording Christmas Can Cure an additional holiday \ndestination in Park City, UT. It is clear that this already well-\nestablished organization is continuing to gain momentum and broaden its \nimpact on the lives of veterans and their families across the Nation.\n  On behalf of the people of New Hampshire, I thank the Carrier family \nand others who have donated their time and efforts to Christmas Can \nCure. The selflessness and patriotism of their mission is a true \nexample of what makes ours such a great State, and I look forward to \nhearing more stories of\n\n[[Page S437]]\n\nlives that have been touched by the great work of this Granite State \norganization.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/16/senate-section/article/S437-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNIZING VETERANS COUNT\n\n Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I rise today to join the New \nHampshire chapter of the Military Officers Association of America, \nMOAA, in recognizing the critical work of Veterans Count, a New \nHampshire organization that has proven a critical ally in ongoing \nefforts to support servicemembers, veterans, and their families. On \nJanuary 25, 2014, Veterans Count will receive the Granite State \nWarriors Award, given by the MOAA to New Hampshire organizations making \nthe most significant contributions to the Armed Forces of the United \nStates. A program of Easter Seals, Veterans Count helps servicemembers \nand their families throughout the deployment cycle and beyond.\n  The hallmark of Veterans Count's approach to providing support is \ntheir partnership with the Deployment Cycle Support Program, DCSP, \nwhich has assisted thousands of servicemembers and their families since \nits inception in 2007. The program was built on the understanding that \nthe strains of a military deployment are shared and can both precede \nand outlast the deployment itself. Thanks to the work and collaboration \nof New Hampshire groups like Veterans Count, the DCSP has provided \nextraordinary support to veterans and their families.\n  Veterans Count also deserves recognition for their work addressing \nmental health and suicide awareness. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan \nwounded our warriors in ways that were not previously well understood \nand although mental health and suicide prevention efforts are ongoing, \nwe must do more to help those soldiers and veterans in need. Veterans \nCount is at the forefront of these efforts and, in 2012 alone, the \ngroup intervened successfully in 29 suicide risk situations.

A bill to repeal the War Powers Resolution and to provide \nfor proper war powers consultation, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join my colleague, \nthe junior Senator from Virginia, as we introduce the War Powers \nConsultation Act of 2014.\n  This legislation is the final product of the National War Powers \nCommission, which was a bipartisan effort co-led by former Secretary of \nState Jim Baker and former Secretary of State Warren Christopher. The \ncommission was set up by the Miller Center at the University of \nVirginia to devise a modern and workable war powers consultation \nmechanism for the executive and legislative branches. It included some \nof our Nation's most distinguished and respected thinkers and \npractitioners of national security policy and law. In 2008, after more \nthan a year of hard work, the commission released the final product--an \nactual legislative proposal to repeal and replace the War Powers \nResolution of 1973, which no American President has ever accepted as \nconstitutional.\n  As does my colleague, I view our introduction of this legislation \ntoday as the start of an important congressional and national debate, \nnot the final word in that debate. We wish to pick up where the \nNational War Powers Commission left off 6 years ago, and we do so fully \nunderstanding and hopeful that this legislation should be considered \nand debated and amended and improved through regular order.\n  My colleague from Virginia has done a great job on this legislation, \nand I am proud to join him. I wish to expand a bit on why updating the \nWar Powers Resolution is such a worthwhile endeavor for the Senate to \nconsider right now.\n  The Constitution gives the power to declare war to the Congress, but \nCongress has not formally declared war since June of 1942 even though \nour Nation has been involved in dozens of military actions of one scale \nor another since that time. There is a reason for this. The nature of \nwar is changing. It is increasingly unlikely that the combat operations \nour Nation will be involved in will resemble those of World War II, \nwhere the standing armies and navies of nation states squared off \nagainst those of rival nation states on clearly defined fields of \nbattle. Rather, the conflicts in which increasingly we find ourselves \nand for which we must prepare will be murkier, harder to reconcile with \nthe traditional notions of warfare; they may be more limited in their \nobjectives, their scope, and their duration; and they likely will not \nconclude with a formal surrender ceremony on the deck of a battleship.\n  The challenge for all of us serving in Congress is this: How do we \nreconcile the changing nature of war with Congress's proper role in the \ndeclaration of war? It is not exactly a new question, but it is a \nprofound one, for unless we in Congress are prepared to cede our \nconstitutional authority over matters of war to the executive, we need \na more workable arrangement for consultation and decisionmaking between \nthe executive and legislative branches.\n  We have seen several manifestations of this challenge in recent \nyears. In 2011 President Obama committed U.S. military forces to combat \noperations in Libya to protect civilian populations from imminent \nslaughter by a brutal, anti-American tyrant. I, for one, believe he was \nright to do so. But 6 months later, when our armed services were still \ninvolved in kinetic actions in Libya--not just supporting our NATO \nallies but conducting air-to-ground operations and targeted strikes \nfrom armed, unmanned aerial vehicles--the administration claimed, as \nother administrations would, that it had no obligations to Congress \nunder the War Powers Resolution because our Armed Forces were not \ninvolved in combat operations. That struck many Members of Congress, \nincluding me, as fundamentally at odds with reality, and unfortunately \nit pushed more Members of Congress into opposition against the mission \nitself.\n  More recently, we saw the opposite problem manifested with regard to \nSyria. Perhaps due to the backlash in Congress that the \nadministration's handling of the Libya conflict engendered, President \nObama decided to seek congressional authorization for limited \nairstrikes against the Assad regime after it slaughtered more than \n1,400 of its own citizens with chemical weapons last August. An \noperation that likely would have lasted a few days and thus been fully \nconsistent with the President's authority under the existing War Powers \nResolution had he decided to act decisively and take limited military \naction instead devolved into a stinging legislative repudiation of \nexecutive action. The tragic result was that the Assad regime was \nspared any meaningful consequences for its use of a weapon of mass \ndestruction against innocent men, women, and children, and, as with \nLibya, the forces that want to turn America away from the world were \nnot checked but empowered.\n  Some of us may see the problem in these two instances as a failure of \nPresidential leadership, and I would agree, but I also believe the \nexamples of Libya and Syria represent the broader problem we as a \nnation face: What is the proper war power authority of the executive \nand legislative branches when it comes to limited conflicts, which are \nincreasingly the kinds of conflicts with which we are faced?\n  It is essential for the Congress and the President to work together \nto define a new war powers consultative agreement that reflects the \nnature of conflict in the 21st century and is in line with our \nConstitution. Our Nation does not have 535 commanders in chief. We have \none--the President--and that role as established by our Constitution\n\n[[Page S442]]\n\nmust be respected. Our Nation is poorly served when Members of Congress \ntry to micromanage the Commander in Chief in matters of war.\n  At the same time, now more than ever, we need to create a broader and \nmore durable national consensus on foreign policy and national \nsecurity, especially when it comes to matters of war and armed \nconflict. We need to find ways to make internationalist policies more \npolitically sustainable.\n  After the September 11 attack, we embarked on an expansive foreign \npolicy. Spending on defense and foreign assistance went up, and energy \nshifted to the executive. Now things are changing. Americans want to \npull back from the world. Our foreign assistance and defense budgets \nare declining. The desire to curb Presidential power across the board \nis growing, and the political momentum is shifting toward the Congress. \nAmerica has gone through this kind of political rebalancing before, and \nmuch of the time we have gotten it wrong. That is how we got \nisolationism and disarmament after World War I, that is how we got a \nhollow army after Vietnam, and that is how we weakened our national \nsecurity after the Cold War in the misplaced hope of cashing in on a \npeace dividend. We can't afford to repeat these mistakes.\n  A new war powers resolution--one that is recognized as both \nconstitutional and workable in practice--can be an important \ncontribution to this effort. It can more effectively invest in the \nCongress the critical decisions that impact our national security. It \ncan help build a more durable consensus in favor of the kinds of \npolicies we need to sustain our global leadership and protect our \nNation. In short, the legislation we are introducing today can restore \na better balance to the way national security decisionmaking should \nwork in a great democracy such as ours.\n  Let me say again. Neither the Senator from Virginia nor I believe the \nlegislation we are introducing today answers all of the monumental and \ndifficult questions surrounding the issue of war powers. We believe \nthis is a matter of transcendent importance to our Nation, and we as a \ndeliberative body of our government should debate this issue, and we \nlook forward to that debate. This legislation should be seen as a way \nof starting that discussion both here in the Congress and across our \nNation. We owe that to ourselves and our constituents. Most of all, we \nowe that to the brave men and women who serve our Nation in uniform and \nare called to risk their lives in harm's way for the sake of our \nNation's national defense.\n\n  Before I yield to my tardy colleague from Virginia, I wish to mention \nagain another reason why I think this legislation should be the \nbeginning of a serious debate which we should bring to some conclusion. \nThe fact is that no President of the United States has recognized the \nconstitutionality of the War Powers Act. That is a problem in itself. \nThat is a perversion, frankly, of the Constitution of the United States \nof America. That is one reason, but the most important reason is that I \nbelieve we are living in incredibly dangerous times. When we look \nacross the Middle East, when we look at Asia and the rise in the \ntensions in that part of the world and we look at the conflicts that \nare becoming regional--and whose fault they are is a subject for \nanother debate and discussion, but the fact is that we are in the path \nof some kind of conflict in which--whether the United States of America \nwants to or not--we may have to be involved in some ways.\n  We still have vital national security interests in the Middle East. \nIt is evolving into a chaotic situation, and one can look from the \nMediterranean all the way to the Strait of Hormuz, the Gulf of Aqaba, \nand throughout the region. So I believe the likelihood of us being \ninvolved in some way or another in some conflict is greater than it has \nbeen since the end of the Cold War, and I believe the American people \ndeserve legislation and a clear definition of the responsibilities of \nthe Congress of the United States and that of the President of the \nUnited States.\n  Again, I thank my colleague from Virginia, whose idea this is, who \ntook a great proposal that was developed at the University of Virginia \nand was kind enough to involve me in this effort. I thank him for it. I \nthank him for his very hard work on it, despite the fact that, as the \nChair will recognize, he was late for this discussion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Arizona for \npointing out to all in the Chamber my tardiness, and I should not have \nbeen tardy because I do not like to follow the Senator from Arizona. I \nwould rather begin before him. But I want to thank him for his work \nwith me, together, on this important issue and amplify on a few of the \ncomments he has made.\n  Today, together, as cosponsors we are introducing the War Powers \nConsultation Act of 2014, which would repeal the 1973 War Powers \nResolution and replace it. I could not have a better cosponsor than \nSenator McCain and appreciate all the work he and his staff have done \nover the last months with us.\n  I gave a floor speech about this issue in this Chamber in July of \n2013, almost to the day, 40 years after the Senate passed the War \nPowers Resolution of 1973. Many of you remember the context of that \npassage. When it was passed in the summer of 1973, it was in the midst \nof the end of the Vietnam war. President Nixon had expanded the Vietnam \nwar into Cambodia and Laos without explicit congressional approval, and \nthe Congress reacted very negatively and passed this act to try to \ncurtail executive powers in terms of the initiation of military \nhostilities.\n  It was a very controversial bill. When it was passed, President Nixon \nvetoed it. Congress overrode the veto at the end of 1973. But as \nSenator McCain indicated, no President has conceded the \nconstitutionality of the 1973 act, and most constitutional scholars who \nhave written about the question have found at least a few of what they \nbelieve would be fatal infirmities in that 1973 resolution.\n  It was a hyperpartisan time, maybe not unlike some aspects of the \npresent, and in trying to find that right balance in this critical \nquestion of when the Nation goes to war or initiates military action, \nCongress and the President did not reach an accord.\n  I came to the Senate with a number of passions and things I hoped to \ndo. But I think I came with only one obsession, and this is that \nobsession. Virginia is a State that is most connected to the military \nof any State in the country. Our map is a map of American military \nhistory--from Yorktown, where the Revolutionary War ended, to \nAppomattox, where the Civil War ended, to the Pentagon, where 9/11 \nhappened. That is who we are. One in nine Virginians is a veteran. If \nyou add our Active Duty, our Guard and Reserve, our military families, \nour DOD civilians, our DOD contractors, you are basically talking about \none in three Virginians. These issues of war and peace matter so deeply \nto us, as they do all Americans.\n  The particular passion I had in coming to this body around war powers \nwas because of kind of a disturbing thought, which is, if the President \nand Congress do not work together and find consensus in matters around \nwar, we might be asking our men and women to fight and potentially give \ntheir lives without a clear political consensus and agreement behind \nthe mission.\n  I do not think there is anything more important that the Senate and \nthe Congress can do than to be on board on decisions about whether we \ninitiate military action, because if we do not, we are asking young men \nand women to fight and potentially give their lives, with us not having \ndone the hard work of creating the political consensus to support them. \nThat is why I have worked hard to bring this to the attention of this \nbody with Senator McCain.\n  The Constitution actually sets up a fairly clear framework. The \nPresident is the Commander in Chief, not 535 commanders-in-chief, as \nSenator McCain indicated. But Congress is the body that has the power \nboth to declare war and then to fund military action. In dividing the \nresponsibilities in this way, the Framers were pretty clear. James \nMadison, who worked on the Constitution, especially the Bill of Rights, \nwrote a letter to Thomas Jefferson and said:\n\n       The constitution supposes, what the History of all \n     Governments demonstrates, that the Executive is the branch of \n     power most interested in war, and most prone to it. It\n\n[[Page S443]]\n\n     has accordingly with studied care vested the question of war \n     in the Legislature.\n\n  Despite that original constitutional understanding, our history has \nnot matched the notion that Congress would always be the initiator of \nmilitary action. Congress has only declared war five times in the \nhistory of the United States, while Presidents have initiated military \naction prior to any congressional approval more than 120 times.\n  In some of these instances where the President has initiated war, \nCongress has come back and either subsequently ratified Presidential \naction--sometimes by a formal approval or sometimes by informal \napproval such as budgetary allocation--but in other instances, \nincluding recently, Presidents have acted and committed American \nmilitary forces to military action without any congressional approval. \nThe Senator from Arizona mentioned the most recent one. President Obama \ncommitted military force to NATO, action against Libya in 2011, without \nany congressional approval, and he was formally censured by the House \nof Representatives for doing so.\n  The current context that requires a reanalysis of this thorny \nquestion, after 40 years of the War Powers Resolution, was well stated \nby the Senator from Arizona. Wars are different. They start \ndifferently. They are not necessarily nation state against nation \nstate. They could be limited in time or, as of now, we are still \npursuing a military force that was authorized on September 18, 2001, 12 \nor 13 years later. Wars are of different duration, different scope, \ndifferent geography. Nation states are no longer the only entities that \nare engaged in war.\n  These new developments that are challenging--what do we do about \ndrones in countries far afield from where battles were originally \nwaged--raise the issue of the need to go back into this War Powers \nResolution and update it for the current times.\n  As the Senator from Arizona mentioned, this has been a question that \nMembers of Congress have grappled with and thought about, as have \ndiplomats and scholars and administration officials and Members of \nCongress for some time.\n  In 2007, the Miller Center for the study of the presidency at the \nUniversity of Virginia convened a National War Powers Commission under \nthe chairmanships of two esteemable and bipartisan leaders--former \nSecretaries of State Warren Christopher and James Baker. The remaining \nmembers of the Commission were a complete A list of thinkers in this \narea--Slade Gorton, Abner Mikva, Ed Meese, Lee Hamilton. The \nCommission's historian was no less than Doris Kearns Goodwin, who \nlooked at the entire scope of this problem in American history and what \nthe role of Congress and the President should be.\n  The Commission issued a unanimous report, proposing an act to replace \nthe War Powers Act of 1973, briefed Congress and incoming President \nObama on the particular act in 2007 and 2008, but at that time, the \ntime was not yet ripe for consideration of this bill.\n  But now that we are 40 years into an unworkable War Powers Resolution \nand now, as the Senator indicated, we have had a string of Presidents--\nboth Democratic Presidents and Republican Presidents--who have \nmaintained that the act is unconstitutional and now that we have had a \n40-year history of Congress often exceeding to the claim of \nunconstitutionality by not following the War Powers Resolution itself, \nwe do think it is time to revisit.\n  Let me just state two fundamental, substantive issues that this bill \npresents in the War Powers Consultation Act of 2014.\n  First, there is a set of definitions. What is war? The bill defines \nsignificant military action as any action where involvement of U.S. \ntroops would be expected to be in combat for at least a week or longer. \nUnder those circumstances, the provisions of the act would be \ntriggered.\n  There are some exceptions in the act. The act would not cover defined \ncovert action operations. But once a combat operation was expected to \nlast for more than 7 days, the act would be triggered.\n  The act basically sets up two important substantive improvements on \nthe War Powers Resolution.\n  First, a permanent consultation committee is established in Congress, \nwith the majority and minority leaders of both Houses and the chairs \nand ranking members of the four key committees in both Houses that deal \nwith war issues--Intel, Armed Services, Foreign Relations, and \nAppropriations.\n  That permanent consultation committee is a venue for discussion \nbetween the executive and legislative branches--permanent and \ncontinuous--over matters in the world that may require the use of \nAmerican military force.\n  Because the question comes up often: What did the President do to \nconsult with Congress? Is it enough to call a few leaders or call a few \ncommittee chairs? This act would normalize and regularize what \nconsultation with Congress means by establishing a permanent \nconsultation committee and requiring ongoing dialogue between the \nExecutive and that committee.\n  The second requirement of this bill is that once military action is \ncommenced that would take more than 7 days, there is a requirement for \na vote in both Houses of Congress. The consultation committee itself \nwould put a resolution on the table in both Houses to approve or \ndisapprove of military action. It would be a privileged motion with \nexpedited requirements for debate, amendment, and vote, and that would \nensure that we do not reach a situation where action is being taken at \nthe instance of one branch with the other branch not in agreement, \nbecause to do that would put our men and women who are fighting and in \nharm's way at the risk of sacrificing their lives when we in the \npolitical leadership have not done the job of reaching a consensus \nbehind the mission.\n  To conclude, I will acknowledge what the Senator from Arizona said. \nThis is a very thorny and difficult question that has created \nchallenges and differences of interpretation since the Constitution was \nwritten in 1787. Despite the fact that the Framers who wrote the \nConstitution actually had a pretty clear idea about how it should \noperate, it has never operated that way.\n  Forty years of a failed War Powers Resolution in today's dangerous \nworld suggests that it is time now to get back in and to do some \ncareful deliberation to update and normalize the appropriate level of \nconsultation between a President and the legislature.\n  The recent events as cited by the Senator--whatever you think about \nthe merits or the equities, whether it is Libya, whether it is Syria, \nwhether it is the discussions we are having now with respect to Iran or \nany other of a number of potential spots around the world that could \nlead to conflict--suggest that while decisions about war and initiation \nof military action will never be easy, they get harder if we do not \nhave an agreed-upon process for coming to understand each other's \npoints of view and then acting in the best interest of the Nation to \nforge a consensus.\n  With that, I appreciate the opportunity to stand with my colleague, \nafter a number of months of discussion, to introduce this bill, and I \nlook forward to the opportunity to carry this dialogue forward with my \ncolleagues in this body.\n  Thank you very much.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Coons):\n  S. 1945. A bill to amend the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to revise the \ncriteria for determining which States and political subdivisions are \nsubject to section 4 of the Act, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, almost five decades ago, President Lyndon \nJohnson signed the original Voting Rights Act into law. At the signing, \nhe spoke eloquently about the central purpose of the law. He said:\n\n       This act flows from a clear and simple wrong. Its only \n     purpose is to right that wrong. Millions of Americans are \n     denied the right to vote because of their color. This law \n     will ensure them the right to vote. The wrong is one which no \n     American, in his heart, can justify. The right is one which \n     no American, true to our principles, can deny.\n\n  A lot has changed since 1965 and much progress has been made, but 7 \nyears ago the Senate and House examined whether racial discrimination \nin voting was still a problem that required a Federal solution. After a \nlong series of hearings in both Chambers and based upon a mountain of \nevidence,\n\n[[Page S444]]\n\nDemocrats and Republicans came together to conclude that racial \ndiscrimination in voting is still a problem and the protections that \nvoters have had under the Voting Rights Act were still needed. Yet, \nlast summer, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision that struck at \nthe heart of the Voting Rights Act when it held that the coverage \nprovision of section 5 was unconstitutional because it was not \nsufficiently based on current conditions. In doing so, the Court made \nclear that Congress could update the law to reinstitute the protections \nof section 5 coverage if it were based on more recent conduct.\n  Today, I am pleased to announce that we are responding to the Court's \ndecision by introducing a bill that helps reinvigorate the most vital \nprotections of the act. Through months of cooperation, negotiation, and \ncompromise, Congressmen Sensenbrenner and Conyers and I have agreed on \na bipartisan and bicameral proposal to restore the protections of the \nVoting Rights Act that were weakened by the Supreme Court's decision \nlast summer. Our sole focus throughout this entire process was to \nensure that no American would be denied their constitutional right to \nvote because of discrimination on the basis of race or color. We \nbelieve that this is a strong bipartisan bill that accomplishes this \ngoal and that every Member of Congress can support.\n  Under our bipartisan bill, all States and jurisdictions are eligible \nfor section 5 protections under a new coverage formula, which is based \non repeated voting rights violations in the last 15 years. This \ncoverage provision is based solely on a State's or local jurisdiction's \nrecent voting rights record. Significantly, the 15-year period \n``rolls'' or continuously moves to keep up with ``current conditions,'' \nas the Supreme Court stated should be a basis for any coverage \nprovision. If a State that is covered establishes a clean record moving \nforward, it will fall out of coverage. In addition, the existing \nbailout provision would still be available for States or jurisdictions \nthat can establish that they had a clean record in a 10-year span. \nThese provisions ensure that the coverage provision is not over-\ninclusive because jurisdictions that have not repeatedly violated the \nvoting rights of its constituents can come out from under preclearance \nrequirements.\n  Our bill would also improve the Voting Rights Act to allow our \nFederal courts to bail-in the worst actors for preclearance. Current \nlaw permits States or jurisdictions to be bailed in only for \nintentional voting rights violations, but to ensure that the worst \ndiscrimination in voting is captured, the bill would amend the act to \nallow States or jurisdictions to be bailed in for results-based \nviolations, where the effect of a particular voting measure is to deny \nan individual his or her right to vote.\n  In recognition that voters need to be aware of changes in laws \naffecting their right to vote, the bill provides for greater \ntransparency in elections. Sunlight is a great disinfectant, as Justice \nBrandeis once observed, and in this instance, the additional sunlight \nwill protect voters from discrimination. The transparency provisions \nprovide for public notice and information in three areas. The first \npart requires public notice of late breaking changes in Federal \nelections. The second part requires information on polling place \nresource allocation for Federal elections. The third part requires \ninformation on changes to electoral districts, including demographic \ninformation, to prevent racial gerrymandering, impermissible \nredistricting, and infringement on minority voters. The last part \nrequires this information for Federal, State, and local elections \nbecause the most impermissible conduct oftentimes occurs in State and \nlocal elections.\n  Finally, our bill revises the preliminary injunction standard for \nvoting rights actions. The principle behind this part of the proposal \nis the recognition that when voting rights are at stake, obtaining \nrelief after the election has already concluded is too late to \nvindicate the individuals' voting rights. We recognize that there will \nbe cases where there is a special need for immediate, preliminary \nrelief where the plaintiff can establish that the voting measure is \nlikely to be discriminatory.\n  This proposal is a bipartisan effort to provide a narrow fix to \naddress the Supreme Court's Shelby County decision to ensure that all \nAmericans are protected from racial discrimination in voting. I am \nconfident and hopeful that the Congress can work together as a body--\nnot as Democrats or Republicans but as Americans--to ensure that we \nroot out all voter discrimination with a strong and reinvigorated \nVoting Rights Act.\n  I am confident we can do this because protecting voting rights has \nalways been a bipartisan effort. In 1965 President Johnson signed the \nVoting Rights Act into law. That law was passed with overwhelming \nbipartisan support in Congress. In the Senate the vote was 79 to 18. In \nthe House the vote was 328 to 74. In the four times since it was \nreauthorized, the support for the law has only increased. In fact, when \nPresident George W. Bush signed the most recent reauthorization in \n2006, the vote in the Senate was 98 to 0 and the vote in the House was \n390 to 33. Too often there is gridlock in Congress, but when it comes \nto the Voting Rights Act, there is almost unanimous agreement on the \nprinciple that no American should be denied his or her right to vote or \nto participate in our democracy.\n  My hope is that we can continue this legacy of bipartisanship on the \nissue of voting rights. As we prepare to celebrate Martin Luther King, \nJr. Day on Monday, we should remember the words of Dr. King, who, in a \npowerful speech about the right to vote, said:\n\n       So long as I do not firmly and irrevocably possess the \n     right to vote I do not possess myself. I cannot make up my \n     mind--it is made up for me. I cannot live as a democratic \n     citizen, observing the laws I have helped to enact--I can \n     only submit to the edict of others. So our most urgent \n     request to the president of the United States and every \n     member of Congress is to give us the right to vote.\n\n  I believe that the bipartisan bill we are introducing today honors \nthe spirit of those words. I thank Senators Durbin and Coons for \nworking with me and I look forward to working with all Senators on this \nimportant legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. Schatz, and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 1946. A bill to amend the Reclamation Safety of Dams Act of 1978 \nto modify the authorization of appropriations; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce a bill to protect \nvaluable water resource infrastructure across the West. I am pleased to \nbe joined by Senators Schatz and Feinstein who share my concern for dam \nsafety. The Bureau of Reclamation's Dam Safety Program is not a new \nprogram, but it is vital for farmers, local economies, and communities \nin 17 Western States. Because the Safety of Dams, SOD Program is \nrunning out of money, it is essential that Congress extend the program \nand allow projects to proceed by permanently authorizing the funding \nneeded.\n  The SOD Program has a straightforward mission: ``to ensure that \nReclamation facilities do not present unreasonable risks to the public, \npublic safety, property, and/or the environment.'' The challenge of \nmeeting that mission is complicated by the strains of aging \ninfrastructure and population growth within dam failure zones. \nReclamation manages 476 dams and dikes, 370 of which are listed within \nthe high or significant hazard class, meaning failure of the dam or \ndike would cause life loss or significant damages. Once Reclamation \nbegins risk modifications to a dam, the local partners share 15 percent \nof the associated costs. Since the creation of the SOD Program, \nCongress has seen fit to raise the program's authorized ceiling four \ntimes--in 1984, 2000, and 2002. Twelve years later, it is time to keep \nthis program going once more before we hit the ceiling.\n  My bill would do away with the authorization ceiling and permanently \nauthorize this important program. No longer would the ceiling be a \nhindrance on advancing dam safety. A project in my home State helps to \nillustrate the problem. Scoggins Dam is located in Washington County, \nOR. The dam forms the heart of the water system in the Tualatin Basin, \nproviding drinking water to residents, irrigation for valuable \ncroplands, and support for nearly a quarter million jobs. The risk to \nScoggins Dam comes from its position within the Cascade subduction \nzone, where a typical earthquake has a magnitude of 8.7 to 9.2. As the \nfirst U.S. Senator to visit Fukushima after its\n\n[[Page S445]]\n\ndevastating subduction zone earthquake and resulting tsunami, I saw \nfirsthand the incredible damage a seismic event can have on a region \nand its infrastructure.\n  The Bureau of Reclamation is already well into the process of risk \nassessment on Scoggins Dam, and the current SOD Program ceiling poses a \nsignificant obstacle to advancing the project to concrete risk-\nmitigation actions. Reclamation has evaluated Scoggins Dam and \npredicted that an earthquake could cause spill wall failure and \npotential embankment failure due to deformation, overtopping, or \nerosion through cracks. Reclamation completed the correction action \nstudy for Scoggins in late 2012; however, no modifications can proceed \nuntil there is room in the SOD Program budget. The uncertainty around \nfixing this Federal facility is taking a toll on economic development \nat a time when pivotal Oregon companies like Intel and Nike are \nundertaking expansions in Washington County. Scoggins Dam joins a list \nof other dam projects on the near horizon that won't be able to proceed \nwithout this bill.\n  Ensuring that dams continue to provide the benefits they do across \nthe West in a safe manner is an important responsibility. I want to \nexpress my thanks to the Tualatin Basin Water Supply Partners for their \ndiligent work to see that safety modifications are made for the \npublic's benefit and to meet the region's long-run water needs. I look \nforward to working with Senator Schatz, Senator Feinstein, and other \ncolleagues and the bill's other supporters to continue the work of the \nSOD Program.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANDERS:\n  S. 1950. A bill to improve the provision of medical services and \nbenefits to veterans, and for other purposes; read the first time.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, today as the chairman of the committee I \nhave introduced the most comprehensive piece of veterans legislation \nthat we have seen in a very long time. The Comprehensive Veterans \nHealth and Benefit and Military Retirement Pay Restoration Act of 2014 \ndelivers on the promises that we have made to our servicemembers and I \nbelieve will have the support of Members of the Senate and of the \nHouse. It addresses virtually every single issue the veterans community \nhas been concerned about.\n  What we have done now is taken two omnibus bills and wrapped them \ninto this legislation. In addition, we have taken other pieces of \nlegislation passed by the committee, and we have added to that based on \nsome recent developments.\n  This legislation is the product of a year of bipartisan work and \nincludes provisions important to almost every single veterans service \norganization and dozens of Members of the Senate, Republican, Democrat, \nand Independent, many of which were reported out of the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee with strong bipartisan support.\n  This legislation completely eliminates the cuts that were made to the \nmilitary retiree cost-of-living adjustments. I know there was great \nconcern here in the Senate from Democrats and Republicans about that \ncut, as well as in the House of Representatives. I am happy to say this \nlegislation completely eliminates the cuts that were made to the \nmilitary retiree cost-of-living adjustments.\n  As we all know, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 that was passed a \nfew days ago would lower cost-of-living adjustments for military \nretirees by reducing the annual adjustment by 1 percent until age 62. \nThe American people have spoken very loudly and very clearly. They have \ntold the Congress to restore those cuts to military retirees and we \nhave listened. I applaud the House and the Senate for restoring these \ncuts for disabled military retirees and survivors in the appropriations \nact we passed today. Today we took care of part of the problem. But we \nhave to do more. What the comprehensive veterans bill I have introduced \ntoday does is restore the full COLA to all military retirees, every \nsingle retiree. This bill restores these COLAs and does much more.\n  I wish to take a moment to highlight some of the key provisions of \nthis comprehensive piece of legislation. Let me say, this legislation \nis based on listening very carefully to what the veterans organizations \nhave told us in private meetings, in hearings, and at some of the very \nlarge hearings we have held with the American Legion, the VFW, the DAV, \nand many other service organizations. Let me briefly touch on some of \nthe provisions we are addressing, some of the concerns we are \naddressing in this comprehensive veterans legislation which, I should \nadd, is fully paid for. It is fully paid for.\n  In the first omnibus bill that we passed, S. 944, the Veterans Health \nand Benefits Improvement Act of 2013, we dealt with in-State tuition \nassistance for post-9/11 veterans, an issue of great concern to young \nveterans and to all of the veterans organizations. This package \nincludes provisions the committee's ranking member Senator Burr and I \nworked together on, that would help servicemembers transition back into \ncivilian life by making recently separated veterans eligible for \ntuition at the in-State rate.\n  Given the nature of our Armed Forces, servicemembers have little to \nno say as to where they reside during military service. Therefore, many \nof these servicemembers have not had sufficient time to establish \nresidency by the time they go back to school. This legislation would \nhelp the transition of our brave men and women who have sacrificed so \nmuch in defense of our country by giving them a fair shot at attaining \neducational goals without incurring an additional financial burden. We \naddress that issue in this legislation.\n  Clearly one of the issues that has been an embarrassment to all of us \nis the degree of sexual assault we have seen in the military. What this \nlegislation does is address that issue as well. While the Pentagon, \nCongress, and other stakeholders continue to work to end sexual assault \nwithin the military, something we have to focus on, we must nonetheless \ndo everything we can to ensure that the VA is a welcoming place for \nthose who have survived sexual assault. That is why this legislation \nincludes important provisions that would improve the delivery of care \nand benefits to individuals who experience sexual trauma by serving in \nthe military. These provisions were inspired by Ruth Moore, a veteran \nwho struggled for 23 years to receive VA disability compensation.\n  It would expand access to VA counseling and care to active-duty \nservicemembers and members of the Guard and Reserve who experienced \nsexual assault during inactive-duty training. It also takes a number of \nsteps to improve the adjudication of disability compensation claims \nbased on military sexual trauma.\n  This legislation will give the VA additional tools to provide victims \nof sexual trauma with the care and benefits they need to confront the \nemotional and physical consequences of these horrific acts. Sexual \nassault in the military is unacceptable and this committee is, in a \nsignificant way, addressing that issue.\n  One of the concerns we have heard from many veterans and veterans \norganizations is the issue of overmedication. Many of our veterans come \nback and receive in some cases 5, 10 different types of pills to \naddress some of the very serious problems they have. What this bill \ndoes is expand, among many other things, access to complementary and \nalternative medicine. The VA already does a good job in that area. This \nwould expand their capability to provide complementary and alternative \nmedicine.\n  Maintaining the VA's world-class health care system remains a \npriority for our committee. I am pleased we were able to respond to \ncalls from veterans to increase access to complementary and alternative \nmedicine for the treatment of chronic pain, mental health conditions, \nand chronic disease. By expanding access to these treatment options--\noptions such as acupuncture, meditation, massage therapy, and many \nothers--we can enhance the likelihood veterans get the care they need \nin the way that works for them. These treatments are becoming more and \nmore popular. More and more veterans want access to them and that is \nwhat we do in this legislation.\n  Additionally, this legislation calls for the VA to promote healthy \nweight in veterans by increasing their access to fitness facilities as \na healthy weight is critical to combating multiple chronic diseases, \nincluding diabetes and heart disease. In other words, the\n\n[[Page S446]]\n\nmost cost-effective and best way to treat disease is to prevent that \ndisease by making sure our veterans have the opportunity to keep \nhealthy. This legislation does that as well.\n  This legislation further honors as veterans certain persons who \nperformed service in the Reserve components of the Armed Forces. I know \nhow important this provision is for all those who wore this Nation's \nuniforms as members of the Reserves. I am pleased we will finally honor \ntheir service with passage of this legislation.\n  This legislation also expands benefits for surviving spouses, for the \nspouses of those who gave their lives to defend this country. I want to \nmake special note of provisions that will be included in this package \nthat would also strengthen the benefits and services provided to \nsurviving family members by addressing a number of concerns brought to \nthe attention of this committee by the Gold Star Wives in testimony \nlast year.\n  Obviously the Gold Star Wives are the spouses of those soldiers who \ndied in combat. Specifically, this bill would provide additional \ndependency and indemnity compensation for surviving spouses with \nchildren in order to provide financial support in the difficult period \nfollowing the loss of a loved one. This bill would also expand the \nMarine Gunnery Sergeant John David Fry Scholarship to include surviving \nspouses of members of the Armed Forces who died in the line of duty. \nThat means surviving spouses would become eligible for post-9/11 GI \nbill benefits, setting them and their families up for success in the \nyears to follow.\n  One of the issues that has occupied a great deal of time and energy \non the committee deals with claim processing. We all know that for the \nlast number of years the VA has had a very significant backlog. That is \nclearly not acceptable. When a veteran brings forth a claim, that claim \nshould be processed in a reasonable period of time with a reasonable \ndegree of accuracy. We are all too well familiar with the challenges of \nthe claims backlog. I am very pleased to see that the VA is making \nsignificant progress on this complex issue. They are going from paper \nto digital. That is a huge process. As a result, the backlog is \ndeclining. That is good news, but we have to do more.\n  This legislation would support VA's ongoing efforts and would make \nneeded improvements to the claims system. Among a number of claims-\nrelated provisions, this bill for the first time would require the \nDepartment to publicly report on both claims processing goals and \nactual production. This would allow Congress and the public to closely \ntrack and measure VA's progress on this difficult issue. The Secretary \nof the VA Eric Shinseki has proposed a very ambitious goal for the end \nof 2015. We want to make sure they are on track.\n  That is some of the provisions included in the first bill. Let me \ntalk a little about bit about the second omnibus bill. Both of those \nbills passed unanimously out of committee. The Comprehensive Veterans \nHealth and Benefits and Military Retirement Pay Restoration Act of 2014 \nincludes provisions from S. 1581, a second omnibus bill that moved out \nof the committee with unanimous support at the November markup. Here \nare some of the provisions in that omnibus.\n  The improvement and expansion of dental care. I don't know about New \nMexico, but I can tell you that in Vermont, and in fact in many parts \nof this country, inability to access affordable dental care is a major \ncrisis. It is true for the general public and it is true for veterans \nas well. The truth is, right now the VA, with the exception of service-\nconnected oral problems, does not provide dental care to our veterans. \nI think that is a very significant omission.\n  What this legislation does is, starting off with a large-scale pilot \nproject, begin the effort to make sure dental care becomes part of VA \nhealth care. This is something that I think the veterans throughout \nthis country will be very excited to learn about and to participate in.\n  Those are some of the provisions that were in the two omnibus bills, \nand they passed unanimously.\n  Let me talk about some other legislation that came out of the \ncommittee, in some cases with bipartisan support, but not unanimously. \nThe first one deals with advanced appropriations for the VA; that is, \nS. 932, the Putting Veterans Funding First Act of 2013. That was \nintroduced, as I recall, by Senators Begich and Boozman in a bipartisan \nway. Here is the story, which is very important: As we saw last year, \nin the event of a prolonged government shutdown, the Veterans' \nAdministration would not have been able to issue disability \ncompensation or pension payments or provide educational benefit to \nmillions of deserving veterans.\n\n  The truth is that during that shutdown, we were perhaps a week or 10 \ndays away from disabled veterans, and others, not getting the benefits \nso many of them depend upon. It is what they depend upon to buy \ngroceries, it is what they depend upon to pay a mortgage, and to make \ntheir car payments. We were a week or 10 days away from those veterans \nnot getting those benefits.\n  I am happy to say that in this legislation we have addressed that \nissue, and we have moved forward with advanced appropriations for \nmandatory accounts at the VA.\n  Our economy is making slow progress. We are creating jobs, but nobody \nbelieves we are anywhere near where we want to be. Real unemployment in \nthis country is close to 13 percent. In my view, we owe a great deal to \nour veterans who have left their families, their jobs, gone abroad, and \nthen when they come back, they are unable to find employment. What our \nlegislation does is put into this comprehensive bill the Renew Our VOW \nto Hire Heroes, S. 6, the Putting Veterans Back to Work Act of 2013. \nThis legislation would reauthorize provisions from the VOW to Hire \nHeroes Act, including a 2-year extension to the Veterans Training \nAssistance Program which retrains unemployed veterans for high-demand \noccupations. There are other employment provisions in this legislation \nas well.\n  Several years ago, under the leadership of our colleague Patty \nMurray, who was my predecessor as chair of the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee, we proudly passed the Caregivers Act. The Caregivers Act was \na very important piece of legislation which said to families who were \ntaking care of disabled veterans: We understand what you are doing is \nvery difficult, and we are going to give you some assistance.\n  The legislation we had passed dealt with post-9/11 veterans and their \nfamilies. After listening to the concerns of pre-9/11 veterans and \ntheir family members, I introduced S. 851, the Caregivers Expansion and \nImprovement Act of 2013 to extend eligibility for the caregivers \nprograms to veterans' families of all eras. So we took this program, \nwhich was working well, and we said we are going to pay attention to \nthe needs of all families who are taking care of men and women who put \ntheir lives on the line to defend us and have become disabled, and that \nis in this legislation as well.\n  Also in this legislation is language which will extend eligibility to \nenroll in VA health care, and that is S. 1604. We all know that early \ndiagnosis of health care conditions is critically important. Under the \ncurrent law, recently separated veterans have 5 years of free health \ncare from the VA. This legislation would extend the period of time for \nthese individuals, including members of the active component, the \nNational Guard, and Reserves. They will be eligible to enroll in the VA \nhealth care system for 10 years post deployment. We go from 5 years to \n10 years.\n  This benefit has been incredibly helpful to our most recent \ngeneration of servicemembers, and extending the enrollment period will \nallow more individuals to take advantage of VA's high-quality, cost-\neffective health care system, including important access to mental \nhealth care services.\n  Additionally, this legislation simplifies the process for determining \neligibility for enrollment in VA health care for lower income veterans. \nCurrently VA uses an extremely complex calculation of geographic income \nthresholds that vary from county to county. You can have one veteran in \none county in Vermont, another person living a mile away, and one is \neligible for VA health care because of his or her income, but another \nperson with the same income is not eligible. My legislation establishes \none income threshold per State, simplifies the process, and\n\n[[Page S447]]\n\nwill enable more veterans to be eligible for VA health care.\n  This legislation also includes S. 131, the Women Veterans and Other \nHealth Care Improvements Act of 2013. With the widespread use of \nimprovised explosive devices throughout Iraq and Afghanistan, both \nfemale and male servicemembers have found themselves with increased \nrisk of spinal cord, reproductive, and urinary tract injury. Many of \nthese veterans dreamed of starting a family, but their injuries \nprevented them from conceiving, and this legislation will help them \nfulfill their dreams.\n  We have three more important provisions I want to briefly touch upon, \nand that is, once again, the restoration of full COLA for all military \nretirees. In an effort to address concerns regarding the cost-of-living \nadjustments for all military retirees, this bill would reaffirm the \ncommitment Congress made to our servicemembers and veterans by ensuring \nconsistent and appropriate funding for military retirees and veterans. \nThis very important provision is in this legislation.\n  Furthermore, there has been a concern that many CBOCs, community-\nbased outreach clinics, that have been planned all over this country \nhave been unable to be built for a variety of technical reasons. We \naddressed that issue as well. This bill also improves access to mental \nhealth treatment for veterans.\n  Let me conclude by saying we give a lot of speeches about the respect \nwe have for the men and women who put their lives on the line to defend \nthis country. They have come forward through the veterans committee and \nthey have said: We have concerns. We have concerns about health care; \nwe have concerns about how quickly the benefits that we apply for come \nto us. They have been very loud and clear in saying--and we agree with \nthem--that it is unacceptable that pensions promised to veterans have \nbeen cut. There have been many other issues dealing with employment and \ndealing with education.\n  What this bill does in a comprehensive way is to say to the veterans \nof this country--the millions and millions of people who have given so \nmuch to us--we hear your concerns. We hear your concerns, and we are \ngoing to address your concerns.\n  I want to take this moment to thank majority leader Senator Reid. He \nhas been very supportive of not only veterans in general but supportive \nof this effort to make sure we keep our promises to the veterans of \nthis country. That bill has been introduced. My hope is we can get it \nto the floor as soon as possible.\n  I hope very much that although there is a partisan climate, that on \nthis issue of keeping our promises to the men and women who have put \ntheir lives on the line to defend this country, we can come together as \na Senate and as a House and have the President sign this bill which \nwill mean so much to so many.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I want to start by thanking Chairman \nSanders of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, where I serve, for his \nextraordinary vision and leadership and join him in thanking the \nmajority leader for his commitment to this kind of comprehensive and \naggressive approach to revise and reinvigorate, reinvent and reform, \nveterans programs in a comprehensive and overarching approach.\n  I will be speaking at greater length in the days and weeks to come, \nbut I want to join the Senator in committing all of us--I hope on a \nbipartisan basis--to this effort to fix the flaws and fulfill the \nvision this Nation owes to the men and women who have served and \nsacrificed year after year.\n  This program recognizes a fundamental truth: We are dealing with \ndifferent populations of different ages, and within those populations, \npeople with different needs and challenges, and a comprehensive program \nis necessary to address the obligation. It is an obligation we owe them \nto make sure that we leave no veteran behind and keep faith with every \nman and woman who has served and sacrificed for this Nation.\n  It fixes the flaws of the last budget agreement that reduced the \ncost-of-living adjustment on retirees' pensions. It commits the Nation \nto economic opportunity and real jobs--training for the jobs that exist \nnow and the jobs of the future. It reforms loan and aid programs for \ncollege education and also for noncollege education.\n  It addresses the gaps in health care, not just by promising but \nperforming. And, of course, it will also necessarily help veterans who \nmay be preyed upon by schemes and scams, legal or illegal, and that is \na very desperate and challenging need for this Nation to address, and \nhopefully it will do so on a bipartisan basis.\n  There should be no reason and no justification for opposing an effort \nthat is paid for--and I stress paid for. My hope is we will have \nbipartisan support for this visionary and courageous measure that says \nto America's veterans: We will keep faith with you. We will leave no \nveteran behind.\n  One of the first promises I made 3 years ago in the first speech I \ngave on the floor of this Chamber was I would work and fight \naggressively for the veterans of this Nation. I intend to work for this \nprogram--work to improve it--and continue to listen to the Veterans of \nForeign Wars, the Vietnam Veterans of America, the American Legion, and \nall of the groups that represent our veterans so ably, and speak for \nthem. The voices and faces of Connecticut's veterans have been with me \nalways, and I see them always when I return. I will work tirelessly for \nthis program.\n  Again, my thanks to all of the members of the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee who will be supporting this program, and to our chairman \nSenator Sanders for his great leadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/16/senate-section/article/S447-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Moran, Mr. Scott, \n        Mr. Hoeven, Mr. Portman, Mr. Thune, Mr. Paul, Mr. Hatch, Mr. \n        Inhofe, Mr. Blunt, Mr. Barrasso, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Roberts, Mr. \n        Sessions, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Flake, Mr. Rubio, Mr. Johanns, Mr. \n        Boozman, Mrs. Fischer, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Johnson, \n        of Wisconsin, Mr. Risch, Mr. Burr, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Chambliss, \n        Mr. Coburn, Mr. Grassley, Mr. McCain, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Crapo, \n        Mr. Lee, Mr. Coats, Mr. Toomey, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Cruz, Mr. \n        Kirk, Mr. Wicker, Mr. Corker, and Mr. Graham):\n  S.J.

The educational efforts of the Church, \n     therefore, must be directed to forming persons-in-community; \n     for the education of the individual Christian is important \n     not only to his solitary destiny, but also the destinies of \n     the many communities in which he lives.'': Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the goals of Catholic Schools Week, an event \n     cosponsored by the National Catholic Educational Association \n     and the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops that \n     recognizes the vital contributions of thousands of Catholic \n     elementary and secondary schools in the United States; and\n       (2) commends Catholic schools, students, parents, and \n     teachers across the United States for ongoing contributions \n     to education and for playing a vital role in promoting and \n     ensuring a brighter, stronger future for the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/16/senate-section/article/S448-2", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S448-S449]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 335--DESIGNATING JANUARY 2014 AS ``NATIONAL MENTORING \n                                MONTH''\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself, Mr. Isakson, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Schumer, \nMrs. Feinstein, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Carper, Ms. Baldwin, Mr. Brown, Mr. \nWyden, Mr. Scott, Ms. Warren, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Cochran, \nand Mr. Rubio) submitted the following resolution; which was considered \nand agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 335\n\n       Whereas the goals of National Mentoring Month are to raise \n     awareness of mentoring, recruit individuals to volunteer as \n     mentors, and encourage organizations to engage and integrate \n     quality mentoring into their efforts;\n       Whereas mentoring is a longstanding tradition in which a \n     dependable, caring adult provides guidance, support, and \n     encouragement to facilitate the social, emotional, and \n     cognitive development of a young person;\n       Whereas a mentor is a caring, consistent presence who \n     devotes time to a young person to help that young person \n     discover personal strength and achieve their potential \n     through a structured and trusting relationship;\n       Whereas research on mentoring shows that formal, high-\n     quality mentoring programs focused on developing the \n     competence and character of mentees promote positive \n     outcomes, such as improved academic achievement, self-esteem, \n     social skills, and career development;\n       Whereas research shows that young people who are matched \n     with a caring adult through a quality mentoring program are \n     46 percent less likely to use illegal drugs, 27 percent less \n     likely to start drinking, 52 percent less likely to skip \n     school, 37 percent less likely to skip class, and are more \n     trusting of their parents or guardians;\n       Whereas more than 5,000 mentoring programs in communities \n     of all sizes across the United States focus on building \n     strong, effective relationships between mentors and mentees;\n       Whereas approximately 3,000,000 young people in the United \n     States are in formal mentoring relationships due to the \n     remarkable vigor, creativity, and resourcefulness of the \n     thousands of mentoring programs in communities throughout the \n     United States;\n       Whereas in spite of the progress made to increase \n     mentoring, the United States has a serious ``mentoring gap'', \n     with nearly 15,000,000 young people in need of mentors;\n       Whereas, in 2012, 399,546 children were in foster care in \n     the United States, many of whom were without a mentor and \n     26,000 of whom ``aged out'' of foster care by reaching \n     adulthood without being placed in a permanent home;\n       Whereas mentor programs that serve foster children are \n     unique and require additional considerations, including \n     specialized training and support necessary to provide for \n     consistent, meaningful, and long-term relationships for \n     children in foster care;\n       Whereas mentoring is a proven cost-effective investment;\n       Whereas for every dollar invested in mentoring, there is a \n     3 dollar return to society;\n       Whereas mentoring partnerships between the public and \n     private sectors bring State and local leaders together to \n     support mentoring programs by preventing duplication of \n     efforts, offering training in industry best practices, and \n     making the most of limited resources to benefit young people \n     in the United States;\n       Whereas the designation of January 2014 as ``National \n     Mentoring Month'' will call attention to the critical role \n     mentors play in helping young people realize their potential; \n     and\n       Whereas a month-long celebration of mentoring will \n     encourage more individuals and organizations, including \n     schools, businesses, nonprofit organizations, faith \n     institutions, and foundations, to become engaged in mentoring \n     and close the mentoring gap in the United States: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the month of January 2014 as ``National \n     Mentoring Month'';\n       (2) recognizes with gratitude the contributions of the \n     millions of caring adults and students who are already \n     serving as mentors and encourages more adults and students to \n     volunteer as mentors;\n       (3) supports the goals of mentoring to increase educational \n     achievement, reduce juvenile delinquency, and improve life \n     outcomes for mentees; and\n       (4) promotes the creation and expansion of quality \n     mentoring programs across the country to equip more young \n     people with the\n\n[[Page S449]]\n\n     tools needed to lead healthy and productive lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/16/senate-section/article/S449-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S449]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 336--DESIGNATING THE FIRST WEEK OF APRIL 2014 AS \n                  ``NATIONAL ASBESTOS AWARENESS WEEK''\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Isakson, Mrs. \nMurray, Mr. Reid, and Mr. Tester) submitted the following resolution;

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 335.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 335) designating January 2014 as \n     ``National Mentoring Month.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I wish to speak for just a minute in \nhonor of National Mentoring Month. Senator Isakson and I have submitted \na Senate resolution to pay tribute to the millions of men and women \nwhose lives are enriched every day by mentoring in our country. I know \nwe are going to get right back on the discussion on the Appropriations \nbill, but I want to take just a point of personal privilege for 2 or 3 \nminutes to talk about the fact that this is the 13th anniversary of \nNational Mentoring Month, and today is Thank Your Mentor Day. With \nheartfelt gratitude, I would like to thank all of the mentors who serve \nin communities across Louisiana and all those who serve across the \nnation.\n  I wish to acknowledge and I am very grateful to the following \nSenators: Senator Baldwin, Senator Brown, Senator Carper, Senator \nCochran, Senator Durbin, Senator Gillibrand, Senator Klobuchar, Senator \nMikulski, Senator Murray, Senator Rubio, Senator Schumer, Senator \nScott, Senator Warren, and Senator Wyden, who cosponsored our mentor \nresolution and have been real leaders in the mentorship movement.\n  In situations in which a young person is missing a caring, consistent \npresence, there is one simple intervention that can make all the \ndifference: a good mentor. Research shows that mentoring improves \nacademic achievement, self-esteem, social skills, and career \ndevelopment in children.\n  The U.S. has strong mentoring programs, but more are needed. More \nthan 4.5 million young people in the U.S. are in formal mentoring \nrelationships; however, there are a growing number of young people who \nneed mentors but do not have them. More than one in three young people, \nabout 16 million Americans, are in need of a mentor. More than half of \nthose who are without a mentor are at-risk youth. There is a particular \nneed for an increase in mentors for foster youth who perhaps more than \nanyone else could benefit from a steady, dependable mentor. Because \nfoster youth tend to move from home to home and school to school, they \noften lack the consistent academic guidance and emotional support they \nneed to succeed. We need more caring mentors for these at-risk youth.\n  We can all identify hundreds of young people or people of all \ndifferent ages who are stepping up and doing an act of support and \nmentoring for a young person and who is making a real difference in \ntheir lives.\n  I wish to just point out four in Louisiana today.\n  One, as shown in this picture, is Lorita. She is serving 20 hours a \nweek as a foster grandparent, working with special needs children at \nthe James Ward Elementary School in Lake Charles, LA.\n  With Lorita's loving guidance, her student mentee went from a 47-\npercent skill mastery in math to 80 percent. That is a pretty \nsignificant jump. That is a life-changing improvement for that child \nand opens a real opportunity for future mentorship work.\n  One of my favorite mentor programs is the National Guard Youth \nChalleNGe Program, which started in Louisiana in 1993. The program \nopens its doors to young people between the ages of 16 and 18 who have \ndropped out of school, in many instances have dropped out of their \nfamilies. Their families have given up on them and they have given up \non their families and in many instances they are headed nowhere but to \neither prison or to a homeless shelter or worse.\n  Our National Guard steps up and helps; doing all the amazing things \nour National Guard does here at home in\n\n[[Page S458]]\n\npeacetime and in war, they have also mentored over 15,000 young people \nin Louisiana in the last 20 years. We graduate from our three programs \nin Louisiana about 1,400 kids a year, each one with a mentor.\n  So I wish to give a shout out to the National Guard and the National \nGuard Youth ChalleNGe Program.\n  Of course, a program we all support on both sides of the aisle is Big \nBrothers Big Sisters. There are three Big Brothers Big Sisters \nagencies, serving 871 at-risk youth in the State of Louisiana.\n  These are youth who include children of single parent families, those \nwith a parent who currently may be incarcerated or children who have \nbeen involved in the juvenile justice system. We have a wonderful Big \nBrother Big Sister mentor here. Urmie is an outstanding Big Sister \nserving in Jennings, LA, who proudly says her most rewarding aspect of \nserving as a mentor is: Knowing I am making a difference in a young \nperson's life.\n  Finally, our Big Buddy Program. Big Buddy is a leading community \nprogram in Baton Rouge, LA. It is national as well, supported broadly \nby Members of Congress and local officials. We in our program serve 700 \ndisadvantaged youth each week.\n  One of their most dedicated mentors, John, has served since 2008 and \nis a product of mentoring.\n  John's father wasn't a presence in his life, so by his own admission, \nhe lacked guidance growing up. However, he was blessed with some caring \nadults--his coach, teacher, and pastor--who stepped in to make sure he \ndid not fall through the cracks.\n  Once into adulthood and established in his career, John felt the need \nto reconnect and give back to children who face adversity. John is now \nthe proud mentor of two mentees: Bobby and Charles.\n  I encourage all Americans to seek out opportunities in their \ncommunity to serve as a mentor, and I urge the public and private \nsectors to come together and create partnerships to close the mentoring \ngap.\n  With an increase in dedicated mentors like Lorita, Michael, Urmie, \nand John we can ensure that more young Americans are better prepared \nfor school, work, and life.\n  Once again, please join me in celebrating January 2014 as National \nMentoring Month and in honoring the millions of Americans who guide our \nyoungest citizens towards achieving their dreams.\n  Now I am going to end. But I do want to particularly say how proud I \nam of the Million Women Mentors which I find very exciting as a woman \nleader. I know the Presiding Officer will be thrilled to see the number \nof extraordinary businesses and organizations that are trying to \nidentify 1 million mentors for girls in America to go into the field of \nscience, technology, engineering, and math, which is a game changer for \nlittle girls and young women to think about careers such as science, \ntechnology, engineering, and math. There is often a need in our country \nfor that skilled labor, so mentors are stepping up and filling in the \ngap.\n  I want everyone to be proud that today is a celebration of mentorship \nmonth. I thank Senator Isakson for joining me in supporting this \neffort.\n  Mr. REID.
