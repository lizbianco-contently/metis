We hope we can move forward on these bills \nimmediately. There is no reason we cannot. It is something we should be \ndoing to fund our government. Senator Mikulski is going to be leading \nthis, as I indicated, along with the senior Senator from Alabama Mr. \nShelby. These bills will provide our government with the resources it \nneeds to serve the American people. The manner in which we handle these \nvery important issues will largely dictate how the appropriations are \nmanaged in the coming weeks and months. We need to keep our government \noperating.\n  I look forward to a cooperative amendment process and participation \nfrom all Senators.

Under the previous order, the Senate will be \nin a period of morning business until 11:00 a.m., with Senators \npermitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes, with the time equally \ndivided by the two leaders or their designees.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the distinguished senior Senator from Iowa \nis here to speak on one of the nominations. I am sure that if the \nRepublican leader does come, he would yield to the Republican leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                           Kadzik Nomination\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. For the third time in a couple weeks, I want to speak \nabout one of the nominees we are going to be voting on today. That \nnominee is Peter Kadzik. He has been nominated to the Department of \nJustice's Office of\n\n[[Page S3692]]\n\nLegislative Affairs. He would have the position of Assistant Attorney \nGeneral. Today I would like to make a few concluding comments about \nthis nominee's record as well as this administration's record, more \nbroadly speaking, with respect to congressional oversight.\n  It is hard for me to imagine a nominee who is less suited to head the \nOffice of Legislative Affairs than Mr. Kadzik. It is not a mystery how \nthe nominee will run that office if he is confirmed, and we know that \nbecause he has been Acting Assistant Attorney General for well over a \nyear, and he has a long and well-established history of contempt for \ncongressional oversight authority. It is clear to me that when it comes \nto this nominee, past practice will be an accurate predictor of future \nperformance. Unfortunately, there is a lot of evidence that justifies \nmy conclusion. I will start with the nominee's record of contempt for \ncongressional oversight even before he joined the Justice Department.\n  When he was a private attorney back in 2001, the House ordered the \nnominee to testify as part of the Congress's investigation into the \neleventh-hour pardon of billionaire tax fugitive Marc Rich. The nominee \nrepresented Rich. Not only did the nominee refuse to appear \nvoluntarily, but he got on a plane to California the day before he was \nscheduled to testify before the House committee. In order to get him to \ntestify before the House, the House had to send the U.S. Marshals to \npersonally serve him with a subpoena in California. Isn't that a cute \nway to act when Congress is trying to speak to him? When he returned to \nWashington, he actually claimed that his lawyers had never bothered to \nmention the subpoena to him before he left on that plane trip to \nCalifornia. We know that claim isn't true because of handwritten notes \nthat are now part of the record of this nominee's confirmation hearing.\n  Unfortunately, things haven't improved much since then. The nominee's \nrecord as Acting Assistant Attorney General has been completely \nunacceptable. Senators' letters and questions go unanswered for many \nmonths before the nominee provides--most often--a largely nonresponsive \nreply. So, as I said last week, this administration is sending a \nmessage by nominating Mr. Kadzik to the Office of Legislative Affairs. \nThat message is this: You can expect more of the same.\n  I want to ask my colleagues this: How much more abuse of this body's \nprerogative by this White House are we willing to accept? How much more \nstonewalling of our legitimate, reasonable requests for information are \nwe prepared to tolerate as we try to carry out our constitutional \nresponsibility of oversight? How many more times do you intend to look \nthe other way as this administration flaunts the law through illegal \nand unilateral executive action?\n  In recent weeks the administration has raised the stakes. Two weeks \nago the President approved the release of the Taliban five from \nGuantanamo without so much as a phone call to the chair or vice chair \nof the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. Disposition of the \ndetainees at Guantanamo is one of the most important issues related to \nthe war on terror, and Congress has a well-defined role under the law \nwhen it comes to releasing dangerous terrorists. But the administration \ndoesn't care about the role Congress has assumed for itself under the \nConstitution and under the laws we write. This administration has shown \ntotal contempt for its obligations under the law--a law they took an \noath to uphold. I guess the President's view is that it is better to \nask forgiveness after the fact than it is to abide by his \nconstitutional obligation to follow the law and take care that law is \nfaithfully executed.\n  That is one reason why this nomination is so important. It is a \nperfect example of this administration's contempt for oversight and \ncontempt for the law.\n  This Senator believes Congress is entitled to learn why the \nadministration thinks it is free to ignore the law. That is why I asked \nthe Attorney General to provide the legal rationale for the President's \nunilateral executive actions that the Office of Legal Counsel gave to \nthe administration that they could ignore the law that said they had to \nnotify Congress 30 days ahead of time when they were going to release \nGuantanamo prisoners. But back in May the nominee refused to disclose \nthe Office of Legal Counsel materials.\n  Given the administration's flagrant disregard for the law governing \nthe release of the Taliban fighters, I think my request to the Attorney \nGeneral is all the more important right now. So I renew my request that \nthe administration provide us with whatever advice it received from the \nOffice of Legal Counsel before it decided to violate the National \nDefense Authorization Act and go forward with the stealth release of \nthe Taliban prisoners.\n  On June 5 I asked the Attorney General to provide the Justice \nDepartment's legal rationale by June 19, which happens to be just 2 \ndays from now. At the very least Senators should wait for a vote on \nthis nomination until then so we can determine whether the Justice \nDepartment intends to comply with our request for the legal \njustification as to why the President could ignore the law when these \nprisoners were released. That would be a modest first step the \nadministration could take to demonstrate it is serious about respecting \noversight authority and the constitutional responsibility of the \nCongress to do that oversight and whether or not they respect the \nseparation of powers under the Constitution.\n  I will conclude. My colleagues know this nominee embodies the \nadministration's disregard for oversight authority and its dismissive \napproach to its legal obligations.\n  That much is clear. But my colleagues also need to remember this: If \nthey vote for this nominee, they are voting to diminish congressional \nauthority. If they vote for this nominee, they are voting to give the \nPresident more of a free pass than he already assumes--and specifically \nin this case on the unlawful release of Taliban fighters. They are \nvoting also to empower unlawful execution of executive actions by this \nand future administrations. They are voting to chip away at the network \nof checks and balances that undergirds the relationship between the \nexecutive and the legislative branches--the very signal the \nConstitution writers sent to the Colonies that they didn't want one \nperson making decisions in our government; they wanted that to be \ndivided authority.\n  Also remember that one day the shoe may be on the other foot. One day \nthere may be a Republican administration that is just as cavalier about \nits legal obligations. If that administration ignores our oversight \nrequest, any Senator who voted for these people will have no right to \ncomplain.\n\n  I urge Senators to stand up for the Senate's constitutional \nresponsibilities of oversight and stand up to this administration and \nvote no.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/17/senate-section/article/S3692-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3692]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the world is learning of the profound \nchallenge facing our Nation as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant \nsweeps across Iraq. We hear the names of former battlefields in Iraq \nand remember the hard-fought gains in places such as Fallujah and Al \nQaim and Ramadi.\n  Just as many Members had not heard of Al Qaeda in the Arabian \nPeninsula before a terrorist attempted to detonate an explosive device \non an airliner over Detroit in 2009, they are now learning of ISIL, a \nvicious terrorist organization that operates across portions of Syria \nand Iraq. Like AQAP, ISIL consists of an insurgency that threatens \nstability in the region where it trains and fights, and that presents a \nterrorist threat to the United States.\n  The Iraqi security forces that were cowed in the face of ISIL \nadvances are now less capable than when the President withdrew the \nentirety of our force without successfully negotiating a capable \nremaining U.S. presence. Such a force would have preserved the gains \nmade on the ground by mentoring our partners and assisting with command \nand control and intelligence sharing. Now we must grapple with how best \nto help Iraq meet this threat.\n  ISIL is a lethal, violent terrorist force, and its activities in \nSyria and Iraq represent a grave threat to U.S. interests. The \nadministration must act\n\n[[Page S3693]]\n\nquickly to provide assistance to the Maliki government before every \ngain made by the U.S. and allied troops is lost and before ISIL expands \nits sanctuary from which it can eventually threaten the United States.\n  Several weeks ago the President spoke at West Point, and in that \nspeech he vaguely described a new counterterrorism strategy that he \nsaid ``matches this diffuse threat'' by ``expand[ing] our reach without \nsending forces that stretch our military too thin, or [that] stir up \nlocal resentments.'' He said that ``we need partners to fight \nterrorists alongside of us.''\n  The President must quickly provide us with a strategy and plan that \naddress the threat posed by the insurgency and the terrorist \ncapabilities of ISIL, and he must explain that new strategy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/17/senate-section/article/S3693-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3693]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                THE IRS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, when the IRS targeting of conservative \ngroups came to light after the last Presidential election, just about \neveryone denounced the agency's Nixonian tactics. Members of both \nparties--from the President on down--called it outrageous and \ninexcusable and just about everyone agreed no stone should be left \nunturned in figuring out how it happened in the first place.\n  Well, that was more than a year ago, and despite the President's \nassurances that he was as mad as everybody else, his administration has \nbeen anything but cooperative in the time that has elapsed since then. \nInstead of working with Congress to get to the bottom of what happened, \nthe President's allies actually went in the opposite direction. They \ntried to slip a regulation by the American people that would have \neffectively enshrined the IRS's speech suppression tactics--the kind of \ntactics at the center of the IRS scandal--as permanent agency practice. \nIt was a brazen move on the administration's part, and administration \nofficials only backed down after Americans rose up and demanded that \nthe IRS get out of the speech suppression business for good. Even some \nof our friends on the pro-First Amendment left--a dwindling \nconstituency in recent years--joined us in condemning it. But I doubt \nwe have seen the last of the administration's antifree speech efforts.\n  We have seen a revival in recent weeks of a truly radical proposal to \nchange the First Amendment. When it comes to the IRS scandal, it is now \nquite obvious we have not seen the last of the administration's \nstalling either. The latest claim by the IRS is that it somehow lost a \nfull 2 years' worth of emails from the woman in charge of the IRS \ndepartment at the center of the scandal. They lost 2 years' worth of \nemails. But Congress submitted a request for these emails over a year \nago, and they are suddenly telling us now? The committees investigating \nthe scandal need those emails in order to figure out who knew what and \nwhen and to determine whether any coordination was going on between the \nIRS and anyone outside the agency.\n  I will be interested to see what the IRS Commissioner has to say \nabout all of this when he testifies next week. But please, let's get \npast the ``dog ate my homework'' excuses buried in a late Friday news \ndump. The President promised to work ``hand in hand'' with Congress on \nthis matter so his administration needs to live up to that promise \nimmediately.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/17/senate-section/article/S3693-2", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3693]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            COAL REGULATIONS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, in the Obama administration's latest \ndefensive on the war on coal, it has proposed new regulations that \nthreaten Kentucky's 20 existing coal-fired powerplants while \npotentially putting thousands out of work. If enacted, the massive new \nregulations would prove the single worst blow to Kentucky's economy in \nmodern times and a dagger to the heart of the Commonwealth's middle \nclass.\n  Despite what they are called, the proposed restrictions on Kentucky's \ncoal-fired powerplants amount to little more than a massive energy tax, \nand they will have a devastating effect on Kentucky.\n  The administration announced it would hold four public hearings on \nthe new proposed regulations, and given the dramatic effects they are \nsure to have on my home State, you would think they would hold one of \nthose hearings in eastern Kentucky or, at the very least, somewhere in \nKentucky. But then, of course, you would be mistaken.\n  Once again, just like last year when the Obama administration held \npublic hearings before proposing this national energy tax, not one of \nthe sessions is slated for a nonmetropolitan area dependent on coal. \nThe session that is the nearest to eastern Kentucky is a 10-hour \nroundtrip.\n  Since coal employs 11,000 Kentuckians and is over 90 percent of \nKentucky's electricity, I wrote a letter to Gina McCarthy, the EPA \nAdministrator, formally requesting that she convene a hearing in coal \ncountry. Of course I have yet to get a response. However, it doesn't \nappear that Administrator McCarthy is too busy to talk to some people. \nImagine my surprise when I found she had time to appear on an HBO late-\nnight comedy show where she admitted that the Obama administration is, \nin fact, waging a war on coal.\n\n  The host asked her this question:\n\n       Some people call it a war on coal. I hope it is a war on \n     coal. Is it?\n\n  After a moment of indirection, Administrator McCarthy conceded that a \nwar on coal is ``exactly what this is.'' The EPA Administrator said the \nwar on coal is ``exactly what this is.''\n  Of course, this talk show was recorded in front of a friendly anti-\ncoal host and audience in a television studio in Los Angeles. It almost \nsounds like the site of one of her EPA anti-coal hearings.\n  So why does Administrator McCarthy have the time to appear on HBO but \ndoes not have the time to appear on WYMT-TV in Hazard so she can \nexplain her war on coal to the people it is most directly affecting? \nWhy does she have the time to sit down with a TV comedian but not with \nthe editors of the Appalachian News Express in Pikeville so she can \nlook my constituents in the eye and explain how these rules will impact \nthem?\n  Of course, for those of us who watch this administration closely, \nthis kind of admission is nothing new. A year ago an adviser to the \nWhite House acknowledged that ``a War on Coal is exactly what's \nneeded.''\n  Last year, because the administration refused to hold any of its \nlistening sessions in coal country, I held one of my own. We heard a \nlot of riveting testimony from those in the industry and their \nfamilies, and I brought their stories back to the administration where \nI testified on their behalf since the Administrator would not directly \nhear from them.\n  I am committed to making sure Kentucky's voice is heard on this issue \neven if the Obama administration doesn't want to listen. That is why I \nimmediately responded to the administration's new regulations in my own \nlegislation, the Coal Country Protection Act, to push back against the \nPresident's extreme anti-coal scheme. Supported by the Kentucky Coal \nAssociation, my legislation would require that the following simple but \nimportant benchmarks be met before the rules take effect.\n  Here is what it would do: No. 1, the Secretary of Labor would have to \ncertify that the rules would not generate loss of employment.\n  No. 2, the Director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office \nwould have to certify the rules would not result in any loss in \nAmerican gross domestic product.\n  No. 3, the Administrator of the Energy Information Administration \nwould have to certify the rules would not increase electricity rates.\n  And No. 4, the Chair of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and \nthe president of the North American Electric Reliability Corporation \nwould have to certify that electricity delivery would remain reliable. \nThat is it.\n  My legislation is plain common sense, and I urge the majority leader \nto allow a vote on my legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this morning there was a scene on \ntelevision I had never seen before. In fact, the commentators said they \nhad never seen it either.\n\n[[Page S3694]]\n\n  I might preface this by saying I grew up in the Midwest. Tornadoes \nare a part of our lives. I cannot recall how many times I was rousted \nout of my bed in the middle of the night as the sirens were going on \noutside and mom and dad would take me to the basement. That is what we \ndid as I grew up in the Midwest. Tornadoes were part of our lives.\n  This morning showed what happened in Nebraska yesterday to be a \nvirtually unique occurrence--twin tornadoes came ripping through the \nState of Nebraska killing people and destroying lives and businesses \nand homes and farms. There was a reflection on this about how the \nweather seems to be getting more extreme in this country. Are we \ngetting more and more extreme weather events, many of which are very \ndestructive? I think the clear answer is yes. Don't trust a politician \nor even an environmentalist for that answer. Go to the people who do \nthis for a living. That is what I did. I held a hearing and called the \nleaders from the property and casualty insurance companies. They do \nthis for a living, and they said not only are we getting more extreme \nweather events, they are much more expensive than ever before. The \ndestruction is much larger. So many insurance companies, because of \nthese extreme weather events, are starting to charge higher premiums \nand backing off of coverage. They said they can't create a reserve for \nthe possibility of an extreme weather event that would be so \ndestructive.\n  There are some people who hear what I just said and say: Well, God \nhas his ways--or her ways--and God may decide the weather is going to \nbe a lot tougher for you in this generation than in other generations. \nI heard that back home. But there are some people who believe--and I am \none of them--that this is not just God's work, this has something to do \nwith our work on this planet.\n  I happen to believe carbon pollution is a challenge, not just for \nAmerica but for the world, and we need to reduce carbon pollution, \nwhich is changing the planet we live on. Because of carbon pollution, \nthis warming climate--this warming planet--is creating situations which \nare troubling.\n  There was an article in the paper over the weekend. Norfolk, VA--not \na liberal bastion--is now taking steps because of the rising ocean. It \nis up about a foot and a half from what they knew as the standard and \nthey expect it to grow even more, threatening buildings, commerce, and \nhomes all around that area. The impact of climate change and carbon \npollution is evident in every direction of this world.\n\n  I have said this on the floor four or five times and I will repeat \nit: There is only one major political party in the world today that \ndenies climate change and denies these extreme weather events have \nanything to do with our activity on Earth. The Republican Party of the \nUnited States of America is in denial. So when they deny the premise \nthat something is happening on this Earth that we need to think about \nand worry about, it is easy to dismiss any and every effort to deal \nwith it.\n  The Senator who spoke before me is from my neighboring State of \nKentucky. His coal fields abut my coal fields in Southern Illinois, so \nwe have a common energy resource. But I will say in all honesty, if we \nwant to use the energy resource of coal in Illinois, we have to change \nthe way we use it to reduce pollution. I think we can do that. It will \nbe better technology in the electrical powerplants and uses something \nthat is underway in our State: carbon capturing sequestration. Imagine \nif we could take the carbon pollution that is headed for the atmosphere \nthat causes the problem and never let it reach the atmosphere.\n  That is what we are going to do. We are going to dig deep into the \nEarth over 1 mile down under three levels of shale rock and store \ncompressed CO2 so it doesn't go into the atmosphere. Carbon \ncapturing sequestration, that is not a war on coal; that is a war on \nour energy problems and a responsible approach for dealing with coal.\n  I think that is the honest answer to my friends in Southern Illinois \nand those who value the coal industry and what it means to our economy. \nWe have to be thoughtful, reflective, and innovative in making certain \nwe use the energy resources we have responsibly and leave this Earth in \na situation where our children and grandchildren will say our \ngeneration did not ignore the obvious.\n  Twin tornadoes in Nebraska are an indicator to me that time is not on \nour side. We have to step up. Both parties have to step up and find \nsolutions that are responsible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/17/senate-section/article/S3694-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           YANDLE NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of Staci Yandle, who has \nbeen nominated to serve as a Federal district court judge in the \nSouthern District of Illinois. She is going to replace a fine Federal \njudge, J. Philip Gilbert, who took senior status in March. It is a \njudicial emergency, so I am glad we are moving to it today.\n  Staci Yandle has the experience, integrity, and the judgment to be an \nexcellent Federal judge. Born in Centreville, IL--incidentally, the \nhometown of my wife--she currently lives in Carlyle, IL, downstate. She \nreceived her undergraduate degree from the University of Illinois and \nher law degree from Vanderbilt.\n  Over the course of her career, Staci Yandle has gained extensive \nexperience in the courtroom. She has her own solo practice based in \nO'Fallon, IL, which she has operated now for 7 years. She has worked \nfor several outstanding law firms in southern Illinois and handled a \nwide range of litigation matters, including employment, education, \nmedical injury, civil rights, and nursing home abuse cases. She also \nworked as an arbitrator for the Twentieth Judicial Circuit Court in \nIllinois.\n  Ms. Yandle currently serves on the board of the Illinois Bar \nFoundation. She has taught as an adjunct law professor at the St. Louis \nUniversity School of Law.\n  Additionally, she has a distinguished record of pro bono service in \nsouthern Illinois, representing indigent clients and nonprofit \ncorporations, including the Delta Economic Development Corporation, \nwhich operates a childcare center in St. Clair County.\n  Ms. Yandle's nomination is historic in several respects. Never before \nin the course of the history of our State has there been an Article III \nFederal judge who was openly a member of the LGBT community. Upon \nconfirmation, Staci Yandle will be the first. Upon confirmation, she \nwill also be the first African-American Federal judge ever to serve in \nthe Southern District of Illinois. She will be only the second woman to \nserve, as she is joining Nancy Rosenstengel, who was approved by the \nSenate just a few weeks ago.\n  In short, Staci Yandle's confirmation marks another important \nmilestone in America's journey toward equality of opportunity.\n  Ms. Yandle was recommended to me by a bipartisan screening committee \nwhich I established to take a look at all of the judicial candidates, \nand I was pleased to recommend her to President Obama. He forwarded her \nnomination for consideration by the Senate Judiciary Committee where it \npassed with a strong vote. I hope there will be an equally strong vote \ntoday in support of her nomination.\n  In conclusion, Ms. Yandle is an excellent nominee and I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in voting to confirm her.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/17/senate-section/article/S3694-2", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3694-S3696]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               NOMINATION\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to speak about an important vote \nwe are going to be taking today to confirm the next U.S. district judge \nfor the Eastern District of Washington State.\n  It is not every day that I get to support a nominee who also happens \nto be a former intern in my Senate office, but it is also not every day \nthat a man who is the son of a migrant farmworker and himself worked on \nfarms in the Yakima Valley is called upon by the President of the \nUnited States to become the very first Latino Federal judge in the \nEastern District of Washington. So I am incredibly proud to stand in \nsupport of Judge Salvador Mendoza, Jr., whose confirmation we will vote \non shortly.\n  Through his life story, Judge Mendoza represents the very best of my \nhome State's honest, hard-working spirit. Through his work ethic, his \ncommitment to his community, and\n\n[[Page S3695]]\n\nhis belief in equal opportunity, Judge Mendoza is a leader and a role \nmodel for families throughout our State, particularly young men and \nwomen born into poverty and difficult circumstances. In fact, in his \napplication to serve as Federal judge, he discussed his own upbringing, \nand I wish to quote him. Judge Mendoza wrote:\n\n       I wrote and studied hard to better myself and my family. I \n     understood then what I believe now, that both the quality of \n     the educational system coupled with a strong system of \n     justice will lift up the entire community.\n\n  Those are the words of a man who belongs in our judicial system. It \nshould come as no surprise that throughout his professional life, Judge \nMendoza has stayed true to those words. From serving as a trustee for \nColumbia Basin College to helping to coordinate the annual Tri-Cities \nYouth and Justice Conference, to helping create the first drug court \nfor Benton and Franklin counties, Judge Mendoza has given his time and \nexperience, investing in institutions that lift communities throughout \nour State.\n\n  Judge Mendoza is currently a superior court judge, but his judicial \ncareer spans private practice, service as an assistant attorney \ngeneral, and years of experience in superior, district, municipal, and \njuvenile court. He is an experienced practitioner in Federal court and \nserved from 2010 to 2013 as lawyer representative to the Ninth Circuit \nJudicial Conference.\n  Through his many years of legal practice and judicial experience, \nJudge Mendoza will come to the Federal bench well prepared.\n  Judge Mendoza has described his judicial philosophy as guided by the \nprinciples of patience, respect, and humility--the same principles that \nhave guided his life and legal career--and principles that will serve \nhim well as a member of the Federal judiciary.\n  Let me close by thanking him for his willingness to serve Washington \nState as a Federal judge. I have always believed that as a country we \nare at our best when good people are willing to give of themselves in \nservice to others. It is that kind of service to others that has \ndefined Judge Mendoza throughout his career and that will continue to \ndefine him as he assumes the duties of this new office.\n  I am proud to support his nomination to be U.S. district judge, and I \nurge our colleagues to support his nomination as well.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise to support the nomination of \nSalvador Mendoza, Jr., to be a district judge for the Eastern District \nof our State. I applaud the Senate Judiciary Committee for favorably \nreporting Mr. Mendoza's nomination on a bipartisan basis out of the \ncommittee with a 17-to-1 vote, so he enjoys a great deal of support. We \nare happy because we filled one vacancy for the Eastern District bench \nearlier in April, and now it is time for the Senate to move forward in \nfilling the last of the two vacancies by voting to confirm Judge \nMendoza.\n  Judge Mendoza is a well-qualified, dedicated judge whose passion and \nperspective will serve the Eastern District of Washington very well. He \nhas had experience serving as a superior court judge. He has served as \na prosecutor, he has been in private practice, and he has been a \ncommunity leader in the central part of our State. There is no question \nthat he is ready for the challenge of being a Federal judge.\n  I also wish to speak in terms of the historic nature of this vote. \nSalvador Mendoza will become the first ever Hispanic Federal judge in \nEastern Washington. That is a major step forward and one that is long \noverdue. One in every nine residents of Washington State is Hispanic. \nYet we have not yet had a Hispanic Federal judge in the eastern part of \nour State. Judge Mendoza is the right man for the job and he is ready \nto make history.\n  Judge Mendoza personifies the American dream. Eastern Washington is \nhome to a very large and growing Hispanic population. Many who settled \nin Eastern Washington did so for the very same reasons Judge Mendoza's \nfamily did. He grew up in a family of migrant workers who moved from \nCalifornia to Washington's Yakima Valley when he was just a small \nchild. He went on from working alongside his parents in the fields to \nearn a bachelor's degree from the University of Washington and a law \ndegree from the University of California at Los Angeles.\n  Coming from very modest beginnings, Judge Mendoza has built a stellar \nlegal resume. Judge Mendoza served as a deputy prosecuting attorney and \nspent 1 year as assistant attorney general. He has worked in private \npractice in a partner firm, and he went on to serve as judge pro \ntempore for Benton County Superior Court and Franklin County juvenile \ndistrict court. Since 2013 he has served as Washington State's superior \ncourt judge for Benton and Franklin Counties.\n  A few years ago I had the honor of speaking with Judge Mendoza at a \nroundtable of Latino community leaders in the Tri-Cities. I came away \nvery impressed with his intellect and his ability and keen \nunderstanding of our challenges in Central and Eastern Washington and \nof our legal system. He talked about the importance of an effective \ndrug court to tackle the challenges facing Central Washington, and \nJudge Mendoza has shown his commitment to making his community a better \nplace to live. He helped found the juvenile drug court program for \nBenton and Franklin Counties, which provides the opportunities for \ntreatment for juvenile drug offenders. He is the main organizer of the \nTri-Cities Youth and Justice Forum, an organization that encourages \nstudents from underrepresented communities to seek careers within the \nlegal system. He also serves on many other boards, including the board \nof trustees for Columbia Basin College.\n  I think Judge Mendoza has earned this important position. I hope my \ncolleagues will support him. I know my colleague Senator Murray, who \njust spoke, Governor Jay Inslee, and many other attorneys and judges \nacross the State of Washington enthusiastically support Judge Mendoza's \nnomination. So I urge my colleagues to confirm him today.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, the Senate will vote on the \nnominations of three judicial nominees to serve on the U.S. districts \ncourts: Judge Salvador Mendoza, to serve in the Eastern District of \nWashington, Staci Yandle, to fill an emergency vacancy in the Southern \nDistrict of Illinois, and Judge Darrin Gayles, to fill an emergency \nvacancy in the Southern District of Florida. Each of these nominees has \nthe support of their home State Senators, and each was reported over a \nmonth ago with unanimous or nearly unanimous approval of members of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee. None of these qualified nominees deserved \nto be filibustered yesterday, and should be confirmed without delay.\n  The confirmation of these nominees will be historic milestones for \ndiversity on the Federal bench. If confirmed, Judge Mendoza would be \nthe first Latino to serve on the Federal bench in the Eastern District \nof Washington. The confirmation of Staci Yandle would make her the \nfirst African-American woman ever to serve as a Federal judge in the \nSouthern District of Illinois, as well as the first openly gay Federal \njudge to serve in Illinois. And, if confirmed, Judge Gayles would be \nthe first openly gay African-American man judge to ever serve on the \nFederal bench. It is important that the Federal bench reflects the \ndiversity of the American people, and we should be proud of the \nprogress we are making today.\n  Judge Salvador Mendoza has been nominated to fill a judicial vacancy \non the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Washington. \nJudge Mendoza has served since 2013 as a Washington State superior \ncourt judge in Benton and Franklin Counties. He previously served as a \njudge pro tempore in Benton and Franklin Counties from 2002 to 2013. In \n2002, he helped start the Benton-Franklin Juvenile Drug Court program, \na treatment-based program intended to be an alternative to full \ncriminal prosecution. Before his time\n\n[[Page S3696]]\n\nas a judge, he worked in private practice as the president and managing \nattorney of Mendoza and Johnson, P.S. from 2002 to 2013. He served as \nvice president at Haney and Mendoza, P.S. from 1999 to 2002. After \ngraduating from law school, he served as assistant attorney general in \nthe Washington State Attorney General's Office from 1997 to 1998, and \nas the deputy prosecuting attorney in the Franklin County Prosecutor's \nOffice from 1998 to 1999. He has the support of his home State \nSenators, Senator Cantwell and Senator Murray. The Judiciary Committee \nreported his nomination favorably with near-unanimous bipartisan \nsupport to the full Senate on April 3, 2014.\n  Staci Yandle has been nominated to fill a judicial emergency vacancy \non the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois. Staci \nYandle has worked since 2007 in private practice as a sole \npractitioner, and since 2010 as counsel for the Farrise Firm P.C. She \npreviously served as a partner at The Rex Carr Law Firm from 2003 to \n2007 and as an associate at Carr, Korein, Schlichter, Kunin, Montroy, \nGlass & Bogard from 1987 to 2003. She worked as an adjunct professor at \nthe St. Louis University School of Law from 1991 to 2000, teaching \ncourses in trial advocacy and civil practice. From 1992 to 1996, she \nserved as a member of the Illinois Advisory Committee to the U.S. \nCommission on Civil Rights. Staci Yandle has been active in her \ncommunity, providing pro bono legal services to indigent clients on \nissues ranging from tenant disputes to personal injury claims. She has \nthe support of her home State Senators, Senator Durbin and Senator \nKirk. The Judiciary Committee reported her nomination favorably with \nnear-unanimous bipartisan support to the full Senate on April 3, 2014.\n  Judge Darrin Gayles has been nominated to fill a judicial emergency \nvacancy on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of \nFlorida. He has served since 2011 as a Florida State judge on the \nEleventh Judicial Circuit Court, and previously served as a county \njudge in the Eleventh Judicial Circuit of Florida from 2004 to 2011. \nPrior to becoming a judge, he served as an assistant U.S. attorney in \nthe Southern District of Florida from 1999 to 2004, an assistant \ndistrict counsel in the U.S. Department of Justice, Immigration and \nNaturalization Service from 1997 to 1999, and as an assistant State \nattorney in the Miami-Dade State Attorney's Office from 1993 to 1997. \nHe has the support of his home State Senators, Senator Nelson and \nSenator Rubio. The Judiciary Committee reported his nomination by voice \nvote to the full Senate on May 8, 2014.\n  I commend the majority leader for bringing the nominations of these \nthree nominees up for a vote. With yesterday's cloture votes, the \nSenate has voted on cloture for judicial nominees 50 times so far this \nyear. This is more than all the cloture votes on judicial nominees \nduring the two preceding administrations combined. This level of \npartisanship is meritless, and only serves to weaken the Federal courts \nand the American justice system. I hope that my colleagues will join me \nin voting to confirm these qualified nominees, and allow them to get to \nwork for the American people.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schatz).

Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                        Family Friendly Policies\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, Senate Democrats have been focused on a \nlot of ways to expand opportunity and economic security for women and \nmothers in today's workforce. We have talked about the need to ensure \nequal pay for equal work, to make childcare more affordable, and to \nencourage profamily workplace policies that help workers be good \nparents and good employees.\n  We have explained how each of those policies and others would give \nworking women and mothers a better shot at success. It is important to \nkeep in mind that times have changed in the last few decades. Today \ntwo-thirds of families with children have two working parents. Dads are \ntaking a more hands-on role in raising their children. This means in \nmany working families fathers are increasingly facing a lot of the same \nchallenges that mothers do. In fact, more and more fathers report they \nare struggling to balance work and family.\n  At a time when so many families need both parents to be at work in \norder to make ends meet, we clearly need to update our policies so that \nboth mothers and fathers can succeed at work and at home. So today, \nsince it was just Father's Day, I asked a few dads to come in and speak \nwith my colleagues and me about how many of the policies often thought \nof as especially important to working women, such as affordable \nchildcare, paid sick leave, would also do a lot for dads. I want to \nthank them for taking the time to share their stories and their \nexperiences with all of us, because what we heard was really powerful. \nWe heard fathers speak about how family-friendly policies helped them \nraise their kids and meet their responsibilities at work.\n  We heard from a dad who decided to stay home with his twins rather \nthan pay for childcare because it was simply too expensive. We heard \nfrom a father and a small business owner who has made fair pay a \npriority at his business because he knows how fast those lost wages add \nup and how much equal pay can mean for a working family with a mortgage \nor student loans or car payments or all three of those.\n  What these fathers made clear is the economic barriers we often see \nas impacting women, such as inflexible workplace policies or the high \ncost of childcare or unequal pay, are not just holding women back, they \nare holding 21st century families back. There is no question in my mind \nthey are a drag on our economy. That is why Democrats are fighting for \npolicies that would help hard-working mothers and fathers across the \ncountry.\n  We are fighting to make sure women get equal pay for equal work, just \nas we made sure women do not get charged more for health insurance \nbecause of their gender. We have legislation to expand access to \naffordable quality childcare and early education so that mothers and \nfathers can go to work knowing their children are safe and thriving \nwhile they are away.\n  We have also proposed raising the minimum wage so parents are not \nworking full time but still stuck in poverty and struggling to make \nends meet. Democrats are also fighting to help our workers compete for \ngood jobs by bringing down tuition costs and ensuring workers can get \nthe training and education they need.\n  There is much more we can do as well. But any of those policies would \ngo an enormously long way toward helping working families get the fair \nshot they deserve. This is why it has been so disappointing to see that \nwhen it comes to everything from the Paycheck Fairness Act to the \nraising of minimum wage for millions of our workers, to helping ease \nthe burden of student loans, our Republican colleagues have so far said \nno, even though these policies are policies that would help millions of \nour working families and even though we know Americans across the \ncountry strongly support these kinds of changes. I know they would \ncertainly mean a lot to many of the fathers I spoke with today.\n  I came here today to say I hope our Republican colleagues rethink the \napproach they have taken on all of those issues so far, because I \nbelieve if we take steps to break down the barriers working mothers and \nfathers are facing in today's economy, families across our country will \nhave more opportunity and our country will be stronger now and over the \nlong term.\n  There is no reason for us not to get to work on these.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n\n                         South Dakota Flooding\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, before I begin my prepared remarks, I \nwish to acknowledge my constituents in South Dakota who are dealing \nwith unprecedented flooding. We have seen historic amounts of rainfall \nalready in the month of June that dwarf anything we can compare to \nthroughout our State's history. Hail and winds are causing widespread \ndamage across the State.\n  It is not just confined to our State. There are States in the region \nas well that are experiencing some of these same circumstances and \ntremendous damage to property. So I wanted to express my thoughts and \nprayers to the people I represent as well as to those in other States \nwho are dealing with some of these circumstances, and to say thank you \nand express my appreciation to our first responders who have been very \nmuch in demand and on call the last few days.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  The American people are very tired. They are very weary. They are \narguably fed up. The Washington Post headline from last Friday summed \nit up, ``Obama's image hits record lows in trio of polls.'' Gallup, \nCNN/ORC, and Bloomberg polls all found that the President's favorable \nrating had fallen to new lows. It is no wonder. Five years after the \nrecession supposedly ended, most Americans still feel as though they \nare in the midst of it.\n  It is not just me saying that. The President's own Federal Reserve \nChair Janet Yellen stated as recently as March, ``The recovery still \nfeels like a recession to many Americans, and it also looks that way in \nsome economic statistics.''\n  Let's talk about some of those statistics. Unemployment has spent the \npast 5\\1/2\\ years at recession level highs. Currently nearly 10 million \nAmericans are unemployed, more than one-third of them for 6 months or \nlonger. The labor force participation rate is at a 36-year low. A USA \nToday editorial from last week noted that the ``decline in the `labor \nforce participation rate' is one of the most troubling trends of our \ntime.'' Of course, the labor participation rate being the fraction of \nthe available workforce that is actually working or at least looking \nfor work.\n  What is driving that trend, Americans so discouraged by their failure \nto find a job that they have literally given up looking altogether? \nThat is what is driving the trend in the labor participation rate.\n  Even after accounting for baby-boomers retiring and more people going \nto college--and this is again from the USA Today piece I mentioned \nearlier--this translates to 6 million people who could be working or \nlooking for work. As the paper points out, the lack of these workers in \nthe workforce means a weaker economy, lower tax revenue, as well as \ngreater governmental expense.\n\n  Young people just getting out of college face a bleak job market. The \nunemployment rate for young adults is a staggering 13.2 percent or more \nthan twice the national average. The director of Outreach for \nGeneration Opportunity, a nonprofit advocacy organization for \nmillennials, recently stated that more than four out of five recent \ngraduates do not have jobs. Currently, 36 percent of young adults are \nliving at home with their parents.\n  It is no wonder that CNNmoney reports that young adults, aged 18 to \n34, are most likely to feel the American dream is unattainable, with 63 \npercent saying it is not only unattainable, it is impossible.\n  Everywhere Americans look, prices are rising. The price of everything \nfrom milk to the refrigerator to hold it has increased over the past \nseveral years. Gas prices have almost doubled since President Obama \ntook office. College costs are soaring.\n\n[[Page S3699]]\n\n  Then there is ObamaCare, which has meant soaring premiums and huge \ndeductibles for way too many American families. Being in the middle \nclass was once associated with financial security. With a little \nprudence, middle-class families could be expected to see their kids \nthrough college and to retire comfortably. No more.\n  In the Obama economy, the future is less secure. Household income not \nonly failed to rise over the past 5\\1/2\\ years, it has actually dropped \nby $3,500 under the President's watch. Wages have remained flat and \neconomic growth has been tepid at best. Middle-class families are no \nlonger looking forward to a future of economic security. Instead, they \nare praying they do not get hit with any unexpected bills. They are \nworrying that they will not be able to send their kids to college, and \nthey are wondering how long they will have to work past retirement to \nthe economic security they need.\n  In a previous America, low-income families could confidently expect \nthat effort and hard work could bring them into the ranks of the middle \nclass. How many of our parents started out living on a shoestring but \nended up sending their kids to college and retiring comfortably?\n  Today, though, opportunities to reach the middle class are few and \nfar between. Fourteen million more Americans are on food stamps today \nthan when the President took office. Democratic policies such as the \nObamaCare 30-hour workweek are hitting low-income Americans the \nhardest. Many of the better paying jobs lost during the recession are \nnot being replaced. Seventy-eight percent of the jobs lost during the \nrecession were high- or mid-wage jobs, but just 56 percent of the jobs \nrecovered have been high or mid-wage jobs. That means almost half of \nthe new jobs that have been created are low-wage jobs. That is not the \nkind of climate that enables upward mobility.\n  The worst part is it does not look as though things are going to get \nbetter anytime soon. This week the International Monetary Fund \nannounced it now predicts the United States economic growth rate will \nnot exceed 2 percent this year. That is not anywhere close to the kind \nof growth we need for a real recovery.\n  The New York Times reported last week, ``The Federal Reserve, \npersistently optimistic in its previous forecasts, said in March that \nit no longer expected a full recovery in the foreseeable future.'' Let \nme repeat that. The Federal Reserve said it no longer expected a full \nrecovery in the foreseeable future.\n  Four years ago President Obama and his administration proclaimed the \nadvent of the summer of economic recovery. President Obama claimed the \neconomy is headed in the right direction. Vice President Biden \nconfidently predicted in April of 2010 that sometime in the next couple \nof months we are going to be creating between 250,000 jobs a month and \n500,000 jobs a month. In August of that year, Treasury Secretary \nTimothy Geithner published an op-ed in the New York Times entitled, \n``Welcome to the Recovery.''\n  Well, as the American people know, recovery summer never \nmaterialized. Four years later the American people are still waiting. \nAccording to the Federal Reserve, they are going to have to wait \nlonger. In 2009, the President's economic advisors predicted that \nunemployment would fall below 6 percent in 2012. Two years later, \nunemployment is still firmly stuck above 6 percent. The Federal Reserve \nBank in San Francisco has suggested that 6-percent unemployment should \nbe considered the ``new normal.''\n  I do not accept that. Republicans do not accept that. We do not \naccept 6.3 percent unemployment, sluggish economic growth, and \nstruggling middle-class families as the new normal, because it does not \nhave to be that way. We can get our economy going again. But it is \ngoing to take something a lot different than the policies of the past \n5\\1/2\\ years. It is going to take the kind of policies that remove \nfamilies' burdens, instead of increasing them. It is going to take \npolicies that encourage businesses to create jobs, not to cut jobs. \nRepublicans have a lot of ideas about how to get started, ideas such as \nrepealing the ObamaCare medical device tax that has already killed tens \nof thousands of jobs and will kill thousands more if it is not stopped \nor restoring the 40-hour workweek so businesses will no longer be \nforced to cut employees' hours under ObamaCare's mandates or stopping \nthe President's national energy tax which would make it more difficult \nfor American families, particularly low-income families, to afford gas, \nheating, and electricity or enacting trade promotion authority to open \nnew markets to American farmers, workers, and businesses, and to create \nnew good-paying jobs for American workers.\n  The list goes on. These are just a few of the ideas Republicans have \nto get our economy going again.\n  If Democrats were serious about wanting to help American families, \nthey would be working with Republicans to help us get legislation \npassed. We don't have to accept the President's economy as the new \nnormal: chronic high unemployment, sluggish growth, massive amounts of \ndebt. That shouldn't be the norm, and we shouldn't be satisfied with \nit.\n  Republicans are going to be working every day to ensure it isn't the \nnew normal, and we will continue working until our economy is \nflourishing again and every American has the opportunity for a good job \nand a prosperous and secure future. We hope Democrats will work with us \ntoward that end. It means opening this floor of the Senate to \nlegislation that will grow our economy, create jobs, and allow us to \nopenly debate, allow us to offer amendments, something that hasn't \nhappened for the past year.\n  Since July of last year, there have been only nine Republican \namendments voted on on the floor of the Senate--nine--nine amendments \nin almost a year. The ironic thing about that is the same procedures \nthat are being used to block Republican amendments are also blocking \nDemocratic amendments. So in that same timeframe Democrats have only \nhad seven amendments voted on in the past year.\n  In the world's greatest deliberative body, the place where we are \nsupposed to have open debate and an open amendment process, Republicans \nhad nine amendments voted on. We could take that as a personal affront, \nbut that is not what it is about. It is about the people whom we \nrepresent because they elect us here to come out, represent them, and \nto make sure their voices are heard in the political processes in the \ndebates we have in Washington on the big issues that are important to \nthem and their families. So when amendments are blocked and this \nprocess is shut down on the floor of the Senate, it is the people's \nvoices who don't get heard and don't get represented. That has to \nchange, and it needs to change soon, because the issues are big, and \nthe problems and the challenges that face middle-income families are \nconsequential.\n  Many of us in this Chamber come here every single day hoping to offer \nlegislation and amendments that we believe will be solutions to getting \nthe economy growing again and to create jobs. Every single day for the \nlast year, at least, we have been shut down.\n  We can do better by the American people. They deserve better. I hope \nwe will do better, and we can start now.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/17/senate-section/article/S3699-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Who yields time? If no one yields time, time \nwill be charged equally to both sides.\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n\n\n                  Tribute to Leonard N. ``Bud'' Purdy\n\n  Mr. RISCH. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of \nIdaho's legendary ranchers and conservationists, Leonard N. Purdy, who \nwas known to all of us as Bud Purdy. Bud passed away on April 14, at \nthe age of 96, at his home on Silver Creek in Picabo, ID.\n  Bud never called himself a cowboy, but when I think of an Idaho \ncowboy, Bud is the one who frequently comes to mind. As many have said, \nhe was the definition of the values we attribute to\n\n[[Page S3700]]\n\ncowboys--hard work, common sense, persistence, determination, faith in \nothers, honesty, and, to me, a true friend. Bud demonstrated these \nevery day in life on the ranch, at the store and the grain businesses \nhe owned, and especially among family, friends, and in the community.\n  I think the love of ranching was just in his blood, an inherited \ntrait. After graduating from Washington State University in Pullman, \nBud went to work on his grandfather's ranch. He worked his way up to \nmanaging the Picabo Ranch and then he bought it. He also bought the \nPicabo Store and Silver Creek Supply--a grain elevator and seed \nbusiness.\n  Bud was known by all for his love of the cattle industry. He enjoyed \nmoving cattle, riding the fences, and moving and checking water, some \nof which he did long after most would have retired. He was a real Idaho \ncowboy. In fact, Bud helped get the Idaho Cattle Association started, \nwhere he served as president and was a longtime member of the board.\n  Bud was one of the larger-than-life Idahoans who helped make the Gem \nState a great place to live, work, and play. Working the land for \nlivestock grazing, Bud recognized the value of conserving for future \ngenerations, so some 20 years ago he donated a 3,500-acre conservation \neasement along Silver Creek to the Nature Conservancy--a contribution \nvalued at $7 million. Yet Bud--true to his character--did not even take \nthe associated tax deduction.\n  Clearly, like he valued the land, Bud valued Idaho. He had natural \nleadership talent which was called on time and again in community and \nindustry organizations. He served on the Idaho Rangeland Committee and \nthe National Bureau of Land Management Advisory Council. Bud also gave \ntime to foundations of the University of Idaho and College of Southern \nIdaho and the Blaine County Medical Center. In addition, he helped \nraise funds for the new St. Luke's Hospital. Bud also helped establish \nthe Idaho Association of Commerce and Industry, where he also served as \nchairman. IACI, as it is known, is a strong and well-respected group \nfostering business interests in Idaho.\n  Amazingly, Bud found time for hunting, skiing, fishing, and flying. \nAmong those he hosted, hunted, and skied with were Ernest Hemingway, \nJimmy Stewart, and Gary Cooper--all frequent visitors to his ranch on \nSilver Creek.\n  Flying became a passion. He checked the ranch from the air and \npiloted to many meetings across the State and Nation. As late as last \nyear, he and his son Nick flew to California to attend a meeting. At \nthe time of Bud's passing, he was the second oldest pilot in Idaho. He \nonce told me he hoped he could fly long enough to be the oldest pilot \nin Idaho. Unfortunately, he didn't quite make it. But if there are \nplanes in Heaven, Bud is definitely flying one today.\n  Among the many honors and awards Bud received were an induction into \nthe Idaho Hall of Fame, an honorary doctorate in range science from the \nUniversity of Idaho, the Idaho Statesman Distinguished Citizens Award, \nand serving as grand marshal of the 2013 Ketchum Wagon Days Parade.\n  As busy as he was, Bud was always a family man. He and his first wife \nMaxine Dahl had three children--Nick, Mark, and Kris. Nick continues \nthe family ranching legacy. In 1952 Bud married Ruth Eccles. Her son \nGordon helped manage the Picabo Store. Throughout the years, Bud \nemployed other family members as well. In fact, you could say the town \nof Picabo is successfully run and managed by the Purdy family.\n  Idaho has lost one of its most beloved and respected citizens, but \nIdaho and our great Nation are better places for the accomplishments \nand contributions of Bud Purdy. The legacy he leaves the world is one \nwe all would do well to emulate.\n  Bud, a grateful Idaho and nation will miss you.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Border Security\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I am returning to the Senate floor to \ntalk once again about the wave of migrant children who are coming \nacross the U.S.-Mexican border unaccompanied by adults. So far this \nyear, since October, 47,000 unaccompanied minors have been detained at \nthe border, most of them coming not from Mexico, which obviously is \ncloser to the United States, but from as far away as Central America \nand beyond.\n  To put this in some context, from Guatemala City, Guatemala, to \nMcAllen, TX, is roughly a trip of 1200 miles. I have spoken many times \nand I will continue to speak to anyone who will listen about the \nhorrific and dangerous conditions these children and other migrants \ntravel just to get to the United States. Thousands of migrant children, \nalmost all of whom come from Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, and \nMexico are currently being held in U.S. military facilities such as \nLackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, TX. While Federal, State, and \nlocal officials try to figure out, No. 1, who they are--find out what \ntheir identity is, because many of them show up without any \nidentification--they try to figure out, well, do they have any \nrelatives here in the United States or possible legal guardians? Then \nthey have to decide what to do with them while their cases are being \nprocessed. Obviously since the majority of them come from countries \nother than Mexico, they cannot just be turned back, particularly in the \ncase of minor children, some of whom have been reported to be as young \nas 5 years old. The average age is roughly 14 years old, but still when \nI describe, as I will today and will continue to do, the horrific \nconditions under which these migrant children travel from Mexico and up \nfrom Central America, no one in their right mind would want to have \ntheir child subjected to that sort of potential and reality of abuse \nand mistreatment.\n  I am glad the President has asked Vice President Joe Biden to travel \nto Central America, but I worry that so far I haven't heard any plan \nwhatsoever that would stop the flow of these unaccompanied children \nfrom Central America and Mexico.\n  As you can imagine, this is a bureaucratic nightmare, trying to \nfigure out how to deal with this mass of humanity coming across the \nborder. In fact, the Border Patrol is spending so much time trying to \ntake care of the humanitarian crisis that they are neglecting some of \ntheir principal responsibilities, which are to stem the flow of illegal \nimmigration and drugs across the border. So this is diverting law \nenforcement from its assigned role just to deal with the temporary \ncrisis. At least I hope it is temporary.\n  The authorities in South Texas and the Rio Grande Valley do not have \nthe resources or the manpower to handle such a massive influx of \nunaccompanied children. In terms of the children who have been released \nfrom U.S. custody, we still don't know how many of their ``temporary \nguardians'' are themselves illegal immigrants. We don't know because I \nassume there is not a background check conducted on them. I hope I am \nwrong. But I hope we don't find out that some of these unaccompanied \nminors are being turned over to relatives who are themselves perhaps \ncriminals or sex offenders. In other words, we have no idea, because \nthe President has not spoken out, what kind of plan there is to make \nsure of the conditions these children are living in or what sort of \npotential abuse they might suffer. It is an awful situation any way you \nlook at it.\n  What makes it even more outrageous is it is directly the result of \nthe impression that President Obama is uninterested in enforcing our \nimmigration laws, specifically his refusal to enforce and his granting \nof so-called deferred action programs he announced in the Rose Garden 2 \nyears ago.\n  To be fair to the President and the Senators who voted for the Senate \nimmigration bill, it would have, if signed into law, granted a deferred \naction for a certain class of minors, so-called DREAM Act kids. But \nnone of these children entering the country currently qualify or would \nqualify for either the President's deferred action order that he issued \nunilaterally or the\n\n[[Page S3701]]\n\nSenate-passed DREAM Act provisions. So we know they are entering in \nviolation of American law, but there are no negative consequences \nassociated with it as long as they are basically accommodated in the \nUnited States.\n  As a result, the number of children entering the country, together \nwith the number of adults, is simply skyrocketing. As I said \npreviously, to start with, it was estimated that 47,000 have been \ndetained so far this year, and that this entire calendar year there \nwill be as many as 60,000. Next year the numbers are expected to double \nto 120,000 children.\n  The fact is this is not just affecting States such as Texas, a border \nState, or even Arizona or California. This is affecting States such as \nVirginia, Maryland, Oklahoma, and other places where the Federal \nGovernment is simply looking for a place to warehouse these children \nwhile it figures out what to do with them.\n  Of course, the ensuing crisis has prompted a fresh debate over \nsecurity conditions at the U.S.-Mexican border. As the debate goes \nforward, it is worth considering exactly what we mean when we talk \nabout border security, because I fear it is a term that is often \nmisunderstood.\n  Border security is not just about catching people along the Rio \nGrande or checkpoints in places such as Falfurrias or Sarita, it is \nalso about deterring potential illegal immigrants from starting out \nfrom their home country on such a dangerous journey in the first place. \nMy friend Congressman Henry Cuellar from Laredo said, for example, when \nyou play football you don't just defend at the goal line; you start 20 \nyards from the goal line, you start at midfield and on the other team's \nturf. So we need to make sure we have a comprehensive approach and a \nplan to deal with illegal immigration into the country, as I said, \nhopefully with the goal in large part of deterring parents from turning \ntheir children over to the hands of the drug cartels and other \ntransnational criminal gangs and sending them on this perilous and \nhorrific journey north to the United States.\n  This journey from Central America to southern Mexico to the U.S. \nborder is one of the most dangerous journeys anywhere in the world. \nIndeed, every single corridor is controlled by transnational criminal \ndrug organizations, including drug smugglers and cartels. They prey on \nthe weakest and most vulnerable people they find. They will rob them, \nthey will sexually assault them, they will kill them if need be in \norder to suit their purposes. Not surprisingly, the ongoing surge of \nCentral American migrants has been an absolute gift to the Mexican drug \ncartels and their gangland affiliates. As an Austin-based immigration \nlawyer told the L.A. Times recently: ``The smugglers are milking this \nsituation for all it's worth.'' This is money in the bank for the drug \ncartels and the human smugglers, the people who prey on the most \nvulnerable people who are smuggled in from Central America and Mexico \nto the United States. That is how they make their money. That is their \nbusiness model, so to speak.\n\n  President Obama has often defended his immigration policies as a \nhumane response to a broken system. I would be among the first to \nacknowledge that America's immigration system is indeed broken, but \nthere is nothing humane about incentivizing people who risk their lives \nand their children's lives by traveling through the most dangerous \nsmuggling corridors in the Western Hemisphere. There is nothing humane \nabout incentivizing people to pay human traffickers for transportation \nthrough Mexico.\n  Yet when the administration deliberately refuses to enforce our \nimmigration laws and talks daily about its investigation into changing \nrepatriation policies, it effectively tells people in Mexico and \nCentral America that if they make it across to the U.S. border they \nwill almost certainly be allowed to stay. When the administration does \nthose things, it is effectively encouraging poor, vulnerable immigrants \nto embark on a treacherous and often deadly journey.\n  As I said, the journey is especially treacherous for young migrant \nwomen and children. The migrant women are frequently raped, kidnapped, \nand sold to sex traffickers. Some experts believe that 6 out of 10 of \nthe migrant women who traverse this dangerous territory are sexually \nassaulted. It is truly appalling and without question one of the worst \nhuman rights nightmares anywhere in our hemisphere. For that matter, it \nis likely getting worse. A new Congressional Research Service memo \nindicates that girls and children below the age of 13 represent a \ngrowing number of unaccompanied minors who are being apprehended at the \nsouthern border. Needless to say, as more and more migrant children \ntravel through Mexico, more will be forced into sex slavery and \nprostitution.\n  I think we all agree that the status quo is simply intolerable and \nunacceptable.\n  So what is the solution? Well, I spent the past couple of days urging \nthe President to take a few basic steps that would help curtail the \nseemingly endless flow of unaccompanied minors up through this \ndangerous smuggling corridor. The steps I have outlined I think reflect \ncommon sense. For starters, the President of the United States must \nmake it abundantly clear to everyone that his deferred action program \non deportation does not apply to the children who are now streaming \nacross our border in floodlike proportions. If the President himself \nwere to make such an announcement, it would get noticed.\n  Right now Central American newspapers as well as the criminal cartels \nare actively spreading the word that if you turn yourselves over to us \nand pay our price to get smuggled into the United States, you can get \nfree passage and stay, because they are saying you will not be \nrepatriated.\n  If the President also worked with the Mexican Government to help \nsecure its southern border with Guatemala--that border is about 500 \nmiles long and it is currently the place the migrants come from Central \nAmerica into Mexico to begin that long, perilous journey, many on a \ntrain system that has become known as The Beast or The Beast of Death, \nwhich has been written about a lot. If the President were to help \nprovide Mexico, in consultation with our Mexican friends, a way to help \nsecure that border, it would help stem more than half the flow of \nmigrants including these unaccompanied children from Central America. \nAnd if the President sent the message, contrary to what he has done \nrecently, that he is committed to enforcing all of our immigration laws \nuntil Congress and the President can engage in our constitutionally \nrequired process of amending those laws, then the tide of children \nflooding across South Texas might soon be reversed.\n  I wish I had confidence that President Obama would take the actions I \nhave described. His record on immigration and border security, \nunfortunately, inspires no confidence that he will.\n  To reiterate, once again, solving this crisis isn't simply about \nsecuring America's southern border. It is not just about goal-line \ndefense, in the words of Congressman Cuellar, it is about enforcing our \nimmigration laws. It is about saving mothers and daughters, fathers and \nsons, from contact with some of the most brutal criminal organizations \non the planet.\n  I hope the President is listening. I am encouraged that Vice \nPresident Biden is traveling to the region, but, of course, we know \nthat Central America, the government there, has deteriorated to the \npoint that it has become an increasingly dangerous place. That is \nanother one of the arguments that is made, that people are simply \nfleeing from violence in those Central American countries. I certainly \nam sympathetic, but the fact is the United States cannot absorb people \nfrom every part of the globe who want to come to the United States \nwithout imperiling our way of life. So what we need to do is find a way \nto control immigration through legal channels, and we need to send the \nmessage to other countries that you cannot come here with impunity and \nsimply overwhelm our ability in the United States to take care of legal \nimmigrants.\n  The President can do a lot. Sending Vice President Biden to Central \nAmerica is a start, but what we need is a plan along the lines I have \noutlined in order to stem this humanitarian crisis that is occurring \nnot just in South Texas but is being spread to Virginia, Maryland, \nOklahoma, Arizona, and California, because that is where these children \nare being sent in the custody\n\n[[Page S3702]]\n\nof the Federal Government--basically in warehouses or it occurs to me \nthat this is more like a refugee camp on American soil. This is not the \nway we would want our children to live, and this is not the way we \nshould want other parents' children to live. We will take care of them \nto the best of our ability while they are here, but what we need is an \nunequivocal message that says America does not have an open border and \nthat parents should not turn their children over to these dangerous \ndrug cartels and human smugglers in order to come to the United States.\n\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Veterans Health Care\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, what the recent crisis at the Veterans' \nAdministration has taught us is that the cost of war does not end when \nthe last shots are fired and the last missiles are launched. The cost \nof war continues until the last veteran receives the care and benefits \nthat he or she has earned on the battlefield. In other words, the cost \nof war is very expensive. It is expensive in terms of human life, in \nterms of human suffering, and in terms of financial commitment.\n  The cost of war in Iraq and Afghanistan alone is almost 7,000 dead. \nThe cost of war is some 200,000 men and women coming home from those \nwars with post-traumatic stress disorder or traumatic brain injury. The \ncost of war from Iraq and Afghanistan is that many of our veterans have \ncome home without arms or legs or eyesight or without their hearing. \nThe cost of war is tragic suicides taking place all over this country \nfrom people who have returned from war.\n  The cost of war is veterans coming home unable to find jobs and get \ntheir feet back on the ground financially. The cost of war is high \ndivorce rates and the impact that family stress has on kids. The cost \nof war is widows suddenly having to start their life anew without the \nperson they married at their side.\n  Two weeks ago Senator McCain and I hammered together a proposal to \ndeal with the current crisis at the VA, and I thank him very much for \nunderstanding the need to move forward expeditiously.\n  Last Wednesday this legislation passed the Senate by a vote of 93 to \n3, and I thank all of the Members in both political parties for voting \nfor this bill. I thank them for understanding that we need to continue \nmoving forward on this legislation as quickly as possible and in a \nnonpartisan way.\n  A recent VA audit revealed that more than 57,000 veterans are waiting \nto be scheduled for medical appointments. They are in facilities where \nthe waiting lists are much too long. That, to my mind, is clearly an \nemergency situation.\n  I thank all of those Senators who not only voted to pass this bill \nbut, perhaps more importantly, voted to pay for this bill through \nemergency funding. I could not agree more with Senator McCain when he \nsaid:\n\n       If there is a definition of emergency, I would say that \n     this legislation fits that. It is an emergency. It is an \n     emergency what is happening to our veterans and the men and \n     women who have served this country. And we need to pass this \n     legislation and get it in conference with the House as soon \n     as possible.\n\n  I fully agree with Senator McCain's sentiment. Madam President, 93 \nSenators--in a strong bipartisan showing--agreed with Senator McCain \nand me that this is an emergency, that veterans must get the quality \nhealth care they need, and they must get it in a timely manner. We need \nto provide the funding the VA needs and do it in an expeditious way.\n  Needless to say, the bill we passed in the Senate is a compromise. It \nis not the bill I know Senator McCain would have written alone, and it \nis surely not the bill I would have written if I could have had the \npower to write it alone. It is a compromise that was hammered out in \ngood faith, which is something we need to see more of in this body.\n  What this bill does is address the immediate crisis facing the VA of \nlong waiting periods and makes certain that as soon as possible, the \nveterans of our country get the high-quality care they need and they \nget it in a timely fashion. That is what our veterans deserve.\n  I will briefly touch on some of the major provisions in the bill. \nThis bill allows for 26 major medical facility leases, which means \nimproved and expanded care for veterans in 17 States and Puerto Rico. \nThere has been some disagreement about a 27th facility located in \nOklahoma. That facility was in the original bill I introduced, and I \nsupported its inclusion in final passage.\n  This bill also provides for the expedited hiring of VA doctors and \nnurses and $500 million targeted to hire those providers with \nunobligated funds. No medical program can provide quality care in a \ntimely manner if those programs do not have an adequate number of \ndoctors, nurses, and other medical providers.\n  This bill will provide an opportunity for the VA to immediately \nincrease capacity within their system. It will provide an expedited \nhiring authority to allow VA to quickly hire doctors and nurses, which \nis not the case right now. One of the problems with the VA is they have \na very complicated process. It takes a whole lot of time, and they \noften lose their applicants because it takes such a long period of \ntime. We need to change that, and this bill does that.\n  Right now there are 741 vacancy announcements for physician positions \nat VA on USAJOBS. My understanding is that is a flaw. In fact, the real \nnumber of physicians needed is significantly greater than that. In \nPhoenix alone there have been estimates that up to 500 new providers in \nthat one facility alone--and those are doctors, nurses, and other \nhealth care providers--are needed if the veterans in Phoenix are going \nto have timely care.\n  Further, what our legislation also does is say to veterans around the \ncountry that if they cannot get into a VA facility in a timely manner, \nthey will be able to get the care they need outside of the VA. In my \nview, what we need to do is hire those doctors, nurses, and supporting \nstaff so veterans who come to the VA can get timely care there, but if \nthey cannot get to a VA facility, this legislation is very clear in \nstating that they can go to private doctors, community health centers, \nDepartment of Defense bases or Indian health care facilities.\n  The goal is to give veterans a wide option to access care in a timely \nmanner through providers in their communities. If the VA is unable to \naccommodate those veterans, they are going to go outside of the VA and \nget timely health care, and that is a very important provision in this \nbill.\n  This bill also says veterans who live 40 miles or more from a VA \nfacility--if they choose--also have the option of seeking care outside \nof the VA. For those veterans living in very rural areas--and I have \ntalked to one Senator who indicated that in some cases a veteran has to \ntravel hundreds and hundreds of miles to get VA health care--this \nprovision will also be very important.\n  The bill also addresses a major crisis we have seen in the military; \nthat is, the tragedy and the outrage of sexual assault. Our bill will \nsignificantly increase VA services for those veterans who experienced \nsexual assault in the military.\n  This bill also deals with an issue--where there is widespread support \nacross partisan lines--instate tuition for all veterans at public \ncolleges and universities. This bill also importantly provides that \nsurviving spouses--mostly wives who have lost their husbands in \nbattle--will also be eligible for the post-9/11 GI bill, and that is \nexactly the right thing to do.\n  This bill also establishes commissions to provide help to give the VA \nin terms of improving schedule capabilities and capital planning. These \nare areas, frankly, where the VA has not been strong. They can use \nprivate sector and expert help so they can improve their scheduling \ncapabilities and their ability to do capital planning.\n  Finally, and importantly, this bill gives the Secretary the authority \nto immediately fire incompetent employees or those who have falsified \nor manipulated data in terms of waiting periods. All of us have been \noutraged that people have intentionally manipulated data to make it \nappear that veterans\n\n[[Page S3703]]\n\nhave been getting timely care when that was not the case.\n  Our bill gives the Secretary the ability to fire those employees and \nother incompetent employees and it also provides due process. I think \nthat is important because I do not want to see the VA politicized. I \ndon't want to see a President coming into office with a new Secretary \nfiring 300 or 400 top-level supervisors. We do not want to see the VA \npoliticized. We want the best people regardless of their political \nviews.\n  The House of Representatives passed legislation last week which \ncovers a lot of the same ground the Sanders-McCain bill covers, and I \nam very confident that in working with chairman Jeff Miller and ranking \nmember Mike Michaud, we can bridge the differences and send the \nPresident a bill he can sign in the very near future. I think that is \nwhat the American people want. That is what Members of Congress want. \nWe do not want this to drag on and on and on. We want to get this bill \ndone quickly.\n\n  Finally, I did want to say a word to the 300,000 employees who work \nat the VA. These last several months have been a tough time for many of \nthem. The truth is the overwhelming majority of the people who work at \nthe VA are hard-working, honest, and serious people. In fact, many of \nthem are veterans themselves. I know many others who work at the VA \nlook at what they do not as a job--a 9-to-5 job--but they look at it as \na mission. They feel very seriously that our veterans have to get the \nbest health care possible, and they are doing their best to make that \nhappen. I thank them very much for that.\n  Over and over, I hear from my State of Vermont and from across the \ncountry that once veterans get into the VA health care system, the care \nis good. That is not just my view; it is the view of virtually all of \nthe major veterans organizations and independent studies that compare \nVA health care with care in the private sector.\n  In the State of Vermont some 98 percent of veterans get appointments \ninto the system within 30 days. That is good, but it needs to be better \nin Vermont and throughout this country. The goal must be the highest \nquality care possible and getting people their appointments in a timely \nmanner.\n  Let me read, interestingly enough, a poll that just came out from \nGallup today. It was published today, and it was commissioned by \nMarketWatch from the Wall Street Journal. The interesting paragraph \nhere--they polled some 42,000-plus Americans regarding their \nsatisfaction with health care in America. Let me quote what the article \nsays:\n\n       Despite recent troubles with veterans not having access to \n     prompt medical appointments, current and former military \n     personnel are the most satisfied with their health care, as \n     77% expressed contentment. That was the highest satisfaction \n     rate among those broken out by method of coverage.\n\n  Veterans, obviously, get their health care in other ways--not just \nthrough the VA--but it is important to recognize that for many, many \nveterans the health care they are getting is good, and they appreciate \nthat.\n  Let me conclude by saying our job right now--and I think the American \npeople are with us on this virtually 100 percent--is to make sure those \nmen and women who have put their lives on the line to defend us--they \nare now asking us to defend them, to make sure they get the health care \nand the benefits to which they are entitled. My goal is to see that we \nmove this legislation as quickly as possible. I hope by tomorrow we \nwill have named conferees to the conference committee. My hope is we \ncan get this legislation on to the President's desk as soon as we \npossibly can.\n  It is one thing to give heartfelt speeches about how much we love and \nrespect veterans; it is another to act, and now is the time for action. \nThe Senate and House committee staffs have already begun preliminary \ndiscussions. My understanding is the House conferees will be named \ntomorrow. I believe we will do the same here in the Senate. My job and \nwhat I intend to work on as hard as I can is to make sure we pass \nstrong legislation as soon as we possibly can and have the President \nsign that legislation.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Immigration Reform\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, just a few minutes ago the Senator from \nTexas, my friend John Cornyn, came to the floor and spoke about \nimmigration and the situation on our border. It was a very moving \nstatement that he has made before and needs to make again. He did it \ntoday and identified a serious issue we are facing--not just one but \nseveral serious issues. They are dramatized by the fact that we are \nseeing hundreds of children who are being turned loose on America's \nborder with Mexico crossing the border, being apprehended, and being \nplaced in a humane situation in America--children, some as young as 5, \n6, and 7 years of age, not accompanied by adults. You think to \nyourself, what is going on here?\n  Senator Cornyn, of course, representing the State of Texas, knows \nthis better than most because they are watching these children.\n  Eighty percent of these children come from three countries: Honduras, \nEl Salvador, and Guatemala. In these countries there is a state of \nlawlessness at this point that is so desperate--so desperate--that a \nfamily would turn over a child to someone who says: I will get them \nacross the American border.\n  Some of these kids show up--I do not know how many; I cannot tell \nyou--with little slips of paper with a name and a telephone number of a \nrelative in the United States. Think about that for a second. How \ndesperate would a family have to be to turn over a 5-year-old, a 6-or \n7-year-old child to someone and say: Take them hundreds of miles and \nenter illegally into the United States of America with my little girl \nor my little boy. I cannot even imagine the desperation that people are \nfacing that they would do such a thing.\n  That represents a major problem for the United States at several \nlevels.\n  First, we are a humane and caring nation. We will not see a child \nabandoned at the border and turn our backs. What we are doing is taking \nthese children into protective custody, trying to find a way to link \nthem with some member of their family for their own good. Imagine the \ntrauma these kids have gone through at that point and now what they \nmight face. That is why we are stepping forward.\n  Senator Cornyn came to the floor, and he rightfully said that many of \nthese children do not make these journeys unharmed. Terrible things \nhappen to them. Awful things happen to them--assaults, rapes, beatings, \nand God only knows. You think to yourself, what impact will that trauma \nhave on that child for such a long period of time?\n  The lawlessness in these three countries is leading to this \noutmigration for safety, this desperation by many families and parents.\n  The second aspect is one that we cannot ignore either. Many children \ncome into the United States, and some of them come in the most extreme \nsituations for a very basic human reason--children who were raised in \nother countries and their parents are in the United States. They have \nnot seen them sometimes for years. They have received cash to keep them \ngoing under the care of another relative, gifts at Christmas, gifts for \ntheir birthday. But some of these kids--these little kids--will jump on \nthese freight trains and go through Central America toward the United \nStates in the hope of finding a parent. I cannot tell you the exact \nnumbers.\n  There is a book that won the Pulitzer Prize called ``Enrique's \nJourney.'' A woman named Nazario who writes for the L.A. Times went \ndown to Central America, got on one of these trains with these kids, \nwho sit on top of these freight cars as they go through these countries \ntrying to get to the United States. Many of them--she believes the \nmajority of them--are simply trying to be reunited with their parents.\n  Listen to the tragedy in what I have just described. Think about the \ndesperation of families and the desperation of these children and where \nit puts us in the world today, and reflect for a moment on a political \nreality that did not come up in the earlier statement. The political \nreality is that it has been\n\n[[Page S3704]]\n\nmore than 1 year since the Senate passed a comprehensive immigration \nreform bill with 68 votes, 14 Republicans joining the Democrats in a \nbipartisan effort.\n  I know a little bit about this bill because I joined the group who \nwrote it, four Democrats, four Republicans, sitting across the table--\non our side, Chuck Schumer of New York, Bob Menendez of New Jersey, \nMike Bennet of Colorado; on the Republican side, John McCain of \nArizona, Jeff Flake of Arizona, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and \nMarco Rubio of Florida. We sat in this room--many rooms, I should say--\nover a period of months and hammered out a comprehensive bill that \ndeals with many of the issues that are behind the tragedy I just \ndescribed. That is something we ought to acknowledge is part of our \nchallenge today, that 1 year has gone by and the House of \nRepresentatives has refused to even call this bill for consideration.\n  I am pretty proud of what we did and what we wrote. I do not think \nthere are many pieces of legislation that bipartisan that have the \nsupport of business and labor and religious groups of every \ndenomination. They all support our bill. I am proud of that fact.\n  I served in the House. I know they have some pride of authorship. \nThey may want to do their version of the bill. That is OK. But doing \nnothing is not OK. It is not acceptable. We have a broken immigration \nsystem. Senator Cornyn of Texas said as much himself.\n  If we are going to deal with the problem at the border with these \nchildren, if we are going to deal with the problem of 11 million or \nmore undocumented people in America--many of whom have been here for \nlong periods of time, may live in a household where everyone else in \nthe house is an American citizen, and I know of these cases in Chicago; \nI have met them--people who are willing to come forward at this point \nin their lives, register with the government, tell the government where \nthey live, where they work, have a background check so that if they \nhave serious criminal issues they are gone, stay in this country, pay \ntheir taxes, pay a fine for being undocumented, learn English, and wait \n13 years at the earliest before they can become citizens, and they go \nto the absolute back of the line--that is what our bill says. That, to \nme, is a movement toward a solution of what we are facing today.\n  But I hear many times criticism of this President. I will tell you, \nthis President has been fully supportive of this effort for \ncomprehensive immigration reform. I cannot tell you how many hours I \nhave spent with him and so many others trying to work toward this goal. \nI know, because he used to be my junior Senator from Illinois and we \nare pretty close. I know that when he was going through the transition \nto become President, he invited Senators McCain and Graham to meet with \nhim in Chicago before he was sworn in. They talked about immigration. \nThat is how important it is to this President. So those who would blame \nhim or dismiss him for the current situation, it is not fair. He \nsupports comprehensive immigration reform.\n  He said to the House of Representatives and the Republican leadership \nthat he will step back in terms of doing anything on an executive level \nand give them the opportunity to do what they are supposed to do--call \nthis matter for a vote. We are praying they do it before the end of \nJuly because we are running out of time. In just a few months there \nwill be an election and then a lameduck session between the election \nand the new Congress. Not much can get done in that period of time.\n  The President has said to Speaker Boehner and the Republicans: Move \nthe bill. So when I hear the criticism of some of the terrible \ninjustices in our current immigration system, I think we ought to be \nvery honest. We have passed a bill--a bipartisan bill, a comprehensive \nbill--in the Senate, and it has been sitting in the House for more than \na year. More than a year.\n  I came to this issue, like most, with a family story. I have told my \nfamily story on the floor many times, but I am proud of it, so I am \ngoing to repeat it.\n  My mother was an immigrant to this country. She came to America, \nbrought here at the age of 2. She was brought from Lithuania. My \ngrandmother packed her up with my aunt and uncle and brought them over \nin a ship. They landed in Baltimore and somehow got on a train to St. \nLouis. They were headed for their great opportunity in America, their \nland of opportunity, the town I was born in, East St. Louis, IL. That \nis where I came from. That is where they landed because the Lithuanians \nwere there working in the packing houses and the steel mills and all of \nthe jobs that immigrants take.\n  That is my story. That is my family's story. But that is also \nAmerica's story. Those immigrants who come here and take the dirtiest, \nhardest jobs, work night and day trying to make sure their kids have \nanother chance, create time and again generations of renewal in \nAmerica.\n  There is something in our DNA, my friends--all of us who are proud to \nsay we are Americans--there is something in our DNA about that \nimmigrant spirit, to think that my family and millions of others said: \nWe are leaving Jurbarkas, Lithuania, and we are going to America, where \nwe do not even speak the language.\n  What an adventure. What courage. What Americanism. That is what \ncreates us. That is in our national DNA. Thank goodness it is.\n  There is something else I would like to note. It has been 2 years \nsince President Obama issued an Executive order. It was known as the \nDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, DACA.\n  Here is the history. Thirteen years ago I got a call in my Chicago \noffice from a Korean mother who said she had a problem. She had brought \nher daughter to the United States at the age of 2 on a visitor's visa. \nHer daughter was now grown up, 18 years of age. She had never filed any \npapers for her. Technically mom, who was here legally as a citizen, had \nan undocumented child in her house.\n  The problem was that this undocumented girl had turned out to be a \nspectacular pianist and had won an opportunity for scholarships to the \nJuilliard School of Music and the New York Conservatory of Music. She \nwas that good. When she went to fill out the application, they asked \nher for her citizenship. She turned to her mom and said: What am I?\n  Her mom said: I don't know.\n  The girl said: What are you going to do?\n  Mom said: Let's call Durbin.\n  So they called my office. We checked the law. The law was very clear. \nThat little girl who had been in the United States for 16 or 17 years \nat that point in her life was undocumented and under the law had to \nleave the United States for 10 years and apply to come back in. That is \nhow the law was written.\n  I thought to myself: That is not fair. That little girl did not have \nany say in her parents moving here. She had nothing to say when they \nfailed to file the necessary papers. Now she was the victim of our \nlegal system and her parents' failure to file the papers so she could \nbe here legally.\n  So I introduced the DREAM Act. The DREAM Act I introduced 13 years \nago said: If you are in that kind of a circumstance--brought here as a \nchild by your parents, have lived in the United States, finished high \nschool, no serious criminal record--we will give you a chance. Either \nenlist in our military or go to college for at least 2 years, and we \nwill put you on the path to citizenship.\n  That is the DREAM Act. Well, that bill has been around a long time--\n13 years. It has passed in the Senate as part of a comprehensive bill, \nand it has passed in the House individually. But it has never passed in \nboth places, which, as we know, is what is necessary to become a law.\n\n  So I wrote to President Obama, with 22 of my colleagues--that at one \npoint included Senator Lugar of Indiana, my Republican colleague then--\nand asked the President: Create an Executive order so these young \npeople eligible for the DREAM Act will not be deported while we debate. \nGive them a chance to be here in a legally recognized status because \nthey would qualify under this bill that continues to pass--the Deferred \nAction for Childhood Arrivals. That, of course, was enacted by the \nPresident in Executive order 2 years ago.\n  After it was enacted, Congressman Luis Gutieerrez and I--in Chicago--\nsaid: We want to give all of those eligible to apply for this deferred \naction\n\n[[Page S3705]]\n\nprotection under the Executive order a chance to sign up.\n  So Luis and I said: We are going to reserve Navy Pier--if you have \never been to Chicago, there is a huge ballroom at the end of Navy Pier, \none of the most popular sites in downtown--and we are going to invite \nany young person who wants to sign up for DACA so they won't be \ndeported to come in and sign up.\n  I said initially: I hope we get 200 people to come because we have a \nbig room here.\n  In the end over 10,000 showed up. It overwhelmed us. We had volunteer \nlawyers there, lots of friends there, and people helping. Parents got \nin line at midnight the night before, standing with their kids and \nwaiting for a chance to give these kids a chance to be legally in the \nUnited States and not deported; that is how much it meant to them.\n  Some of these parents, sadly, didn't have the same protection, but \nthey wanted to do everything they could for their kids. Well, the time \nhas passed, and in the course of time we have seen 560,000 children \nacross America who signed up for this protection under DACA--560,000.\n  I have come to the floor and told about 50 or 60 stories about these \nDREAMers. We call them DREAMers--these young kids. Each time I tell the \nstory, I get responses from people saying: I can't believe that we \nstill haven't resolved this problem.\n  I want to tell you one of these stories today. I want to update you \nabout one of the DREAMers I have spoken about on the floor.\n  This is Erika Andiola and her mother Guadalupe Arreola. Guadalupe's \nhusband--Erika's father--abused her for 15 years. In order to escape \nthis abuse and protect her kids, she fled to the United States.\n  Free from threats of violence, Guadalupe and her children made life \nin this country. Her daughter Erika graduated with honors from Arizona \nState University with a bachelor's degree in psychology. She is the \nfounder and president of the Arizona DREAM Act Coalition, a group \nadvocating for immigration reform.\n  After receiving DACA, her protection under the President's Executive \norder, Erika became the first DREAMer to work for the Congress. She \ncould legally do it under the President's order. She served as district \noutreach director for Congresswoman Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona. I might \nadd that Congressman Gutieerrez also hired one of the earliest DREAMers \nunder DACA on his staff as well.\n  The same week that Erika was hired to work for a Member of Congress, \nthey received notice that her mother was being placed in deportation \nproceedings. Why were we trying to deport Erika's mother, Guadalupe? \nBecause she was pulled over for a traffic violation and she had a \ndeportation order that was 15 years old.\n  Erika made a difficult decision. She gave up her job with the \nCongresswoman and started focusing on helping her mom. Her mother wrote \nme a letter and said:\n\n       I have always taught my children that there is nothing more \n     important than the love for our families. . . . I ask \n     Congress and the President to realize that I am a human being \n     who was just looking to protect my children from a life full \n     of violence.\n\n  There are 11 million undocumented immigrants like Guadalupe in the \nUnited States. They are hard-working men and women with courage who \nleave everything behind they know to build a better life. They have \nstrong family values, and they make a real contribution to our country \nand our economy. They serve our food in restaurants. They clean off the \ntables when we are finished eating. They take care of our small \nchildren in daycare, and they watch our parents in nursing homes. That \nis who the undocumented are in America.\n  They raise children like Erika and make contributions to our country. \nThey want to be Americans. But under current law, there is no way for \nthem to get in line and legalized.\n  Last week the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Jeh \nJohnson, was kind enough to come to Chicago. I invited him. I wanted \nhim to see the Broadview processing facility, where those who are about \nto face deportation are held. It is a grim reminder of families that \nare being broken up right before our eyes. I wanted him also to meet \nwith people in the Muslim community, in the Syrian community, in the \nHispanic communities, and talk about immigration in America today. He \nwas kind enough to do that.\n  Along with my colleagues, Congressmen Luis Gutieerrez and Bill \nFoster, we visited the center. We met in the detention cells a 51-year-\nold man who came to the United States at the age of 6. He has three \nkids who are U.S. citizens. One now serves in the U.S. Army and another \nis a police officer. In the visitation area outside, we met his mother, \nwho is 80 years old. She was hoping to get a glimpse of her son before \nhe was deported.\n  This is the human impact of immigration laws and policies. The House \nof Representatives has a chance to fix this and many other problems. We \ncan move together to stop this horrible humanitarian crisis at the \nborder with children. We can move together to deal with the \nundocumented among us who will step forward, pay their taxes and their \nfines, learn English, go to the back of the line and wait their turns. \nWe will be a better country if we do.\n  I hope the House Republicans will take up this responsibility. If \nthey have a better idea, bring it to the floor and vote on it but, if \nnot, call up our bipartisan Senate bill. Let's fix this broken \nimmigration system. Let's move this country forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Unanimous Consent Request--S. Res. 469\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. I rise today to put the Senate on record on something \nvery important, and that is speaking to the decision by the Obama \nadministration to release five top Taliban leaders from Guantanamo Bay \nwithout consulting Congress, as required by law--a decision that I \nbelieve endangers the lives of American personnel, not to mention the \ncountless Afghans and the success of our mission in Afghanistan.\n  It has been well reported in the press that this release was done \nwithout consulting Congress or congressional leaders on either side of \nthe aisle--Republican or Democrat, by the way. This was in clear \nviolation of a requirement to provide detailed notice to Congress \nbefore such action is taken--a requirement that is contained in both an \nauthorization bill called the 2004 National Defense Authorization Act \nand a spending bill, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014, both of \nwhich passed Congress with big bipartisan majorities. Both were \nbipartisan bills, and there was a bipartisan consensus about having \nthis notification.\n\n  Despite several closed-door briefings and public comments from the \nadministration since we learned of the release, the administration has \nbeen unable to provide any legitimate justification for violating the \nrequirement and for failing to consult with Congress.\n  I believe the President's conduct raises a lot of questions--\nquestions which should concern every Member of this body on both sides \nof the aisle.\n  This is not a partisan issue, nor is it about what kind of soldier \nSGT Bowe Bergdahl may have been. I trust the Army will handle that \nmatter appropriately. This is about our role in the Congress, and it is \nabout our national security. It is about protecting our men and women \nin Afghanistan. It is about ensuring that what they have fought for in \nthe last decade and the gains they have made in our war against \nterrorism and for the people in Afghanistan will not be squandered, as \nwe are seeing today in the country of Iraq.\n  Congress enacted the bipartisan notice requirement to secure those \ninterests and to prevent the release of dangerous terrorists who are \nlikely to rejoin the fight if they are freed. It requires the President \nto give a detailed justification for the release of detainees from \nGuantanamo Bay, why such a release is in the country's national \nsecurity interests, and what actions the administration will take to \nensure that\n\n[[Page S3706]]\n\nthose released detainees do not return to the battlefield to threaten \nAmerican lives--basically asking the administration to notify us, but \nto also provide a justification for the release and the conditions of \nthat release.\n  Had the President followed the law, I believe many of the dangers \nposed by this decision could have been avoided altogether. I think he \nwould have heard on a bipartisan basis the concerns of the Congress, \nwhich were only voiced after the decisions were made, again, on both \nsides of the aisle.\n  Make no mistake, these five men who were released are dangerous. \nDon't take my word for it. This is what the administration has said \nrepeatedly. I was in a hearing before the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee in 2012. I was a member of the committee at that time. \nSenator Levin, my colleague and chairman of the committee, who is here \non the floor with us today, was at that committee hearing. In fact, he \nasked some very good questions, including questions to the President's \nown Director of National Intelligence James Clapper.\n  What did Mr. Clapper say? He reiterated a 2010 administration \nassessment that these five Taliban leaders--these same five who were \njust released--posed a high risk of returning to the fight.\n  On this very point, Director Clapper did not equivocate, saying:\n\n       I do not think anyone harbors any illusions about these \n     five Taliban members and what they might do if they were \n     transferred.\n\n  This was sworn testimony before our committee. Even if, as the \nPresident admits, there is ``absolutely a risk that these men will \nreturn to the battlefield,'' these men were senior members of the \nTaliban. They include the Taliban's deputy defense minister, deputy \nminister of intelligence, administrator of the interior, and some were \nclosely associated with Osama bin Laden or Al Qaeda. Two are wanted by \nthe United Nations for war crimes.\n  Yet despite these red flags--which, according to reports from the \npress, were reiterated during internal White House debates of the \ntransfer--President Obama released these men anyway without following \nthe notice provided in the law.\n  We need to know why. We need to know what security risks these five \nindividuals pose. We need to know what measures have been put in place \nto mitigate those risks. I don't know why any Member of this body would \noppose going on record saying that the law was violated and seeking \nanswers to these good questions.\n  In a moment I am going to ask for unanimous consent on a resolution \nwhich I have offered and many of my colleagues have cosponsored calling \non Congress, through regular order and committee jurisdiction, to \ninvestigate the decision to authorize this release. This resolution has \na very narrow purpose: It only seeks to ensure that, when Congress \nspeaks, the President listens. I would remind us that this provision on \nGuantanamo transfer passed in an overwhelming bipartisan manner.\n  This is not an issue of politics. No matter what party the President \nis from, our entire constitutional balance depends on adherence to the \nrule of law. This is about more than the President ignoring Congress. \nThe American people are the ones who deserve these answers. We are \ntheir representatives. That is why that provision was put in place, so \nthat we, representing them, could give the President better advice.\n  The American people deserve these answers. So do, by the way, our men \nand women in uniform who continue to put their lives on the line for us \nevery single day.\n  Already this month, since the release of these detainees, eight \nAmerican servicemen have lost their lives in Afghanistan. We still have \nover 30,000 troops in the theater--30,000 Americans putting their lives \non the line for us every day. I think a lot of them are wondering: What \nwas the justification? Why? What effect will it have on them and their \nsafety? One could hardly doubt that the administration's decision to \nrelease these Taliban leaders will put even more Americans at risk.\n  We should be under no illusions: If we take no action, I do not \nbelieve this will be the last unlawful transfer of detainees from \nGuantanamo Bay back to the battlefield.\n  In other words, if we don't speak and go on record to say: Wait a \nminute; we had a law here; this is wrong; we need a detailed \njustification--I believe the wrong message will be sent to the \nadministration. The sense is Congress didn't seem to care that we \nviolated the authorization bill, the appropriations bill, and went \nahead without providing the appropriate notice.\n  President Obama has made it clear that closing Guantanamo is one of \nhis top priorities in the waning days of his administration. I \nunderstand that. But he has provided no such clarity on what he intends \nto do with the dangerous men who are housed there--men such as Khalid \nShaikh Mohammed, the principal architect of the 9/11 attacks. He is \nthere. Will he be released? Into whose custody? The terrorist known as \nHambali, the mastermind of the Bali bombing that killed 200 people, \nincluding 7 Americans; Ramsey bin Al-Shabab, a high-ranking Al Qaeda \noperative who helped coordinate the 9/11 attacks.\n  We also need to remember why we went to Afghanistan in the first \nplace. Before 9/11, under Taliban rule the country had become a haven \nfor Al Qaeda, a power base for Osama bin Laden, and a place from which \nto plan and launch attacks against the United States and our allies. We \nwent to Afghanistan to seek justice for those who died on September 11, \nbut we also went to remove the Taliban from power, to free the Afghan \npeople, and to ensure that Afghanistan never again becomes this base, \nthis platform for terrorist activity which threatens us. We must not be \nblind to the fact that the Taliban aims to regain as much power as they \ncan in Afghanistan and in Pakistan. That means a return to oppression, \nhuman rights abuses, the suppression of women's rights and, \nmost importantly to us and our national security, the complicit \nharboring of their ally Al Qaeda. We have just returned to them the \nleadership team to help them achieve that goal.\n\n  President Obama tells us the war in Afghanistan is coming to an end. \nWe need to ensure that end is one of sustainable victory, not defeat. \nThe deteriorating situation we see unfolding before us on our TV sets \nin Iraq today demonstrates what can happen when we rush to the exits \nwithout preparing for an appropriate exit.\n  Today, the black flag of radical Islam flies over the second largest \ncity in Iraq, and armed militants are advancing on Baghdad. Proclaiming \nvictory in Iraq did not make it so.\n  Many made it clear that if we failed to maintain appropriate forces \nin Iraq to help the government transition and establish its authority, \nthe long-term stability of Iraq would be open to threats and radical \ngroups. We chose not to complete a status-of-forces agreement with the \nMaliki government. President Obama did not heed the warnings from those \nwho saw these threats, and unfortunately we are seeing some of these \npredictions come true. Whatever we do in Afghanistan, I hope we learn \nfrom the lessons of Iraq.\n  The decisions to release high-ranking members of the Taliban while \nthe fight against the Taliban continues to this day has shaken the \ntrust of the American people, the trust of the Afghan people, and it \nopens the frightening possibility that what we are seeing today in Iraq \nmay be a foreshadowing of Afghanistan's future.\n  In my view, Congress has the responsibility to get to the bottom of \nhow this release happened and to ensure it doesn't happen again. I hope \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle will support the resolution I \nhave submitted so we can fulfill that responsibility.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Armed Services Committee be \ndischarged from further consideration of S. Res. 469; that the Senate \nproceed to its consideration; that the resolution be agreed to, the \npreamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be considered and \nlaid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I do intend to object to the resolution for \na number of reasons.\n  First of all, the resolution prejudges the very conclusion that the \nresolution\n\n[[Page S3707]]\n\nsays it wants an investigation to determine. It calls for an \ninvestigation, but then it already concludes that the President \nviolated the law. That is not what I call an impartial investigation. \nThat is a resolution which reaches a conclusion prejudging the very \ninvestigation it calls for.\n  There are other problems here as well. My good friend from Ohio said \nthe President violated the law because he didn't give 30 days notice to \nCongress. Indeed, the National Defense Authorization Act provides for \n30 days notice. But it also is a matter of fact the President said, \nwhen he signed the National Defense Authorization Act, that if there \nwere necessary circumstances where there were negotiations going on \nwith foreign countries or foreign people in terms of preserving or \nsaving an American life that he is not going to be bound by 30 days \nnotice. He said that at the signing ceremony.\n  You can't change a law at a signing ceremony, but what you can do at \na signing ceremony is what this President did: At the very signing \nceremony for the very act the Senator is relying on, the President put \nus on notice that there could be circumstances under which he could not \ngive 30 days notice to the Congress.\n  When he did not give 30 days notice in this circumstance, he did it \non the advice of counsel. The Department of Justice told him that he \nhas powers, as Commander in Chief, under article II. That is part of \nthe law of this land. The law of this land includes the National \nDefense Authorization Act. As a matter of fact, the Presiding Officer \nis very much aware of the fact that the National Defense Authorization \nAct, of which he is so important a part, is part of the law of this \nland. But so is article II of the Constitution, which gives the \nCommander in Chief certain powers, and the Department of Justice said \nhe could use those powers to not give 30 days notice because it could \njeopardize the life of an American citizen.\n  Maybe there are those who argue that is OK, follow the authorization \nlaw instead of article II, because the authorization law somehow or \nanother has precedence over article II, which it doesn't. Article II is \npart of the Constitution. But the authorization act itself was said to \nbe subject to article II powers of the President when he signed the \nvery act.\n  So what happened? The President decided, because of the exigencies of \nthese circumstances--whether you agree or don't agree with the details \nof the deal, that is one issue. People can disagree with that all they \nwant. But as to whether once the President decided he was going to make \nthat deal and save that life and not jeopardize that life by waiting 30 \ndays, at that point the question is, was that illegal? That is what a \ncourt could decide if it so chose as to whether a President could use \narticle II powers in order to act quickly to save an American life.\n  I think that prejudging this kind of an issue with the kind of \ninvestigation that would prejudge it--because that is part of the \nresolution itself--is not what this Senate should be doing.\n  By the way, during that 30-day period the President would have had to \nhave not just waited 30 days; he would have also had to have made all \nkinds of detailed and substantive classified notifications. He would \nhave had to have made certain kinds of findings, detailed statements, \nthe basis for the transfer release, and explanation of why the transfer \nrelease is in the national security interest of the United States, a \ndescription of any actions taken to mitigate the risks. He would have \nhad to have done all that before he was able to execute the transfer of \nan American citizen to the safety of this country.\n  The President did do all of those things immediately after he made \nthe decision to act. So we got all of that notification that is \nrequired by law, but we didn't get it 30 days in advance because of the \njeopardy it would have created to American life.\n\n  Again, people are going to disagree as to whether this agreement \nshould have been reached. That is fair discussion, fair game for \ndebate, but that is a very different issue as to whether we should \nprejudge as to whether the President, who acted under his article II \npowers--and told us he might do so when he signed this bill--acted \nillegally, and that is what this resolution says happened--that the \nPresident acted illegally. It prejudges the investigation.\n  I think for a number of reasons it is inappropriate for us to adopt \nthis resolution, so I will object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. It is unfortunate that we cannot at this point come to a \nbipartisan agreement on something even, it seems to me, as \nstraightforward as this.\n  To my friend from Michigan I would say a couple of things. One, this \nresolution does not prejudge the investigation. The resolution--and I \nhave it in front of me now--does not talk about the President's article \nII powers. It very clearly says that transfer of these detainees \nviolated the National Defense Authorization Act--legislation that you \nbrought to the floor--and the appropriations bill. That is what it \nsays. So that is clear by the very language in those bills, that it \ndoes violate those bills. It doesn't talk about the constitutional \nauthorities the President may have. It does say that it violates the \nterms of this legislation. It does not prejudge the investigation, \nwhich is in the why, the investigation as to why it happened, with, \nagain, the intent of trying to keep this from happening again.\n  I do think the President could have used some reasoned judgment from \nsome people who have been around a while, maybe even Senator Levin, who \nhas some strong views on these national security matters and was \ninvolved earlier in the hearings that I was in where, under oath, the \nadministration official talked about how dangerous these very men were.\n  Second, Senator Levin correctly says the President cannot change the \nlaw, and that is all we are saying. He cannot change the law with a \nsigning statement. If he didn't believe this law was appropriate, he \nshould have vetoed it, and he has done that in the past--as have other \nPresidents--vetoed legislation with which he didn't agree.\n  So I do believe that under article II, Chairman Levin is correct that \nthe President does have certain authorities. That is why we were very \ncareful when we drafted this legislation, this resolution, to say that \nthis says the Congress shall go on record establishing that under the \nclear terms of these two laws that were passed by the Congress and \nsigned into law by the President, the President did not follow the \nterms of those laws. That is clear. The investigation, then, is into \nwhy, and the Armed Services Committee would have the ability to do \nthat.\n  By the way, today I know many are celebrating the capture of Ahmed \nAbu Khattala. Ahmed Abu Khattala was one of the terrorists who attacked \nthe American compound in Benghazi, and I am glad to hear we have \ncaptured him and he may be deported back to the United States of \nAmerica.\n  It is interesting because we got notice. I don't know if the chairman \nwas notified, but I know the intelligence committee was notified. And \nthat wasn't required by law, by the way. It is just common practice \nthat happens when you have a relationship between the administration \nand Congress that is confidential.\n  We were notified, of course, with regard to the bin Laden capture. I \ncannot imagine the bin Laden capture was any less sensitive or any \ndifferent in kind to make it something that we could do a notification \non when we couldn't do it on the release of these five detainees from \nGuantanamo.\n  So this is something I think is very reasonable. We are asking for \njustification not after the decision is made--that is not what the \nlegislation says. It says before the decision is made so that Congress \ncan have the opportunity to discuss this with the President and to make \nsure that, in fact, we are proceeding appropriately with these very \ndangerous detainees at Guantanamo.\n  I would again make the point that some of these detainees who are at \nGuantanamo right now are people who--just as in the case of these five \nTaliban--have been considered to be extremely dangerous, and I would \nask the question, If Congress isn't on record saying that we expect the \nlaw to be followed here and that the President ought to notify Congress \nbefore we release these people, what is going to happen with Khalid \nShaikh Mohammed? What is going to happen with Hambali? What is going to \nhappen with Ramzi bin al-Shibh, an architect of the\n\n[[Page S3708]]\n\n9/11 attacks? These are all people who are at Guantanamo. The President \nsays he wants to shut it down.\n  I think the legislation Senator Levin and others crafted--which, by \nthe way, was legislation that changed over time. It evolved. The \nnotification was a relatively slight requirement on the President \ncompared to the previous legislation when I was on the Armed Services \nCommittee with Chairman Levin. So this was something we thought about. \nWe decided notification was appropriate, notifying Congress and \nproviding a detailed justification. It is not too much to ask.\n  Again, we required the President to tell the Congress before \nreleasing Guantanamo detainees. We spoke with one voice in the \nCongress. The President ignored that legal requirement. He ignored the \nvoice of Congress. He ignored the law. If we are not going to hold him \naccountable, I don't know who will. Again, what does it say about the \nseparation of powers enshrined in our Constitution, which simply says \nCongress has a role as one of the branches of government. No \ndeclaration, no investigation, no recourse? I don't think that is going \nto be helpful in terms of ensuring that balance of power continues and \nthat we don't have this situation recur, as the President is talking \nabout shutting down Guantanamo Bay and releasing other detainees.\n  I hope my friends on the other side of the aisle will reconsider \ntheir course of action today and take a careful look at this \nresolution, which was carefully drafted--including not to impinge on \nthe President's constitutional powers under article II. I think the \nstakes are simply too high to do otherwise.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, first of all, look at what the resolution says. When \nyou read the resolution, it says: Congress should investigate the \nactions taken by President Obama and his administration that led to the \nunlawful transfer of such detainees.\n  So when my friend says it doesn't prejudge that it was unlawful, by \nits very terms it says ``investigate the actions taken by President \nObama that led to the unlawful transfer of such detainees.'' That is \nwhat the resolution says.\n  Secondly, the point that the resolution makes no reference to article \nII--my friend says that, and he is accurate in that regard. That is the \nproblem. What is missing is a reference to what the President was \nadvised he could do--which is act under his article II powers--and what \nthe President said he would do when he signed this bill.\n  Third, the fact that we were notified of the bin Laden capture--I \ndon't know how many of us were notified, but it certainly wasn't 30 \ndays before he was captured, if it was at all. That is the issue here--\nnot whether the President should have notified--by the way, I think he \ncould have done a better job of notifying Congress. That is not the \nquestion. The question is whether he acted illegally, as the resolution \nsays he did, because he didn't follow the 30-day notice requirement, \nwhich, in his judgment and I think a lot of other people's judgment, \nincluding mine, would have jeopardized the life of an American citizen. \nSo he acted under article II powers to avoid that jeopardy, and there \nis no reference to article II in here. There is no reference to the \nfact that the Department of Justice informed the President he could act \nwithout abiding by a 30-day provision if he acted under his article II \npowers to save the life of an American citizen.\n  There are many reasons that this resolution--there are many problems \nthat it seems to me this resolution does not fairly address or resolve, \nand that is the reason I object.\n  One other issue; that is, my friend from Ohio made reference to James \nClapper, who is the Director of National Intelligence. Well, Director \nClapper supports the deal that was made relative to this transfer, as \ndoes General Dempsey, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and \nAdmiral Winnefeld, the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time until \n4:45 p.m. be equally divided between the two leaders or their designees \nand that at 4:45 p.m. all postcloture time be expired and the Senate \nproceed to vote on the confirmation of Calendar No. 572, with all the \nprovisions of the previous order remaining in effect, and that the \nSenate then resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, with this agreement there will be two \nrollcall votes at 4:45 p.m., first on the confirmation of Peter Kadzik \nto be Assistant Attorney General and second on cloture on the motion to \nproceed to H.R. 4660, the House Commerce, Justice, Science \nAppropriations Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I am coming to the floor today to talk about what is \nhappening in Ukraine, but before I do that, I cannot help but--having \nheard some of the discussion before this from my colleague from \nMichigan and my colleague from Ohio--add to that discussion.\n  First of all, the President didn't even notify the chair of the \nintelligence committee and the ranking member of that committee. And I \nthink it is clear why he didn't notify the chair of the intelligence \ncommittee. Because there was widespread opposition from the \nintelligence committee to transferring these five particular detainees, \nand that was made clear to the administration well before this prisoner \nswap was made.\n  Moreover, what I find not only shocking--that the chair and ranking \nmember of the intelligence committee weren't consulted about this, but \nwhat made my jaw drop was when I learned that our commander in \nAfghanistan had not been consulted in advance about the impact on the \nground of this particular prisoner transfer in terms of the five \nTaliban detainees--which, make no mistake, what our intelligence \ncommunity has said is that these five detainees, the five Taliban dream \nteam--on a scale of 1 to 10, how likely will it be that they get back \nin the fight against us and our allies and against our interests? Four \nof them, we were told, are a 10 out of 10 that they will get back into \nthe fight. That is why these five detainees were designated as high-\nrisk by the board that is supposed to review these issues and decide \nwhether prisoners can be safely transferred out of Guantanamo or \nwhether they should be indefinitely detained.\n  I just wanted to add that to this discussion because it is important \nto understand. I do believe we should bring our men and women home who \nhave served our country, but these five detainees represent a real \ndanger to us and our allies going forward, and that is why even the \nintel committee on a bipartisan basis didn't think this was a good \nidea.\n  The notion that the President couldn't trust, for example, the \nranking member of the intel committee, whom I have great respect for, \nand the chairman of that committee, whom we entrust every day to hold \nclassified information, to ask at least what the intel committee \nthought, I just think that is absurd, that they would have somehow put \nat risk our soldier in Afghanistan.\n  So I wanted to add that to the discussion. And it seems to me that if \nwe really wanted to consult on the ground with our commander in \nAfghanistan, we would want to know from him in advance what he thought \nabout putting the five detainees back in the battle space, regardless \nof what he thinks now about it because making a good decision means \nconsulting the people who are knowledgeable about this in advance.\n  What worries me the most about this transfer is the fact that five \nout of the five are likely to get back in the fight, and we don't have \na good record on this. The estimates are that 29 percent of those who \nhave been detained in Guantanamo have either gotten directly back in \nthe fight or we believe have gotten back in the fight against our \ninterests or the interests of our allies. That is the national security \nconcern about this transfer.\n\n\n                                Ukraine\n\n  I am here today to talk about the situation in Ukraine. As we look \naround\n\n[[Page S3709]]\n\nthe world there is so much happening and so much which is of concern to \nour country, but today I would like to focus on Ukraine and what Russia \nis doing in Eastern Ukraine to interfere with the sovereignty of the \nUkrainian people, to interfere with their choice of how they want to \nconduct their country, the choices they have a right to make for their \nown country.\n  Of course, this began with the illegal invasion and annexation of \nCrimea, but it has not stopped there. It has continued in Eastern \nUkraine, where essentially we have seen violence and turmoil in parts \nof Eastern Ukraine.\n  Make no mistake, the cause of that violence and turmoil in Eastern \nUkraine is by the so-called separatists, and the cause is very clear: \nVladimir Putin and Russia hold the key to that violence. They hold the \nkey and are as responsible for that violence as they are responsible \nfor the illegal invasion of Crimea.\n  In fact, I would say Vladimir Putin has operational control of what \nis happening. He could ask those separatists to stop what they are \ndoing. He could stop giving them arms. He could stop giving them the \nthings he has been giving them, including the capability of shooting \ndown Ukrainian planes, giving them the capability of tanks and arms.\n  With everything the Ukrainian people are trying to deal with, what do \nthey want? The Ukrainian people want to determine their own future. \nThey want Vladimir Putin and Russia to butt out. They want Russia to \nrespect their sovereign territory, and unfortunately none of this is \nhappening.\n  I recently had the honor of leading a delegation to Ukraine to \noversee the Presidential election last month. I had the chance to sit \ndown and meet with the now-elected President Boris Plushenko in \nUkraine.\n  I also had the chance to meet many people in Ukraine and see their \nelections firsthand. One of the events that was very inspiring to me \nwas the first polling place I went to in Kiev. There was an older \ngentleman, probably in his seventies, who cast the first ballot of the \nday. As he cast his ballot, he said: ``For democracy.'' That was a very \nmoving moment because that is what we saw throughout the polling places \nwe observed in Ukraine. They had a very high turnout.\n  The Ukrainian people came out to vote in their elections so they \ncould choose their President, not a President chosen by Vladimir Putin. \nThey came out to vote for a President chosen by the Ukrainian people, \nand they did it despite what was happening in Eastern Ukraine. They did \nit despite the threats Russia made against their sovereignty and their \ncountry.\n  I think they did it in spite of Russia and to send a message, as a \npeople, to say: We are going to determine our future. Vladimir Putin, \nyou are not going to determine our future. I found it all inspiring.\n  Why does Ukraine and what happens there matter to the United States \nof America? First of all, if Russia believes they can go in and invade \nthe sovereign territory of another country without consequences, what \ndoes that mean for the rest of Europe and the security of Europe? \nUnfortunately, we have seen history such as this before, where \ncountries are invaded and other countries act in an apathetic fashion; \nthere are no consequences as a result of that invasion.\n  The President gave a moving speech in Warsaw, Poland, on June 4 of \nthis year, to celebrate the 25th anniversary of Freedom Day there. In \nthat speech the President said:\n\n       Ukraine must be free to choose its own future for itself \n     and by itself. We will not accept Russia's occupation of \n     Crimea or its violation of Ukraine sovereignty.\n\n  It means increased support to help our friends such as Ukraine and \nMoldova and Georgia, all of which are watching what is happening in \nUkraine and wondering: Will we be next if there are no consequences for \nthe invasion of Ukraine? To help them provide for their own defense, \nour free nations will stand united so further Russian provocations will \nonly mean more isolation and costs for Russia.\n  In fact, as I went to Ukraine to oversee the elections, the President \nhad said--with those impending Presidential elections in Ukraine--along \nwith Chancellor Merkel of Germany, that if the Ukrainian elections were \ninterfered with, there would be more costs to Russia. Well, guess what. \nWhen I was there overseeing the elections in places such as Kiev, where \nwe had a record turnout, the Russians continued to foment violence in \nthe eastern province.\n  In Donetsk and Luhansk, the people there did not have the free right \nto vote and exercise their decisionmaking for the future of their \ncountry. Where were the costs for that? There were none imposed. In \nfact, the economic sanctions imposed by this administration have not \nhad an impact on Russia.\n  In fact, their stock market is back to where it was before the \nsanctions, and at this point they feel they have gotten away with it \nbecause the economic sanctions we imposed prior to those elections were \nimposed on individuals and some minimal sanctions on sectoral, but very \nlimited, and we have done nothing to actually support the Ukrainians in \nhelping them to defend themselves.\n  What has happened since the President talked about the costs they \nwould endure if they interfered with the election? Nothing happened \neven though the Russians continue to foment violence in the east.\n  Flash forward to the Warsaw speech in Poland, where the President \nsaid if there is further aggression by the Russians, there will be \ncosts if they interfere with the sovereignty of Ukraine.\n  Guess what happened since then. Since that time, the developments \nhave been absolutely shocking, and I think the Russians are trying to \ntake advantage of what is happening in Iraq and other things happening \naround the world. They are thinking we will lose sight of their illegal \ninvasion of Ukraine and what they are doing in Eastern Ukraine.\n  On June 12, Russian-backed separatists in Ukraine reportedly acquired \nT-64 tanks and BM-21 rocket launchers from Russia. These are the types \nof vehicles--rocket launchers--Russia is supplying to their agents, \nessentially, in Eastern Ukraine. There have been tanks sighted. This is \nno grassroots movement. Tanks and rockets have all been provided by \nRussia to kill Ukrainian people who are trying to defend their \nsovereignty. This has all happened since the elections, adding on to \nthe violence that was committed in Eastern Ukraine during the \nelections.\n  The President said there will be costs. There have been no costs for \ntanks and missile launchers in Eastern Ukraine. In fact, on June 14 \npro-Russian separatists shot down a Ukrainian military transport \nkilling all 49 people on board in the deadliest unrest in months in \nEastern Ukraine. This is the type of transport the Russians--the agents \nthey backed--shot down.\n  In order to shoot down a plane such as this, they have to have the \ntechnology to do it, and guess who is giving them that technology. \nRussia. Yet there have been no costs to that because at this point the \nPresident has just talked. He has not imposed tougher sanctions on the \neconomy of Russia nor has he provided the Ukrainian military with \nsupport.\n  This is what it looked like when they shot down those 49 people who \nwere killed. The Russian agents and the separatists they are giving the \narms to did this--shot down that plane, and this is the actual picture \nof that plane.\n  At this point what is the State Department's response? What has our \nadministration said? We are highly concerned about the new Russian \nefforts to support the separatists. We are very concerned. If they \ndon't deescalate, there will be additional costs.\n\n  How many times will our President and the State Department say there \nwill be additional costs if the Russians do anything further? How many \ntimes will the Russians again shoot down Ukrainian planes by giving \nthese arms to their agents and their separatists? How many more Russian \ntanks have to cross the Ukrainian border before we will impose such \ncosts?\n  Words don't mean anything to someone such as Vladimir Putin, and he \nknows we keep talking and not acting, so he can keep shooting down \ntheir planes. He can make sure the tanks roll over the border--the \nRussian tanks. This is not a grassroots movement. They have tanks and \nrocket launchers to shoot down aircraft. This is a subversion where the \nRussians are also trying to repeat the playbook of what happened in \nCrimea to further\n\n[[Page S3710]]\n\ntake over the rest of Ukraine, and it is time for us to back up our \nwords with actions.\n  What kind of actions are we talking about? We are talking about \nlegislation we have offered in the Congress. I have worked with Senator \nCorker and others on legislation that will impose tougher economic \nsanctions on Russia and will make a difference to them and their \neconomy. We have financial sector sanctions, energy sector sanctions, \nmilitary sector sanctions--sanctions that will send the message that, \nyes, this will hurt your economy if you don't respect the sovereignty \nof another country or if you continue to escalate the violence by \nproviding not only tanks but also rocket launchers and shooting down \nplanes of the Ukrainian people.\n  When I had the chance to meet with the new President of Ukraine, he \nhad a request of us. First of all, he wants to make sure we are tougher \nthan we have been on Russia in terms of economic sanctions so Russia \ndoesn't continue to invade their territory and, not only that, so they \ndon't go into other countries in the region. We need to use the \neconomic tools at our disposal so we are forced to use military tools \ndown the line. We have economic tools this administration is not using \nto impose costs on Russia and to back up the words of our President \nrather than continuing to look the other way when tanks roll in and \nairplanes are shot down.\n  What else can we do? The President asked me about supporting their \nmilitary. No one wants to send a U.S. troop to Ukraine. No one wants to \nsend our people to fight their battle, but this is what he asked of us: \nThe former Russian-backed President gutted our military. Can you help \nget us some basic things for our military--body armor, communication \nequipment, night vision goggles, in addition, antitank and anti-\naircraft capability.\n  What would that do for them? They could defend themselves from the \ntanks. They could help push back against their planes from being shot \ndown. So what they want is the ability and the help to defend \nthemselves.\n  Why should we give it to them? We should give it to them because not \nonly is it the right thing to do so they can help defend themselves and \nwe can push back against the Russian invasion in their country, but it \nis the right thing to do because we were a signatory to the Budapest \nmemorandum.\n  In 1994, Ukraine gave up their nuclear weapons. They gave up their \nnuclear weapons under the Budapest memorandum that the United States, \nthe United Kingdom, and Russia signed. Russia has violated this \nagreement because the agreement required all parties to respect the \nsovereignty of Ukraine and the agreement required us to respect not \nonly their sovereignty, but they expected some security assurance \nbecause they were giving up their nuclear weapons by signing this \nagreement.\n  We haven't even given them antitank, anti-aircraft equipment so they \ncan defend themselves after they gave up nuclear weapons. What other \ncountry in the world is ever going to give up their nuclear weapons \nwhen we are not even going to impose tough economic sanctions on a \ncountry that has been invaded. We have not even given them basic \nmilitary equipment when they were invaded.\n  I would argue, in looking at this playbook, no rational country is \ngoing to give up their nuclear weapons again in such an agreement if we \ndon't actually follow through in what our President said, which is: \nThere will be costs if the Russians continue to invade the territory of \nUkraine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have 1 \nadditional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. In summary, I do not expect us to go alone. I would ask \nour European partners to step up too. It is a shame that the French \nwill continue their recent sale to the Russians to give them further \ncapability of the Mistral class amphibious assault ships. So shame on \nthe French for that because Europe is threatened by the Russian \naggression here, and I not only expect our country to follow through, \nbut our allies should be held accountable to follow through as well.\n  Ukraine matters. We cannot continue to look the other way as Russia \nthinks they can invade another country without consequences. We can \nmake a difference in this Congress. I urge the President to follow \nthrough on his words; otherwise, do not say it if you were not willing \nto back it up, Mr. President.\n  The Ukrainian people deserve our support. They love America. All they \nwant is to determine their own future instead of Vladimir Putin \ndetermining their future for them.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n\n                            Embassy Security\n\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about an important \ntopic, the topic of embassy security. The safety of American embassies \nabroad and especially our capital ``A'' Ambassadors and our small ``a'' \nambassadors, who go to work every day in communities across the globe--\n182 countries where we have embassies--to represent the United States.\n  Embassy security has been in the news yesterday. The President \nannounced the dispatch of 275 additional marines to Baghdad to protect \nthe American Embassy and embassy personnel in Iraq. Today we received \nthe news of the excellent law enforcement work that has been done by \nthe United States to finally capture one of the leaders behind the raid \non Benghazi in September of 2012. Obviously, embassy security is an \nimportant and very newsworthy and topical issue.\n  Mr. President, I think you have noticed what I have, that in the \naftermath of the tragic attack on the embassy compound in Benghazi that \ncost four Americans their lives, there has been much discussion in \nCongress about Benghazi. But too much of it, in my view, has been \nfocused on trying to play the blame game than trying to talk about what \nwe should do to minimize the chance of such an incident happening \nagain.\n  We have seen attacks on embassies. From the attack on the U.S. \nEmbassy in Beirut in the 1980s, to attacks on embassies in Africa in \nthe 1990s, we have seen this before. But what we ought to be talking \nabout in this body and in the House is how to make our embassies safer \ninstead of trying to play a blame game.\n  I want to bring in this speech one fact about embassy security that \nshould trouble us a lot, and especially us in the Senate. Of the 182 \ncountries in the world that have United States Ambassadors, 54 of the \nU.S. Ambassador posts are currently vacant. Nearly 30 percent of the \nambassador posts in the world--where the U.S. Ambassador goes to \nrepresent us--are currently vacant. Ten of the posts are vacant because \nthe White House has not forwarded a name to the Senate, which is \nresponsible for the consent to those nominations. One of those 10--\nSyria--has not been forwarded because of security reasons. Twenty-one \nposts are vacant because the White House has sent nominees but the \nnominees are pending in the Foreign Relations Committee, where I serve. \nThe chairman of the committee, Senator Menendez, is doing all he can to \nmove those through but is facing some pretty significant opposition, \noften from members of the committee. And 23 of the positions are vacant \nbecause they have gone through the Foreign Relations Committee, they \nhave received overwhelming votes of support, but they are being held \nhere on the Senate floor with no action on the Senate floor, often for \na very long period of time.\n  Let me tell you about those 23 nations. The ambassador to the nation \nof Djibouti, which is a critical partner in Africa for the United \nStates in counterterrorism operations--his nomination has been pending \nin the Senate for 67 days; for the Czech Republic, the nomination has \nbeen pending for 95 days; for the Bahamas, the nomination has been \npending for 122 days; for the State of Kuwait, in the Middle East--a \ncritical area--the nomination has been pending for 179 days; for Bosnia \nand Herzegovina, 200 days; for Hungary, 215 days; for New Zealand, 223 \ndays; for Iceland, 223 days; for Zambia, 270 days; for the Gabonese \nRepublic, 270 days; for the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, pending \nhere in the Senate, 272 days; for the Kingdom of Norway, 272 days; for \nJamaica, 272 days; for the Kingdom of Lesotho, 312 days; for the \nRepublic\n\n[[Page S3711]]\n\nof Palau, 313 days; for the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste, 313 \ndays; for Cameroon, 314 days; for Namibia, 314 days; for Niger--Niger, \ncritical in issues of terrorism and counterterrorism in Africa--the \nnomination on this floor, pending for 314 days; for Trinidad and \nTobago, 314 days; for Albania, 319 days; for Sierra Leone, 335 days; \nand topping the list, a strong ally of the United States, the Republic \nof Peru, the ambassadorial nomination has been pending on the floor of \nthe Senate for 353 days--almost a year.\n  Again, these vacancies represent nearly 30 percent of all of the in-\ncountry ambassadorships that the United States sends around the globe--\nessentially just hanging a sign out in front of the Embassy of the \nUnited States with a big ``vacant'' sign on it.\n  I would submit that ``vacancies'' means an uncertainty about \nleadership and that hurts embassy security. Mr. President, you and I \nwere both Governors. We know that our agencies ran a lot better when \nthey knew who the leaders were. An interim, a part-time, a temporary, \nan acting--that is not the same as a leader. That is not the same as a \nconfirmed ambassador. So our personnel, who are serving in these 54 \nembassies around the world--often in very dangerous places in the \nworld--are there waiting for their leader to come. Now they have a \ndeputy in charge of the mission, and those people are usually fine, but \neven that deputy is waiting to find out: Who will our leader be? Times \nof uncertainty increase insecurity.\n  So I would say to my colleagues, if you really care about Benghazi \nand embassy security, you should care about confirming ambassadors in \nthese 54 nations that are waiting for American leadership.\n  The ability to promptly nominate and confirm these ambassadors is \ndirectly connected to our security, and I would argue that individuals \nblocking or slowing down ambassadorial appointments are not being \naccurate when they claim to support embassy security.\n  The effects of these vacancies are not just in the security of our \nembassies, obviously. I often hear colleagues on the floor of this body \nor see them on television criticizing America as retreating from global \nleadership. Well, if you care about America's global leadership, why \nallow 54 American embassies around the world to not have ambassadors? \nWhy allow those vacancies to exist?\n  The existence of these vacancies--some for nearly as long as a year--\nsends a pretty powerful message to the nations where the vacancies \nexist. And the message could be interpreted one of two ways. Maybe the \nUnited States is retreating from global leadership because if the \nUnited States cared, the Senate would confirm ambassadors. Or in some \ncountries the interpretation is a little bit different. It is not about \nglobal leadership. Some countries interpret it as: Maybe we are not \nthat important to the United States. It is a sign of disrespect to \nnations as important as Niger, some of the nations in the Middle East I \nmentioned, France, to not have ambassadors for extended periods of \ntime.\n\n  This is a very important issue and I do not think this body, which is \nconstitutionally charged with this responsibility, should be complicit \nin sending a message to the nations of the world that we are retreating \nor that we are uninterested in our relationships with them.\n  Let me conclude by coming back to the subject of embassy security. \nMr. President, I know you, like I, in this job have had the opportunity \nto travel around the world and meet some of our embassy personnel. What \nI try to do when I travel--I imagine you try to do the same--is not \njust spend time with the capital ``A'' ambassadors--that is important--\nbut I also try to spend time with the small ``a'' ambassadors: the \nForeign Service officers on their first or second tour who have \nchosen--even though the salary is not great, even though the working \nconditions can be tough, even though security challenges can be \nsignificant--to serve the United States abroad.\n  I was in Beirut, in Lebanon, in February with Senator Angus King of \nMaine. Let me tell you about our personnel in Lebanon. Because of the \ndangers in that country, they all have to live on the embassy compound. \nThey live there in Beirut, which has been subject to some very \ndifficult times. The U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut were bombed in the \n1980s. The U.S. Embassy was bombed. Hundreds were killed in those two \nbombings. The U.S. embassy annex was bombed. Other U.S. Embassy \npersonnel were targeted and killed. Hundreds of Americans serving not \njust in the military but as Foreign Service officers lost their lives \nin Lebanon, representing us in the best way they could.\n  For that reason our embassy personnel live on the embassy compound in \nBeirut. Guess what kind of personal life they have. They are allowed 6 \nhours a week personal time to be off the embassy compound, and they \nhave to be escorted by security. They described what it is like. They \nmight want to go to the beach, and traffic is horrible, so in that 6 \nhours a week, it is an hour and a half to get to where they want to go, \nand then it is an hour and a half to get back from where they want to \ngo, so what they really get is about 3 hours a week of personal time. \nThat is what these wonderful American public servants do.\n  I then went to Egypt, and I had a visit with a young first-tour \nForeign Service officer there who was talking about needing to finish a \nmeeting we were having because of the Skype date with her husband. I \nwas not familiar with that terminology. She serves in a capacity where, \nfor safety and other reasons, it was not ideal for him to be there with \nher. So on Friday nights they both dress up, and with a glass of wine \nthey then fire up the Skype and talk across thousands of miles to try \nto keep their marriage alive. This is a person who is thrilled to serve \nthe United States in a dangerous part of the world. Again, it is not \nfor the salary. It is not for the comfort. It is for the honor of \nrepresenting this country.\n  We owe them something. We owe them a secure operation that can make \nthem feel--not completely safe because there is no guarantee of safety \nfor our personnel in many of these countries but at least that we are \ndoing all we can to try to keep them safe.\n  I stand today because we are not doing all we can to keep these \npeople safe. To the extent that we in the Senate are responsible for \nthe vacancies of nearly 30 percent of the ambassadorial posts around \nthe world--and the absence of ambassadors leads to additional \ninsecurity--we are not honoring our obligation to the brave Americans \nwho want to serve this Nation in very dangerous places.\n  I urge my colleagues, if you are talking about Benghazi and the need \nfor more embassy security, you should be promptly confirming \nambassadors to represent the United States. If you are worried about \nthe role of America in the world, and you are asserting, critically, \nthat America is retreating from global leadership, you should be \nconfirming promptly the ambassadorial nominees who are pending before \nthe Senate.\n  With that, Mr. President, I thank you and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DONNELLY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaine.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                       vote on kadzik nomination\n\n  Under the previous order, the question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Peter J.

The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                              Nominations\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I rise to speak to the 42 very well-\nqualified and very patient nominees who, through no fault of their own \nand certainly no fault of the Foreign Relations Committee and no fault \nof their records of service to this Nation that have been established, \nare trapped on the executive calendar, unable to assume their appointed \nposts because the Republican leadership has chosen obstructionism as a \npolitical tool. They have consciously chosen the strategy to do \nnothing, pass nothing, approve nothing, and leave, most importantly in \nmy view, key diplomatic posts unfilled for months, threatening in many \ncases national security and our ability to conduct foreign policy.\n  Those who say that Congress is broken are wrong. The Congress isn't \nbroken, but if the Republican leadership wants you to believe it is, \nthey use every parliamentary tool to make certain, among other posts, \nwe cannot fill key foreign policy positions. And the world waits, \nAmerican foreign policy waits, diplomacy waits, and our allies wait to \nlet these nominees and their families have some closure and get to \nwork.\n  The blame for these posts being left vacant with these people being \nin political limbo rests squarely on the shoulders of the Republican \nleadership. It is not a problem with Congress or the Democrats or the \nPresident or with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Never, to my \nknowledge, has this body as a political strategy obstructed en masse \nthe appointments of noncontroversial career Foreign Service officers \nwho have worked for both Democratic and Republican administrations. \nNever.\n  Never have we held up appointments to so many ambassadorial \npositions, State Department positions, USAID positions, and \nrepresentatives to the multilateral development banks. Eighteen of the \nforty-two pending nominees are ambassadors who would fill important \nposts in the Czech Republic, Bosnia, Albania, Gabon, Mauritania, \nCameroon, Niger, Sierra Leone, Djibouti, and Kuwait. Nearly 20 \npercent--20 percent--of our total ambassadorial presence in Africa is \nbeing held up by the Republican leadership. All of them have waited on \naverage 280 days--280 days--for Senate action. That is unfair to them. \nIt is unfair to their families. It is bad policy. It is unnecessary, \nirresponsible, and completely unacceptable. And it has to end. It harms \nour regional coordination on issues such as food, security, and \ncounterterrorism.\n  We are seeing what is happening across Africa, particularly northern \nAfrica, and we have a challenge. We have a challenge that involves our \nnational interests and our national security. You cannot promote the \nsolutions to those challenges if you don't have an ambassador on the \nground in those countries. Let us remember that U.S. leadership plays a \nmajor role in supporting peace and security efforts alongside our \ndevelopment, democracy, and humanitarian goals across Africa and around \nthe world, preventing us from being able to project power and \nleadership, leaving us--in my view--vulnerable from a national security \nstandpoint.\n  In West Africa, the Nigerian terrorist organization Boko Haram is \nperpetuating a brutal campaign of violence\n\n[[Page S3713]]\n\nand fear, kidnapping young women and taking advantage of porous borders \nwith Niger and Cameroon. The United States is leading an effort with \nour international partners to improve regional coordination to address \nboth this threat and serious development challenges in the region.\n  Unfortunately, the Senate has yet to confirm the ambassadorial \nnominees to Niger or Cameroon. We need to fill these ambassadorial \npositions in order to promote our interests and our coordination in the \nregion in pursuit of some of these goals.\n  Mauritania has been a key partner in addressing the terrorist threat \nposed by Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, AQIM, in Africa's volatile \nSahel region.\n  Let's not forget that the East African Nation of Djibouti holds U.S. \nAfrica Command's Combined Joint Task Force--Horn of Africa and is the \nU.S. military's only enduring infrastructure in Africa, Camp Lemonnier, \nhome to some 4,000 U.S. servicemembers and civilians.\n  Our cooperation with Djibouti supports counterterrorism efforts \nagainst Al-Shabaab in Somalia and Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula in \nnearby Yemen and anti-piracy operations in the Gulf of Aden. Al-Shabaab \nrecently carried out its first terrorist attack in Djibouti, targeting \na restaurant frequented by westerners. Yet our ambassadorial nominee, \nThomas Kelly, remains unconfirmed.\n  In addition to supporting peace and security efforts in Africa, the \nUnited States also plays a key role supporting democratic governance \nacross the continent, which in turn contributes to greater stability.\n  Niger and Namibia are set to hold Presidential elections within the \nnext 9 months and both ambassadorial nominees have yet to be confirmed \nby the full Senate.\n  At a time when stability in parts of Africa is tenuous, at best, with \nconflicts, famine, and the ever-increasing threat from criminal and \nterrorist organizations, it is simply not in our national interest to \nhave the President's nominees--many of them career Foreign Service \nofficers--in many cases held up for political reasons for nearly a \nyear--a year in so many cases.\n  U.S. leadership in international organizations is being negatively \naffected. In fact, the nominee for Assistant Secretary of State for \nInternational Organization Affairs was reported to the Senate on March \n3. Her nomination is not the least bit controversial, and yet she has \nnot been confirmed.\n  Nominees for posts at the United Nations have been pending for \nmonths, including the nominee to be U.S. Representative to the U.N. \nConference on Disarmament, who was reported out on March 11. These gaps \nhave affected our credibility around the world, and they are affecting \nU.S. national security.\n  It is worth understanding that this list is not static. We are \nconstantly adding nominees to the Executive Calendar. We held hearings \nfor an additional five nominees last week. Four more had their hearings \ntoday, chaired by Senator Cardin--who is here on the floor with me and \nhas done an exceptional job in this regard--including our nominees to \nbe ambassador to Korea and Vietnam. Simply stated, the backlog is \nweakening America's role in the world.\n  The vast majority of these nominees are uncontroversial. They have \npassed committee by voice vote, not even a recorded vote, and are \nnominations that normally would have gone through the Senate en bloc by \nunanimous consent. Holding them hostage is simply wrong on every level.\n\n  Never has one party stood in the way of full and complete conduct of \nforeign policy, and it is time the American people understand who is to \nblame for the dysfunction that is holding them hostage for political \nreasons. And as we hold up action on these nominees, the world is \nconvulsing. The days are filled with a steady stream of breaking-news \nstories, disheartening images, trending tweets of reports of unrest in \nUkraine, Iraq, Venezuela; mass atrocities in Syria, South Sudan, the \nCentral African Republic; heart-wrenching accounts of kidnapped girls \nin Nigeria and alarming events of violence against women in Egypt, \nPakistan, Afghanistan, and other parts of the world. That is the daily \ndiet of what we see unfolding across the world.\n  American leadership is expected by the international community during \nthis challenging period, and it is in fact something that is in our own \nnational interests and national security interests.\n  Some complain that the United States does too much and others argue \nthat we don't do enough, but always the debate in foreign affairs is \ncentered on our Nation and the vital role we fill within the \ninternational system. We live in a new world defined by technological \nadvancement and rapid globalization, but we are history-bound by a \ndeeply imbued duty to provide moral clarity when it appears lacking, of \nserving as a lighthouse to a community of nations undergoing profound \ntransformation.\n  In one very particular arena, we are failing this charge. We are \nleaving our embassies without the tools they need, without the \nnecessary leadership to pick up that metaphorical hammer.\n  Using obstruction as a political tool, we are being forced to turn \nfrom our vital responsibility of confirming ambassadorial nominees to \nconduct American foreign policy. That means turning from our \nresponsibility in everything from providing emergency services for \nAmericans abroad to responding to humanitarian crises around the world, \nto supporting U.S. businesses and our commerce agenda overseas. The \nlack of confirmed ambassadors is crippling our global agenda.\n  Consider this: Key U.S.-held positions at the World Bank, \nInternational Monetary Fund, the Inter-American Development Bank, the \nEuropean Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and other \ninternational financial institutions are not filled.\n  Seizing the opportunity, Russia and China are actively lobbying IMF \nmembers to reduce U.S. ownership share in the bank. Just recently, \nChristine Lagarde, IMF managing director said: ``I wouldn't be \nsurprised if one of these days the IMF was headquartered in Beijing.''\n  No nation can hear what we have to say if we are not there, if we \nhave no voice. It is not an overstatement to say our national security \nis affected by Republican noncooperation. One example is the Assistant \nSecretary of State for Verification, Compliance, and Implementation \ntasked with monitoring and verifying our arms control agreements \nremains empty, and that affects our ability to design and implement a \npotential agreement to halt Iran's illicit nuclear weapons program.\n  Last week, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee held a hearing for \nthe nominees to serve in Egypt, Iraq, and Qatar. Imagine those \ncountries not having a U.S. ambassador during a time when they are \ngoing through massive turmoil and change--some of them, not all of \nthem, but Iraq is certainly going through turmoil. We will soon vote to \napprove these Foreign Service officers, but there is no guarantee they \nwill be confirmed expeditiously by the Senate despite the very obvious \nneed for a constant U.S. presence in these Nations. Iraq is on the \nverge of civil war and we have no way to confirm Stu Jones, a very \nqualified nominee who is currently serving in Jordan for the post to \nreplace Robert Beecroft, who is headed to Egypt but is currently in \nIraq.\n  That this scenario is even a possibility, given their pending \nassignments, concerns me and should concern all of us. Perhaps their \nfate will be similar to the nominee to Kuwait, who has not received a \nconfirmation vote for nearly 200 days.\n  The Emir of Kuwait recently made a historic visit to Iran. Persistent \nreports link wealthy Kuwaiti donors to a variety of extremists, \nincluding the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria--the ISIS, which is \nthreatening Iraq. Yet we lack the ambassador's ears and eyes on the \nground to provide the analysis we need.\n  Of the 42 unconfirmed nominees, almost half are career ambassadors, \nwho, as I said earlier, have served this Nation for a lifetime on \nbehalf of Democratic and Republican administrations. Some were already \nconfirmed, as I said earlier, in the past by the Senate and served as \nambassadors in previous posts.\n  So let me conclude by saying since becoming chairman of the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee, we have debated and voted to approve 125 \nnominees, oftentimes unanimously and without discord.\n\n[[Page S3714]]\n\n  But apparently the pricetag for Leader Reid executing what some call \nthe nuclear option to get anything done in the Senate is the Republican \nleadership's intransigence that gums up the Senate proceedings, \nparticularly holding ambassadorial nominees hostage and in so doing \nharming our national security objectives. This standoff is having very \nnegative and real implications in the world that is beset by chaos and \nin need of American engagement. It has to end and it has to end now.\n  It is not about a Republican or a Democratic divide in terms of \nimportance. This is about the national interests and security of the \nUnited States. If we are not in our embassies abroad as a leader, we \ncan do all the diplomacy and efforts from the State Department, but at \nthe end of the day the person on the ground every day and engaging with \nthe leadership of that country and promoting American ideals, values, \nand interests is the ambassador. In the absence of an ambassador, we \ncannot be heard. I don't want the United States not to be heard.\n  I see my colleague from Maryland, a distinguished member of the \ncommittee who has held so many of these hearings for nominees and has \ndone a fantastic job on behalf of the committee. He is going to speak \nnext. As the chair of one of our key subcommittees, it is critical, as \nyou will hear from him, that we have our nominees so our interests can \nbe represented.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, first, I thank Senator Menendez for his \nincredible leadership on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. What \nSenator Menendez did not bring out is the number of hours our committee \nhas had hearings on each one of these nominees.\n  We take the nomination process very seriously--the committee does--\nunder Senator Menendez's leadership. We have a complete record on the \nbackground and experience of each of President Obama's nominees. We \nhave vetted them, gone over everything, and we have had hearings.\n  As Senator Menendez pointed out, today I chaired a hearing where we \nconsidered the nominations for our Ambassadors to Algeria, Vietnam, and \nthe Republic of Korea as well as an Assistant Administrator for USAID \nfor Asia. That hearing lasted an hour and a half, many questions were \nasked. The record is open through Thursday so members of the committee \ncan ask additional questions.\n  Many times additional questions are asked for the record. We get \nthose responses, and we then analyze all of that information and go to \na committee markup where every member of the committee has a chance to \ndebate each nominee. As Senator Menendez has pointed out, in most cases \nthey have been approved by our committee by unanimous votes, and many \ntimes it is not recorded because there is no controversy.\n  In many cases these are career diplomats, and in other cases they are \npeople who have an extraordinary background to add to the service of \ntheir country, and we are very blessed that they are willing to step \nforward to take on the ambassadorship or membership in a key national \norganization to further U.S. foreign policy. That is the record.\n  So what happens after we act? Senator Menendez has expedited these \nnominations as quickly as he could do it in carrying out the \nresponsibilities of the Senate to advise on these nominations. But what \nhas happened afterward is that they cannot get a Senate vote and not \nbecause of any meritorious objections to the confirmation. They are \njust being backlogged in order to gum up the operations of the Senate. \nThere is no policy reason or substantive reason for the delay in the \nconsideration of these nominations.\n  This is foreign policy for the United States. This is in the best \ninterests of the United States. It is hard for the public to understand \nand it is hard for this Senator to understand why we would hold up \nhaving a confirmed ambassador heading up our embassy in any country in \nthe world but particularly those countries that are critically \nimportant to U.S. interests. We should have a confirmed head of our \nembassy in every country.\n\n  As far as it is affecting U.S. interests, let me give you what I \nthink is obvious, and the Presiding Officer understands this. Our \nnational defense strategy depends upon not just our soldiers and our \nweapons, it depends very much on diplomacy and development assistance. \nThe diplomacy--and to a large extent the development assistance--is \nmanaged by our embassy in the host country and the CEO of that embassy \nis the confirmed ambassador, and in many cases we don't have a \nconfirmed ambassador. We don't have an ambassador because the Senate \nhas not confirmed that position.\n  For months we have gone without confirming an ambassador after the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee has recommended a confirmation, and \nthat is why we have come to the floor to talk about that. This does \naffect our national security interests.\n  Senator Menendez pointed out a very obvious fact; that is, the face-\nto-face interchange of our ambassador and the country he or she is \nrepresenting that gives the United States the best opportunity in that \ncountry. That is how you do diplomacy. You don't do diplomacy through \nletters; you don't do diplomacy through long exchanges from one country \nto another; you do it by being in that country--by your personal \ncommitment to that country. That is why we have our embassies and our \nambassadors. When we don't have a confirmed ambassador--when we don't \nhave the CEO of that embassy there--we miss that personal face-to-face \ninterchange which is critically important.\n  Just think for a moment. Here we are trying to make an important \ncontact in a foreign country, and we may meet with the Prime Minister \nor the Foreign Minister, and we don't have an ambassador to be our \nrepresentative or to be there to supervise the diplomacy that is taking \nplace.\n  What many people are not aware of is that our embassies are more than \njust the ambassador dealing with current foreign policy issues. We have \na host of functions that are carried out under the supervision of our \nambassador who, as we pointed out in many cases, is not there because \nwe have not acted. Maybe we are interested in what is going on with \nU.S. business. We have a lot of economic interests around the world.\n  We are in a global economy. American businesses depend upon our \nembassy being there for them to fight for the government contracts on a \nfair, level playing field so they can conduct their business \ninternationally. They depend upon an embassy to be at full strength. \nBecause of global competition, we are fighting every day for job \nopportunities for Americans and American companies.\n  In too many countries we don't have that person there fighting for \nour businesses because the Senate is not active because those on the \nother side of the aisle have prevented us from taking up these \nambassadors for confirmation, even though there has been no controversy \nsurrounding their individual confirmation, and that is hurting U.S. \nbusiness interests.\n  There are many citizens who travel abroad. They expect to have the \nfull service of their embassy if they need it or if they get sick or \nthey need the services of our embassy for whatever it might be. They \ndepend on that embassy, and they want the CEO to be present in that \nembassy in order to fight for their interests.\n  That confirmed ambassador is not there today because the Republicans \nhave denied the vote in the Senate to confirm that position. We are not \nat full strength to protect Americans who are traveling abroad. Our \nparticipation in environmental opportunities is very much dependent \nupon the functioning of our embassy.\n  Our humanitarian efforts depend upon the functioning of the embassy. \nOur eyes and ears on the ground depend upon the functioning of the \nembassy. Our development assistance programs are run out of the \nembassies. In many cases the CEO is not there because of the \nobstruction by the Republicans in the Senate who are not allowing a \nvote on noncontroversial nominees. Because these nominations have not \ntaken place, we are not at full strength.\n  We are hurting our country. We are hurting our interests. We are \nhurting our business interests, our security interests, and our \nleadership on environmental issues. As Senator Menendez\n\n[[Page S3715]]\n\npointed out, they are not just ambassadors to countries, they are \nambassadors to international organizations.\n  We are not at full strength on economic international organizations. \nWe are not at full strength on arms control negotiations because we \ndon't have our key person there--not because that person is \ncontroversial, not because the President has elected someone who is \ncontroversial but to the contrary. Almost all of these nominations are \nnoncontroversial and waiting for months because the Republicans will \nnot allow a vote.\n  Somebody said: OK. Don't we need a lot of floor time to debate this? \nLook at the record. Look how much floor debate has been spent on \napproving these nominations. I am willing to wager--although we can't \nwager on the floor of the Senate. I am willing to point out that if we \nbring these nominations to floor consideration, in almost every case \nthere will be virtually no debate, and they will be approved by an \noverwhelming majority, if not a unanimous vote.\n  We are hurting our country. We are hurting the reputation of the \nUnited States. We are supposedly the major power. Yet we can't get a \nCEO confirmed to head our embassies abroad.\n  It is also unfair to the people who are making a sacrifice for public \nservice. As Senator Menendez pointed out, a large number of these \nnominees were ambassadorships or career diplomats. These are not \npolitical appointments, these are career people who have made their \ncareer serving their country.\n  Many have young families. What do they do about school enrollment in \nSeptember? Do they enroll their children in the school where they are \nnow or do they wait to see if they will be confirmed and enroll them in \nthe country in which they will be serving? Why are we putting people \nwho are serving their country through that type of uncertainty and \nanxiety? But we are. We are, by failing to move in a timely way the \nnominations that have been brought forward to us.\n\n  I will just mention one other example. I started with the hearing I \nchaired today on behalf of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \ndealing with four nominees. One was the Ambassador to Vietnam. I was \njust recently in Vietnam. I met with our current Ambassador, Ambassador \nShear. I mention that because he has been nominated to be Assistant \nSecretary of Defense for Asia, so he is leaving Vietnam. We had a \nhearing today on the next Ambassador to Vietnam--a well-qualified \ncareer diplomat. The question is: Are we going to have the orderly \nchange of command in Vietnam, a country critically important to U.S. \ninterests? We are negotiating a Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement. \nPart of that involves good governance changes that we expect in \nVietnam. We expect our Ambassador to be there to negotiate these \nissues. The question is: Will we have that orderly transfer?\n  Two career people seeking to move forward in their careers are being \nheld up by inaction on the floor of the Senate.\n  I come to the last point I wish to make. Yes, we are hurting the \nUnited States in not having these confirmed CEOs. It is creating \nunfairness to the families of people who want to serve our country--and \nthe uncertainty that is there. But it is also hurting the Senate \nbecause it is our responsibility to act on Presidential appointments. \nIt is our responsibility to act in a timely, thoughtful way. We are not \ncarrying out that responsibility. By the Republicans obstructing votes \non the President's nominations on key foreign policy positions, we are \nnot carrying out our responsibility--an oath that we took to serve in \nthe Senate to protect the interests of this country. It is our \nresponsibility to act on these nominations in a timely way, and we have \nnot done that because of the obstructionism of the Republicans.\n  I urge my colleagues to put our national interests first. Let us move \nforward with our responsibility. The committee has carried out its \nresponsibility and, quite frankly, the chairman has carried that out in \na very bipartisan way. We have had cooperation between Republicans and \nDemocrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. We have carried \nout our responsibility. Now it is time for the Senate to carry out its \nresponsibility, for the Republicans to allow us to vote in a timely way \non this backlog of nominees for critical foreign policy positions. I \nurge my colleagues to allow us to move forward in the best interests of \nour country and in respect for those who have stepped forward to serve \nour country, to carry out the responsibilities we all swore to uphold \nin the Senate.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/17/senate-section/article/S3715-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I wish to honor the service of a \ngreat Marine infantryman, Maj. Myle Hammond. Major Hammond will be \nretiring from the Marine Corps after more than 20 years of dedicated \nservice to our country. On this occasion, I believe it is fitting to \nrecognize his contribution to the Marine Corps, the Senate, and the \nNation.\n  Major Hammond's career included three combat tours in Iraq, a tour \nwith the Ceremonial Honor Guard at Marine Barracks, Washington, 3 years \nin the Marine Corps Senate Liaison Office, and 1 year working as a \ncongressional fellow in my office. A marine's marine, Myle's \ndistinguished service in combat and in garrison is emblematic of the \ncaliber of his character.\n  I was proud to welcome Myle into my office, and he exceeded every \nexpectation. His indepth knowledge of the Marine Corps and the \nlegislative process made him an invaluable member of my staff. At the \nconclusion of his fellowship, Myle moved on to be the deputy director \nof the Marine Senate Liaison. His quick wit and strategic thinking were \nvital in guiding the Marine Corps senior leadership through the Senate. \nHis efforts were instrumental in ensuring the completion of the MV-22B \nacquisition program, executing a responsible drawdown of the Marine \nCorps, and recognizing the contributions of the first African-American \nmarines through the award of the Congressional Gold Medal in tribute to \nthe Montford Point Marines.\n  A decorated combat veteran and proud father, Myle is a model American \nto us all. As Myle hangs up his uniform, he will remain in Virginia \nwith his wife Rani and their two young children, Mason and Sydney. \nAlthough his absence will be felt in the Marine Corps and in Congress, \nI trust that his contributions in the private sector will equal those \nof his public service.\n  I share the sentiments of many Senators in my gratitude and \nappreciation to Major Hammond for his outstanding leadership and his \nunwavering dedication to the Marine Corps and the country. I wish Myle \nand his family all the best upon his retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/17/senate-section/article/S3715-4", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3715-S3717]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        DES MOINES COUNTY, IOWA\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, the strength of my State of Iowa \nlies in its\n\n[[Page S3716]]\n\nvibrant local communities, where citizens come together to foster \neconomic development, make smart investments to expand opportunity, and \ntake the initiative to improve the health and well-being of residents. \nOver the decades, I have witnessed the growth and revitalization of so \nmany communities across my State, and it has been deeply gratifying to \nsee how my work in Congress has supported these local efforts.\n  I have always believed in accountability for public officials, and \nthis, my final year in the Senate, is an appropriate time to give an \naccounting of my work across four decades representing Iowa in \nCongress. I take pride in accomplishments that have been national in \nscope--for instance, passing the Americans with Disabilities Act and \nspearheading successful farm bills. But I take a very special pride in \nprojects that have made a big difference in local communities across my \nState.\n  Today, I would like to give an accounting of my work with leaders and \nresidents of Des Moines County to build a legacy of a stronger local \neconomy, better schools and educational opportunities, and a healthier, \nsafer community.\n  Between 2001 and 2013, the creative leadership in your community has \nworked with me to secure funding in Des Moines County worth over $45 \nmillion and successfully acquire financial assistance from programs I \nhave fought hard to support, which have provided more than $158 million \nto the local economy.\n  Of course, my favorite memories of working together include helping \nto get compensation for sick former nuclear workers at the Iowa Army \nAmmunition Plant, improving transportation in the county, and helping \narea residents access to quality, affordable health care by building a \nCommunity Health Center.\n  Investing in Iowa's economic development through targeted community \nprojects: In Southeast Iowa, we have worked together to grow the \neconomy by making targeted investments in important economic \ndevelopment projects including improved roads and bridges, modernized \nsewer and water systems, and better housing options for residents of \nDes Moines County. In many cases, I have secured Federal funding that \nhas leveraged local investments and served as a catalyst for a whole \nripple effect of positive, creative changes. For example, working with \nmayors, city council members, and local economic development officials \nin Des Moines County, I have fought for funding for important \ntransportation projects, including $118 million for the Avenue of the \nSaints, more than $45 million for the four-lane highway from Des Moines \nto Burlington, another $45 million to replace the Burlington Northern \nbridge over the Mississippi River, and maintaining Essential Air \nService funding to the community, helping to create jobs and expand \neconomic opportunities.\n  Main Street Iowa: One of the greatest challenges we face--in Iowa and \nall across America--is preserving the character and vitality of our \nsmall towns and rural communities. This isn't just about economics; it \nis also about maintaining our identity as Iowans. Main Street Iowa \nhelps preserve Iowa's heart and soul by providing funds to revitalize \ndowntown business districts. This program has allowed towns like \nBurlington to use that money to leverage other investments to jumpstart \nchange and renewal. I am so pleased that Des Moines County has earned \n$130,000 through this program. These grants build much more than \nbuildings; they build up the spirit and morale of people in our small \ntowns and local communities.\n  School grants: Every child in Iowa deserves to be educated in a \nclassroom that is safe, accessible, and modern. That is why, for the \npast decade and a half, I have secured funding for the innovative Iowa \nDemonstration Construction Grant Program--better known among educators \nin Iowa as Harkin grants for public schools construction and \nrenovation. Across 15 years, Harkin grants worth more than $132 million \nhave helped school districts to fund a range of renovation and repair \nefforts--everything from updating fire safety systems to building new \nschools. In many cases, these Federal dollars have served as the needed \nincentive to leverage local public and private dollars, so it often has \na tremendous multiplier effect within a school district. Over the \nyears, Des Moines County has received $717,400 in Harkin grants. \nSimilarly, schools in Des Moines County have received funds that I \ndesignated for Iowa Star Schools for technology totaling $20,000.\n  Disaster mitigation and prevention: In 1993, when historic floods \nripped through Iowa, it became clear to me that the national emergency \nresponse infrastructure was woefully inadequate to meet the needs of \nIowans in flood-ravaged communities. I went to work dramatically \nexpanding the Federal Emergency Management Agency's hazard mitigation \nprogram, which helps communities reduce the loss of life and property \ndue to natural disasters and enables mitigation measures to be \nimplemented during the immediate recovery period. Disaster relief means \nmore than helping people and businesses get back on their feet after a \ndisaster, it means doing our best to prevent the same predictable flood \nor other catastrophe from recurring in the future. The hazard \nmitigation program that I helped create in 1993 provided critical \nsupport to Iowa communities impacted by the devastating floods of 2008. \nDes Moines County has received over $1 million to remediate and prevent \nwidespread destruction from natural disasters.\n  Iowa Army Ammunitions workers: When a constituent, Bob Anderson, \nwrote me a letter to saying that he was sick with lymphoma and believed \nit was because he had worked at the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant, which \nmanufactured nuclear weapons during the Cold War, I began looking into \nhis claims. Even though the Army initially denied these accusations, I \ncontinued to investigate the situation and discovered that workers \nthere were in fact exposed to massive doses of radiation and that this \nwasn't an injustice unique to Iowa. Working to get compensation to Bob \nand thousands of other sick workers throughout the United States \ninvolved a massive bipartisan legislative and bureaucratic undertaking, \nstarting with the passage of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness \nCompensation Plan Act of 2000. To date, the Department of Labor has \npaid out over $10 billion in compensation to workers all over the \nUnited States, including over $239 million to the Burlington workers \nand more than $57 million to a special cohort of workers at the Ames \nLaboratory.\n  Keeping Iowa communities safe: I also firmly believe that our first \nresponders need to be appropriately trained and equipped, able to \nrespond to both local emergencies and to statewide challenges such as, \nfor instance, the methamphetamine epidemic. Since 2001, Des Moines \nCounty's fire departments have received over $1.2 million for \nfirefighter safety and operations equipment and more than $499,000 in \nByrne Justice Assistance Grants.\n  Wellness and health care: Improving the health and wellness of all \nAmericans has been something I have been passionate about for decades. \nThat is why I fought to dramatically increase funding for disease \nprevention, innovative medical research, and a whole range of \ninitiatives to improve the health of individuals and families not only \nat the doctor's office but also in our communities, schools, and \nworkplaces. I am so proud that Americans have better access to clinical \npreventive services, nutritious food, smoke-free environments, safe \nplaces to engage in physical activity, and information to make healthy \ndecisions for themselves and their families. These efforts not only \nsave lives, they will also save money for generations to come thanks to \nthe prevention of costly chronic diseases, which account for a whopping \n75 percent of annual health care costs. I am pleased that Des Moines \nCounty has worked with me to secure $2.9 million for the Community \nHealth Center.\n  Disability rights: Growing up, I loved and admired my brother Frank, \nwho was deaf. However, I was deeply disturbed by the discrimination and \nobstacles he faced every day. That is why I have always been a \npassionate advocate for full equality for people with disabilities. As \nthe primary author of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the ADA \nAmendments Act, I have had four guiding goals for our fellow citizens \nwith disabilities: equal opportunity, full participation, independent \nliving, and economic self-sufficiency.\n\n[[Page S3717]]\n\nNearly a quarter century since passage of the ADA, I see remarkable \nchanges in communities everywhere I go in Iowa--not just in curb cuts \nor closed captioned television but in the full participation of people \nwith disabilities in our society and economy, folks who at long last \nhave the opportunity to contribute their talents and to be fully \nincluded. These changes have increased economic opportunities for all \ncitizens of Des Moines County, both those with and without \ndisabilities.\n  This is at least a partial accounting of my work on behalf of Iowa, \nand specifically Des Moines County, during my time in Congress. In \nevery case, this work has been about partnerships, cooperation, and \nempowering folks at the State and local level, including in Des Moines \nCounty, to fulfill their own dreams and initiatives. And, of course, \nthis work is never complete. Even after I retire from the Senate, I \nhave no intention of retiring from the fight for a better, fairer, \nricher Iowa. I will always be profoundly grateful for the opportunity \nto serve the people of Iowa as their Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/17/senate-section/article/S3717-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3717-S3718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           SCOTT COUNTY, IOWA\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, the strength of my State of Iowa \nlies in its vibrant local communities, where citizens come together to \nfoster economic development, make smart investments to expand \nopportunity, and take the initiative to improve the health and well-\nbeing of residents. Over the decades, I have witnessed the growth and \nrevitalization of so many communities across my State.

Every \nAmerican, regardless of his or her station in life, deserves equal \naccess to our justice system. Having been a legal aid attorney myself, \nI can tell you that there are many, many people who would have no \naccess to legal representation if it weren't for programs like this \none. This funding will help legal aid lawyers reach out and serve those \nwho otherwise would be disenfranchised from our justice system. That is \nwhy, throughout my career, I have fought to improve funding for Legal \nAid Services, to expand their scope, and to offer loan forgiveness for \nattorneys who choose to serve their communities by becoming legal aid \nattorneys.\n  Among the highlights:\n  Investing in Iowa's economic development through targeted community \nprojects: In Eastern Iowa, we have worked together to grow the economy \nby making targeted investments in important economic development \nprojects, including improved roads and bridges, modernized sewer and \nwater systems, and better housing options for residents of Scott \nCounty. In many cases, I have secured Federal funding that has \nleveraged local investments and served as a catalyst for a whole ripple \neffect of positive, creative changes. For example, working with mayors, \ncity council members, and local economic development officials in Scott \nCounty, I have fought for over $256.9 million in defense projects \nthrough the Rock Island Arsenal, ALCOA, John Deere, Carleton Life \nSupport Systems, and other local businesses, helping to create jobs and \nexpand economic opportunities.\n  School grants: Every child in Iowa deserves to be educated in a \nclassroom that is safe, accessible, and modern. That is why, for the \npast decade and a half, I have secured funding for the innovative Iowa \nDemonstration Construction Grant Program better known among educators \nin Iowa as Harkin grants for public schools construction and \nrenovation.

Over the \nyears, Scott County has received $3.2 million in Harkin grants. \nSimilarly, schools in Scott County have received funds that I \ndesignated for Iowa Star Schools for technology totaling $336,600.\n  Keeping Iowa communities safe: I also firmly believe that our first \nresponders need to be appropriately trained and equipped, able to \nrespond to both local emergencies and to statewide challenges such as, \nfor instance, the methamphetamine epidemic. Since 2001, Scott County's \nfire departments have received over $1.5 million for firefighter safety \nand operations equipment and over $521,000 for Byrne Justice Assistance \nGrants.\n  Wellness and health care: Improving the health and wellness of all \nAmericans has been something I have been passionate about for decades. \nThat is why I fought to dramatically increase funding for disease \nprevention, innovative medical research, and a whole range of \ninitiatives to improve the health of individuals and families not only \nat the doctor's office, but also in our communities, schools, and \nworkplaces. I am so proud that Americans have better access to clinical \npreventive services, nutritious food, smoke-free environments, safe \nplaces to engage in physical activity, and information to make healthy \ndecisions for themselves and their families. These efforts not only \nsave lives, they will also save money for generations to come thanks to \nthe prevention of costly chronic diseases, which account for a whopping \n75 percent of annual health care costs. I am pleased that Scott County \nhas recognized this important issue by securing over $9.8 million for \nthe Community Health Center.\n  Disability rights: Growing up, I loved and admired my brother Frank, \nwho was deaf. But I was deeply disturbed by the discrimination and \nobstacles he faced every day. That is why I have always been a \npassionate advocate for full equality for people with disabilities. As \nthe primary author of the Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA, and the \nADA Amendments Act, I have had four guiding goals for our fellow \ncitizens with disabilities: equal opportunity, full participation, \nindependent living, and economic self-sufficiency. Nearly a quarter \ncentury since passage of the ADA, I see remarkable changes in \ncommunities everywhere I go in Iowa--not just in curb cuts or closed \ncaptioned television but in the full participation of people with \ndisabilities in our society and economy, folks who at long last have \nthe opportunity to contribute their talents and to be fully included. \nThese changes have increased economic opportunities for all citizens of \nScott County, both those with and without disabilities. And they make \nus proud to be a part of a community and country that respects the \nworth and civil rights of all of our citizens.\n  This is at least a partial accounting of my work on behalf of Iowa, \nand specifically Scott County, during my time in Congress. In every \ncase, this work has been about partnerships, cooperation, and \nempowering folks at the State and local level, including in Scott \nCounty, to fulfill their own dreams and initiatives. And, of course, \nthis work is never complete. Even after I retire from the Senate, I \nhave no intention of retiring from the fight for a better, fairer, \nricher Iowa. I will always\n\n[[Page S3718]]\n\nbe profoundly grateful for the opportunity to serve the people of Iowa \nas their Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/17/senate-section/article/S3718-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNIZING THE RENO RODEO\n\n Mr. HELLER. Madam President, today I wish to recognize the \n95th year of the Annual Reno Rodeo, the ``Wildest, Richest Rodeo in the \nWest''. Revered by some as the greatest outdoor rodeo in the world, I, \nalong with my fellow Nevadans, are proud that it has called the great \nState of Nevada home for so many years.\n  The Reno Rodeo was started in 1919 by local community leaders and has \ngrown exponentially in the past 95 years, offering Nevadans and rodeo \ngoers nationwide a place to truly experience the gritty, energetic \nentertainment that the Wild West is best known for. For generations \nfans have been flocking to Reno to see some of our Nation's toughest \ncowboys and cowgirls compete in ten days of competition, showcasing \ntheir amazing talents, from roping to bull riding. This event has \nbecome a yearly tradition for many Nevada families, including my own, \nand is the source of many cherished memories. As rodeo lovers, my wife \nLynne and I have proudly ridden in the Reno Rodeo Parade on our horses, \nJackson and Cruise, and Lynne has had the privilege of singing the \nNational Anthem at the Rodeo's opening several times.\n  From its start as a charitable organization in 1986, the Reno Rodeo \nFoundation has focused its mission on benefitting and enriching the \nlives of Nevada families in need. With the help of over 500 dedicated \nvolunteers in the community, the Reno Rodeo Foundation has made a \ntradition of giving the annual proceeds of the event back to the \nresidents of Nevada in a variety of ways. The organization has used the \nproceeds to build a horseback riding facility for Marvin Piccolo, a \nschool for children with special physical or mental needs in Reno, and \nhas created a recreation center on the Kids' Kampus to benefit abused \nand neglected children in protective custody. These are just a few \nexamples of how the rodeo gives back to the Silver State. I am both \nhumbled and honored to recognize the Reno Rodeo here today for donating \nover $1 million in the form of scholarships, children's charities, high \nschool rodeo, literacy programs, and much more.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me and all Nevadans in recognizing Reno \nRodeo, a special event that has proudly called Nevada home for the past \n95 years, and I would like to offer the best of luck to all who are \nparticipating in this year's events.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/17/senate-section/article/S3718-2", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CONGRATULATING STEVE AND SUSAN DUPREY\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I wish to offer my most heartfelt \ncongratulations to Steve and Susan Duprey as they receive the Boy \nScouts of America's New Hampshire Distinguished Citizens Award this \nevening. The Granite State is known for a straightforward and honest \napproach to politics and life, and a commitment to liberty summed up by \nits State motto, Live free or die.' Through their longtime dedication \nto community service and active engagement in the public life of their \nState and Nation, Steve and Susan embody the great spirit of their \nState and richly deserve this honor.\n  Steve has been a leader in New Hampshire since he was first elected \nto the State legislature as a 19-year-old college student. He graduated \nfrom law school, built a highly successful real estate development and \nmanagement company, and served as chairman of the New Hampshire \nRepublican Party for four terms. Susan, a land use attorney, has served \nin leadership positions at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and United Way, \namong other organizations, and has been involved in Presidential \ncampaigns going back to 1979. Altogether, Steve and Susan have worked \non more than 30 national and State Republican campaigns since the \n1970s. Susan most recently served as an adviser to Ann Romney during \nthe 2012 campaign. Steve currently serves as New Hampshire's Republican \nnational committeeman where he promotes and protects the vital role of \nthe Granite State's first in the Nation primary. Wherever one looks, \nthe Dupreys are working to serve their State, country and community.\n  In some of the darkest days of my Presidential run in 2007 and 2008--\nwhen more than a few respected pundits declared my campaign over--I \ncould always count on Steve and Susan to stand with me. Without their \nsteadfast support and wise counsel, I don't know if I would have won \nthe Republican nomination. During the general election, Steve traveled \nthroughout the country with me, serving as a trusted adviser. Steve was \nofficially designated as the `Secretary of Fun' on the campaign trail, \nand could always be counted on to lighten the mood in what can often be \na tense and stressful experience. While we lost that campaign, I will \nalways cherish the opportunity to travel this remarkable country and \ngain more than a few friends, few better than my fellow rebel-rouser \nSteve Duprey.\n  Congratulations to Steve and Susan--you deserve this recognition. \nEnjoy the evening.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/17/senate-section/article/S3718-3", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ROSLYN, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. THUNE.

A bill to direct the Federal Communications Commission to \npromulgate regulations that prohibit certain preferential treatment or \nprioritization of Internet traffic; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr President, in recent months, we have seen an outpouring \nof public support for maintaining meaningful open Internet rules. \nAmericans are speaking loud and clear--they want an Internet that is a \nplatform for free expression and innovation, where the best ideas and \nservices can reach consumers based on merit rather than based on a \nfinancial relationship with a broadband provider. I agree, which is why \ntoday I am proud to join my friend in the House, Representative Doris \nMatsui of California, to introduce bicameral legislation requiring the \nFederal Communications Commission FCC, to ban pay-to-play deals on the \nInternet.\n  Since FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler began a proceeding to consider new \nopen Internet rules, nearly 300,000 Americans have commented on his \nproposal. They are concerned that the Internet will become a place \nwhere broadband providers charge tolls to websites or applications in \norder to reach end users. This would represent a fundamental departure \nfrom the way in which consumers and entrepreneurs interact with the \nInternet. A two-tiered Internet based on ability to pay would harm the \ninnovative and competitive environment we have all come to expect in \nthe online world.\n  A pay-to-play Internet would allow larger companies to squeeze out \ntheir competitors. A small web company in Vermont that develops an idea \nto rival the largest Silicon Valley titans should not have to worry \nthat its access to\n\n[[Page S3721]]\n\nconsumers could be blocked because its competitors have a paid \narrangement with broadband providers. The next generation of Internet \ncompanies should have the same protections that allowed a company like \nVermont's Dealer.com to become a thriving success.\n  Such arrangements would also harm consumers, who would not have the \nassurance that the service they are paying for will provide the speed \nthat they want. Too many Americans currently lack real choice in \nbroadband providers, particularly those in rural areas. If the FCC \nclears the way for pay-to-play deals, whole swaths of the Internet \ncould become functionally inaccessible to the customers of certain \nInternet providers. This is not the Internet we know today and we must \nact to ensure that it does not come to pass.\n  The Online Competition and Consumer Choice Act, which I am \nintroducing with Congresswoman Matsui today, is straightforward. It \nrequires the FCC to establish rules preventing providers from charging \nwebsites for priority access. It also requires rules to prevent \nproviders from prioritizing their own affiliated content or services. \nThis legislation should not be used by opponents of meaningful open \nInternet rules as an excuse for the FCC to not take any action that \nwill protect consumers and innovators. The FCC should act now to ban \nthese deals. I appreciate that Chairman Wheeler is asking whether they \nshould be banned outright in the current open Internet proceeding. The \noverwhelming response from the American people is that they should be.\n  The importance of an open Internet is an issue that resonates outside \nof the Beltway, and with good reason--most Americans interact with the \nInternet as part of their daily lives. The issue of how we protect and \npromote an open Internet is crucial to our culture and our economy. I \nwant to make sure that stakeholders from outside of Washington have an \nopportunity to show policymakers and regulators here that their \ndecisions will have a significant impact throughout the country. That \nis why I am holding a Judiciary Committee field hearing on July 1 at \nthe University of Vermont.\n  There should be widespread agreement to prevent special deals that \nharm consumers and dampen online innovation. The FCC and Congress \nshould rightly focus on this timely and significant issue. I urge the \nSenate to pass this constructive legislative response.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2476\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of Transportation to \npartner with industry to strengthen the safety culture and safety \npractices of short line and regional freight railroads; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today Senator Murray and I are \nintroducing legislation to enhance the safety practices and safety \nculture of short line railroads. The horrific derailment that occurred \nin Lac-Megantic, Quebec, last year, just 30 miles from the Maine \nborder, brought to light the importance of ensuring the safe \ntransportation of energy products. Specifically, our bill would \nauthorize the Secretary of Transportation to make grants to a new Short \nLine Safety Institute for research, development, evaluation, and \ntraining efforts.\n  In the early morning hours of July 6, 2013, a freight train carrying \nhundreds of thousands of gallons of crude oil was sent hurtling toward \nthe small, picturesque Canadian village of Lac-Megantic. The train \nderailed in the center of town, leveling several blocks, and killing 47 \nresidents. Since the accident, the National Transportation Safety Board \nand the Department of Transportation have been working with American \nShort Line and Regional Railroad Association to develop new safety \nguidelines to prevent future disasters.\n  While this tragedy hit very close to home for us Mainers, there have \nbeen several other derailments of crude oil and other hazardous \nmaterial recently across the country. Despite these incidents, the \nrailroad industry maintains it has a strong safety record. According to \nthe Association of American Railroads, 99.997 percent of rail hazmat \nshipments reached their destination without a release of product. This \nunderscores the problem we face today we must ensure that we are taking \nthe necessary steps to prevent another Lac-Megantic, while not \noverburdening an industry that has a proven track record of safety.\n  There are 550 short line railroad companies that operate over 50,000 \nmiles of track, or nearly one third of the national railroad network. \nThe tracks can be as short as 2 miles or up to more than 1,000 miles \nlong. Generally, short line railroads must follow the same rules and \nregulations as the Nation's major railroads. But railroad safety is \nabout more than just following the rules. Our bill would authorize the \nShort Line Safety Institute, under the Federal Railroad \nAdministration's research and development programs, to provide a \ncontinuous and active focus on short line safety to assist individual \nshort lines to improve their safety performance. It would allow for the \nhiring\n\n[[Page S3722]]\n\nof professional assessment staff who would work with individual short \nline managers and their employees to assess and improve safety \npractices. Safety training materials and techniques would be developed, \nand efforts would be made to further increase management and employee \nfocus on creating a safety culture.\n  Short line railroads are mostly small businesses with far fewer \nemployees than the Class I railroads. In addition, most of the \nemployees have multiple responsibilities, stretching their time and \nresources thin. Furthermore, a large percentage of short line railroad \nresources go into track rehabilitation, which limits the resources \navailable for other areas. This bill would allow short line railroad \nmanagement to continually work with their employees using the most up \nto date methods to ensure safe operations. It would also improve \nawareness of industry best practices, both in general and with regard \nto specific commodities such as crude oil.\n  For those in rural America, short line railroads are a critical link \nto the national railroad network. Most are preserving light density \nlines that otherwise would have been abandoned, leaving thousands of \nsmall shippers in the lurch. They do their best to provide an essential \nservice as safely as possible; however, with assistance, they believe \nthey can do better, and establishing a Short Line Safety Institute is a \ncost effective way to do so. The concept merits our support, and I am \npleased to introduce this legislation with Senator Murray to help make \nthis concept a reality.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID:\n  S. 2479.

Res. 477\n\n       Whereas on June 20, 1782, the bald eagle was officially \n     designated as the national emblem of the United States by the \n     founding fathers in the Congress of the Confederation;\n       Whereas the bald eagle is the central image of the Great \n     Seal of the United States;\n       Whereas the image of the bald eagle is displayed in the \n     official seal of many branches and departments of the Federal \n     Government, including--\n       (1) the Office of the President;\n       (2) the Office of the Vice President;\n       (3) Congress;\n       (4) the Supreme Court;\n       (5) the Department of the Treasury;\n       (6) the Department of Defense;\n\n[[Page S3724]]\n\n       (7) the Department of Justice;\n       (8) the Department of State;\n       (9) the Department of Commerce;\n       (10) the Department of Homeland Security;\n       (11) the Department of Veterans Affairs;\n       (12) the Department of Labor;\n       (13) the Department of Health and Human Services;\n       (14) the Department of Energy;\n       (15) the Department of Housing and Urban Development;\n       (16) the Central Intelligence Agency;

118 Stat. 3934);\n       Whereas the sale of the limited edition bald eagle \n     commemorative coins issued by the Secretary of the Treasury \n     has raised approximately $7,800,000 for the nonprofit \n     American Eagle Foundation of Pigeon Forge, Tennessee to \n     support efforts to protect the bald eagle;\n       Whereas if not for the vigilant conservation efforts of \n     concerned Americans and the enactment of conservation laws \n     (including regulations), the bald eagle would face \n     extinction;\n       Whereas the American Eagle Foundation has brought \n     substantial public attention to the cause of the protection \n     and care of the bald eagle nationally;\n       Whereas, November 4, 2010, marked the 25th anniversary of \n     the American Eagle Foundation;\n       Whereas facilities around the United States, such as the \n     Southeastern Raptor Center at Auburn University in the State \n     of Alabama, rehabilitate injured eagles for release into the \n     wild;\n       Whereas the dramatic recovery of the population of bald \n     eagles--\n       (1) is an endangered species success story; and\n       (2) an inspirational example for other wildlife and natural \n     resource conservation efforts around the world;\n       Whereas the initial recovery of the population of bald \n     eagles was accomplished by the concerted efforts of numerous \n     government agencies, corporations, organizations, and \n     individuals; and\n       Whereas the continuation of recovery, management, and \n     public awareness programs for bald eagles will be necessary \n     to ensure--\n       (1) the continued progress of the recovery of bald eagles; \n     and\n       (2) that the population and habitat of bald eagles will \n     remain healthy and secure for future generations: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates June 20, 2014, as ``American Eagle Day'';\n       (2) applauds the issuance of bald eagle commemorative coins \n     by the Secretary of the Treasury as a means by which to \n     generate critical funds for the protection of bald eagles;

\n     assistance under this section may be done in phases to \n     accommodate the financing and other requirements related to \n     rehabilitating or constructing the project or projects to \n     which the assistance is transferred, to ensure that such \n     project or projects meet the standards under subsection (c).\n       (c) The transfer authorized in subsection (a) is subject to \n     the following conditions:\n       (1) Number and bedroom size of units.--\n       (A) For occupied units in the transferring project: the \n     number of low-income and very low-income units and the

amount of Federal assistance provided to the transferring \n     project shall remain the same in the receiving project or \n     projects.\n       (B) For unoccupied units in the transferring project: the \n     Secretary may authorize a reduction in the number of dwelling \n     units in the receiving project or projects to allow for a \n     reconfiguration of bedroom sizes to meet current market \n     demands, as determined by the Secretary and provided there is \n     no increase in the project-based assistance budget authority.\n       (2) The transferring project shall, as determined by the \n     Secretary, be either physically obsolete or economically \n     nonviable.\n       (3) The receiving project or projects shall meet or exceed \n     applicable physical standards established by the Secretary.\n       (4) The owner or mortgagor of the transferring project \n     shall notify and consult with the tenants residing in the \n     transferring project and

occupancy.\n       (6) The Secretary determines that this transfer is in the \n     best interest of the tenants.\n       (7) If either the transferring project or the receiving \n     project or projects meets the condition specified in \n     subsection (d)(2)(A), any lien on the receiving project \n     resulting from additional financing obtained by the owner \n     shall be subordinate to any FHA-insured mortgage lien \n     transferred to, or placed on, such project by the Secretary, \n     except that the Secretary may waive this requirement upon \n     determination that such a waiver is necessary to facilitate \n     the financing of acquisition, construction, and/or \n     rehabilitation of the receiving project or projects.\n       (8) If the transferring project meets the requirements of \n     subsection (d)(2), the owner or mortgagor of the receiving \n     project or projects shall execute and record either a \n     continuation of the existing use agreement or a new use \n     agreement for the project where, in either case, any use \n     restrictions in such agreement are of no lesser duration than \n     the existing use restrictions.\n       (9) The transfer does not increase the cost (as defined in \n     section 502 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as \n     amended) of any FHA-insured mortgage, except to the extent \n     that appropriations are provided in advance for the amount of \n     any such increased cost.\n       (d) For purposes of this section--\n       (1) the terms ``low-income'' and ``very low-income'' shall

The Secretary shall also \n     take appropriate steps to ensure that project-based contracts \n     remain in effect prior to foreclosure, subject to the \n     exercise of contractual abatement remedies to assist \n     relocation of tenants for imminent major threats to health \n     and safety after written notice to and informed consent of \n     the affected tenants and use of other available remedies, \n     such as partial abatements or receivership. After disposition \n     of any multifamily property described under this section, the \n     contract and allowable rent levels on such properties shall \n     be subject to the requirements under section 524 of MAHRAA.\n       Sec. 217.  Section 108 of the Housing and Community \n     Development Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5308) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a) by inserting ``States on behalf of \n     non-entitlement communities,'' after ``issued by eligible \n     public entities,'';\n       (2) by striking subsection (k) and inserting the following:\n       ``(k) The Secretary shall monitor the use by eligible \n     public entities and States of commitment amounts authorized \n     in appropriation Acts for any fiscal year. If the Secretary \n     finds that 50 percent of the annual commitment amount has \n     been committed, the Secretary may impose a limitation on the \n     amount of guarantees any one entity may receive in any fiscal \n     year of $35,000,000 for units of general local government \n     receiving grants under section 106(b) or States receiving \n     grants under section 106(d) and $7,000,000 for units of \n     general local government receiving grants under section \n     106(d); or request the enactment of legislation increasing \n     the annual commitment authority for guarantees under this \n     section.''; and\n       (3) by striking subsection (m) and inserting the following \n     new subsection:\n       ``(m) Distribution of Funds to Local Governments in Non-\n     entitlement Areas.--Any State receiving a guarantee or \n     commitment on behalf of non-entitlement areas shall \n     distribute all funds that are subject to such guarantee to \n     the units of general local government in non-entitlement \n     areas that received the commitment.''.\n       Sec. 218.  Public housing agencies that own and operate 400 \n     or fewer public housing units may elect to be exempt from any \n     asset management requirement imposed by the Secretary of \n     Housing and Urban Development in connection with the \n     operating fund rule: Provided, That an agency seeking a \n     discontinuance of a reduction of subsidy under the operating \n     fund formula shall not be exempt from asset management \n     requirements.\n       Sec. 219.

No official or employee of the Department of \n     Housing and Urban Development shall be designated as an \n     allotment holder unless the Office of the Chief Financial \n     Officer has determined that such allotment holder has \n     implemented an adequate system of funds control and has \n     received training in funds control procedures and directives. \n     The Chief Financial Officer shall ensure that there is a \n     trained allotment holder for each HUD sub-office under the \n     accounts ``Executive Offices'' and ``Administrative Support \n     Offices,'' as well as each account receiving appropriations \n     for ``Program Office Salaries and Expenses'', ``Government \n     National Mortgage Association--Guarantees of Mortgage-Backed \n     Securities Loan Guarantee Program Account'', and ``Office of \n     Inspector General'' within the Department of Housing and \n     Urban Development.\n       Sec. 221.

Other than areas with high rates of \n     defaults and foreclosures, grants may also be provided to \n     approved counseling intermediaries based on a geographic \n     analysis of the United States by the NRC which determines \n     where there is a prevalence of mortgages that are risky and \n     likely to fail, including any trends for mortgages that are \n     likely to default and face foreclosure. A State Housing \n     Finance Agency may also be eligible where the State Housing \n     Finance Agency meets all the requirements under this \n     paragraph.

No funds made available under this \n     paragraph may be provided directly to lenders or homeowners \n     to discharge outstanding mortgage balances or for any other \n     direct debt reduction payments.\n       (3) The use of mortgage foreclosure mitigation assistance \n     by approved counseling intermediaries and State Housing \n     Finance Agencies shall involve a reasonable analysis of the \n     borrower's financial situation, an evaluation of the current \n     value of the property that is subject to the mortgage, \n     counseling regarding the assumption of the mortgage by \n     another non-Federal party, counseling regarding the possible \n     purchase of the mortgage by a non-Federal third party, \n     counseling and advice of all likely restructuring and \n     refinancing strategies or the approval of a work-out strategy \n     by all interested parties.\n       (4) NRC may provide up to 15 percent of the total funds \n     under this paragraph to its own charter members with \n     expertise in foreclosure prevention counseling, subject to a \n     certification by the NRC that the procedures for selection do \n     not consist of any procedures or activities that could be \n     construed as a conflict of interest or have the appearance of \n     impropriety.\n       (5) HUD-approved counseling entities and State Housing \n     Finance Agencies receiving funds under this paragraph shall \n     have demonstrated experience in successfully working with \n     financial institutions as well as borrowers facing default, \n     delinquency, and foreclosure, as well as documented \n     counseling capacity, outreach capacity, past successful \n     performance and positive outcomes with documented counseling \n     plans (including post mortgage foreclosure mitigation \n     counseling), loan workout agreements, and loan modification \n     agreements. NRC may use other criteria to demonstrate \n     capacity in underserved areas.\n       (6) Of the total amount made available under this \n     paragraph, up to $2,500,000 may be made available to build \n     the mortgage foreclosure and default mitigation counseling \n     capacity of counseling intermediaries through NRC training \n     courses with HUD-approved counseling intermediaries and their \n     partners, except that private financial institutions that \n     participate in NRC training shall pay market rates for such \n     training.\n       (7) Of the total amount made available under this \n     paragraph, up to 5 percent may be used for associated \n     administrative expenses for the NRC to carry out activities \n     provided under this section.\n       (8) Mortgage foreclosure mitigation assistance grants may \n     include a budget for outreach and advertising, and training, \n     as determined by the NRC.\n       (9) The NRC shall continue to report bi-annually to the \n     House and Senate Committees on Appropriations as well as the \n     Senate Banking Committee and House Financial Services \n     Committee on its efforts to mitigate mortgage default.\n\n           United States Interagency Council on Homelessness\n\n                           operating expenses\n\n       For necessary expenses (including payment of salaries, \n     authorized travel, hire of passenger motor vehicles, the \n     rental of conference rooms, and the employment of experts and \n     consultants under section 3109 of title 5, United States \n     Code) of the United States Interagency Council on \n     Homelessness in carrying out the functions pursuant to title \n     II of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, as amended, \n     $3,530,000.
