All \namendments must be offered by 3 p.m. today.\n  Multiple rollcall votes are possible today. Senators will be notified \nwhen these votes are scheduled.\n\n\n                              Our Economy\n\n  Mr. President, over the last 45 months America's private sector has \nadded more than 8 million jobs. We heard that from the President last \nnight. The stock market has soared. Productivity has never in the \nhistory of our country been higher, and Americans have even started \nbuilding and buying homes again. But while the economy is gaining \nmomentum, for far too many Americans the hopeful headlines don't match \nthe grim reality.\n  For the last decades middle-class Americans have seen their paychecks \nshrink even as corporate profits climb and the wealthiest are doing \nbetter and better. As the President said last night, there is nothing \nwrong with people making money. We are all happy they are doing well. \nBut the average CEO's income is multiplied 250 times, and the people \nwho work for that CEO are making less and less every year. That has \nhappened during the last years. The richest 1 percent have had their \nwealth increased by three times while during that same period of time \nthe middle class has had its earning capacity drop 10 percent. Average \nAmericans are working even longer and harder than they were 30 years \nago and receiving less in the way of remuneration.\n  The difference is this. Their hard work isn't paying off the way it \nused to. We must change that, and we can change that. It is not too \nlate to ensure that Americans' success is determined by the strength of \ntheir spirit instead of the size of their bank account.\n  Fifty years ago, in his first State of the Union Address, Lyndon \nJohnson declared unconditional war on poverty. We have seen a lot of \nnews accounts on that anniversary during the last month or so. But here \nis what Lyndon Johnson said 50 years ago:\n\n       Unfortunately, many Americans live on the outskirts of hope \n     . . . because of their poverty. . . . Our task is to help \n     replace their despair with opportunity.\n\n  Thanks to the innovative programs created five decades ago, including \nMedicare and school lunch programs,\n\n[[Page S558]]\n\nthe poverty rate has fallen 40 percent since the 1960s. But there is so \nmuch work to do.\n  The 67 richest Americans' net worth increased $2 billion on average \nlast year. But during that same time, 1 million more American children \ndropped into poverty.\n  So there is much more to do. Too many American families still live on \nthe outskirts of hope, struggling to survive, and falling well short of \nthe American dream.\n  Last night President Obama laid out a plan to breathe new life into \nthis country's struggling middle class. The President charted a course \nto build on the economic progress we have made over the last 45 months \nand to guarantee that progress is felt by every hard-working American. \nHe challenged us--the Congress--to work with him to replace despair \nwith opportunity. President Obama called for commonsense investments in \nour future--investments that have been deferred for too long.\n  If America hopes to rebuild and maintain a world-class economy, we \nmust build the 21st century infrastructure to support that economy and \na cutting-edge energy supply to power it. We must prepare today's \nstudents for tomorrow's jobs by ensuring a higher education is within \nreach for every promising student. We must give small businesses and \nmanufacturers the support they need to thrive, and we must ensure every \nAmerican earns a living wage during their working years and has the \nopportunity to retire comfortably.\n  I support the President's action to raise the minimum wage for \nprivate contractors who do work for the government, such as janitors, \nfood servers, dish washers, and construction workers. But no American \nworking a full-time job should live in poverty, and Congress must act \nto raise the minimum wage for all our Nation's workers.\n  A strong middle class--and an opportunity for every American to enter \nthat middle class--is the key to this Nation's prosperity.\n  Last night the President also asked us to renew our commitment to the \nprinciples on which this country was founded--the principles which made \nthis country great: Fairness--basic fairness. We must make certain that \nevery American, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, race or \nincome, has the opportunity to a full and equal participation in the \nworkplace.\n  There are no guarantees in life. Not everyone succeeds. But every \nAmerican deserves a fair shot at that success.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                       State of the Union Address\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to say a word this morning about \nthe President's State of the Union speech. Let me say that I think \nCongresswoman McMorris Rodgers did a great job representing our party \nand the people of Washington State's Fifth District last night.\n  Frankly, I wish the President had laid out an agenda half as hopeful \nas the one she did because the State of the Union address is always an \nimportant moment for our country. It is an opportunity for the two \nparties to come together with the President, members of the Supreme \nCourt, and other government officials to show a kind of unity even in \nthe midst of the great debates we have here every single day. It is a \nworthy tradition.\n  Last night the President had a real chance to unite the Nation around \na forward-looking agenda. He had a huge opportunity to reach to the \nmiddle and chart a new path--at a time when nearly 70 percent of \nAmericans say the country is either stagnant or worse off now than when \nthe President took office--that we are on the wrong path. It could have \nbeen a legacy-making moment. Instead, it was the same tired boilerplate \nwe hear year after year.\n  When you peel back all the adjectives and the anecdotes, all the \nplatitudes and nods to the left, what remains for the middle class? \nLargely, the same tired policies that led us to this point--the same \nfailed agenda with its legacy of stagnant unemployment, lower incomes, \ngrowing inequality, and crumbling pathways to the future. The only \ndifference is that now the President wants to keep doing the same old \nthing, but without as much input from the people's elected \nrepresentatives in Congress.\n  It is basically all of the same policies, less of that pesky \ndemocratic accountability. The President didn't talk about embracing a \npositive new agenda last night. He didn't talk about reforming our Tax \nCode in a way that would drive private-sector growth and job creation. \nHe didn't talk about finding serious ways to start reducing a massive \n$17 trillion debt that threatens to suffocate our economy and crush the \ndreams of our children. He didn't talk about saving Social Security and \nMedicare or about streamlining and slimming the size of government or \nabout setting America's entrepreneurs and small businesses free to \ndream and to succeed.\n  As for energy, the President plans seems to boil down to more \nregulation and new taxes on energy production.\n  For all of his talk of phones and pens, he didn't even mention using \nhis pen to sign off on the Keystone Pipeline. It is the single, \nsimplest action he could have taken to create jobs soon, and it is \nactually a project which would create jobs right away. It still can, if \nthe President will just lead. Unions support it; powerful members of \nhis own party support it. The American people overwhelmingly support \nit. But there is one small group that doesn't support it: Special \ninterests on the far left. The special interests on the far left won \nlast night, and the middle class lost.\n  There is another big issue where the President turned his back on the \nmiddle class, and that of course is ObamaCare. The State of the Union \nwas the President's opportunity to finally admit his mistakes and the \npainful consequences which have affected so many in Kentucky and around \nthe country. It was a chance to call for a fresh, bipartisan beginning \nand to start over with true health reform that could really help \nmiddle-class families. Instead, he simply doubled down on failed \npolicies.\n  I know he tried to paint a rosy picture of life under this law in his \nspeech, and I suppose that is natural. But he must know it is not a \npicture that reflects reality. He must know that Americans suffering \nunder this law aren't going to buy the spin, and he must know that \ntrying to sell Kentucky's ObamaCare bureaucracy as some kind of success \nstory is, to the thousands and thousands of Kentuckians being hurt by \nit--well, it is, frankly, insulting.\n  It is insulting to the quarter-million Kentuckians who have had their \nplans canceled because of this law. It is insulting to the families \nstruggling to afford premiums that have on average increased by almost \nhalf across Kentucky. It is insulting to the taxpayers who have been \nforced to subsidize--to the tune of about $250 million in Kentucky \nalone--ObamaCare's restricted access to doctors and hospitals. It has a \ncrushing effect on families and skyrocketing costs.\n  So look. It is clear. President Obama missed the mark last night.\n  On some issues he actually said the right things, such as on Trade \nPromotion Authority. That is a place where we can work together to \ncreate more American jobs, as long as the President can convince his \nown party to work constructively with us to do that. What he didn't say \nlast night is that the only thing stopping us from creating more trade \njobs is his own party. So we will see if he actually follows through on \ntrade.\n  But overall, the President mostly refused to budge from his failed \npolicies. He refused to reach across the aisle in a way that would lead \nto immediate job growth opportunities. That is distressing news for our \ncountry. It is especially disheartening for the middle class, and it is \ndisappointing for those of us who actually want to get big things done \nfor our constituents, for those who do want to work with the President, \nwho want to collaborate on smart, bipartisan policies that could \nfinally--finally--get Americans back to work after years of this failed \nObama economy. But we cannot do it without President Obama. He has to \nlead on trade, jobs, energy, the economy--whatever the issue.\n\n  We are not going to give up. We are not going to stop trying to help \nhim to see that Americans are calling for a new direction, for a \nforward leaning agenda that actually puts the middle\n\n[[Page S559]]\n\nclass first and leaves tired leftwing ideas where they belong--in the \nhistory books. And when the President is ready to work with us, he \nshould know we will be here waiting for him. We have always been here, \nactually, and many Members of his party, with other helpful ideas, have \nbeen here too, waiting for him--Democrats with smart ideas the \nPresident has not been willing to consider so far.\n  All he needs to do is pick up the phone. If he is willing to actually \nwork in a serious way with Members of both parties, we will send him \nsome things to sign with that pen too.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, earlier this month we commemorated the \n50th anniversary of President Johnson's declaration of ``unconditional \nwar on poverty.'' That war on poverty was a massively successful \ninitiative. It helped tens of millions of Americans lift themselves out \nof poverty, reduced hardship, empowered people to build new \nopportunities for themselves and their future.\n  We see some of the residue of this. Today, food stamps ensure that \nchildren do not go to bed hungry at night. The Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act insisted that all children, regardless of background, can \nlearn and have an equal opportunity for education. Legal Services helps \npeople with limited resources seek protection from exploitation. Low-\nincome families fight poverty in their own communities by helping to \nlead community action agencies. The war on poverty and the Great \nSociety encompassed a tremendous list of achievements that I cannot \neven begin to do justice to today.\n  However, we know we still have more work to do. Too many of those \nsuccessful programs and policies have been reduced or rolled back under \nsubsequent Presidents and Congresses. What is more, our economy has \nchanged and in fundamental ways, with decades of waste, stagnation, and \nrising income inequality.\n  Now we must urgently turn our attention to policies that will ensure \nthat working families can still get ahead in America. We must recognize \nthat tens of millions of working Americans struggle to put food on the \ntable, a roof over their head, and pay their bills every month. This is \na fundamental failing of our economy. It is something we not only have \na moral obligation to fix but we have the ability to fix. We can do so \nfirst by raising the minimum wage, one of our Nation's simplest and \nmost effective means of lifting working families out of poverty.\n  I am so pleased President Obama has taken the first step in this \neffort. Last night at the State of the Union, he announced he would \nissue an Executive order that will require future Federal contracts to \nprovide wages of at least $10.10 an hour to our Nation's contract \nworkers for the Federal Government. I applaud President Obama's bold \nstep to ensure that the Federal Government is a leader in promoting \ngood jobs that pay fair wages. I think most Americans would agree that \ntaxpayer dollars should not support companies that pay poverty wages. \nThis Executive order is a strong step in the right direction. But now \nwe in the Congress have work to do, to raise the minimum wage for the \nrest of American workers.\n  Again, I am so grateful for President Obama taking a strong \nleadership position, as he did last night, in calling for Congress to \nexpeditiously work to increase the minimum wage.\n  We need to agree in this country that if you work hard and play by \nthe rules you can earn enough money to support your family, keep a roof \nover your head, put some money away for a rainy day, have a secure \nretirement. The minimum wage played a critical role in doing that, \nwhich is why Presidents and elected leaders from both parties in the \npast have supported fair increases in the minimum wage. From time to \ntime, we adjusted the minimum wage on a bipartisan basis to help \nworking families keep up with inflation and the changing economy. But \nrecently we have heard a new and disturbing set of talking points from \nour friends on the other side of the aisle. They claim that raising the \nminimum wage does not actually reduce poverty. They argue the minimum \nwage workers do not come from poor families or that no one stays at a \nminimum wage job long enough to be trapped in poverty.\n  Those all sound good on the talk shows, but the facts simply prove \nthose statements are not true. The fact is a majority of people who \nwould benefit from an increase in the minimum wage come from low-income \nhouseholds. Many of them have been trapped in jobs at or near the \nminimum wage for years and years at a time. Indeed, when you listen \nmore closely, the offensive underlying premise of all these arguments \nis that anyone can rise out of poverty if they just work harder.\n  Tell that to Nereida Castro of Des Moines. She and her husband both \nwork minimum wage jobs in the fast food and construction industries. \nThey have five children to support. But Nereida says they live day to \nday because of their bills and expenses. She said her family ``has to \nlimit many things to give to our kids to only make rent, to cover \nexpenses. We have to limit everything.''\n  A raise in the minimum wage would allow her to ``live a life where I \ndon't feel like I'm drowning.''\n  Tell that tale about ``you just have to work harder'' to Nancy \nSalgado, 27-year-old single mother with two kids, ages 2 and 7. She \nworked at McDonald's for the past 10 years but makes only $8.25 an \nhour. That is the minimum wage in her own State of Illinois. She \nstruggles to be able to pay for necessities such as milk and shoes for \nher kids. She recently confronted the president of McDonald's USA, \nsaying:\n\n       I'm a single mother of two. It's really hard for me to feed \n     my 2 kids and struggle day to day. . . . Do you think this is \n     fair, that I have to be making $8.25 an hour when I have been \n     working at McDonald's for 10 years?\n\n  For Senators and Representatives sitting comfortably here in \nWashington to preach to working mothers such as Nancy, struggling hard \nto get ahead, working 10 years at McDonald's--to tell them they are not \nworking hard enough, that is beyond offensive.\n  No one disputes that hard work is a big part of the path out of \npoverty, but you also need a basic foundation of economic security to \nstart building that better life. How are you supposed to pay for a \ncommunity college course on $7.25 an hour? How are you supposed to find \na better job when you are standing in line at a food bank because your \nwages won't cover all your household expenses, and neither will your \nfood stamps? How are you supposed to build a better life for your kids \nwhen you can't even find them safe childcare while you are at \nwork? They just can't get ahead if their job traps them in poverty.\n\n  It has not always been this way. We used to agree that minimum wage \nworks. People who perform some of the most difficult and essential jobs \nin our society should not have to live in poverty. The minimum wage \nkept families above the poverty line in the 1960s and 1970s. In today's \ndollars, a minimum wage worker in 1968--when the minimum wage was 120 \npercent of the poverty line--took home $10.71 an hour or $22,000 a year \nworking full time.\n  Since the 1980s, the minimum wage has not kept up. Today the minimum \nwage is about 80 percent of the level of poverty. This is how far we \nhave come down. The same family whose breadwinner worked at a job \nmaking minimum wage in 1968--look at where they\n\n[[Page S560]]\n\nare--would be way below the poverty line today. It is no wonder working \npeople have to turn to the safety net of food stamps and all other \nkinds of things just to help them get by.\n  A recent study found that our taxpayers have to pick up the tab for \nmillions of working families to the tune of about $240 billion a year \nfor food stamps, Medicaid/CHIP, earned-income tax credit, and temporary \nassistance to needy families. I wish to make it clear that these are \nnot people sitting at home watching TV. These are people who work, but \nthey are making minimum wage. What we want and what they want is not to \nhave the Government and the taxpayers pick up the tab. They want to be \nable to support themselves with the jobs they have.\n  We have to rectify this. My legislation, the Minimum Wage Fairness \nAct, which I introduced--along with Majority Leader Reid and \nCongressman George Miller on the House side--will raise the minimum \nwage to $10.10 an hour in three annual steps and will get it above the \npoverty line by 2016 for the first time in over 20 years. That is what \nwe are talking about--getting this minimum wage up.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate on both \nsides of the aisle sometime soon so we can bring this bill forward. I \nhope we can do it on a bipartisan basis and recognize it is indeed time \nto get families--working families--out of poverty by paying them a \ndecent minimum wage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp).

Madam President, last night President Obama laid out an \noptimistic vision for a great nation that must never stop working to \nbecome even greater.\n  When the President gave his first State of the Union in February of \n2009, our economy was losing over 700,000 jobs a month. Wall Street \nfirms had collapsed and taken Main Street businesses with them and \neconomists were not sure how deep it would go or if it would tip from a \ngreat recession into a true depression.\n  Families across the country were huddled around kitchen tables \ntalking late into the night trying to figure out how they were going to \nstay in their homes or send their kids to college or even put food on \ntheir table. People who had gone to work every single day of their \nadult lives and had not had to update their resume in 20 years didn't \nknow how they were going to pull their lives together if they got that \npink slip. Workers who had jobs they thought were secure were panicking \nknowing that if things continued to go wrong, nobody was truly safe.\n  A lot has changed in 5 years. It has not been perfect. It certainly \nhas not been smooth. We were not able to do nearly enough, and we still \nneed to do far more.\n  Last night President Obama was able to talk about the progress we \nhave made since he inherited the greatest economic crisis since the \nGreat Depression. He was able to talk about the 46 months of straight \nprivate sector growth, about an unemployment rate that has come down \nfrom dangerous heights. He talked about the work that still remains to \nhelp millions of workers still trying to get back on the job.\n  He articulated a vision not just for bolstering our still fragile \neconomic recovery but also for continuing the great American tradition \nof leaving our children with a stronger nation than the one we \ninherited from our parents--a vision of a country that makes sure every \nchild has an opportunity to work hard, contribute to their community, \nand succeed to the best of their ability. He spoke of a country that \ndoesn't just have economic growth at the top that may or may not \ntrickle down but that has broad-based prosperity built from the middle \nout and a vision of a country that offers workers and families the \nstability and security they expect when they put in a lifetime of hard \nwork.\n  President Obama talked about ways he is going to make this year a \nyear of action, and I know that is what the American people are \nexpecting. Some of that will come through executive action and public-\nprivate partnerships, but a lot of what we need to do depends on us in \nCongress.\n  Over the past few years Congress has been lurching, as we all know, \nfrom crisis to crisis, stumbling from one artificial deadline to the \nnext, and too often engaging in petty partisan bickering instead of \nsolving problems for the families we all represent.\n  At the end of last year, House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan \nand I worked together to show the American people it didn't have to be \nthis way. When we sat down together in a budget conference that \nDemocrats had been trying to start for 7 months, we faced an awful lot \nof skepticism. Many people were hoping we could reach a deal and avoid \nanother crisis. However, they were far more confident that this budget \ngroup would not succeed where so many others had failed.\n  Chairman Ryan and I decided to listen to each other. We searched for \ncommon ground and we made some compromises. We knew we were never going \nto agree on everything, but we didn't think that should mean we \ncouldn't agree on anything. We wanted a deal, not a fight, and we were \nable to put partisanship aside to do the right thing for the American \npeople.\n  Our 2-year budget deal was a step in the right direction. We proved \nthat bipartisanship was possible in this divided government, that \nDemocrats and Republicans could break through the bitterness and rancor \nand work together and reach an agreement. That deal rolled back the \ndamaging across-the-board cuts and prevented a government shutdown. It \nmoved our country forward, but we can't stop now because the vast \nmajority of Americans understand our economy simply is not working the \nway it needs for people like them.\n\n  We need to do more to expand economic opportunities for the families \nand small business owners and communities across the country who are \nlooking to us to get this right. They see the wealthiest Americans and \nbiggest corporations continue to take advantage of an unfair Tax Code \nfilled with special interest loopholes and giveaways. They see fewer \nand fewer opportunities for workers to find a job or earn enough for a \nstable middle-class life or send their kids to college. They watch as \ntheir government cuts back on critical investments in long-term and \nbroad-based economic growth, and they want more than partisan bickering \nfrom their elected representatives. They want real action.\n  We will spend a lot of time over the next few months talking about \nmany of the policies President Obama talked about last night, but I \nwish to focus on a few he mentioned that impact women and their \neconomic opportunities in particular.\n  We need to face the reality that working women across the country--\nand working moms in particular--are struggling to find work that pays a \nliving wage at a time when they are balancing being both the \nbreadwinner and caretaker in so many families. When we talk about \ncreating opportunity in America, we need to focus on the fact that \nwomen continue to be paid 77 cents for every $1 a man earns, and they \nmake up two-thirds of all minimum-wage workers. We need policy changes \nthat focus on all workers but also help women catch up if we are truly \ngoing to create economic opportunity that expands the middle class and \nstrengthens all of our families.\n  I was very glad to hear President Obama announce last night that he \nwill be raising the minimum wage for Federal contractors. We need to \nbuild on that to give millions more women and men in this country \naccess to a raise and make sure that working hard and having a job is \nrewarded. This is something we will be moving on in Congress in the \nnear future, and I am hoping Republicans decide to put politics aside \non this and work with us to get this done.\n  I was also very glad to hear President Obama double down on his \ncommitment to a national preschool initiative that would not only help \nour youngest children and pay dividends in future economic growth but \nwould empower millions of women who would be able to go to work and \ngive back to their communities. This is not just a policy for me, it is \npersonal. It is what got me into politics in the first place, and it is \nsomething that has driven me ever since.\n\n[[Page S561]]\n\n  As a former preschool teacher, I saw in my own classroom that when \nyoung children get the attention they need early, they will be miles \nahead of their peers on the path to success. I saw the students I had \nwho had been taught to simply raise their hand to ask a question or \nstand in line to go to recess; they were the ones who were more \nprepared to tackle a full curriculum when they got to school.\n  It is not just my personal experience. Study after study after study \nhas made it clear that beginning to educate our children at an early \nage means they will be less likely to be held back, less likely to \nrequire special education, less likely to engage in criminal activity, \nand ultimately they will be more likely to graduate from high school \nand earn more.\n  Investing in preschool is overwhelmingly supported, and it is \nsupported by the American people. In fact, the most recent polls show \nthat over 80 percent of Americans believe we should pursue this across \nthe country. It is strongly supported by the many people who truly \nunderstand the impact it will have on the ground.\n  I have talked to law enforcement officials who said they believe that \nearly education is the key to reducing crime. Business and innovation \nand education leaders have seen the long-term impact that investing in \nearly education has on our children and on our communities. We have to \nmake these investments in our children and our future and Congress \nneeds to act. Every day we wait is another opportunity lost. These are \njust a few of the policies President Obama talked about that I am ready \nto get work on.\n  The President also talked about the clear need to reform our \nimmigration system, support our veterans and our wounded warriors, \nreform our bloated and unfair Tax Code, and invest in our Nation's \ninfrastructure priorities. The American people are now expecting their \nelected officials to work together to tackle those issues, and many \nmore, over the coming months and years.\n  I am at the table. I am ready to build on that bipartisan foundation \nwe laid with the budget deal, but I am very worried that while the \nPresident and many of us in Congress are talking about working together \nto move the country forward, we have some Republicans who are already \ntalking about dragging us backward into another needless crisis. That \nis absurd. We went through this just a couple of months ago. There is \nno reason for Republicans to put this country through this again.\n  Republican leaders proved at the end of last year that they were not \ngoing to actually follow the tea party off the cliff and let the \ngovernment default. After a lot of drama and partisan posturing and \neconomic pain for millions of families, Republicans dropped their \ndemands and joined Democrats to reopen the government and avoid a \ndefault.\n  Republican leaders have said they are not going to let the country \ndefault this time either, but they now seem unable to stop playing \ngames with this issue to make the tea party happy.\n  I will be very clear on the floor: Democrats are not going to \nnegotiate over whether the government should pay its bills. If the \nRepublicans continue down this path of empty threats and taking \nhostages and dangerous demands, they will get exactly what they got \nlast time they tried to play politics with our economic recovery--\nnothing.\n  I call on my Republican colleagues to stop working on a wish list of \ndebt limit demands and hostages and stop thinking about the new threats \nthey are going to make to our economy and to the American people and \njoin us at the table to work on the real issues we need to address.\n  Democrats want to work with Republicans to tackle our challenges \nfairly and responsibly. That is what the President talked about last \nnight. It is what we are here to talk about today. But as Chairman Ryan \nand I showed just a few months ago, the way for both sides to get what \nthey want is through compromise and negotiation, not hostage-taking and \nnot threats.\n\n  The American people expect us to work together. They want more deals \nand fewer fights, and I know Democrats are ready to get to work. I am \nhopeful Republicans will work with us to make this year of action in \nCongress a reality.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I was privileged to be in our capital \ncity of Des Moines 2 days ago, on Monday, January 27, and I was \nprivileged to visit a lot of my friends in the Iowa legislature. I was \nin the Iowa House on Monday morning when a resolution was brought up by \nRepresentative Dan Muhlbauer and read and adopted unanimously. It was a \nresolution requesting the U.S. Congress to immediately enact a new \nFederal food, farm, and jobs bill. I won't read it all, but ultimately \nI will ask unanimous consent to have this resolution printed in the \nRecord. The resolution basically points out how much a farm bill means \nto our fellow Iowans.\n  The resolution states:\n\n       Be it resolved by the House of Representatives--\n\n  That is the Iowa House of Representatives--\n\n     that with the reconvening of the United States Congress after \n     its holiday recess, the United States House of \n     Representatives and the United States Senate should enact a \n     new food, farm, and jobs bill with all possible speed but no \n     later than January 31 of 2014.\n\n  I guess the good news I have now for Representative Muhlbauer and his \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle in the Iowa legislature is that \nwe heard them. Under the great leadership of Senator Stabenow, we now \nhave a farm bill ready to come to the floor after the House passes it, \nI hope sometime today. We hope to have it on the Senate floor maybe as \nearly as tomorrow--if not, the first of the week--to get the job done. \nI think everybody has signed off on it. It is a good farm bill. It has \ntaken a long time and a lot of hard work to get there, but a lot of \ngood people worked together on both sides of the aisle in both the \nSenate and in the House to get it done. So I thank Representative \nMuhlbauer and his colleagues for holding our feet to the fire and \nsending us this resolution.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record House \nResolution No. 102.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        House Resolution No. 102\n\n       Whereas, the United States Congress regularly establishes \n     agricultural and food policy in an omnibus farm bill in a \n     bipartisan spirit of cooperation, exemplified by the federal \n     Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-\n     246 which originally was to expire in 2012, but was extended \n     by the 112th Congress in the American Taxpayer Relief Act of \n     2012, Pub. L. No. 112-240; and\n       Whereas, a new food, farm, and jobs bill is critical to \n     maintaining a strong agricultural economy and an abundant \n     food supply that benefits all Americans, including by \n     providing programs relating to farm commodity support, \n     horticulture, livestock, conservation, nutrition assistance, \n     trade and international food aid, agricultural research, farm \n     credit, rural development, bioenergy, forestry, and \n     innovative strategies to revitalize this nation's rural \n     economy by creating jobs in small towns and rural \n     communities; and\n       Whereas, in Iowa, agricultural producers have faced a \n     multitude of disasters, including drought, flood, and \n     blizzard conditions which have been alleviated by disaster \n     assistance under farm bill programs; and\n       Whereas, during 2013, the United States Senate and House of \n     Representatives have been engaged in prolonged negotiations \n     to enact a new food, farm, and jobs bill that is now in \n     conference committee which is considering differences between \n     the Senate version, titled the Agriculture Reform, Food, and \n     Jobs Act of 2013 (S. 954), and the House version, titled the \n     Federal Agriculture Reform and Risk Management (FARRM) Act of \n     2013 (H.R. 2642); and\n       Whereas, without the passage of a new food, farm, and jobs \n     bill the United States will be subject to previously enacted \n     permanent law, including commodity price support statutes \n     effective in 1949; and\n       Whereas, the prolonged delay in passing a new food, farm, \n     and jobs bill has created uncertainty for agricultural \n     producers and will negatively impact the nation's overseas \n     trade; and\n       Whereas, without the immediate passage of a new food, farm, \n     and jobs bill consumers will increasingly suffer economic \n     consequences; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That with the \n     reconvening of the United States Congress after its holiday \n     recess, the United States House of Representatives and the \n     United States Senate should enact a new food, farm, and jobs \n     bill with all possible speed but no later than January 31, \n     2014; and be it further\n\n[[Page S562]]\n\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the President of the United States Senate and \n     the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the Honorable Debbie Stabenow, Chairwoman of \n     the Committee on Agriculture. Nutrition, and Forestry of the \n     United States Senate, and the Honorable Frank Lucas, Chairman \n     of the Committee on Agriculture of the United States House of \n     Representatives; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution shall be \n     transmitted to each member of the Iowa congressional \n     delegation; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the Honorable Tom Vilsack, Secretary of the \n     United States Department of Agriculture.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN.

The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/29/senate-section/article/S562-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S562-S565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, as someone who has practiced medicine \nin Wyoming for about a quarter of a century, and as medical director of \nthe Wyoming health fairs to bring low-cost blood screenings to people \nall around Wyoming, I have been very involved in the health care issue \nand in actually helping to provide health care for people.\n  It was ironic last night during the State of the Union Address to \nlisten to the President talk about health care as if he had some \nunderstanding of how it all worked. It became evident to me, sadly, \nthat the President put forth some bold proposals and then came out with \na 2,700-page bill that I think many people who voted for never read, \ndidn't understand, didn't know the harm it was going to do to American \nfamilies, and then the President last night was talking about it in the \nState of the Union Address in ways that it is actually helping people. \nIt may be helping some, but it is hurting many more. It is not just the \nWeb site. The Web site is the tip of the iceberg. There is huge damage \nbeing done to families.\n  Today I have a letter with me that just came in from a family in \nWyoming to talk about how much this is harming this person's individual \nfamily. A man from Upton, WY, a small community, somebody who tries to \nget up every day, go to work, take care of his family, put food on the \ntable. Yet his whole family is being harmed by this law the President \nhas put into place, forced down the throats of the American people on a \nparty-line vote.\n  So let me start with the letter:\n\n       Opening up my insurance letter today has lead me to write \n     you this letter. I'm usually the type of person that just \n     keeps trudging along--\n\n  I think all of us have constituents who are like this--\n\n     and take things as they come. I'm a longtime resident of this \n     beautiful state and graduated from the University of \n     Wyoming-- as so many people have done--\n       I'm married and have 4 young kids from ages 9 to 3.\n\n  He has four young kids ages 9 to 3. He said:\n\n       We're a healthy and active family. Non-smokers. Go to \n     doctors for emergency care only. Go to the chiropractor and \n     dentist regularly. I have a high deductible insurance plan.\n\n  It is a $10,000 deductible, which is high. He says he is paying $584 \na month for that. I wish the President of the United States would get \nletters such as this and read them and understand the impact he is \nhaving on people's lives and how much his plan is hurting American \nfamilies.\n  Justin writes:\n\n       Now, due to the current healthcare climate, I'm going to \n     have to pay $945 a month.\n\n  So he will be paying a lot more. He was paying $584, now $945 a \nmonth. He says:\n\n       And they conveniently raised my deductible to $11,000.\n\n  He had a $10,000 deductible, which is high. They have raised that, \nand raised his premiums from $584 to $945 a month. He says:\n\n       How does Obama expect the middle class to stretch their \n     budgets every month to get healthcare coverage?\n\n  That is what middle-class Americans want to know. How does this \nPresident expect the middle class to stretch their budgets every month \nto get health care coverage?\n  He goes on:\n\n       How can we get rid of ObamaCare?\n\n  That is a question I was asked repeatedly around the State of Wyoming \nlast week.\n  This gentleman goes on to say:\n\n       Every chance you get, please vote to repeal ObamaCare.\n\n  The President last night ridiculed people such as Justin--ridiculed \nhim--saying, Well, sure, vote over and over and over. This man from \nWyoming is saying: Every chance you get, vote to repeal ObamaCare.\n  He also said:\n\n       Every chance you get please help the middle class.\n\n  Every chance you get, please help the middle class. We are not seeing \nthat from this President, this administration, and those who supported \nthese policies which have hurt the middle class.\n  He said:\n\n       Thank you and I appreciate your leadership for the state of \n     Wyoming. Now I'll go back to working hard to pay my insurance \n     bill, (and probably some for the people that Obama is trying \n     to help.)\n\n  Finally he says:\n\n       Obama stated to the public that our premiums were not going \n     to rise. Thanks for listening to me rant.\n\n  I don't consider what we are hearing from my friend Justin from \nUpton, WY, a rant. I hear it as a cry for help due to a health care law \nthe President and the Democrats forced down the throats of the American \npeople against their will. Many people who voted for it never read it, \ndidn't understand it, and I really have strong doubts the President \nhimself understands the health care law, what is in it, and the damage \nit continues to do to middle-class Americans and families all across \nthis country.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, last night in the State of the Union \nMessage, the President looked at the Congress again and said: You need \nto be for my plan unless you have another plan, and suggested once \nagain that we have never had other plans. I don't know in a handful of \nminutes that I can do justice to the other plans out there, but I can \ntell my colleagues there were other alternatives that were filed in \nlegislation and that were debated in 2009. Clearly, today's \nexperiences, one of which has been shared by a family from Wyoming, \nwould be different experiences if we had looked at those other plans.\n  Let me very quickly respond to the President when he asked, What are \nyour ideas, and remind him again of what the ideas were that were \nproposed by people who thought we had the best health care system in \nthe world but thought it could be improved. Some thought there were \npeople who did not have the access they needed and there were rules \nthat could be changed to make a difference. Here is what some of them \nare.\n  One idea is to allow small business health plans. Most people get \ntheir insurance at work and they like what they have. Eighty-five \npercent of the people who had insurance last year got insurance at work \nand well over 90 percent of them thought what they had at work was good \nand met their needs. For years we have talked about ways to try to \nexpand that so people, whether their association is the farm bureau or \nsome other group they are associated with, where they can, through \nsmall businesses or associated health plans, get their health care plan \nthat way, so they too become members of a bigger group that competes \nfor health insurance through that group.\n  No. 2, expand coverage for young adults. The President said last \nnight that 3 million of the people have been added of the--he thought \nmaybe 12 million; I haven't seen that figure yet. A few days ago \nSenator Reid said it was 9 million people, and a third of the people \nwho had been added did so by staying on their parent's health care a \nlittle bit longer. That was the most uninsured group. The only person \nwho filed that legislation in the House as the principal sponsor was \nme--to let people stay on their insurance. We said age 25, not 26. So I \nsuppose the President added that 1 year to it, or whoever wrote the \nAffordable Health Care Act. But if that is right--I got the bill out \nthe other day here on the floor--it was 3 pages and 4 lines. If 3 pages \nhave\n\n[[Page S563]]\n\nsolved 25 to 33 percent of the problem, I guess maybe our side should \nhave come up with 12 pages of legislation and solved the whole problem. \nThis was not something that took 2,600 pages that nobody understood.\n  If we had that debate today, it would be a much better debate, \nbecause people have begun to understand how dangerous it is to deal \nwith the health care of individuals and families.\n  Medical liability reform makes a big difference in how costs and \ninsurance are impacted and how health care is done.\n  Increasing insurance flexibility lets people buy insurance across \nState lines. This is something that was out there as a significant idea \nthat didn't minimize the choices people have, it maximized the places \npeople could look to find out what their family needed.\n  As to preexisting conditions, we had a system that was dealing with \nthat pretty effectively if a person could get into it--the State high-\nrisk pools. We talked about ways to expand those. Why would that be \nbetter than where we are now? If an insurance company, a government--if \nin some way an entity is making that high-risk pool better--they know \nthey are dealing with individuals who had a preexisting condition. It \nis not necessary to try to structure everybody else's costs so they pay \na lot more just in case people with a preexisting condition become an \nunreasonable part of an insurance group that an entity is trying to \nprovide for. These programs have been closed as of December 31 in most \nStates. And in every case we have been contacted on, people who had \npreexisting conditions, were in a high-risk pool, are paying more for \ninsurance with less coverage and, in many cases, can't get their \ndoctor. And these are people who had a preexisting condition so who \ntheir doctor was mattered to them. In many cases, they no longer can \nhave that doctor.\n  Clearly, I don't have time today to respond fully to the President. \nWhether it is high-risk pools that work better, wellness programs, \npreventing insurance companies from being able to cancel policies--that \ndidn't require millions of taxpayer dollars; it just requires a rule \nthat said they can't cancel a policy because somebody gets sick. The \nsame as limits on coverage.\n  As for encouraging health savings accounts, the Affordable Care Act \neliminates one of the real tools that was working for families.\n  As far as more transparency, how do health care providers do and how \nmuch do they charge to do it? What are their results and what are their \ncosts?\n  And income tax treatment so that everybody who buys insurance buys \nthat with dollars that are treated the same way. If the biggest company \nin America can buy an insurance policy and have it nontaxed, have it \ntax deductible, so should the individual who buys insurance on their \nown.\n  There are all kinds of alternatives out there that would work better \nthat are not nearly as complicated and not nearly as expensive. The \nPresident needs to at least understand there are plenty of competing \nideas. His ideas are not the only ideas that will work to make the \nsystem work better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, surprisingly, the President didn't talk \nmuch about ObamaCare, his signature achievement. The people of \nArkansas, the people of America certainly are talking a great deal \nabout it and they are writing a great deal about it also. The reason is \nbecause they are so concerned that health care has become an absolute \nmess.\n  The President talked about a single mom who was able to resolve the \nproblem of her preexisting conditions. I think we all agree that is \nsomething that was desperately needed. I am an optometrist, an eye \ndoctor, and very much aware of the situations people have been put in, \nin the past. Although the reality is we can fix this problem--problems \nsuch as this--without creating a massive bureaucracy, without creating \na situation where we have thousands of pages of regulations, and the \nreality is the unintended consequences of the situation we are in now \nwith ObamaCare is that we have made it unaffordable. We have made it \nsuch that millions of Americans simply cannot afford the health \ninsurance they are being offered.\n  Let me talk about a few people who have written to me to talk about \ntheir situation. Jack from Springdale writes:\n\n       I just found out recently from my current health insurance \n     provider that my current health insurance policy will be \n     discontinued effective the first of next year, and a \n     replacement policy will be approximately double which will be \n     around $1,200 per month. My question is, is this what \n     ObamaCare was supposed to do? And if not, what can be done \n     about it?\n\n  Leonard and JoAnne write:\n\n       This letter comes to you to ask for your needed support to \n     defeat/defund the Affordable Care Act in any way possible.\n       We recently received notification from Health Advantage of \n     Arkansas that our 2014 monthly premiums increased $173.70 for \n     a total of $1,360.06. Our out of pocket max increased from \n     $3,000 to $5,000, the primary care physician co-pay increased \n     from $25 to $35 and the specialist co-pay increased from $35 \n     to $70. If either of us has to visit the ER, that co-pay \n     increased from $100 to $250 dollars. The drug co-pay also \n     increased. We are insulted to have to pay for benefits such \n     as maternity, pediatric dental, and drug rehab which we have \n     no need for since we are in our 60s and do not use drugs or \n     alcohol. Health Advantage of Arkansas explained that these \n     changes to our policy and increased costs were due to \n     compliance to ACA.\n       We have supported you in the past and would like to know \n     what your plan is to relieve Arkansans and other Americans \n     from these additional financial burdens imposed upon us by \n     the Affordable Care Act.\n\n  Mary in Little Rock writes that she received a notice that her Medi-\nPak Advantage plan was canceled at the end of last year. She explains:\n\n       I had no idea that Obamacare was going to also affect \n     Medicare. Now, to receive comparable coverage for 2014, I \n     will have to pay an additional $500+ in premiums. This \n     additional cost will definitely place an unfair burden on my \n     finances. What are you & the Senate going to do to correct \n     this situation?\n\n  I think Mary asks a very fair question. What are we going to do to \ncorrect her situation and the situation of so many others? I think the \nanswer is we need to repeal ObamaCare. We need to put in place a system \nthat does take care of the problems we have but without the \nbureaucracy, without the tremendous expense, and make health care \naffordable for all Americans.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaine). The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of my colleague \nfrom Arkansas and prior to him those of my colleagues from Missouri and \nWyoming--we will be hearing in a minute from my colleague from \nNebraska--all of whom are expressing sentiments that are conveyed to \nthem by their constituents in their individual States about the very \nreal and very personal impacts ObamaCare is having on them.\n  Last night, in the President's State of the Union speech, he sort of \nglanced over that issue. It is kind of the equivalent of a driveby. He \nsort of acknowledged the law. He said it is not going to change and if \nRepublicans have better ideas, then come forward with them.\n  We just heard the Senator from Missouri, Mr. Blunt, list 10 or 12 \nthings that we think could be done that would be dramatically different \nand would be a dramatic improvement in a very different approach from \nwhat is included in ObamaCare, which is a heavyhanded, government-\ndriven solution to health care, which essentially puts the health care \nin this country, which is one-sixth of our economy, under political \ncontrol here in Washington, DC.\n  As a consequence, what we are seeing out there are higher premiums, \nhigher out-of-pocket costs in the form of deductibles and copays, \ncanceled coverages, and fewer choices when it comes to doctors and \nhospitals. That has been the real-world impact of the passage of \nObamaCare. The President said when he was running for office he was \ngoing to reduce health care costs by $2,500 per family. We now know \nthey have gone up, since he has taken office, by about $2,500 per \nfamily, and they continue to go up all the time.\n  We hear consistently from our constituents in our individual States, \nand those stories that are being shared this morning are good examples \nagain of the real-world impact of this law and why it is so important \nwe go back, start over, and do this the right way, with reforms that \nactually address the issue of creating more competition, more choice \nfor individuals, allowing market forces in the world of health care as \nopposed to having this overreaching government approach, which clearly \nhas not worked.\n\n[[Page S564]]\n\n  The one thing I and many of us got up and talked about when ObamaCare \nwas being debated was the fact that there was not anything in there \nthat constrained utilization or that put downward pressure on costs. So \ncosts keep going up. That keeps getting passed on. Taxes keep going up. \nThey keep getting passed on. What does that mean? For middle-class \nfamilies it means higher premiums and higher deductibles, higher \ncopays, and in many cases fewer jobs because that is the impact it is \nhaving on the economy, and it worsens the very thing the President says \nhe is most concerned about; that is, the issue of income inequality. \nBecause when you are driving up the cost for consumers in their daily \nlives--and I would say health care for most people is a very \nsignificant cost and I would add energy to that--but those are a couple \nof things where we have seen policies that have made it more expensive \nfor middle-class Americans to make ends meet. Health care is certainly \nan example of that.\n  I would like to share a couple examples from my State. Of course, as \nhas been mentioned earlier by my colleagues, we hear these stories in \nthe form of emails, letters, phone calls coming into our offices. Lest \nanybody think what we do is done in a vacuum, these are not abstract \nissues. These are very real personal experiences that people across \nthis country are having.\n  This is a letter from a constituent in Harrisburg, SD, which is a \ngrowing community near Sioux Falls, SD. It is a growing, vibrant \ncommunity. The letter says:\n\n       My wife and I have been fortunate to have become small \n     business owners and entrepreneurs. So far, we have been \n     successful of living the American dream for the last 3 years \n     and have seen great success at what we do.\n       Unfortunately, with ObamaCare, we are needing to make \n     choices I never thought we would have to make.\n       Based upon the rates for health insurance, we would be \n     paying approximately $800 out of pocket per month. \n     Essentially, we are thrown in to make an additional house \n     payment per month, or face a penalty at the end of the year \n     and not have health insurance.\n\n  This constituent goes on to say:\n\n       Needless to say, I am very disappointed and upset right \n     now. I feel I am being taken advantage of because I am a \n     small business owner and wanted to live the ``American \n     Dream.''\n\n  This next statement is from another constituent who is from Rapid \nCity, and this is in the form of a letter regarding the President's \nbroken promises. He says:\n\n       Bottom line is the president lied to us. He said if we like \n     our policy we can keep it. He said we would be saving around \n     $2,500 a year. Wrong on both Accounts.\n\n  He then concludes:\n\n       When our policy expires it will be cancelled and we will \n     have to pay almost triple what we're paying now.\n\n  Those are examples from my State of South Dakota, and my colleague \nfrom Arkansas shared some examples from his State. I know my colleague, \nmy neighbor from Nebraska, Senator Johanns, hears many of those same \nstories coming from his State. He represents people very much like \nthose I represent in South Dakota who in many cases make their living \nthe same way and are experiencing the economic consequences of a bad \npolicy, a failed policy, a bad law that was rushed through here, and \nthey now--the American people--unfortunately, are experiencing the \nadverse impacts of that in their own personal economic lives and, in a \nbroader sense, on our economy nationally. Higher costs, canceled \ncoverages, fewer choices in the form of doctors and hospitals, and \nfewer jobs for American workers whom we want to get back to work, that \nis the real-world experience.\n  There is a better way. The Senator from Missouri talked about many of \nthose ideas. I hope the President would work with us to repeal this bad \nlaw and start over in a way that makes sense for the American people \nand for our health care economy in this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I wish to express my appreciation to \nSenator Boozman and Senator Thune for being down here this morning to \ntalk about an issue that is extremely important and an issue we \ncertainly are hearing a lot about in our Senate offices and hearing a \nlot about when we travel back to our home States; that is, the whole \nissue of ObamaCare.\n  The President, of course, mentioned this in his State of the Union \nlast night, and I think he truly hopes he can change the subject here. \nBut the reality is he cannot because so many people are being hurt by \nthis legislation.\n  Over 4 years ago, when the health care law was being debated, there \nwas one concern that dominated the discussion when we talked to our \nconstituents back home. That concern was cost. They talked about the \nrising cost of health care and wanted to see what we thought in terms \nof this law's impact on that. But since this year's rates were posted, \nit has become absolutely obvious that this law did not hold true to its \npromise to reduce costs.\n  Our Nebraska insurance director was asked to comment about this when \nthe rates were coming out. He said: ``Basically, the rates are going \nup.'' No truer words could have been spoken.\n  A CNBC headline read: ``Consumers say they're shelling out more for \nhealth insurance.''\n  But it is not just those headlines or the opinion of our director of \ninsurance. It is what is happening to real people in their lives.\n  A father from just outside Omaha, NE, wrote a letter to me, and he \nsaid this: In 2013, his family's flexible spending account was cut from \n$5,000 a year to $2,500 a year as a result of the health care law.\n  If there was one thing people appreciated, it was the flexible \nspending account. Why you would want to cut this does not make any \nsense, but that is what the health care law did to him. He goes on to \nsay that his wife's employer-sponsored insurance premiums have \nincreased by an incredible 50 percent and their deductible and maximum \nout-of-pocket costs--well, they have not gone down--have gone up too, \nand these increases have been the worst they have seen in 14 years of \nemployment, all due to the health care law.\n  His sons who are struggling to pay for college had their work hours \nrestricted to 28 hours a week. Why? Because of the law. So as a result \nthey are applying for more financial aid, they are going further in \ndebt, and even taking on part-time jobs so they can stay in school.\n  But that is not the only person who has written to me. A Nebraskan \nfrom the south central part of the State reports this: He spent 27 \nhours trying to enroll on healthcare.gov only to find out he could not \nafford coverage, even with a premium subsidy. Under the best option, \nhis deductible would increase by $7,000.\n  To a middle-class family, $7,000 out of pocket is bankruptcy. They do \nnot have it. It is not like that money is going to fall out of the sky.\n  A young traveling nurse from northeastern Nebraska also faced sticker \nshock and reached out to me. Under a new plan, her premium more than \ndoubled and her deductible went from $3,500 to $6,500. She wrote to me \nand said: ``This is not affordable when I have student loans to pay for \nand I'm trying to support myself.''\n  It is possible some Nebraskans have temporarily renewed their old \npolicy under the delay that was announced by the President, but that \njust means they have delayed the pain until next year, and we will see \nmore of these stories of skyrocketing costs and deductibles.\n  Let's face it. Americans did not get what they were promised when the \nlaw was passed. They expected a bill that would deliver on the promises \nand address the cost of health care. Instead, they are stuck with the \nvery real consequences of a poorly crafted policy.\n  I think it is time we show Americans we can do better. I believe the \nplace to start is to repeal the law and start working on step-by-step \nsolutions that draw down health care costs for American families.\n  Those of us on the floor today are ready to tackle the challenge. I \nhope we find willing partners.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S565]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/29/senate-section/article/S565-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I first wish to thank Senator \nMenendez, Senator Landrieu, and Senator Isakson for their tremendous \nleadership on the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act, of which \nI am a very proud cosponsor, and for working with me and my staff on an \namendment that is so critical to so many New Yorkers who are still \nrecovering from Superstorm Sandy.\n  My amendment is quite simple and common sense. It is aimed to help \nhomeowners who are currently stuck in a bureaucratic ditch that is \nimpossible for them to climb out of due to the immovable reality of the \nbuildings in which they live.\n  Under today's FEMA policy, flood insurance premium rates are based on \nthe elevation of the house relative to the base flood elevation, which \nis the elevation that FEMA calculates that floodwaters have a 1-percent \nchance of rising to in any given year.\n  Under normal circumstances, homes can be elevated to avoid high \ninsurance rates that are assessed on homes that are built below the \nbase flood elevation in special flood hazard areas, but in places such \nas New York and New Jersey this is impossible for owners of older urban \nhomes, such as brownstones, row houses, and multifamily buildings, \nwhich can predate the Civil War, which in many instances cannot be \nraised due to structural characteristics and were built before flood \nmaps were in place.\n  When their homes are mapped in a flood zone, they are simply left \nwithout any option to lower their flood insurance premiums, which can \nbe as high as tens of thousands of dollars each year. To fix this, my \namendment would require FEMA to provide a uniform set of guidance that \nprovides FEMA-approved methods of mitigation for homeowners who simply \ncannot elevate their homes. This amendment would require FEMA to look \nat whether a homeowner has implemented any of the prescribed \nalternatives and take that into consideration when calculating a home's \nflood insurance risk premium. By providing a clear set of mitigation \nalternatives to these homeowners, this amendment will help New Yorkers \nand homeowners across the country who cannot elevate their homes to \nreduce their flood risk. It will help homeowners prevent costly damage \nto their homes during the next storm or flood and save money and \npotential disaster recovery costs in the long term.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the flood \ninsurance fix bill on the floor today. I urge my colleagues on a \nbipartisan basis to come together and pass this first crucial step \ntoward getting it right with the National Flood Insurance Program. It \nis important for America. It is important for millions upon millions of \nAmerican homeowners, not just in Louisiana, not just in Florida, but in \nevery State. Every State in the country is absolutely affected.\n  I also specifically urge my colleagues to defeat the Toomey \namendment, which I think is very well intended but will not get the job \ndone, and to waive the budget point of order, which is a largely \ntechnical point of order. I will explain each of those in turn.\n  First of all, I will explain the need for this bill to get things \nright. All of us came together over a year ago and passed the so-called \nBiggert-Waters Act, to reauthorize the National Flood Insurance Program \nand to reform it in important ways. We needed to do that broad-brush. \nThe program needed to be continued, and not just in short-term fits and \nstarts, which had been the pattern for many years. In fact, in 2010 it \nwas so bad that we actually let the program lapse four different times \nby inaction, shutting down thousands upon thousands of real estate \nclosings that we needed to build our economy, shutting those down every \ntime. So we needed that reauthorization. We needed and still need \nreforms of the program. We need to build up the program to make it \nfiscally sustainable, to make sure that over time we get revenues, \npremiums coming in that cover the full cost of the program. There is no \ndebate about that. That is why we passed that bill.\n  What was not foreseen was that in some significant number of cases, \nthose reforms, once they were put into effect, would actually lead to \ncompletely unaffordable rate increases--a completely unsustainable path \nforward that would not even get us toward the goal of building up the \nfund and building up the program to make it fiscally sustainable. No \nexpert predicted that beforehand. No one from FEMA said:\n\n[[Page S567]]\n\nYou will have some rates that are completely unaffordable. No outside \ninsurance experts said that. But once the details of the \nreauthorization began to be put in place, that became very apparent. We \ndo not know exactly how many cases we would have like this, but we know \nthey are not just isolated cases. We know they are not just in coastal \ncommunities. They are in every State, to some extent or another, around \nthe country. Over time, Members of both parties from every State have \nbegun to understand that, which brings us together hopefully in a \nconstructive way on the floor today.\n  Certainly, that situation is dire and the threat is very real in \nLouisiana. Months ago, for instance, I visited a neighborhood in St. \nCharles Parish, which is part of southeast Louisiana, right on the \nMississippi River. I visited a very nice, solid middle-class \nneighborhood. I met with many homeowners there. They presented me with \na box--a box this big, at least--full of keys, house keys. They were \nthese folks' actual house keys. They were saying: If this is not fixed, \nif this is not done right in time, we are going to have to turn these \nkeys in to the banks, to the government, to whomever, because we would \nface not only premium increases. We had all accepted premium increases \nas part of the reform and as part of the reauthorization, but these \nwould be completely unaffordable, unsustainable increases--literally \ngoing to $12,000, $18,000 or $27,000 a year--not on a millionaire's \nhome but on a modest middle-class home. That just doesn't work.\n\n  These folks were saying very sincerely, very directly: Here are my \nhome keys because that is where this is headed.\n  That is not right on so many different levels. First and foremost, it \nis not right for those Americans who have lived by the rules every step \nof the way, who built to the right elevation when they built their \nhome, who got the flood insurance required by law, required by \nprudence, and paid all of their premiums. They went through mitigation \nprograms, if they could, to raise their homes in many cases.\n  These are folks who are not living right on the coast, who are not \nchoosing highly dangerous areas, and who do not have second homes, \nbeach homes. We are not talking about that at all. We are talking about \na solid middle-class neighborhood way off the gulf coast.\n  These are people who followed the rules every step of the way who \nstill failed the prospect of those completely unaffordable increases. \nThat is not right, and it is not fair.\n  On a second level, that reality threatens whole communities and it \nthreatens our economy because if that were allowed to happen in any \nsignificant number of cases, it would be an economic spiral downward. \nBanks would be burdened with foreclosures. Local businesses would be \nhurt significantly. Whole communities would be in an economic spiral \ndownward.\n  We are not just talking about second homes on a beach. We are not \ntalking about that at all in Louisiana. This bill does not give any \nrelief regarding second homes, for instance. We are talking about a lot \nof communities and a real and unsustainable hit to our economy.\n  On a third and final level, that reality would ensure we don't even \nget to the goal of these reforms, which is to make the system whole and \nfiscally sustainable. To do that we need more folks in the National \nFlood Insurance Program, not folks leaving and turning in their keys. \nThat will kill any effort to make the program solid fiscally and \nsustainable fiscally. So on every level we cannot allow this to happen.\n  The Menendez-Isakson bill, with the help of many other Members, \nincluding myself, was put together to get us to the right place. It \ntakes the important first step to make sure we get it right, FEMA does \nthe mapping correctly--which they are not doing in some cases now--and \nFEMA does the affordability study mandated in the original Biggert-\nWaters, but which FEMA has not even begun yet. We do all those things \nto get this right and avoid completely unaffordable rate increases.\n  I urge my colleagues on a bipartisan basis to support this good bill.\n  We also need your support in defeating the Toomey amendment and in \nwaiving the budget point of order. Let me speak about those briefly.\n  Senator Toomey's amendment is very well intended, but it falls short, \nin my opinion. It limits any delay in rate increases to 2 years, and \nsome rate increases continue for those 2 years. Most importantly, it \ndoesn't mandate and ensure that FEMA ever gets through this \naffordability study, ever makes recommendations to Congress for the \nultimate fix, and doesn't give us any time to react and legislate in \nthat area. It doesn't ensure in any way that FEMA gets its mapping \nright based on true sound science and engineering methodologies.\n  That is just kicking the can down the road and not ensuring in any \nmeaningful way that we are going to get it right. That simply isn't \ngood enough.\n  We need to tie in any delay to figuring out the ultimate fix by \nhaving FEMA complete its affordability study, by making FEMA make \nrecommendations to us, by giving us 6 months to act on those \nrecommendations, by mandating that FEMA do its mapping correctly and \nnot have rate increases before it rushes forward with incorrect \nmapping, which is going on right now in some cases.\n  That is what the underlying bill does. That is what the Toomey \namendment does not do--as well intended as it is.\n  Secondly, there will be a budget point-of-order vote, and we do need \n60 votes to waive that budget point of order. I will vote ``yes'' to \nwaive it--as a strong fiscal conservative--because this is necessary to \nget this national flood insurance system right and to make it fiscally \nsustainable.\n  In fact, over the 10-year budget window that we normally use in \nscoring, this bill has no score over those 10 years. It only has some \nscores in some intermediate periods of time, which gives rise to the \nbudget point of order.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote to waive that point of order, knowing \nthere is no score over 10 years and also knowing that, quite frankly, \nthe fiscal assumptions about the current law are enormously flawed. The \nnotion that we are going to make the National Flood Insurance Program \nmore stable and more fiscally sustainable by having a bunch of premiums \ngo up to $27,000 a year on a modest middle-class home is crazy. That is \nnot going to get us to a better place. That is going to get to us a \nworse place. That is going to shrink the program and have people leave \nthe program--paying no premiums, not paying higher premiums.\n  Yet raising insurance premiums has to be part of the solution, but \nunaffordable premium increases aren't part of the solution because \npeople can't afford to pay them. So they will pay zero instead of \nsomething substantial. They will leave the program instead of putting \nmore homeowners and properties in the program, which is essential to \nget to a strong and stable fiscal situation.\n  Again, on a bipartisan basis, I urge my colleagues to support this \nbill--it is a very important step to stabilize and fix the situation--\nto defeat the Toomey amendment and to waive the budget point of order, \nwhich is absolutely necessary in this process to support a good bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I thank the Senator from Louisiana for his input into \nthe legislation, his work, and his advocacy. I agree with him on the \nother underlying statements that he made, particularly as it relates to \nthe necessity for the legislation, as well as the opposition to the \nToomey amendment.\n  I understand what Senator Toomey is trying to do, but I agree it \ndoesn't meet the ultimate challenge. I agree as well on the budget \npoint of order for the reason Senator Vitter says.\n  I thank the Senator for his support.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nthat takes place during any subsequent quorum calls--or the subsequent \nquorum call that I am going to ask\n\n[[Page S568]]\n\nfor--be equally divided on the Gillibrand amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Tribute to Hadiya Pendleton\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Hadiya \nPendleton, lost to gunfire 1 year ago today, January 29, 2013. She was \n15 years old. She was gunned down while she was standing with friends \nat a park in Chicago's South Side.\n  She was a very talented, caring girl with a bright future. She was a \nsophomore at King College Prep, an honor student, and a majorette in \nthe school band. This is her photograph. Those who knew her talk about \nher warm heart, her big smile, and what a great friend she was to all \nof those around her.\n  A week before her death, Hadiya was in Washington, DC, performing \nwith her school band for President Barack Obama's inaugural \ncelebration. She was absolutely thrilled that as a high school student \nshe could come out and perform for the President she loved.\n  Days afterwards she was gunned down, murdered by men who allegedly \nmistook Hadiya and her friends for members of a rival street gang. I \njoin with those in Chicago and across America who mourn this grim \nanniversary and I extend my condolences to her family.\n\n  This last week or two--even longer now--it has been pretty cold in \nChicago, bitter cold: snow, ice, with people not going outside much. \nBut I wanted to make a trip Saturday morning to visit Hadiya's mom and \ndad on the occasion of this sad anniversary. Her mom Cleo, her father \nNate, and her 11-year-old brother Nate, Jr., as well as the extended \nfamily, are mourning her loss.\n  We sat in their apartment Saturday morning and talked a little about \nher. We talked about what it meant, what the reaction had been. The \nparents were heartened that King College Prep had not forgotten their \ndaughter, that today they were having a special observance and ceremony \nto remember her. It meant a lot to her mom and dad.\n  They have been here before my judiciary subcommittee when we \ndiscussed issues involving gun violence. They have been on television. \nThey have made the rounds. But when you are there with them in their \napartment, you know that after the cameras are gone and all the \nvisitors are gone, it is still a sad remembrance of a beautiful young \ngirl whose life was cut short.\n  No family should have to experience what they went through, but like \nso many families who have lost loved ones to sudden violence, the \nPendletons have decided to dedicate themselves to turning their pain \ninto purpose. They are working to reduce the scourge of gun violence so \nthat other families can be spared. They have established the Hadiya \nPendleton Foundation in Chicago to create a safe space for city youth \nand provide afterschool enrichment programs to help kids avoid the \nviolence on the streets.\n  Incidentally, Hadiya was once featured in a public service \nannouncement video where she said: It is your job as students to say no \nto gangs and yes to a great future. The foundation named after her will \nhelp other students reach that goal. I commend the family for their \nwork on this foundation. I believe it will make a difference.\n  Hadiya's family, as I mentioned, traveled to Washington to talk about \nour laws and how to change them to avoid future violence. In \nparticular, they have spoken out about the need to crack down on the \ngun supply to gang members. The current Federal laws on what we call \nstraw purchasing and gun trafficking are an embarrassment. They are too \nweak. They need to be strengthened. I have joined with my colleague \nSenator Mark Kirk, my Republican colleague, in a bipartisan effort, and \na number of our colleagues have joined us to introduce tough \nlegislation to crack down on the straw purchasing and trafficking. We \ncall this bill the ``Stop Illegal Trafficking in Firearms Act.'' Mark \nKirk likes to call it the Hadiya Pendleton Act. We agreed to name that \nkey section after her since we believe this legislation just might \nreduce the senseless gang shootings such as the one that took her life.\n  Straw purchasing, for any who don't understand it, is when a thug's \ngirlfriend, who has no criminal record, goes to buy the gun and then \nhands it to him to commit a crime. He can't buy it. He couldn't walk in \nthe store and buy it. He could never pass the background check, but she \ndoes. And when she passes it, she hands him the gun, and unfortunately \nviolence and death can be the result.\n  Last April, our antitrafficking legislation got 58 votes on the floor \nof the Senate--58 votes--to stop the trafficking of guns into the hands \nof criminals. That was a few votes short of what we needed. We are \nclose. Our job is to convince just two or three more Senators to join \nus.\n  The Pendleton family understands that even though this law seems so \nobvious, so reasonable, and can save the lives of innocent people, it \nis going to be hard to come by. There is a gun lobby here in this town. \nThey are very powerful. Their allies will do everything they can to \nfight even the most popular commonsense reform, such as cracking down \non illegal gun trafficking.\n  The gun lobby says we shouldn't pass any new gun laws and that we \nshould just enforce the laws already on the books. Actually, the gun \nlobby is in court every day trying to strike down the laws already on \nthe books. But the bottom line is the gun lobby always seems to oppose \nlaws that might reduce gun sales. They just want volume--volume of \nfirearms sold. If they had their way, no questions would be asked.\n  It is time to crack down on the sale of guns that end up in the hands \nof criminals and gang members. We need to push forward in Congress and \nstatehouses and in the law enforcement community with strong efforts to \ncut off the supply of straw-purchased, illegally trafficked guns. The \npath may not be easy but it is the right path. And if we succeed, we \nwill prevent crimes and save lives.\n  I want to commend the Pendleton family for the courage they have \nshown in the face of their tragic loss. I commend them for their \nefforts to try to spare other families. I hope lawmakers will reflect \nfor one brief moment about this good family, who lost this great \ndaughter and now has dedicated a big part of their lives to preventing \nshootings in the future. We owe Hadiya and her mom and dad and her \nmemory our best efforts to make this a safer America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELLER.

AUTHORITY OF STATES TO REGULATE PRIVATE FLOOD \n                   INSURANCE.\n\n       Section 102(b)(7) of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of \n     1973 (42 U.S.C. 4012a(b)(7)) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(7) Private flood insurance defined.--In this subsection, \n     the term `private flood insurance' means an insurance policy \n     that--\n       ``(A) provides flood insurance coverage;\n       ``(B) is issued by an insurance company that is--\n\n[[Page S569]]\n\n       ``(i) licensed, admitted, or otherwise approved to engage \n     in the business of insurance in the State or jurisdiction in \n     which the insured building is located, by the insurance \n     regulator of that State or jurisdiction; or\n       ``(ii) eligible as a nonadmitted insurer to provide \n     insurance in the State or jurisdiction where the property to \n     be insured is located, in accordance with section 524 of the \n     Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (15 \n     U.S.C. 8204); and\n       ``(C) is issued by an insurance company that is not \n     otherwise disapproved as a surplus lines insurer by the \n     insurance regulator of the State or jurisdiction where the \n     property to be insured is located.''.\n\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I am here today to talk about the Heller-\nLee amendment to the flood insurance legislation we are currently \nconsidering. One of my core beliefs is that in order for Americans to \nsucceed, regardless of the issue, we need more choices, we need higher \ncompetition, and we also need less cost. So let us talk about the NFIP.\n  Right now, the National Federal Insurance Program has a near monopoly \non the flood insurance market. In fact, I think if you ask most \nAmericans if they knew there were other flood insurance policies other \nthan through NFIP, you would probably get a blank stare. What most \npeople don't know is that since the passage of the National Flood \nInsurance Act of 1968, private flood insurance has been understood to \nsatisfy requirements and mandates to purchase flood insurance. In fact, \nwhen Congress passed the last flood insurance reform package under \nBiggert-Waters, Congress reaffirmed the intent that private primary \nflood insurance should satisfy requirements and those of mandatory \npurchase.\n  Unfortunately, due to the lack of legislative language, there have \nbeen pervasive rejections of private primary flood insurance by most \nlenders. This is due to the fact that lenders are unsure about the \nvalidity of private-issue flood insurance, despite the fact this \ninsurance has been issued and accepted in the past. For this reason, I, \nalong with Senator Lee, have worked on an amendment that would provide \nclarification and hopefully eliminate this uncertainty.\n  The Heller-Lee amendment provides a simple and clear definition of \nwhat is acceptable private flood insurance. Our amendment would define \nacceptable private flood insurance as a policy that provides flood \ninsurance coverage issued by an insurance company that is licensed, \nadmitted, or otherwise approved to engage in the business of insurance \nin the State or jurisdiction in which the insured building is located.\n  Private insurers are already subject to statutes and regulations in \neach and every State. State insurance commissioners are the best \nregulators to allow and disallow any policy they deem proper or \nimproper, and they have significant ability to assure fair and \nequitable settlements of claims.\n  Further encouragement of private sector participation in the flood \ninsurance market will help reduce the risks to which U.S. taxpayers are \ncurrently exposed. In fact, I would like to share some statements I \njust received from FEMA, after I asked FEMA if private flood insurance \nis a viable tool for some consumers to find lower cost options. FEMA \nstated:\n\n       Private flood insurance would create competition. It is \n     possible some homeowners could find lower-cost options for \n     flood insurance as a result of privatized market competition.\n\n  So I ask my colleagues to support the Heller-Lee amendment so we can \ngive the American public more choices, higher competition, and less \ncost when it comes to flood insurance.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. I ask to speak in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has the floor.\n\n\n                               obamacare\n\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, I rise today on behalf of the 18,000 \nNebraskans who have contacted me to express their concerns with the \nnegative impacts of Obamacare.\n  Rather than addressing these problems in last night's State of the \nUnion address, the President doubled down on the failed policy.\n  Well, the President has had his chance to speak. Now it is time for \nmy constituents to have their voices heard.\n  The law is hurting my constituents. It is hurting middle class \nfamilies. We now know that millions of Americans have lost their \nprivate health insurance.\n  Many who have successfully enrolled in the exchange have been forced \ninto plans that do not meet their families' needs. These plans often \ncost more but cover less.\n  Treatments, even for those battling cancer, have been delayed.\n  We learned this month that a woman named Josie Gracchi--who was \ndiagnosed with breast cancer--recently lost her doctors. She was forced \nto postpone her scheduled biopsy and follow-up treatment. The reason: \nJosie's insurance rolled over into a new plan in an exchange under \nObamacare at the start of the New Year.\n  Seniors are losing their trusted doctors, too.\n  Americans are disclosing deeply personal information--including their \nhealth care histories and Social Security numbers--to a flawed website \nripe for hacking.\n  If truth in advertising rules applied to Obamacare, it would be \nbanned as an unfair and unreliable product. Let me give you an example. \nWe were all told that this massive law would dramatically expand \ncoverage for the uninsured. Yet a recent Wall Street Journal article \ncites a McKinsey study that undermined this promise.\n\n       Only 11 percent of consumers who bought new coverage under \n     the law were previously uninsured, according to a McKinsey & \n     Co. survey of consumers thought to be eligible for the \n     health-law marketplaces.\n       One reason for people declining to purchase plans was \n     affordability. That was cited by 52% of those who had shopped \n     for a new plan but not purchased one in McKinsey's most \n     recent sampling, performed in January.\n\n  As it turns out, the ``Affordable Care'' Act is hardly affordable, \nand the vast majority of those who purchased insurance through the \nexchanges already had health insurance.\n  Last week the CEO of Aetna, a major insurance company, said Obamacare \nwas not attracting enough uninsured people to work. He said more \npremium increases are on the horizon.\n  ``Are they going to be double-digit,'' he said, ``or are we going to \nget beat up because they're double-digit or are we just going to have \nto pull out of the program?''\n  And recently Moody's downgraded health insurers from stable to \nnegative based on uncertainty related to Obamacare. The downgrade is a \nresult of the administration's series of unilateral changes, which only \ninvite even more uncertainty.\n  This pervasive uncertainty is also plaguing our small business \nowners, who are struggling with the onslaught of new regulations. \nAmericans see selective delays for some, but not all. Hardworking men \nand women--our entrepreneurs--are the backbone of our economy. Any sort \nof meaningful economic recovery will only come when they have the \nconfidence to grow and expand their businesses and that requires \ncertainty.\n  Obamacare robs them of that certainty, and as a result the unemployed \nare robbed of jobs.\n  It's not just those searching for work who suffer from Obamacare's \nheavy regulatory hand. Our senior citizens are at a loss as well. The \nWashington Post recently described challenges facing Medicare Advantage \npatients because of Obamacare.\n  Obamacare has cut over half a trillion dollars from Medicare. Now, \ninsurers are terminating physician networks.\n  According to The Post:\n\n       Insurers say they must shrink their physician networks \n     because they face billions of dollars in government-payment \n     cuts over the next decade--reductions that are being used \n     partly to fund insurance coverage for millions of people \n     under the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\n  And it is not just our seniors, it is also the young.\n  A recent study by the American Action Forum found that it would be \ncheaper for 86 percent of young adults to forgo coverage.\n  The study concluded:\n\n\n[[Page S570]]\n\n\n       Even after mandate penalty is fully implemented, a majority \n     of young adult households will find that it is financially \n     advantageous for them to forgo health insurance, pay the \n     mandate penalty, and personally cover their own health care \n     expenses.\n\n  Without the participation of young, healthy people, we are told the \nwhole system will collapse. Then what?\n  To add insult to injury, some Obamacare proponents want taxpayers to \npick up the tab for insurance companies assuming the whole system \nmight, in fact, collapse.\n  Instead of calling this a ``bailout''--which is what it is--they use \nterms that could only be coined in Washington--terms like ``risk-\ncorridors,'' ``reinsurance funds,'' or ``risk-sharing protection.''\n  The White House may even preemptively alter portions of this program \nfor big insurance companies before the law falls apart. I believe \nAmerican taxpayers have paid enough. That is why I cosponsored Senator \nMarco Rubio's Obamacare Bailout Prevention Act.\n  The President and big insurance companies should not be permitted to \nforce taxpayers to pay for the mess they created. Nebraskans have no \ninterest in any more bailouts. And they certainly cannot afford to pay \nfor these sky-rocketing premium spikes. Just ask my constituent from \nLincoln, who wrote me recently to share her story.\n  She said:\n\n       I spent 2 hours on the phone with Healthcare.gov. The \n     Supervisor said she was going to try and reapply and \n     reinstate my plan beginning January 1, 2014. . .\n       After an hour long process everyone but my 15 year old son \n     was approved for healthcare. So, then she tried to apply \n     again. . . An hour later the system `crashed' and she asked \n     me to call back later.\n       So I called back yesterday. I had to go through an hour \n     long process again for signing up. . . at that point, all \n     THREE of my children were completely denied coverage.\n       My husband and I are seriously scared. . . if something \n     catastrophic happens our family will be ruined without \n     healthcare for our children.\n\n  These hardworking middle class families need relief. They are over-\ntaxed and over-burdened. People are scared. The law has not brought \nwhat the President promised. The cost of this flawed law is depriving \nNebraskans the opportunities to build their own futures and pursue \ntheir dreams. Scrapping this law should be a priority for the Senate, \nthe White House, and the country. It certainly is a top priority for \nme. We must repeal and replace this failed law now. Anything short of \nthat is just irresponsible. Our constituents are counting on us--let's \nnot disappoint them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I am here to say hallelujah, that it \nlooks as if we are finally coming to the point at which we can grant \nthe homeowners and businesses of America some relief from the huge, \ngargantuan--tenfold sometimes--increases in flood insurance premiums. \nWe are going to be able to pass this legislation today, with a vote \ncutting off debate yesterday of over 80 votes. I mean, there were times \nwe were just hoping to get to 60 votes. I think that overwhelming \nnumber finally tells the story Senator Landrieu has told. She has told \nthis story from the housetops, from the basements, from the riverbanks, \nand from the gulf shores: Enough. She has told this story along with \nSenator Menendez, who has shouted it from Cape May, NJ, all the way to \nthe Port of New Jersey at the mouth of the Hudson. This Senator has \nshouted this from the State with the longest coastline of any State--\nsave for Alaska--a State whose highest point in the entire State is \nabout 350 feet, along riverbanks and lakes, as well as the coastal \nwaters. Therefore, naturally, it is something we have to be concerned \nwith, the flood protection, and therefore protecting the financial \nassets of folks--their homes and their businesses. They simply cannot \ntake a tenfold increase all at once.\n  Now we are going to pass it. Unfortunately, there are still some \nfolks who are trying to do us in. They are trying to do us in with \nsubtle amendments that are going to try to seduce some Senators: Oh, \ndoesn't this sound good? But they are going to cut the heart out of it, \nand we have to reject those amendments.\n  At the end of the day, we will have the votes here in the Senate and \nwe will pass it. The question is, What will happen down there at the \nother end of the Capitol? Let's just get a real big vote here, and that \nwill send a message to our colleagues in the House of Representatives \nthat this is ``no fooling'' time, that these rate increases are already \nin effect as of January 1, and we need to stop the rate increases in \norder to have time for FEMA to do the affordability study and therefore \nto see what is consumable among consumers, homeowners, business owners, \nand then have that be a consideration along with the actuarial \nsoundness.\n  I will conclude my remarks, before I thank Senator Landrieu, by \nsaying that one of the toughest jobs I have ever had in public \nservice--and I have been blessed with a lifetime of public service--was \nthe elected insurance commissioner of Florida. I learned something \nabout insurance during those years. This thing called actuarial \nsoundness is a mathematical proposition whereby the expected risk and \nthe expected loss--you want to charge enough, if you are an insurance \ncompany, to handle that. That is the theory of actuarial soundness.\n  We know that part of the angst here about the Federal Flood Insurance \nProgram is that it, in essence, has been subsidized by American \ntaxpayers because it was never charging enough. But the question is: \nWhat is the real risk? The 2005 flood losses in the Flood Insurance \nProgram as a result of Katrina--which was not the garden variety \ncategory 3 hurricane because the counterclockwise winds came on to \nMississippi, not on to Louisiana.\n  The back end of the hurricane on the counterclockwise rotation came \nacross Lake Pontchartrain and filled the canals in New Orleans. The \nwater pressure became so great as the water level rose, and what you \nhad were some faulty dikes. When the dikes were breached, part of New \nOrleans flooded, which caused massive financial loss.\n  The other unusual event, which Senator Menendez can tell you about, \nhappened 1 year ago as a result of Hurricane Sandy. Again, that was a \nvery unusual occurrence. We could talk about climate change, but that \nis an issue for another day. It is very unusual for a category 1 \nhurricane to hit the northeast coast of the United States in the late \nmonths when it is cold. Because the water is cold, it is not hot enough \nto fuel a hurricane, but this one did.\n  The northeastern coast is not exactly as accustomed to hurricanes as \nwe are in Florida, and as a result we saw massive losses not so much \nfrom the wind but from floods.\n  The damage was not just along the coast. Look at what happened on the \ninland areas all the way through New England. So those were two unusual \nclimatic events which resulted in huge losses.\n  As you are calculating the actuarial soundness in order to adjust a \nflood insurance premium, should those be considered in what ordinary \npeople--over 2 million policies just in my State alone, 40 percent of \nall the flood insurance policies in the State of Florida. That is why \nwe also need that recalibrated and calculated so we can find out what \nis affordable in the affordability study.\n  Finally, I can't say enough about Senator Landrieu. This would not \nhave happened without her. She has been dogged in her determination. \nShe has been unyielding in her attempts to get this to where we are \nactually going to pass it in the Senate. I just want to express my \npersonal appreciation for Senator Landrieu on behalf of the people of \nFlorida, and, indeed, on behalf of the people of the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to proceed \nfor up to 10 minutes as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Collins and Mr. Nelson pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 1970 are printed in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I yield the floor, and if no one else is\n\n[[Page S571]]\n\nseeking recognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2706\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment be set aside so I may call up amendment No. 2706.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Whitehouse] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2706.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To exempt natural resource agencies from fees for flood \n                  insurance rate map change requests)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. EXEMPTION FROM FEES FOR CERTAIN MAP CHANGE REQUESTS.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a requester \n     shall be exempt from submitting a review or processing fee \n     for a request for a flood insurance rate map change based on \n     a habitat restoration project that is funded in whole or in \n     part with Federal or State funds, including dam removal, \n     culvert redesign or installation, or the installation of fish \n     passage.\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I wish to say a few words about this \namendment which I hope we can pass. I think it is an amendment that \nwill find strong bipartisan support.\n  I am from New England and across New England--and I suspect in \nWisconsin and across the country as well--communities are trying to \nrestore old rivers to their healthy state. What we see in New England, \nparticularly in Rhode Island with our history of the Industrial \nRevolution, is that our early industrial history was powered by \nhydropower. It was powered by damming rivers and then diverting some of \nthe flow through a wheel that then drove the engines of industry--the \nmills, for instance, that were so important to Rhode Island's \nindustrial history. That is not true just of Rhode Island; it is true \nacross New England, and I suspect it is true in a lot of places across \nthe country.\n  As local communities are restoring these old rivers--they tend to be \nsmall rivers, particularly in New England, and these tend to be old \ndams--what we want to do is remove the old dams so the original flow is \nrestored or we want to rebuild or maybe even redesign culverts so the \nflow of the river through the culvert permits the passage of fish. In \nsome cases, we want to fully keep the dam but build a fish passage, so \nthe fish that are working their way upstream to their traditional \nbreeding grounds find a passage and aren't blocked by dams. Again, this \nis part of bringing these old rivers back to life. When we do that, in \nmy State, it is usually towns--small towns often--and local community \norganizations that have to apply in order to make those changes.\n  Part of the application process is a flood map revision to show what \na change--removing the dam or changing the culvert or adding the fish \nladder--will make on downstream conditions and so the flood map gets \nredone. The flood map gets filed with FEMA, and FEMA requires a \nprocessing fee of more than $5,000 in order to review and accept the \nflood map revision.\n  What actually happens in practice is that the town or the local \norganization that is filing the flood map revision, because they are \nrepairing or replacing the dam or providing fish passage for it, will \napply to waive that fee. Virtually always--at least in Rhode Island, \nand I think around the country--FEMA is willing to waive that fee.\n\n  But the problem is, these are small organizations and these are small \ntowns, and it takes actually a considerable effort to put together the \nfee waiver application. So you may save $5,500 in the form of the FEMA \nfee, but you will spend maybe close to that much on your lawyers and \nengineers and on time and trouble in working together to get that \napplication done.\n  So since these fees usually get waived anyway, this amendment would \njust cut to the chase and say there is no fee. And because there is no \nfee, now you do not have to apply for a fee waiver. That will help the \nsmall towns and the small organizations that are often behind these \nsmall projects; and I mean dams that are only just 4 or 5 feet tall \nsometimes. The redesign of a culvert is not a major effort. It is very \nimportant to local communities, very important to local fishermen, very \nimportant to local canoers and outdoorsmen, but not a terrifically big \ndeal.\n  I hope we can agree to eliminate that bureaucratic requirement. \nNeither NOAA nor FEMA have expressed any objection whatsoever to this \namendment.\n  If I can close, I will read a statement by Chris Fox, who is \nexecutive director of the Wood-Pawcatuck Watershed Association. The \nWood River and Pawcatuck River run through western Rhode Island, and \nthey are wonderful rivers. I have actually canoed and kayaked them both \nand enjoyed it immensely. He had to go through this fee waiver process \nfor a set of projects on the Upper Pawcatuck River, and he writes:\n\n       This Amendment will avert lengthy project delays and reduce \n     the cost of these environmentally beneficial projects \n     nationwide. . . . On behalf of the wildlife, water, and \n     people who reside in, and depend upon the health of the Wood-\n     Pawcatuck Watershed, I thank you and all those who support \n     this Amendment.\n\n  I hope all my colleagues will join together to earn Chris Fox's \nthanks for this, I hope, noncontroversial and beneficial amendment.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I rise today in opposition to S. 1926. \nIn July of 2012, after over 7 years of negotiations in the Congress, \nthe Congress finally passed the Biggert-Waters Act, the first \nsignificant flood insurance reauthorization bill since the creation of \nthe National Flood Insurance Program in 1968.\n  One of the goals of the reform at that time was to ensure--yes, to \nensure--that the 5.6 million flood insurance policyholders in this \ncountry could collect on their policies if they were ever to suffer a \nflood loss, something that cannot be guaranteed by the Flood Insurance \nProgram that is currently $25 billion in debt.\n  The program basically is bankrupt and only operating by the grace of \nthe American taxpayer. Historically, the flood insurance premiums have \nnot covered costs because the program was not designed to be \nactuarially sound. Essentially, it was flawed from the beginning when \nit was created in 1968.\n  The National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 authorized subsidized rates \nto encourage participation in the Flood Insurance Program, especially \nfor properties in high-risk locations. The Biggert-Waters legislation \nchanged all this by requiring that the program be actuarially sound, \nthat flood insurance rates reflect actual risk, and that the program \neliminate its debt.\n  The sponsors of the legislation before us now have said that the \nmoment Biggert-Waters was signed into law by the President they began \nworking to roll back the reforms. Before they had any clear knowledge \nof how the changes in that legislation would be implemented, how \nmapping would affect homeowners, how flood insurance rates would change \nor whom might be pulled into the program and whom might be pulled out.\n  If my colleagues are hoping to dismantle the Flood Insurance Program, \nthen they should support this legislation because that is exactly what \nit will do. However, if they are looking to address the unintended \nconsequences of Biggert-Waters, then we should take a more measured \napproach like we do on most legislation. If there are affordability \nconcerns that they are seeking to address, then I think we should find \na way to address them.\n  If they are attempting to address economic impacts that were not \ncontemplated in the Biggert-Waters Act, then we should find alternative \napproaches that minimize those impacts.\n\n[[Page S572]]\n\nIf they believe that the rate at which Biggert-Waters phases in risk-\nbased premiums needs to be reconsidered, then we should discuss \nalternative increases.\n  Unfortunately, this legislation does not specifically address those \nissues. S. 1926, coupled with the provisions that the sponsors included \nin the recently passed omnibus appropriations act, will stop all \nchanges in the Federal Flood Insurance Program. Those efforts will \nensure that mapping revisions which we desperately need do not move \nforward, that premium increases are halted, and, even more disturbing, \nthat homeowners never truly learn their real flood insurance risk.\n  I believe people in America deserve to know the cost and risk of \nwhere they live. Taxpayers deserve to have those who choose to live in \nharm's way assume their own risk. The proponents of this legislation \nwant to continue to burden, I believe, an already over-burdened and \nbankrupt Federal insurance program. They are not seeking to address a \nfew discrete problems with the flood insurance reforms passed in 2012.\n  Make no mistake, they want to stop it all. I concede, like any \nlegislation, there were issues with the implementation of Biggert-\nWaters that were not anticipated. But those can be addressed in other \nways that do not require the ``stop everything'' approach that the \nproponents of this legislation are basically advocating.\n  Congress is often criticized for being unable to fix anything. In \n2012, we took a very significant step toward fixing the National Flood \nInsurance Program after 7 years of work. Now we have a bill before us \nthat will undo virtually every reform that was enacted less than 2 \nyears ago.\n  I urge the proponents of the bill today to follow regular order and \nto take this bill through the committee process where it can be debated \nand amended and where people can be heard. Absent that, I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in voting against this legislation in favor of a \nmore measured approach which will preserve what is needed in the \nBiggert-Waters legislation and change only that which needs to be \nchanged.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TESTER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of my speech, Senator Reed of Rhode Island be the next \nDemocratic speaker.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TESTER. I come to the floor to speak against the Coburn \namendment.\n  I know the good Senator from Oklahoma hasn't brought up this \namendment yet, but this is the time I have available to speak about it. \nIf he doesn't bring it up, God bless him, but if he does bring it up, \nhopefully these comments will be able to impact some of the Members of \nthis body.\n  Before I talk about the Coburn amendment, I thank Senators Menendez, \nLandrieu, and Isakson for including legislation that is very important \nto Senator Johanns and me in this important flood insurance bill.\n  Title II of the underlying bill is actually the National Association \nof Registered Agents and Brokers Reform Act or, as I refer to it, \nNARAB. NARAB is legislation Senator Johanns and I introduced last year. \nIt creates a nonprofit association to provide one-stop licensing for \ninsurance agents and brokers operating outside of their home States, \nwhile also fully preserving the authority of the State insurance \nregulators to supervise these markets.\n  Currently, an insurance agent or broker seeking to operate in \nmultiple States must meet different State-specific licensing \nrequirements for each State and seek approval for each State's \njurisdiction. This process can be time-consuming, costly, redundant, \nand sometimes contradictory--without providing any greater consumer \nprotection. That is a big disincentive for agents and brokers who try \nto grow their business.\n  This is not a new issue for the insurance industry. Congress \nrecognized the need to reform the insurance licensing system 15 years \nago in 1999 when it incorporated the National Association of Registered \nAgents and Brokers subtitle into the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. \nUnfortunately, during consideration of the act, Congress did not \nprovide for the immediate establishment of NARAB. Instead, it included \nprovisions to simply encourage State reciprocity for licensing. As a \nresult, Gramm-Leach-Bliley wasn't able to achieve the level of \nreciprocity and uniformity Congress had hoped for, and these efforts \nbecame something of a dead end. That is why we are considering this \nimportant legislation today.\n  Title II would provide insurance agents and brokers with the option \nof becoming a member of NARAB, provided that they meet the professional \nstandards set by the association and undergo a criminal background \ncheck.\n  NARAB will streamline the licensing process for agents and brokers, \nenabling them to be licensed once under a single high national \nlicensing standard rather than follow different State standards. This \nwill save time, and it will save money. The association will set \nrigorous professional and consumer protection standards, including the \nrequirement that all association members undergo criminal background \nchecks, and, for the first time, continuing education standards for \nnonresident producers. In addition to setting rigorous professional \nstandards, the association will let agents and brokers renew their \nlicenses all at once and fully preserve the ability of regulators to \nprotect consumers, supervise and discipline agents and brokers.\n  Currently, on average, insurance agents sell their products in eight \nStates, with many of them serving even more. A one-stop licensing \ncompliance mechanism will benefit all agents and brokers but \nparticularly the smaller agents and brokers who must spend time and \nmoney dealing with different standards in different States. A one-stop \nshop for insurance licensing will help smaller players compete against \ntheir larger competitors. More opportunity is good for small \nbusinesses, and more competition is good for consumers. However, the \namendment I referred to in my opening that may be offered by the good \nSenator from Oklahoma would render NARAB meaningless by giving States \nthe ability to ignore NARAB's cross-State licensing abilities.\n  The concept of NARAB was first developed when Congress passed Gramm-\nLeach-Bliley in 1999, but, again, the measure wasn't able to achieve \nthe measure of uniformity and reciprocity it hoped for. Title II \nrepresents decades of efforts and will finally achieve the goals laid \nout in Gramm-Leach-Bliley in a way that ensures that regulators can \ncontinue to protect consumers.\n  I appreciate and understand the concerns of my friend from Oklahoma, \nand I share his interest in making sure we preserve States rights, but \nI also want to make clear that we tried to provide an opt-out for \nStates when Gramm-Leach-Bliley was implemented 14 years ago. With all \ndue respect, it simply did not work. That is why we are debating this \nbill today.\n  I would like to take a minute and talk about how this legislation \nprotects States rights. Every State would retain all authority to \nlicense its resident agents and brokers. The association would be \nrequired to notify States when agents and brokers apply for membership, \nletting States notify NARAB of any reason membership should not be \ngranted for a producer.\n\n  Additionally, because the association would be in communication with \nall State insurance regulators, this notification measure will prevent \nbad actors with violations in one State from simply moving to another \nState because their record would now follow them.\n  States will also have significant control over NARAB. The nonprofit \nassociation would be governed by a board of directors dominated by \nState insurance regulators and chaired by a State insurance regulator.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Oklahoma also implies this \nlegislation somehow imposes unfunded mandates on States or compels \nStates to take some action, and this simply isn't the case.\n  The legislation also ensures States remain responsible for the \noversight\n\n[[Page S573]]\n\nand day-to-day regulation of the insurance marketplace. States will \nmaintain exclusive control over the regulation and marketplace \nactivities, consumer protection requirements, unfair trade practices, \nand other important areas.\n  Under this bill, we preserve the longstanding authority of States to \nsupervise insurance producers. Any agent or broker who obtains the \nauthority to operate in a jurisdiction through NARAB is still subject \nto the full regulatory authority of that State and must comply with all \nmarketplace requirements.\n  Under our proposal we ensure States will continue to receive \ninsurance licensing fees, which will be collected by NARAB and remitted \nto the States.\n  This legislation is strongly supported by the National Association of \nState Insurance Commissioners, the National Association of Insurance \nand Financial Advisers, the Council of Insurance Agents and Brokers, \nand the Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers of America. Its \npurpose is thwarted if the amendment of the good Senator from Oklahoma \nis adopted.\n  If NARAB cannot offer producers the ability to fulfill their \nlicensing obligations in all jurisdictions, then NARAB offers very \nlittle value for those agents and brokers who would otherwise \nparticipate and would create uncertainty about whether individual \nStates might opt out in the future.\n  So I urge my colleagues, if the good Senator from Oklahoma decides to \nbring up his amendment, to oppose that amendment.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2697\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I am waiting on Senator Menendez to come \nto the floor on a point of order, but I do ask unanimous consent that \nwe temporarily set aside the pending amendment so I may call up my \namendment No. 2697.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I see Senator Menendez is now on the floor, and what I \nwish to do is talk a little about this bill.\n  This bill is going to add $900 million in additional budget authority \nand outlays over the next 5 years with no offsets, period. The sponsors \nclaim the bill is offset over 10 years but relies on a budget gimmick \nthat assumes Congress would not raise the NFIP borrowing authority once \nit hits the cap. That has never happened. And in the absence of \nsufficient borrowing authority, the program would delay payments of \ninsurance claims until additional resources became available. So in \nreality this bill will add another $2.1 billion in debt to the NFIP \nwhile making no substantive changes to address affordability issues.\n  Even the administration states that delaying implementation of these \nreforms would further erode the financial position of the NFIP, which \nis already $24 billion in debt. This delay would also reduce FEMA's \nability to pay future claims made by all policyholders. NFIP is \nunaffordable to the American people as the program is currently already \nmore than $24 billion in debt.\n  The pending measure, S. 1926, a bill to delay the implementation of \ncertain provisions of the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of \n2012, and to reform the National Association of Registered Agents and \nBrokers, and for other purposes, would violate the Senate pay-go rule \nand increase the deficit. Therefore, I raise a point of order on this \nmeasure, pursuant to sections 201(a) of S. Con. Res. 21, the concurrent \nresolution on the budget for fiscal year 2008.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974 and the waiver provisions of \napplicable budget resolutions, I move to waive all applicable sections \nof that Act and applicable budget resolutions for purposes of the \npending bill, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  The motion to waive is debatable.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, this country is in serious trouble with \nits debt, its unfunded liabilities, and its continual habit by its \nelected representatives to not live within its means.\n  Waiving the Budget Act so that we can delay a reform on something \nthat needs to be reformed does not make sense. I have no doubt I won't \nwin this budget point of order, but the American people need to be \npaying attention. Here we go again, not doing the hard, tough work of \nmaking choices about priorities.\n  We passed a bill, the Biggert-Waters bill, it was signed into law, \nand now, because it is starting to come into effect, we are going to \ndelay it for 4 years. It is going to cost billions. Then we are not \ngoing to solve the problem. And don't forget, this is not about keeping \nBiggert-Waters intact, it is about making it go away. That is what it \nis about.\n  I am adamantly opposed to the waiver of the Budget Act and I will \nawait the call of the Chair on the vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n[[Page S574]]\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, briefly, I appreciate the longstanding \nviews of my colleague from Oklahoma on a variety of fiscal issues, but \non this one I must say I have a disagreement with him. This isn't about \ndoing away with Biggert-Waters, because the reality is that of the 1 \npercent of properties that equal 33 percent of all claims, there is \nnothing set aside for that 1 percent that creates 33 percent of all the \nclaims. It remains as it existed in Biggert-Waters.\n  As a matter of fact, overwhelmingly, we keep most of the Biggert-\nWaters reforms in the legislation. The one thing we are doing is \ncreating a pause for those property owners who have obeyed the rules, \nfollowed their responsibilities, built in new standards and now find \nthemselves, notwithstanding having done all those things, in the midst \nof a lot of hurt and rate shock.\n  In fact, some of us foresaw this, evidenced by the fact that I raised \nthese issues as a member of the Senate banking committee, where this \nbill was heard, and when I couldn't achieve any affordability elements, \nI got an affordability study included, which study should be completed \nbefore we actually put into force skyrocketing premiums that are going \nto what, create greater stability for the fund? No.\n  What is insurance about? Insurance is about spreading risk over a \nwider pool. So what happens when people simply can't meet those \nskyrocketing premiums, as evidenced by the many stories our colleagues \non both sides of the aisle have come to talk about on the floor? What \nhappens when they, in essence, have to say: I can't have insurance or I \nam going to turn my house over to the mortgage company because I can't \nsustain that policy or I will have to sell the property at a fire sale? \nWhat happens then? The pool grows smaller. What are the consequences of \nthe risk pool growing smaller? Prices rise. And when prices rise even \nmore for everybody else, what happens again? The risk pool grows \nsmaller. And when the risk pool grows smaller, the prices rise again.\n  So this isn't about undoing Biggert-Waters. On the contrary, this is \nabout getting it right. This is about fulfilling the element of the law \nthat said there must be an affordability study so we can determine what \ntype of affordability mechanism would exist in the law so that \nultimately we make sure we have a solvent program and, at the same \ntime, be able to keep the single most significant asset any family has \nin this country, which is their home.\n  That is what we are trying do here, and that is why I urge my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to support the waiver of the \nbudget point of order.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I understand Senator Reed has been \nwaiting to speak about his amendment and the unanimous consent \nagreement allows for that. I would like 30 seconds to respond to the \nCoburn amendment. I see the Senator from Tennessee, and I am not sure \nwhat brings him to the floor, but if I can have 30 seconds to respond \nto the Coburn amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I want to underscore what the Senator from New Jersey \njust said. If our efforts were to repeal the Biggert-Waters bill, we \nwould have drafted one to do so. This is not repealing Biggert-Waters. \nThis is an honest, good-faith attempt to make the flood insurance \nprogram work. So we are insisting the affordability study be done \nfirst, we are insisting the maps be accurate, and we are insisting that \nFEMA recognize levees that taxpayers have built with their own money. \nIs that too much to ask? I mean, think about that: An affordability \nstudy, to recognize levees that are built, and to make sure people can \nafford these rates.\n  I know my 30 seconds is up. I urge my colleagues to vote against the \nCoburn point of order and to help us move this important bill to the \nHouse of Representatives with a strong vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2703\n\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and that I be permitted to call up my amendment \nNo. 2703.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Reed] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2703.\n\n  Mr. REED. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To require the Administrator of the Federal Emergency \n  Management Agency to conduct a study to assess voluntary community-\n                     based flood insurance options)\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. STUDY OF VOLUNTARY COMMUNITY-BASED FLOOD INSURANCE \n                   OPTIONS.\n\n       (a) Study.--\n       (1) Study required.--The Administrator shall conduct a \n     study to assess options, methods, and strategies for making \n     available voluntary community-based flood insurance policies \n     through the National Flood Insurance Program.\n       (2) Considerations.--The study conducted under paragraph \n     (1) shall--\n       (A) take into consideration and analyze how voluntary \n     community-based flood insurance policies--\n       (i) would affect communities having varying economic bases, \n     geographic locations, flood hazard characteristics or \n     classifications, and flood management approaches; and\n       (ii) could satisfy the applicable requirements under \n     section 102 of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 (42 \n     U.S.C. 4012a); and\n       (B) evaluate the advisability of making available voluntary \n     community-based flood insurance policies to communities, \n     subdivisions of communities, and areas of residual risk.\n       (3) Consultation.--In conducting the study required under \n     paragraph (1), the Administrator may consult with the \n     Comptroller General of the United States, as the \n     Administrator determines is appropriate.\n       (b) Report by the Administrator.--\n       (1) Report required.--Not later than 18 months after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall submit \n     to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of \n     the Senate and the Committee on Financial Services of the \n     House of Representatives a report that contains the results \n     and conclusions of the study conducted under subsection (a).\n       (2) Contents.--The report submitted under paragraph (1) \n     shall include recommendations for--\n       (A) the best manner to incorporate voluntary community-\n     based flood insurance policies into the National Flood \n     Insurance Program; and\n       (B) a strategy to implement voluntary community-based flood \n     insurance policies that would encourage communities to \n     undertake flood mitigation activities, including the \n     construction, reconstruction, or improvement of levees, dams, \n     or other flood control structures.\n       (c) Report by Comptroller General.--Not later than 6 months \n     after the date on which the Administrator submits the report \n     required under subsection (b), the Comptroller General of the \n     United States shall--\n       (1) review the report submitted by the Administrator; and\n       (2) submit to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \n     Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Financial Services \n     of the House of Representatives a report that contains--\n       (A) an analysis of the report submitted by the \n     Administrator;\n       (B) any comments or recommendations of the Comptroller \n     General relating to the report submitted by the \n     Administrator; and\n       (C) any other recommendations of the Comptroller General \n     relating to community-based flood insurance policies.\n\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, my amendment would require the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency--FEMA--to study and report on the \nadvisability of establishing voluntary community-based flood insurance \npolicies under the National Flood Insurance Program--NFIP. The \nGovernment Accountability Office would be required to review and \ncomment on FEMA's study.\n  The study will help answer important questions about how such \nvoluntary community-based policies could be implemented within the \nNational Flood Insurance Program. It does not commit FEMA, the \nCongress, or local communities to take any action. It simply calls for \nfact-finding and analysis that could provide the basis for improvements \nto the flood insurance program.\n  The idea of community-based flood insurance is to assess the risk for \nall properties within a community and collect premiums from the \ncommunity rather than from individual property owners. By purchasing \ninsurance at the community level, willing local governments--and I \nemphasize willing and\n\n[[Page S575]]\n\nvoluntary--may be able to spread the cost of premiums equitably among \nproperty owners. In addition, they may be able to increase \nparticipation in the flood insurance program, including among property \nowners who are within the 100-year flood plain but who are not subject \nto the mandatory purchase requirement because they do not carry a \nfederally backed mortgage. Expanding participation would ensure that \nall properties in the flood plain have coverage from risk.\n  Beyond increasing coverage and participation, community-based \ninsurance may also offer new opportunities and incentives for \ncommunities to deal with affordability, including by undertaking \nmitigation efforts that will reduce risk and insurance costs. Indeed, \nthe amendment specifically requires FEMA to develop a strategy that \nincorporates mitigation into its recommendations for community-based \npolicies.\n  For communities in Rhode Island and along the east coast that are \ndealing with the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy and the reality of sea \nlevel rise and climate change, this could offer another tool to \nprepare.\n  There are important questions to be answered about the feasibility of \nsuch an option and how it might be offered. That is what this amendment \nseeks to do. A study of this option has been included in separate \namendments and bills sponsored by proponents and opponents of the \nunderlying bill, and it has been approved by the House twice as a \nfreestanding bill.\n  Indeed, it has been part of bills or amendments sponsored or \ncosponsored by Chairman Johnson, Senator Crapo, Senator Shelby, and \nSenator Landrieu.\n  I thank the managers and authors of the underlying bill--Senators \nMenendez, Landrieu, and Isakson--for their work. They have done an \nextraordinary job in working to ensure my amendment could be \nconsidered. I believe this amendment will add to the goals of the \nunderlying bill of which I am a cosponsor. Given the bipartisan support \nfor this concept, I hope it could be adopted by a voice vote.\n  Before I yield the floor, one point. We have another emergency that \nis facing us, not only floods and rising waters, but unemployment \ninsurance. I ask if we could continue the bipartisan dialog we have \nhad. I salute my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who have \nbeen principled in their pursuit of this objective, and we can move on \nthat issue also.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, I rise to address the amendment I have. \nI will formally ask to call it up in a few moments, but I wish to say a \nfew words about it. I would like to start with a little bit of \nbackground and a reminder of how we got here and the circumstances that \nbrought us to this point.\n  It all started, of course, with a completely unsustainable National \nFlood Insurance Program. I don't think there is any dispute that this \nprogram is massively in debt, it has been completely under water, it \nwas insolvent, and there was no prospect for this to right itself \nbecause of the massive subsidies for homeowners of all stripes.\n  By the way, in addition to being fiscally insolvent and therefore a \nhuge drain for taxpayers, it has a lot of very bad incentives. When you \nsubsidize homes built in dangerous places, you subsidize and encourage \nhomes to be rebuilt there, homes to be bought in places that are \ndangerous and costly. So there are problems inherent. The CBO was very \nclear about this. This program was not going to be able to honor its \ncommitments. That is what happens when a program like this is insolvent \nand is unreformed: People who think they have insurance for their home \nend up discovering one day that they don't because of its insolvency.\n  So along came the Biggert-Waters approach to reform the National \nFlood Insurance Program and to put it in a position where it would \nactually be solvent and would actually be able to honor the policies \npeople are paying for.\n  It was September of 2011 that the Senate banking committee took up \nthe reforms, and they passed it with a voice vote. In other words, \nthere was no dissent. There was no objection to the Biggert-Waters \nreforms. That was, of course, after many hearings. This had been \ndiscussed at length for many years before we got to that point. But we \ndid. We passed it in the banking committee.\n  In June of 2012--so less than 2 years ago--Biggert-Waters, the flood \ninsurance reform program--was wrapped into another bill. It was wrapped \ninto the MAP-21 Transportation bill and it passed--and it passed with \noverwhelming support. As a matter of fact, as it happens, every single \nDemocratic Senator who was in the Chamber voted in favor of the \nBiggert-Waters reforms I think in part because they understood this \nprogram needed to be reformed, and I think we all believe this program \nneeds to be in a fiscally sustainable place.\n  So the final passage of that bill less than 2 years ago required the \nreforms of Biggert-Waters, which includes as central to those reforms \nthat over time everybody who participates in the National Flood \nInsurance Program will eventually be paying actuarially sound rates--\nrates that actually reflect the risk of their home, so taxpayers \nwouldn't be on the hook and they wouldn't be subject to the worry about \nwhether this program is going to go away altogether.\n  That is where we were when, lo and behold, we start to discover that \nfor some people premium increases are going to be very dramatic. I have \nheard a lot from Pennsylvanians. This is a problem with the Biggert-\nWaters reform.\n  One of the problems I suspect a lot of folks did not anticipate was \nthat the premium spikes would be quite substantial and happen over a \npretty short period of time. There is a phase-in under the Biggert-\nWaters reforms, but it is quick, and it is very problematic for that \nrelatively small handful of people who would be adversely affected, \nbecause it turns out that the remapping determines that they are in a \nhigher risk profile than had previously been understood or, if they had \nbuilt their home prior to the initial mappings, they wouldn't be \nsubject to the premium increase. But upon sale of their homes, the \npremium increase would go into effect, and it would go into effect \nimmediately. And that of course can have a devastating impact on the \nvalue of a person's home.\n  I want to be very clear. There is no question in my mind that if we \ndon't do anything, if we simply leave Biggert-Waters alone, that has an \nunacceptable impact on people who are adversely affected in the form of \npremium increases that are way too big way too quickly. And that is not \nthe right outcome. We shouldn't settle for that.\n  I know cases in Pennsylvania where people are facing thousands of \ndollars in increase. In some cases it is immediate. In a case where \nthey are going to be selling their home, the new buyer would face that \nimmediately. In other cases, it is phased in quickly.\n  The Menendez approach--the underlying bill we are debating today--\ndeals with this, but it deals with this in the wrong way. It deals with \nthis by completely suspending all the reforms. It completely dispenses \nwith the idea that we should move toward an actuarially sound program. \nIt says for 4 years there will be no change in premiums.\n  It is hard not to see this as a measure designed to kill the reform. \nI understand it is painful to have any premium increase, but to say \nthat the response should be to abandon any effort to move to a fiscally \nsound, actuarially based program can't be right. To do that is to \ncompletely throw out the reforms that took so many years to get.\n  And, by the way, it doesn't provide any certainty for the homeowners \nit is meant to protect--where for 4 years nothing happens, and after \nthe fourth year nobody knows what happens. I know it is the intent of \nsome to continue indefinitely without making any changes, but that is \nnot a solution. This is an insolvent program.\n  What that means is we will get to the day--relatively soon, according \nto CBO--when the National Flood Insurance Program will simply be unable \nto honor the commitments it has made. It will not have the resources. \nIt will not have the borrowing authority. It will run out of money. And \npeople who then get their homes flooded will find it of little comfort \nthat their premium was a little lower when it turns out there is no \nbenefit to be paid, there are no resources for them to rebuild.\n\n[[Page S576]]\n\n  So this doesn't work. And it is not just me who observes this problem \nwith the underlying Menendez bill. As a matter of fact, the President \nof the United States has weighed in on this. I have a quote here from a \nStatement of Administrative Policy they put out 2 days ago directly \nreferring to this bill, identifying it by number. This is the bill they \nare talking about, the Menendez bill. One of the things they say is:\n\n       Delaying implementation of these reforms would further \n     erode the financial position of the NFIP, which is already \n     $24 billion in debt. This delay would also reduce FEMA's \n     ability to pay future claims made by all policyholders.\n\n  This is the President of the United States. His administration has \nlooked at the Menendez bill, and this is their conclusion: This doesn't \nwork. This doesn't work for the policyholders. It doesn't work for \ntaxpayers. It doesn't work for anybody.\n  There is another problem I would point out with the Menendez bill: It \nwouldn't work if it were to become law for these reasons, but it is not \ngoing to become law. The administration has made it clear they don't \nsupport it. The Speaker of the House has made it abundantly clear he \nwill not put a bill on the House floor that guts the reforms of \nBiggert-Waters. The House chairman of the banking committee, who has \njurisdiction over this, has made it abundantly clear: He is not going \nto move a bill that does away with these fiscal reforms.\n  If your goal is to do something to help homeowners who are facing \npremium increases, a vote for the Menendez bill does nothing, because \nthat bill is going nowhere. The administration doesn't support it. They \nhave said so. The House is not even going to take it up. So if your \ngoal is to do something for constituents who are facing a big premium \nincrease--and, frankly, that is a big part of my goal--the Menendez \nbill doesn't cut it. That is going nowhere.\n  What the administration said would work and what House leadership is \nwilling to work with us on would be to phase in these premium increases \nmore gradually, because everybody acknowledges the premium increases \nare occurring too quickly, and that needs to change.\n  This is another quote from that same Statement of Administration \nPolicy on the same bill. What they said was:\n\n       The administration strongly supports a phased transition to \n     actuarially sound flood insurance rates.\n\n  They didn't refer to my amendment, but this is exactly what my \namendment does. It phases this in gradually so as to minimize the pain, \nallow people an opportunity to adjust, allow people the time to maybe \nmitigate the risk and still maintain the integrity--the fiscal \nintegrity--of the program so it actually can pay the claims that surely \nwill be submitted.\n  Let me run through quickly exactly what the amendment does and \ndoesn't do, because there has been some confusion about this.\n  Our amendment actually retains very significant portions of the \nunderlying Menendez bill because parts of it made a lot of sense. \nSection 1 is the title. Section 2, definitions. Unchanged. Section 3 is \nwhere we phased the premium increases in gradually rather than \nsuspending them altogether. That is the big difference. Section 4 of \nthe Menendez bill is an affordability study and report, requires FEMA \nto complete this study--as Biggert-Waters does--within 2 years of the \nenactment of the bill. We leave that intact. I think that is a good \nidea. We need that. My amendment would not affect that whatsoever.\n  The Mendendez bill also provides some additional funding for the \naffordability study. It lifts the cap that was set before. My amendment \nwouldn't change that. I think we need to lift that cap.\n  Section 6. This is a measure that provides funds to reimburse \nhomeowners when they challenge the redraw. So when a new map comes out \nand someone's house is deemed to be in a more risky place and therefore \nthe premium is higher, a homeowner can challenge that. If the homeowner \nwins, under the Menendez language--which I support and stays in this \nbill under my amendment--the homeowner would be reimbursed the cost of \nthat challenge.\n  Senator King from Maine had a very good suggestion, which is: If a \ncommunity chooses to challenge the mapping because they think there was \na mistake made, they think it was inaccurate and it adversely affects \nthem, that community too would be reimbursed for its costs if it turns \nout to be successful in its challenge. I agree with that. We have \nincorporated that into our amendment.\n  Section 7 addresses the flood protection system. This is a very \nimportant part of what the Menendez bill does and I fully support it, \nand that is this: Under current law, one of the problems is in order \nfor a community or a homeowner to fully benefit from risk mitigation \nthat they may have done--a levee that may have been built or a dam or \nsome other risk mitigation. In order to fully benefit from that, the \nFederal Government has to have paid for some portion of it. That is \nridiculous. What difference does it make who paid for it? If it has \nbeen built and it is providing protection, that is all that should \nmatter. This language would achieve that, the Menendez bill achieves \nthat, and my amendment incorporates that. We keep that intact as well.\n  Section 8 addresses floodproofed residential basements, addresses \nthat. Our amendment doesn't change that.\n  Section 9 creates a designation of a flood insurance advocate. Again, \nmy amendment makes no change to that.\n  Section 10. Senator Blunt had an amendment that would change the \nremodeling trigger for loss subsidies from 30 percent to 50 percent of \na home's value. We incorporate Senator Blunt's amendment into our own, \nso that is there.\n  Senator Hagan had an amendment to exempt escrow requirements for \nflood insurance payments. We fully incorporate that into my amendment \nas well.\n  Senator Rubio had an amendment also that was accepted by the \nmanagers. It is in ours.\n  What it comes down to, the difference between my amendment and the \nMenendez approach is one keeps us on a path of reform, keeps us on a \npath to an actuarially sound, fiscally responsible flood insurance \nprogram, whereby the flood insurance program is actually able to pay \nits claims, and the Menendez bill dispenses with it. It dispenses with \nthe most important, most fundamental reform. The other part that we do \nis we soften the blow. If your concern is with these homeowners who are \nfacing these huge premiums, my amendment is the only way we are \nactually going to achieve that help for those folks because this is the \nonly legislative approach that has a chance of actually legislatively \nbecoming law.\n\n  By the way, in addition to its problems with the other body and the \nadministration, the Menendez bill is subject to a budget point of order \nbecause it increases our deficit and forces more government borrowing. \nIt is subject to a point of order. I don't know that it can sustain \nthat. I don't know it can defeat a budget point of order and that is an \nimportant issue.\n  Because our approach is fiscally sound, we are not subject to a \nbudget point of order. What we do is we say the longer delay in the \nphase-in of the premium increases costs the flood insurance program \nsome money until you get to the point where people have reached the \nlevel where they are paying actuarially sound rates, but we fully \noffset that with a very modest surcharge on all flood insurance \npolicies in the country. It is about $40 per year in the first year, \nthe most expensive year, unless your income is over one-half million \ndollars a year, in which case it is about $80, and that is it. It goes \ndown after that because over time, when the higher premiums phase in, \nthe loss to the program is diminished and therefore the surcharge goes \ndown with it.\n  But let's be very clear. The maximum that anybody would be paying is \nabout $40 a year unless their income is over one-half million dollars a \nyear, in which case it would be $80 a year.\n  I will wrap up. I think we cannot continue to ignore all of the \nfundamental mandatory spending problems we have. When we actually go \nthrough a long and painful and deliberative systematic process to \nreform a program, for us to then walk away within 2 years and say never \nmind, we are not going to have any reform, is just so disappointing and \nirresponsible. We have bigger challenges facing us. If we cannot deal \nwith this, I don't know what we are going to do.\n\n[[Page S577]]\n\n  I fully acknowledge we have to soften the blow for people who are \ngoing to face much higher premiums and my amendment does that. The way \nwe do that is by ensuring nobody's premium could go up by more than 25 \npercent. In the case of people who would face a big increase, under my \napproach it will take many years of gradual phasing in before they \nwould actually be forced to pay that higher actuarially sound rate. If \nthey think the rate is unfairly high, they can challenge it or they can \nleave the program and buy private insurance. They can do that. But to \nsuggest we are going to just do nothing after having put the reforms in \nplace I think would be a big mistake.\n  There are a lot of groups that are supporting my amendment. I have a \nlist I am going to run through quickly:\n  Natural Resources Defense Council, National Wildlife Federation, The \nNature Conservancy, Taxpayers for Common Sense, National Association of \nMutual Insurance Companies, Reinsurance Association of America, \nAmerican Rivers, National Fire Protection Association, National Leased \nHousing Association, the R Street Institute, American Consumer \nInstitute, Americans for Prosperity, Americans for Tax Reform, the \nCoalition to Reduce Spending, the Cost of Government Center, Council \nfor Citizens Against Government Waste, Freedom Works, National \nTaxpayers Union, Taxpayers for Common Sense, Taxpayers Protection \nAlliance.\n  You can see there is a combination of fiscal watchdogs, folks who are \nvery concerned about fiscal prudence, as well as people who are \nconcerned about environmental integrity. There are other groups coming \non continuously.\n  As I mentioned, every Democrat who voted on the Biggert-Waters reform \nvoted in favor of it. What my amendment does is it preserves the \nintegrity of the reform while softening the blow for the people who \nwill be affected by it.\n  I think this is a very important, although modest, step in doing \nthese two things.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2707, as Modified\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment so I may \ncall up my amendment, No. 2707, with the modification at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). Without objection, it is so \nordered. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows.\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Toomey] proposes an \n     amendment, No. 2707, as modified.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To adjust phase-ins of flood insurance rate increases)\n\n       Strike sections 103 through 109 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 103.

LIMITATIONS ON FORCE-PLACED INSURANCE.\n\n       Section 102(e) of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 \n     (42 U.S.C. 4012a(e)) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating paragraphs (3) through (6) as \n     paragraphs (4) through (7), respectively; and\n       (2) by inserting after paragraph (2) the following:\n       ``(3) Limitations on lenders and servicers.--\n       ``(A) Payments from insurance companies.--An lender or \n     servicer, or an affiliate of a lender or servicer, may not \n     receive a commission or any other payment from an insurance \n     company in connection with securing business under paragraph \n     (2) from the insurance company.\n       ``(B) Purchase from affiliated insurance companies.--\n       ``(i) In general.--Except as provided in clause (ii), a \n     lender or servicer, or an affiliate of a lender or servicer, \n     that purchases insurance under paragraph (2) may not purchase \n     the insurance from an insurance company that is affiliated \n     with the lender or servicer.\n       ``(ii) Exception.--Clause (i) shall not apply to the \n     purchase of insurance under paragraph (2) by a lender or \n     servicer, or an affiliate of a lender or servicer, that is a \n     bank, or a Federal credit union or State credit union (as \n     those terms are defined in section 101 of the Federal Credit \n     Union Act (12 U.S.C. 1752)), with assets of not more than \n     $10,000,000,000.''.\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I will take this occasion to make a \ncouple of remarks about the content of this amendment.\n  This amendment is about a predatory practice that is involved in the \nflood insurance world, and that predatory practice occurs when a \nservicer of mortgages places flood insurance on a property--be it a \nhome or a business. They sometimes arrange a very expensive policy to \nbe placed on the property. The reason they do this is that the \ninsurer--the insurance company that has prepared the policy--is \ncharging many times the market rate, but in exchange they pay the \nservicer a large bonus.\n  We remember how bonuses in the subprime world were used to steer \nfamilies from prime mortgages into subprime mortgages. In this case the \nbonus is being paid to the servicer so the servicer will steer the \nfamily into an expensive insurance policy rather than a fair market \nrate policy.\n  My amendment takes a very simple approach and says that these bonus \npayments or incentive payments--or whatever name you would like to give \nto them--from the insurer to the servicer in order to utilize their \nvery expensive, above market rate product rather than a fair market \nrate product will not be allowed. That eliminates this conflict of \ninterest and will enable the servicer to provide a fair service of \nplacing flood insurance on a property if it is required under the terms \nof the mortgage, but not to do so in a predatory manner.\n  I hope that all of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle will \ntake a look at this practice and realize that the overall scope of this \nbill is about a fair deal for families who are in the situation of \nbeing required under their mortgage to obtain flood insurance. Part of \nthat fair deal should involve ending this particular predatory premium \npractice on force-placed flood insurance.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2707\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I wish to speak very briefly on the Toomey \namendment. I know we have on the floor a bill that basically, let's \nface it, puts off for about 4 years reforms we put into the Flood \nInsurance Program. It is a $24 billion program. It is a very small, in \nessence, entitlement program we have in this country.\n  I am very despondent over the fact that we passed these reforms \nunanimously out of the Banking Committee in 2011. That took place in \nOctober of 2013.\n  Our Nation is facing incredible entitlement problems, and we all know \nit. People on both sides of the aisle have been down here ad nauseam \ntalking about the fact that as a Nation, the No. 1 threat we have is \nour inability to deal with the fiscal issues we know we have throughout \nthe entitlement programs we have in this country. Here we have a \nsituation where, unanimously, out of the Banking Committee, we passed \nreforms to deal with the flood insurance program which we know is \nmoving quickly towards insolvency.\n  So what do we do? Maybe instead of being the most deliberative body \nin the world, we might be described as the most pandering body in the \nworld. What we are doing instead is punting on these reforms. I am \ndiscouraged by that. It is amazing. I think we have not shown the \nability to really address any of the bigger issues that our Nation has \nto deal with.\n  Obviously, I would be more responsive to a bill that maybe made \ntweaks or did some things to make this work in a way that was not quite \nas draconian. But the fact is we all know the way the program works. It \nis just not sustainable, and we know that, in essence, taxpayers all \nacross this country are subsidizing folks who are participating in a \nnational program that called for them to have insurance relative to \ntheir own property.\n  So in an effort to try to deal with this in a more thoughtful way, \nPat Toomey from Pennsylvania has offered an amendment to ensure that \nthe increases in premiums people are facing\n\n[[Page S580]]\n\nare done in a way that obviously dramatically reduces the impact on \npeople. Again, I applaud that. I appreciate that. I think there are \nsome homeowners in this country, as well as property owners, who are \nhaving--the way the program now works, these increases would take place \nover the next 4 to 5 years. Instead, the Toomey amendment causes them \nto not increase--especially for those who make under a certain amount \nof money--more than 25 percent a year. So if someone has a $200 bill \nfor flood insurance next year, it would go up 50 percent.\n  I think it is a thoughtful effort to try to cause this bill to still \nbe actuarially sound. It has no negative impact on our deficits. I \nthink it is a way for us to deal with this in a much better way than, \nlet's face it, putting our heads in the sand and not taking on this \nissue.\n  I want to go back one more time and say this is one of the few \nreforms--it may be the only reform that I am aware of--that has \nactually become law that has come out of the Banking Committee in \nseveral years. It did so unanimously. This is in essence an entitlement \nprogram. It is a small entitlement program. I understand it is very \nimportant to some property owners around our country. But if we as a \nbody are going to turn away from reforms and not replace those reforms \nwith other reforms but instead delay--in essence what most people \nbelieve because of the way FEMA operates--delay this for 4 years, then \nI think it speaks to a body that just really has no desire whatsoever \nto take on the issues that are so important to our Nation's citizens.\n  So I think the Toomey amendment is a thoughtful approach to try to \ndeal with the issue, which I think is affecting many people in this \nbody who have people they represent who are going through substantial \nincreases in a way that they feel to be too draconian. So if that is a \nSenator's issue, I urge people to strongly support the Toomey \namendment.\n  By the way, with the passage of the Toomey amendment, which leaves \nthe rest of the reforms in place, I will then believe we have done \nsomething in this body that is thoughtful. We will have attempted to \nmake this Flood Insurance Program actuarially sound and, at the same \ntime, we will have solved the issue that I think so many people here \nare concerned about. Without the passage of the Toomey amendment as a \npart of this bill, I wish to say one more time, this body will have \nfailed once again. With a very, very, very small entitlement program, \nwe will have failed to rise to the occasion, to put our country, \nminimally, on a course toward solvency, and instead turned away from \nthis effort which speaks to the fact that there is almost no likelihood \nthat we will ever, within the short period of the midterm anyway, be \nable to address the bigger issues we all know are looming and are \naffecting our country in such a big way.\n  I urge strong support for the Toomey amendment. Without the Toomey \namendment, I hope this body will vote down this bill which undoes the \nonly real reforms the Banking Committee has put in place in the last \nseveral years.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I thank the Presiding Officer for \nthe time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and friend from \nTennessee for his, as usual, thoughtful presentation, even though I \ndisagree with it. His positions are always thoughtful, carefully \nthought out, and I appreciate his thoughts and efforts.\n  The need to pass the Menendez-Isakson-Landrieu bill is extremely \nimportant. In New York we have seen the follies of the present flood \ninsurance law. We have seen follies in a variety of ways. Most of all, \nwe have seen homeowners charged a fortune which they can't afford. We \nhave seen homeowners told that even if they are not going to be \ncharged, immediately when they sell their home, the rate will go up so \nhigh that they can't sell their home, so the value of the home \ndecreases.\n  We have seen people--victims of Sandy--whose homes were destroyed or \nbadly damaged, rebuild their homes and then be perhaps forced to lose \nthem because of ridiculous flood insurance rates. We have seen the \nproblems with the maps--areas 5 miles from the nearest flood somehow \nget called a flood zone and they have to pay more insurance.\n  We have seen FEMA overreaching in terms of drawing maps. In fact, in \nmy State, they used Suffolk County's flood maps and flood levels and \njust transposed them on Nassau County--a different place with different \nelevations and different tides, and we had to get that undone. So a \nmoratorium, going back to the drawing board and holding rates in place \nwhile that happens, makes eminent sense.\n  It is true it will cost the government some money. But what is our \njob here? Is it to let thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of \nthousands default, lose their homes while we stand here and twiddle our \nthumbs? I don't think so. I don't think the vast majority of Americans \nthink that. We have to figure out how to deal with flood insurance and \nthe Menendez-Isakson-Landrieu bill does that. But while we are doing \nit, we have to make sure people don't lose their homes. There are many \nmore storms out there. We know that. We have had a Katrina and a Sandy, \ncreating unprecedented damage. It certainly means that the old flood \ninsurance program probably has to be changed. But to just eliminate it, \nbasically, by not passing this bill or by passing the Toomey amendment \nwhich, in effect, would eliminate it, makes no sense and would cause \nhuge damage.\n  I rise in opposition to the Toomey amendment. If a person believes \nthere should be some level of affordability before we impose rates, \nthen a person can't vote for the Toomey bill. Because the Toomey bill \nbasically has mandatory rate increases before any affordability study \nis concluded. It repeats the mistake of Biggert-Waters. Biggert-Waters \nactually called for an affordability study. FEMA didn't complete the \naffordability study and still had the rates go into effect.\n  If affordability is one of our hallmarks, and I believe it is, then \nit certainly makes no sense to do what FEMA has done under Biggert-\nWaters, which is put rate increases in effect before affordability is \nstudied or do what Toomey does, which actually explicitly says rate \nincreases shall go into effect before the affordability study is \ncompleted.\n  Furthermore, the Toomey amendment, in my judgment, means we may as \nwell have nothing at all; we might as well go back to the old, because \nit establishes an uncapped annual fee on all 5.6 million NFIP \npolicyholders for an unspecified period of time until the identified \ncosts of this bill are offset.\n  There is no guarantee that homeowners would be protected from a \n$30,000 premium, if that is what the actuaries think. Speaking for my \nState of New York, they say it is people on the water. It is second \nhomes. It is rich people. Not in New York, it is not. We have all seen \nthe pictures of homes damaged in Staten Island, in the Rockaways, \nQueens, in southern Brooklyn, on the southern shore of Long Island--\nmodest homes, some of them even called bungalows, where people live \nfull-time. In Long Beach, average folks--firefighters, teachers, cops, \nclerks, secretaries, small business people who struggle--double or \ntriple or quadruple their insurance rates, their flood insurance rates, \nand they can't get by.\n  One other point I wish to make. Some of my colleagues said: This \ndoesn't effect me. It is going to because FEMA is remapping across the \ncountry. They have done a lot of the remapping in New York. I have \ntalked about how irresponsible what they have done is. Once they come \nto other Members' States and maps, they will see that the mapping is \nalmost nonsensical, mapping people into flood zones who have never had \na flood, charging rates that average folks cannot afford. From what I \nam told, Pennsylvania is the State with the highest percentage of new \nmapping activity; 14 percent of all new mapping activity, 1,400 maps. \nSo I think even for my good friend from Pennsylvania--and I know he is \na true believer in these things and I don't doubt that and I respect \nhis integrity, but it is sure going to affect the people of \nPennsylvania.\n  Guess which State is second in terms of new maps? New York: 625. That \nis why I feel so strongly and have worked so hard with Senators \nMenendez and Isakson and Landrieu, who have done such a fabulous job on \nthis legislation to get it passed.\n\n[[Page S581]]\n\n  So I urge defeat of the Toomey amendment. The Toomey amendment is \nalmost a mirror image of the bill itself, the Biggert-Waters bill, \nwhich we are tying to counteract and because FEMA did not implement it \ncorrectly.\n  If the Toomey amendment is defeated, and if our flood insurance bill, \nwhich I am a proud cosponsor of, is passed, homeowners will be able to \nbreathe a sigh of real relief while FEMA goes back to the drawing \nboards and figures out a way to have a flood insurance program that \ndoes not bankrupt thousands of middle-class, working-class people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2697\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I believe when I left the floor my \namendment was pending, amendment No. 2697. I would like to spend a few \nminutes to talk about that amendment. I know somebody else has come to \nthe floor here rather quickly and I have about 5 minutes, I have been \ntold by the cloakroom.\n  Congressional creation of the National Association of Registered \nAgents and Brokers, the bill that has been attached to the flood bill, \nusurps the rights of States' authority over insurance licensing and \nregulations.\n  Congress established the McCarran-Ferguson Act that States should \nretain the regulatory authority over insurance laws.\n  While NARAB II was crafted to retain primacy of insurance regulations \nand enforcement actions within the States, this bill will nevertheless \ncompel States to accept a national license within their jurisdictions.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office stated:\n\n       . . . the association's authority would exist only through \n     a preemption of states' power to regulate the licensing of \n     insurance producers. This preemption would stem from an \n     exercise of the sovereign power of the federal government.\n\n  NARAB II provides the President and his or her appointee the \nauthority to nullify the decisions made by the NARAB board but does not \nextend any of the same rights to the individual States.\n  My amendment will provide a State the opportunity to opt out of \nparticipation in NARAB only through the passage of legislation by the \nState legislature and signature of the Governor, and it will not allow \nState insurance commissioners to opt out on a whim.\n  To prevent a disruptive transition, this amendment requires a 2-year \ndelay between passage of State legislation and the effective date of an \nopt-out. So you cannot get out just like that. It is 2 years.\n  In order to maintain the foundation of reciprocity and prevent States \nfrom gaming the provision for a competitive advantage, insurance \nproducers located within a State that opts out of NARAB would be \nineligible from participating in the NARAB system. So if your State \nopts out, you lose the privilege of going to other States.\n  The inclusion of this provision would accomplish the bill's goal of \nstreamlining and cost-savings without the continuation of Congress \ninfringing on activities that should be left to the States.\n  The amendment will still allow for the benefits provided by a \nmultistate licensing process to reduce the bureaucracy involved for \nproducers to access customers in other States, which will help increase \ncompetition and lower consumer costs--things I am totally for. \nActually, I am for this bill, but only with preserving the Tenth \nAmendment rights of States.\n  The provision will also provide a safeguard from NARAB if 10 years \nfrom now it is not working as well as the current consensus has hoped \nand a State or States no longer wish to participate.\n  As the bill's proponents have already pointed out, NARAB has the \nsupport of every State and every insurance producer. They all agree. If \nthat is the case, and this is so popular and such a needed reform, then \nno State will opt out, and the opt-out provision would be mute, while \nstill protecting the States' rights.\n  I understand the opposition to this, that they think this will not \nget off the ground. But the very statements that have been made both in \nthe committee and on the floor--that everybody wants this, all the \ninsurance industry wants this, all the State insurance commissioners \nwant this--if that is the case, nobody will opt out and we will have \nmet our constitutional duty of protecting the Bill of Rights for the \nStates.\n  I finish by saying this: One of the reasons we are in extreme \ndifficulty--what physicians would call extremis--is that we have \nignored States rights, we have ignored the Bill of Rights, and we have \nsaid we are primal.\n  So as CBO said, we are stepping all over this. I understand I \nprobably will not be able to stop it, but it is another indication of \nwhy we need the Enumerated Powers Act. That is simply a bill sponsored \nby 44 Senators that says if you bring a bill to the floor, you have to \ngive the authority under which the enumerated powers would justify you \nbringing this bill to the floor--to make us pause, just to think about \nit.\n  I do not think it is unreasonable. People may disagree about whether \nStates ought to have the right to opt out, but if the program is such \nas has been designed by the authors of this bill and the statements by \nthe people who have spoken on this bill on the floor--if that is the \ncase--putting this amendment in will not harm it at all; it will not \never be used.\n  So it is simply saying, if they want to opt out, it is 2 years after \nthey vote in their legislature and it is signed by the Governor before \nthey can, so there is no disruption. Nobody is going to do that, if it \nis true what everybody who is supporting this bill has said.\n  It is peculiar and curious to me why anybody would oppose this \namendment if, in fact, the facts are as stated by those supporting \nNARAB II. And I support it. But I think we ought to protect the States' \nconstitutional rights.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I know the distinguished Senator from \nNorth Dakota is going to speak, but if she would withhold for 1 moment, \nI ask unanimous consent that the time until 4:45 p.m. be equally \ndivided between the two leaders or their designees; that at 4:45 p.m. \ntoday the Senate proceed to votes in relation to the following: \nMenendez motion to waive budget points of order against S. 1926, Reed \namendment No. 2703, Whitehouse amendment No. 2706, and Gillibrand \namendment No. 2708--I would expect those amendments would go by voice--\nand, finally, there be 2 minutes of debate in between the votes, \nequally divided in the usual form.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, thank you so much for this opportunity \nto stand and support a bill that has taken a long time to get to the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate. I remember back when Members such as Senator \nMary Landrieu stood and sounded the alarm--sounded the alarm even \nbefore we saw the problem coming. As a result of that initial effort, \nand as a result of the great effort of the gentleman who just left the \nfloor, Mr. Menendez, we now have a bill on the floor where we can truly \nsay we are actually listening to the middle class.\n  How many times do you think in this body we talk about the working \nfolks, who go to work every day, doing everything they can to put food \non the table, and they just need us to not cause more problems for \nthem? We hear about the middle class, and last night during the State \nof the Union speech, again more discussion about the need to pay \nattention to the financial struggles and the challenges of working \nfamilies.\n  Well, let me tell you, this is a bill that for so many working \nfamilies in North Dakota and across the country can mean the difference \nbetween home ownership or no home ownership, can mean the difference \nbetween actually having equity in their home or having a house that is \nunder water.\n\n[[Page S582]]\n\n  I am not exaggerating. This is a critical part of the housing market. \nIt has created uncertainty in the housing market while we are trying to \nachieve some success and some continuing momentum. Housing is 20 \npercent of what we do in this country in our economy, but yet this is \nthrowing a monkey wrench into the housing market for so many families \nand for so many States.\n  I want to not tell anything new here maybe but to kind of give a \ndifferent perspective because I think all too often people think flood \ninsurance is about the coast or it is about the gulf or it is about \nwhat is happening maybe along a major river, whether it is the \nMississippi. But let me tell you, in my State flooding is a reality for \nway too many people. It is a problem we have experienced during these \nwet cycles that has led to devastation, has led to loss of equity in \nfolks' homes, and it has led to uncertainty.\n  I want to talk a little bit about two places you may not think of \nbecause you have all heard about the massive Grand Forks flood, and \nyou, of course, watched television as we were looking at what could \nhave potentially happened in our largest city, the city of Fargo, ND.\n  But what you may not know is we have a city called Minot, ND, that \nexperienced a devastating flood, an absolutely devastating flood, to a \ntremendous amount of affordable housing--that housing that was along \nthe bodyway. They thought they were protected from a hundred-year \nflood. Many did not have flood insurance, and the hundred-year flood \ncame and devastated and wiped out literally hundreds and hundreds of \ngood, hard-working families and retired folks.\n  They are looking to rebuild, but right now the uncertainty of flood \ninsurance and what is going to happen with the new flood maps has \nslowed down that effort. It has created uncertainty. I just had a \nmeeting in the city of Minot, where I talked to the mayor, talked to \nthe city officials, and asked the questions about whether they were \nseeing this uncertainty. They certainly are getting lots of questions. \nI would love to tell those hard-working North Dakotans that we \nactually, in Washington, DC, can hear what they are saying.\n  I also wish to talk about another place way off from Minot. It is in \nthe Red River Valley. It is a place called Grafton, ND, where a great \nNorth Dakota family, Allison and Kyle, purchased their home 1 year ago. \nAt the time, the flood insurance rate on their home was $900 a year.\n  They knew that when they bought the house.\n  They said: OK. Fine. We have this extra expenditure in order to meet \nour mortgage requirement. They built that into their budget. This is \ncoverage for $100,000. It seemed reasonable. It seemed like they were \npaying their fair share. But when the policy recently came up after the \nchanges in the Biggert-Waters law, their flood insurance rate \nskyrocketed to $4,200 a year--$4,200 a year. That is a 375-percent \nincrease.\n  In an email to me, Allison expressed a desire to raise their children \nin Grafton, but unfortunately they no longer can afford to live there \nwith those rates because in Grafton we do not have flood protection. As \na result, the entire community is probably in the 100-year flood plain. \nYou are going to buy a house. You are going to get a mortgage. You are \ngoing to be required to get flood insurance.\n  So not only is Allison devastated by this news, the whole community \nof Grafton is now struggling with this increase in flood insurance. In \nthe community of Valley City, a home has a flood insurance bill that \njust went from $700 to more than $10,000 a year. Think about that. A \nlot of people who hear that amount would say: Is that your mortgage \npayment? No. They say: It is flood insurance. Get this. That flood \ninsurance is for $60,000 worth of coverage.\n  We have an opportunity here to act as a body that actually listens to \nthe challenges of the American people and actually reforms and looks \nback when we make decisions, decisions such as Biggert-Waters, and as \nSenator Menendez has so often said, the concerns about affordability \nwere raised at the time. They assumed those would be taken into \nconsideration as they moved forward with the rate reduction. It did not \nhappen and these rates went up.\n  But we also have a unique issue in North Dakota; it is called the \nbasement exemption. When you think about at what level your house is \nprotected, you think about your foundation, to that level where your \nyard basically meets your foundation. Because we waterproofed our \nbasements along the Red River Valley in a lot of our communities we \nwere given an exemption. Lots of money went into waterproofing and \nmaking those basements flood-proof.\n  One might ask: Why do you need a basement? Just put it on a slab. \nNorth Dakota, unbeknownst to a lot of people, suffers from tornados. In \nfact, Fargo was devastated in the 1950s by a tornado. So people take \nvery seriously that emergency shelter that is provided in basements, \nand frequently those basements get rehabbed and as a result were used \nas flood control back when those homes were built.\n  But now we have a basement exemption. People have made the \ninvestment. FEMA has, in fact, suggested that the basement exemptions \nwill no longer be valid for all of those communities that have relied \non that to provide affordable housing in their communities. So this \nbill retains and says clearly that the basement exemption, after people \nmade investments and reliance on the government--reliance on the \ngovernment's word, that we will, in fact, have protection. Without this \nprovision, without the basement exemption, flood insurance rates in \nthese areas that rely on basements could go up again $10,000 a year.\n  The Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act provides a balanced, \ntargeted approach. This bill gives FEMA the authority needed to \nimplement reforms included in Biggert-Waters in a thoughtful way, to \nimprove the program's solvency, and phase out certain subsidies without \npricing people out of their homes and out of the program.\n  It delays the premium increases until FEMA completes that all-\nimportant affordability study required under Biggert-Waters and \nproposes regulations that allow time for Congress to review. There have \nbeen some positive steps since many of my colleagues have come to the \nfloor, including myself, to sound the alarm so many months ago. But we \nneed still to pass this bill.\n  I think the time is now. What better way--what better way for us to \nrespond to the call of looking at and improving the condition of the \nmiddle class than to say: We heard. We listened. We understood the \nchallenges and today we acted. We heard that you want to own your home. \nWe heard that the Federal Government ought not get in the way of you \nowning your home.\n  I would encourage all of my colleagues--all of my colleagues--to send \na message, send a message that we are putting our votes where our \nmouths are; that we are, in fact, voting to improve the condition of \nvery many working-class and middle-class American citizens who have had \ngreat uncertainty created as a result of flood insurance.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       State of the Union Address\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, last night during the President's State of \nthe Union speech, I felt as though I was watching another rerun of one \nof my favorite movies, ``Groundhog Day'' with Bill Murray. Of course, \nwe all remember that movie. Bill Murray, the principal character, \nrelives exactly the same 24 hours over and over and over again.\n  Of course, that is what the President's State of the Union reminded \nme of, because what we heard is a replay of a lot of the ideas we have \nheard in previous State of the Union speeches. But, unfortunately, the \nPresident's speech and his claims in many respects did not reflect \nreality for most people.\n  It is apparent the President has not changed in this respect. He \nstill thinks slow economic growth and high unemployment, that the \nanswer to that is\n\n[[Page S583]]\n\nmore government spending and more government control over the economy. \nI would say in the debates we have had in this Chamber and elsewhere \nand that Americans have had throughout the course of our history since \nour country's founding about the size and the role of the Federal \nGovernment, usually we end up debating philosophy, ideology, and \ntheory.\n  But the last 5 years have given us the proof we need that big \ngovernment does not work; not to deny that people do not have the best \nof intentions, but we know promise after promise has been made, whether \nit is for the trillion-dollar stimulus--what it would do to \nunemployment. The President later said, in a moment of candor: Well, I \nguess shovel ready was not all that shovel ready. Nancy Pelosi talked \nabout timely, targeted, and temporary stimulus. Again, this was \nborrowed money. This is money we did not have which was added to our \ndebt, which simply did not work. Then of course there is the example of \nObamaCare. But let's just review. For the last 5 years, the President \npushed through this trillion-dollar stimulus, a $1.8 trillion dollar \nhealth care law, a $1.7 trillion increase in new taxes, and about one-\nhalf trillion dollars in new regulations.\n  That is what happens, for example, when I go home to Texas. My \ncommunity bankers and credit unions say: We have hired new people, but \nthe people we have hired are the ones to fill out the paperwork that is \nrequired by the new regulations that are the result of Dodd-Frank.\n  This is another example of where Wall Street perhaps was the target \nbut Main Street was the collateral damage. So all these new regulations \nhave a cost to them because businesses, if they are going to be in \nbusiness, are going to have to hire people to comply with those \nregulations, but that doesn't help grow the economy. That doesn't help \nmake us more productive, and it doesn't put as many people back to work \nas we would hope would be going back to work in productive jobs.\n  Let us consider some of the results of some of these items: the \nstimulus, the health care bill, the new regulations, and new taxes.\n  Between 2009 and 2013, we have seen median household income fall by \nmore than $2,500, so that is $2,500 less than an average family has to \nspend on everything from their food to their heating or air-\nconditioning bill--$2,500 less.\n  Then we know that the labor participation rate--that is a fancy name \nfor the percentage of people actually in the workforce--has fallen to a \nthree-decade low. It has fallen by 3 percentage points since 2009, \nmeaning that many fewer people are actually in the workforce looking \nfor work. If they were still in the workforce looking for work, the \nemployment rate would actually be much higher, but they aren't counted \nonce they drop out of the workforce. Then we know that long-term \nunemployment has increased dramatically as a total share of \nunemployment.\n  Of course, all of this happened after the recession was over. The \ntechnical definition of a recession, I believe, is two consecutive \nterms of negative economic growth. But amazingly a poll conducted only \nlast week reflected that 74 percent of the respondents thought we were \nstill in a recession. Whether it is a technical recession, people still \nfeel as if we are in one. That is a remarkable number, an unfortunate \nbut yet scathing indictment of the President's economic policies which \nhave not delivered what he had hoped and had promised to deliver.\n  What is the big idea that the President has to solve this problem or \nto address these concerns of average hard-working American families? \nThe big idea is let's raise the minimum wage. Superficially, I admit \nraising the minimum wage has some appeal, but the fact is, when \nemployers have to pay more for their workers, overall that is less \nmoney to hire new people. One study estimated that raising the minimum \nwage to $9.50 an hour--that is less than the $10.10 the President has \nproposed--would destroy no fewer than 468,000 jobs. Think about it. \nThere is some money with which to hire people, but rather than hire \nmore people, the government sets the wages, meaning they can't hire \nthese other people. That is how it has an either/or effect in terms of \njobs. One study calculated that raising the minimum wage to $10 an hour \ncould potentially destroy as many as 2.3 million jobs.\n  The President chose to ignore this reality last night in his speech. \nHe was eloquent, as always, and gives a great speech. But he said once \nagain--or reiterated once again--if he can't get what he wants from \nCongress, he is prepared to go it alone.\n  Last night he said he was going to issue an executive order giving a \n40-percent pay raise to Federal contractors, even though the White \nHouse cannot tell us how many workers would actually be affected \nbecause they don't know.\n  But who will end up paying more? The Federal Government.\n  We are talking about raising spending by the Federal Government by 40 \npercent for these Federal contractors. Somebody has to pay that money, \nso it is either going to be the taxpayers or it is going to be added to \nour deficits and debt.\n  I don't want to be a wet blanket, so let me end on a more positive \nnote, something we could actually do together that would actually make \na difference on those long-term unemployed, on people stuck in jobs \nthat are dead end or which they are frustrated with because they are \nnot able to earn the income they want for their family and to live \ntheir dream.\n  One of the debates we should have had earlier but for the majority \nleader denying us an opportunity to offer any amendments, debate, and \nvote on the unemployment insurance extension--but I believe we will see \nthat again--is how could we help people learn the skills they need to \nqualify for the good, high-paying jobs that exist. But there is not \nenough trained workforce with the skills they need in order to pay for \nthose good, high-paying jobs.\n  We know there are a lot of workforce training initiatives. Our friend \nand colleague from Oklahoma tells us there are some 40 different worker \ntraining programs, and he has proposed they ought to be consolidated \nand perhaps streamlined so more of that money could be focused on \ngiving people the education and the tools they need in order to qualify \nfor these good jobs.\n  I saw a glimpse of what could happen, and thankfully is happening \nback in Houston, TX, at San Jacinto College, where I had the \nopportunity to meet some of these inspiring Texans, people who are \npursuing their dream.\n  I met an Iraq war veteran named Jordan Chauvette, who went back to \nschool with the help of the Hazlewood Act. The Hazlewood Act is a State \nlaw that provides tuition benefits to veterans and their families. His \ngoal was to learn the skills he would need in order to live a better \nlife and earn a better income for his wife and family.\n  He recently graduated from San Jacinto College and now is working at \nan engineering and construction company based in the city of La Porte. \nIf I might interject, one of the reasons there is so much construction, \nmanufacturing--an economic boom taking place in this part of our \nState--is because of the shale gas revolution. This is one of the \nbrightest spots in our economy, our energy sector, domestic production \nproducing cleaner natural gas. The President talked about that a little \nbit last night. It is creating these manufacturing jobs because natural \ngas happens to be feedstock necessary for the petrochemical industry.\n  Many of the jobs that exist that need these technical skills are the \nsorts of jobs these young men and women are training for at San Jacinto \nCollege. Everything is connected to everything else, but this is how \ndomestic energy production--some of which the President talked about \nlast night--is so important in terms of bringing that manufacturing \nback on shore. Then we need to have the job training in order to teach \npeople the skills they need in order to qualify for these good, high-\npaying jobs.\n  Let's look at the case of Deanna Harper, who received a cosmetology \ndegree from San Jacinto and then went back to school and earned a \ndegree in something called process technology. I don't pretend to \nunderstand everything that process technology involves, but all I know \nis she is a wife, a mother, and she is earning a six-figure salary \nworking in the energy industry. It is a terrific story.\n\n  I remember a few years ago in Amarillo, TX, meeting a young Hispanic\n\n[[Page S584]]\n\nwoman, a single mother, who had been working as a prison guard--a \ndangerous, tough job. But thanks to the degree she received from \nAmarillo College, she was able to go to work on the B-22 Osprey \nassembly line making in excess of, I believe, $25 an hour and with a \ngreat career ahead of her.\n  What it took was the opportunity for her to go back to school, learn \nthose skills, match those skills with the job, and lift herself up by \nher own bootstraps.\n  So many other Texans--Jordan, Deanna, and this young woman I \nmentioned from Amarillo--have benefited from the recent surge of \nprivate investment into petrochemicals and manufacturing, which I \nmentioned a moment ago. The skills they acquired and the job training \nthey had at San Jacinto prepared them not only for a good job but for \nan upwardly mobile career in a fast-growing industry.\n  At a time of stubbornly high national unemployment and people giving \nup and dropping out of the workforce, we should be doing everything we \npossibly can to ensure that such jobs and careers are available to all \nAmericans who want them. In that sense we should be doing everything \npossible to bring this sort of example to Washington, DC, and to spread \nit nationally.\n  The truth is there are stories such as this occurring everywhere, but \nthere is more we could do. Certainly, one is take up one of the \nsuggestions of our friend from Oklahoma when he talks about the \nduplication, the waste, the inefficiency built into our job-training \nprograms--to make them more efficient, to deliver it more streamlined, \nand to deliver better value to the people who need that training so \nthey can qualify for these kinds of good, high-paying jobs.\n  That is a much better idea than the Federal Government trying to make \na political fix by fixing wages between an employer and a worker that \nartificially elevates those wages beyond what the market will bear and, \nin the process, limit the number of new people whom that employer can \nhire.\n  These are only some of the ideas I think any reasonable person would \nsay are not completely over the top, are not a crazy ideas, that kind \nof make sense. But that is exactly the sort of debate we are not having \nas a result of the restrictive way under which the majority leader is \nletting us take up consideration of some of this legislation such as \nthe unemployment insurance bill.\n  Soon, I predict, he will bring a minimum-wage increase bill to the \nfloor. The question is, Is he going to allow amendments from this side \nof the aisle and the Democratic side of the aisle too? When he cuts off \namendments from the floor of the Senate, it doesn't only hurt the \nminority. We don't like it, but it doesn't only hurt us. It hurts our \nfriends on the other side of the aisle because they are not allowed to \noffer their constructive suggestions for what could improve the \nlegislation. I thought that is why we are in the Senate, to try to \nproduce the best product we can for the American people.\n  We don't do it by writing bills in the majority leader's conference \nroom, bringing them out here, and then trying to shove them on through. \nThat is why we have the debate, the checks, the balances, and the \ndeliberative process we have in the Senate. That is what we have not \nbeen having.\n  I wished to raise a few examples of what we could be doing that would \nbe enormously constructive and would help a lot of these struggling \nworkers during a time of high unemployment and low labor participation \nto help them get back on track.\n  I came away from that experience at San Jacinto College rejuvenated \nand encouraged that there is a lot we can do. We do know that people \ndon't want to collect unemployment--maybe some do, but most people, the \nvast majority of people, want a job.\n  Again, to repeat what the President talked about last night, he \ntalked about the dignity of work. That is what the vast majority of \npeople want; they want a good job. If we give them the opportunity to \nlearn the skills and we give them a growing economy that is creating \njobs, not fewer jobs, then they will be able to find that. I came away \neven more committed to adopting progrowth economic policies that will \nmake it easier for all Americans to find work when they finish school.\n  I close on this note. The press leading into the President's speech \nlast night sounded as if it was going to be a whole lot more like he \nwas going to go it alone. But he did at least offer an olive branch of \ntrying to do things more constructively in the legislative branch, \nrecognizing that our Constitution doesn't authorize the executive to do \nthis all by himself. That is what checks and balances are all about, \nand that is what doesn't happen when he tries to ``go it alone.'' There \nis danger in trying to go it alone when things are poorly thought out \nand rammed through without adequate legislation.\n  But there is one area where that President can use that phone and pen \nhe talked about. He could use that pen to sign the authorization for \nthe Keystone XL Pipeline and connect the pipeline to Canadian oil \nreserves that would extend from Canada all the way through the United \nStates down to Port Arthur, TX, into what we call the Golden Triangle, \nwhere we have a lot of refineries that would turn that crude oil into \njet fuel and gasoline. In the process a lot of jobs would be created.\n\n  For those of my friends who say: Oh my gosh, we can't build another \npipeline, I would invite them to go on Google or Bing or any other \nsearch engine and just type in oil and gas pipelines and see what they \nget. You will be astonished at the number of pipelines that crisscross \nthis country and that safely transmit their product without our even \nknowing about it, by and large.\n  I realize occasionally there are accidents, and those are to be \ndeplored and regretted, and we should try to prevent those. But the \nidea should not be to cut our nose off to spite our face and deny \nourselves this safe source of energy from a friendly country such as \nCanada, so we don't have to get it from dangerous volatile regions of \nthe world and also take with it the jobs that are created as a result \nof this great renaissance in American and North American energy.\n  So I would say to the President, in conclusion, after listening to \nhim last night, and really trying to listen to his words: Look at the \nStates that actually are the successful laboratories of democracy. That \nis the phrase Louis Brandeis coined. That is the great thing about our \nFederal system, where we have 50 States that are sovereign. They \nconduct their own business, subject to those matters that are delegated \nto the Federal Government under the Constitution. But the States are a \ngreat place to see what works and what doesn't work. I might add that \nthe two lowest unemployment rates in the United States are Bismark, ND, \nand Midland, TX, and not unrelated to the shale gas renaissance I \nmentioned a moment ago.\n  We should look at what works, from the Tax Code--making it less \nburdensome, more logical and more conducive to economic growth--to how \nwe address the unkept promises of things such as ObamaCare, which has \ncreated uncertainty, increased cost, and caused a lot of disruption in \nthe lives of Americans, and replacing it with patient-centered reforms \nthat actually reduce the cost, expand quality coverage, and improve \naccess to care.\n  I believe that is the kind of debate we should be having, and that is \nthe type of agenda the American people are asking for and the type of \nagenda they deserve.\n  Mr. President, I yield floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I come to the floor of the Senate today \nto speak on the importance of passing the Homeowner Flood Insurance \nAffordability Act. I am a cosponsor of this legislation because without \nit millions of homeowners across the country will see significant \nincreases in their flood insurance premiums.\n  Homeowner insurance protects a family's investments from damages and \nlosses that come as a result of accidents or tornadoes or burglaries, \nbut that same homeowner policy, as we all know, does not cover damage \nresulting from floods. Sadly, too many Americans learn of this gap in \ntheir policy after it is too late.\n  In recognition of this major gap in coverage, Congress created the \nNational Flood Insurance Program in 1968 to give homeowners and \nbusinesses protection in the event of a flood, and this program has \nhelped them to protect their property, their families, and their \nlivelihoods.\n\n[[Page S585]]\n\n  All regions of America are susceptible to flooding. We see it with \nseasonal rains, hurricanes, and thunderstorms, and it is a powerful \nforce of nature we cannot escape. When you have flood insurance, you \nhave the peace of mind that the tools to help you rebuild will be there \nfor you. For Minnesotans who live in areas susceptible to flooding, the \nflood insurance program is absolutely vital.\n  Each spring in northwestern Minnesota, we know the Red River of the \nNorth will top its banks and the flood waters will threaten Moorhead, \nMN, and Fargo, ND. Leading up to the flood event last spring, I visited \nthe region twice to watch the flood preparations, to urge on our \nvolunteers, and to ensure the residents were receiving the Federal \nassistance and cooperation they needed. Just as I have seen each and \nevery year since 2007, I saw once again how hard friends and neighbors \nwork to prepare for the potential flood.\n  These people aren't idly sitting by. In fact, I would bet that if \ntowns and other areas of the country saw the kind of floods these folks \nhave faced in certain years of the last decade, I am not sure they \nwould have been saved. In this case, the residents of Moorhead and \nFargo incessantly would create sandbags. They have huge warehouses \nfilled with volunteers. Everyone from teenagers to seniors to inmates \nwould be stuffing those bags full of sand. Residents fought heroically \nto save not only their homes but their businesses and their families.\n  Across the Red River, we always say the rising river doesn't divide \nthe two States of Minnesota and North Dakota, it unites us. This is not \nthe first time the Red River has risen, and it certainly won't be the \nlast. As honorable, tireless, and commendable as these efforts are, \nhomeowners can't do it alone, and they deserve our help. That is why we \nneed a National Flood Insurance Program that offers affordable premiums \nfor homeowners who are trying to do the right thing.\n  I would say that on the Minnesota side, many homeowners have \nrelocated--dozens and dozens. In fact, across our State, hundreds of \nhouses have literally been moved or been destroyed because they are too \nclose to flooded areas, but still the need for flood insurance remains.\n  So what are these people seeing? FEMA is increasing premiums to \nlevels that do not fairly reflect the risks associated with the flood \ncoverage that is being provided, and the consequences of these \nincreases can't be understated. There are 1.1 million homes and \nbusinesses across the country that were built before FEMA published a \nflood map of their community, and now they might not be able to sell \ntheir property. Another 2.9 million homes and business owners across \nthe country who have followed the rules but were remapped into a \nhigher-risk area are now seeing significant spikes in their premiums.\n  Rate increases are not just numbers. They can have a substantial \nimpact on real families and even price them out of their homes. Sharp \nincreases in premiums are devastating for a place such as Roseau, MN, \nwhere 75 percent of the homes are located in the floodplain. One Roseau \nresident who recently wanted to purchase flood insurance for a home \nvalued at $75,000, was shocked with the changes in the premiums. This \nindividual's new annual policy would cost $3,726, not the $985 it had \nbeen previously. That is nearly four times as much, and that is sticker \nshock. When calculated for 30 years, the length of a typical home loan, \nthe flood policy on that $75,000 home would cost more than $110,000--\nmore than the value of the home itself.\n  Crookston, MN, residents are similarly seeing premiums they can't \nafford. One resident, who recently purchased a home for around \n$100,000, was stunned to learn his annual flood insurance program would \nbe $5,800, not the $800 he had anticipated based on the past.\n  This isn't the way the National Flood Insurance Program is supposed \nto work. Our National Flood Insurance Program should provide peace of \nmind, but, instead, these changes create a disincentive for families \nand businesses in flood-prone areas to do the right thing.\n  Roseau recovered from a flood in 2002 that caused widespread damage \nand is working on permanent flood protection to reduce the flood stages \nin the city. Once complete, the project will include a restriction \nstructure to the city from the 100-year regulatory flood plain and \nreduce future flood damages by nearly 86 percent.\n  It makes no sense that FEMA would be pushing these premium increases \non consumers before the congressionally required study on affordability \nhas even begun. The bill the Senate is considering today, and which I \nsupport, supports these priorities. It stops the proposed rate \nincreases until the affordability study is done and the flood maps \nbeing used are verified as being accurate. Only after all of this \ncritical information is reviewed should FEMA move forward and consider \nthe cost of premiums that encourage participation in the flood \ninsurance program while ensuring its long-term stability.\n  The National Flood Insurance Program has given protection to \nhomeowners and businesses from catastrophic flood losses for more than \n45 years. We shouldn't hit them now with an outrageous premium \nincrease.\n  I commend Senators Menendez, Isakson, and Landrieu on their great \nwork on this legislation and urge my colleagues to support it.\n\n\n                             The Farm Bill\n\n  Now, Mr. President, I would like to discuss another critical priority \nfor my home State of Minnesota, and that is the farm bill.\n  I rise today to speak in support of the farm bill conference \nagreement. I was a member of the conference committee. This bill is \ngood for farmers, it is good for rural economies, and it is good for \ntaxpayers, which the House recognized earlier today when they voted to \npass the farm bill by a strong vote of 251 to 166. Now it is the \nSenate's turn to pass this critical legislation and get it to the \nPresident's desk as soon as possible.\n  I thank Chairwoman Stabenow for her determination to get us to this \npoint. She has been tireless in her advocacy for America's farmers and \nranchers and has made it a priority to work in a bipartisan way with \nRanking Member Cochran to put together a farm bill that strengthens the \nsafety net for our Nation's family farmers, ranchers, and preserves \ncritical food and nutrition programs and brings down the deficit. \nSenator Stabenow couldn't have been a better partner in this effort, \nand the same goes for Senator Cochran. I greatly appreciate the \nexpertise they both bring to agricultural policy, and I thank them for \ntheir leadership.\n  I thank the ranking member of the House Agriculture Committee, Collin \nPeterson. No one knows more about agriculture than Collin Peterson, who \nserves as a representative from my State. He has the longest district \nin the United States of America, stretching literally from the Canadian \nborder nearly down to the Iowa border. I guess that is why he flies his \nown plane when he visits the towns. There is no other way to visit many \nplaces in one day. It has been a privilege for me to work with \nCongressman Peterson on this issue. It is the second farm bill we have \nworked on together.\n  I also want to thank my other Congressman Tim Walz for his service on \nthe conference committee. We worked hard to make sure this bill is \nstrong for our country, for our State, and for the people of America.\n  Farmers, ranchers, and rural communities in Minnesota have been \nwaiting for this farm bill for more than 2 years. It is a good bill for \nour State, and it is a good bill for the country. It provides the \ncertainty family farmers need to succeed and thrive, and that is why it \nhas the strong support of both the National Farmers Union and the \nAmerican Farm Bureau.\n  That is not to say everyone got everything they wanted in this bill. \nSome concerns remain about potentially retaliatory actions regarding \nexports. As the Senator from the State that is first in turkey, second \nin pork, and sixth in agricultural exports, I will continue to work \nwith the administration and producers to ensure our agricultural \npolicies are implemented in a manner that avoids potential disruptions \nand ensures agricultural exports remain an American success story.\n  As a member of the conference committee, I worked with colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle in the House and the Senate to build on the \nstrong farm bill the Senate passed last year. In the\n\n[[Page S586]]\n\nconference report, we first of all eliminated direct payments and \ntransitioned to crop insurance to help manage risk. We provided $880 \nmillion in mandatory funding to promote homegrown energy. We maintained \nthe successful sugar program that is so important to the sugar beet \nproducers in the Red River Valley. We reduced the deficit by $23 \nbillion, making this an important bill for all Americans. We kept \nnutrition programs strong for Minnesota families. We provided permanent \ndisaster relief for our Nation's livestock producers. We streamlined \nthe conservation programs and still managed to come out with a \nproconservation bill that is supported by environmental and \nconservation groups across the country.\n  I wanted to focus on the disaster provisions of the bill. The \ndisaster provisions are all the more critical when we consider just how \nmuch our farmers and ranchers have been through recently--the worst \ndrought since 1956, a devastating blizzard that killed thousands of \ncattle in my neighboring State of South Dakota, and a wet spring that \nled to a shortage of alfalfa that hurt beef and dairy producers in \nMinnesota.\n  In this farm bill, we ensure that permanent disaster relief will be \nthere for livestock producers that were left stranded when the farm \nbill expired last September. This assistance will be there for \nproducers when they face the next disaster.\n  The farm bill also includes an amendment that I led with Senators \nHoeven and Heitkamp that addresses critical priorities by providing an \nadditional $300 million. This came out of our committee in the Senate \nbefore we passed it in the Senate. This $300 million will boost \nagricultural research, address the backlog of water and wastewater \nprojects, and support energy projects in rural areas.\n  The amendment also supported funding for conservation projects that \ncan help reduce flooding while protecting wildlife habitat.\n  The farm bill authorizes a joint study by the U.S. Departments of \nAgriculture and Transportation to examine rural transportation issues, \nincluding captive shipping, something I pushed for--seeing what I am \nseeing with some of our producers, with our agricultural producers, \nwith our manufacturers that are at the end of the line and are finding \nthey don't have a lot of choice over what rail rates are for that last \nleg. They many times are being charged outrageously high rates, which \nmakes it difficult for them to produce goods.\n  Today families and farmers are facing a severe propane shortage in my \nState. I believe it is more important than ever that we understand the \nvulnerabilities and shortcomings of our transportation infrastructure \nso we can ensure that the fuels we need to keep our homes and barns \nwarm are available and affordable.\n  I fought to include each of these provisions because I believe that \nif we want to recruit a new generation of farmers and ranchers, then we \nmust take action to improve the quality of life in rural communities. \nThat is why I authored a number of the provisions specifically to \nrecruit beginning farmers and ranchers.\n  The first would reduce the cost of crop insurance for beginning \nfarmers by 10 percent. The second would make it easier for beginning \nproducers to graze livestock on Conservation Reserve Program acres.\n  In this bill we put in place a new dairy program that helps dairy \nfarmers in Minnesota and across the country who have struggled with low \nmilk prices and high feed costs. We have probably seen that sector of \nthe agriculture community hit harder than any other. Crops have had \ntheir droughts. We have seen wet springs that have hurt many of our \nfarmers. We have seen the blizzard I mentioned in South Dakota which \nkilled our cattle. We have seen trade barriers put up in other \ncountries which shut down the markets. But I would still say the \nhardest hit of any sector of our agricultural economy in the last few \nyears has been our dairy producers, specifically our small dairy \nproducers. Anyone who has driven through the backroads of Minnesota or \nWisconsin understands how important that is to our economy and our way \nof life.\n  While this compromise wasn't exactly the deal we had reached in the \nSenate, it is still a strong deal. It still contains new protections \nfor dairy farmers. I specifically thank Collin Peterson for his \nleadership in being the architect of this change, as well as the work \nin the Senate by specifically Senator Leahy and Senator Stabenow.\n  The farm bill also streamlines conservation programs from 23 to 13, \nincluding the provisions I worked on to help communities in the Red \nRiver Valley address flooding. It extends conservation compliance rules \nto the Crop Insurance Program--something that came out of the Senate \nbill--and also includes the sodsaver provision that I worked on with \nSenator Thune in South Dakota for five or six States--really, the \nPrairie Pothole States. It protects native lands, native prairie, and \nhelps to preserve our conservation efforts for hunting and for our way \nof life, particularly in the upper Midwest.\n  These critical provisions, with the conservation compliance and our \nsodsaver amendment, are the reason the bill is supported by wildlife \norganizations including Ducks Unlimited and Pheasants Forever, and \nenvironmental groups such as the Natural Resources Defense Council and \nThe Nature Conservancy.\n  I believe we do right by ourselves when we work to strengthen the \nfarms and rural communities which sustain us every day. Our prosperity \ndepends on it, and this farm bill helps us to do just that. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this very bipartisan farm bill.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Coons pertaining to the introduction of S. 1973 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. COONS. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                       State of the Union Address\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, yesterday at the State of the Union Address \nby the President, I asked to join me--each Member of the Senate gets a \npass, a gallery pass for a spouse or constituent or someone--I asked \nElizabeth Dandridge, a Head Start teacher from Cincinnati, to join me \nand she sat in the gallery--the first time she had actually been in the \nCapitol. She taught at Head Start for 10 years.\n  Mrs. Dandridge isn't paid a lot of money. Unfortunately, we don't pay \nHead Start teachers and Head Start teaching assistants a whole lot more \nthan minimum wage. It is important that people understand that there \nare a number of low-wage workers in this country.\n  There is one thing I want to say before I yield to Senator Sessions. \nOne of the reasons to increase the minimum wage is that it matters so \nmuch to those families who work so hard and get so little for it. \nPresident Obama said no one who works full time in this country should \nlive in poverty, and he is absolutely right.\n  The lesson of history is that 100 years ago this month Henry Ford \nmade an announcement that he would pay every one of his workers--from \nthe sweeper of the factory floor to the worker who assembles the \nautos--$5 a day. A lot of his business friends were outraged. They \ncouldn't believe he was doing this. He wasn't necessarily doing it out \nof the goodness of his heart. I certainly don't know his heart. It was \na good business decision.\n  He knew that if he would put $5 a day into his workers' pockets, they \nwould begin to spend that money, it would create more prosperity for \nthe community, a number of those workers might be able to buy cars that \nFord assembled, and we would all be better off. That is really what the \nminimum wage debate is about. It is not only about increasing the \nminimum wage for those\n\n[[Page S587]]\n\nhundreds of thousands of families in my State who work at such low-\nincome levels. It is also going to help the economy in the State of \nDelaware, the State of Alabama, and the State of Ohio.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the flood insurance program is important \nto a lot of Americans. It is important for my constituents in Alabama, \nand they are concerned about it. The reform that has been passed into \nlaw is fundamentally the right approach to fixing the difficulties that \nwe have, in my opinion. It moves this program from a big subsidy to a \nprogram that is actuarially sound and self-sustaining. I think that is \nthe appropriate goal.\n  I think at some point a person living in the interior of the United \nStates should not be required to have money extracted from him or her \nor from their family to pay for somebody who built their house on \nshifting sands on a beach somewhere. That is my view of it. There are \npeople who might find themselves unexpectedly in a dangerous \ncircumstance where floods may occur rapidly or may not occur for \ndecades.\n  In my hometown of Mobile, a number of years ago they had a big flood \nproblem. A lot of homes were damaged. They said it was the 100-year \nflood, and there was a lot of concern for everybody. I think a lot of \npeople didn't have flood insurance. The next year it flooded again so \nthey had two 100-year floods in two consecutive years. I say that \nbecause it is very difficult to manage a program like this in a sound \nway and to fully anticipate all of the dangers.\n  What I am hearing from my constituents is that premiums are going up \nrapidly--very high for some people. It has gone up multiple times from \nwhat the present premiums are currently. There is little time to \nprotest or get a clear review of it, and they think this ought to be \nmore thoughtfully done and phased in in a more effective way.\n  I tend to believe that, but I do not intend to support legislation \nthat would fundamentally undo, reverse or retreat from the principle \nthat was established when we passed legislation in 2012 that provided \nfor the sustainability of this government program--the Flood Insurance \nProgram. I think that is the right principle. It doesn't have to be \ndone overnight. But, it does have to be done more carefully. It doesn't \nneed to be done in a way that hard-working Americans who are struggling \nto get by find their flood insurance premiums--which they must have \nbefore they can get a loan to buy a house in a flood-prone area--\ndoubles, triples or quadruples, and it can be virtually as much as \ntheir house payment. This is the problem we are facing.\n  My colleague Senator Coburn has raised a budget point of order \nagainst the legislation, and I think the budget point of order is well \ntaken. The chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Patty Murray, and \nher staff, have agreed that the legislation violates the budget, and I, \nas the ranking Republican on the Budget Committee, certainly agree with \nthat.\n  There are two aspects of the budget point of order. Maybe I can \nsummarize it. There is probably more to it than this, but in essence we \ncan say two things about it. One, the bill spends more than the Banking \nCommittee was authorized to spend; that creates a violation of the \nbudget in itself. The other violation is that the underlying bill adds \nto the debt. It spends more money than we have, and the result would be \nto add to the debt of the United States.\n  What the bill's supporters have done is come before the Presiding \nOfficer and moved to waive all budget violations. They say this \nlegislation is so important that we should just waive the violations \nand not worry about it. I believe we need to worry about the budget, \nand we need to think about it. There may be occasions when the budget \npoint of order should be waived when we go forward, and there will be \npoints in time when it should not be waived.\n  My view is that we should not waive all budget points of order. I do \nnot believe that is the appropriate vote at this time. We imposed a \nbudget. We promised to limit spending to certain amounts, and we should \nstay within that and not add to the debt. I feel strongly that we ought \nto adhere to the budget and not go around waiving it any time somebody \nwants to spend more money and thereby weaken the commitment we made to \nthe American people when we established certain limits on spending.\n  Both Houses of Congress have adopted it, and we passed it by law. The \nPresident signed the legislation that sets spending limits. This bill \nviolates those limits.\n  I have given thought to this, and maybe good people will disagree. \nThis is my view of it. We should not spend more on the flood insurance \nprogram than was projected and agreed to and add to the debt of the \nUnited States of America. We absolutely should not do that.\n  We should not reduce the constraints we placed on the Federal flood \nprogram so we can spend more money and then borrow the money to pay for \nthat extra cost. That is not what we should do. This budget point of \norder would allow that to happen. The motion to waive the budget \nobjection raised by Senator Coburn--waiving that and all objections to \nthe bill would waive that.\n  There appears to be a second violation, and that violation is that it \nspends more than the Banking Committee was authorized to spend. I think \nthat is a somewhat different issue. Some might disagree under these \ncircumstances. I think that aspect of a budget point of order could be \nwaived, and this is why. Under the law adopted by this body in 2012, \nthe flood insurance program is to be moved to a fully self-sustaining \nactuarially sound program where all the premiums that come in are \nsufficient to pay all of the claims that go out--like any other \ninsurance company in America tries to operate. That is the principle \nthat Congress--both Houses--established when they passed the reform in \n2012.\n  I don't think it is necessarily to be considered a tax increase or a \nviolation of the budget if this insurance program, which is part of the \nBanking Committee's jurisdiction, results in increased premiums to \nensure that the program, while it is transitioning, remains sound and \nis ultimately paid for. I think that is the kind of waiver that may be \njustified.\n  I am really impressed with Senator Toomey and how hard he has worked \non his legislation to create an alternative to the base legislation \nthat is before us today, which I don't think can be justified because \nit adds to the debt of the United States. We don't need to add to the \ndebt. Every time somebody has a problem and then proposes a solution, \nthe tendency is to not find reductions in spending somewhere to fix the \nproblem that they have. They look around and see if they can just \nborrow the money and not pay for the extension.\n  I support Senator Toomey's approach to solving this problem. I mean, \nhis amendment would require a surcharge on all new NFIP policies, but \nit would not add to the debt because the additional spending is paid \nfor by the surcharges that are in turn paid for by NFIP policy \nbeneficiaries. It is not taxing the American citizens to subsidize a \ngroup of people who have flood insurance when the general citizenry \ndoes not have flood insurance.\n  It is an increased fee on the people who benefit from flood insurance \nin the short term to transition this flood insurance program to the \nmore rigorous self-sustaining program from the one that is not self-\nsustaining or is rather draconian in the way it is being implemented.\n  I think Senator Toomey's legislation may not be perfect, but I \nbelieve his legislation is actuarially sound. It raises sufficient \nrevenue from the people who benefit from the flood insurance program to \ntransition in a more gentle and logical and reasonable way to the new \nprogram. It would transition it in an effective way.\n  It does not--according to the people who really understand this--\nthreaten the integrity of the reforms that have been voted into law.\n  I think a good case can be made that the base legislation before us \ntoday violates several budget points of order and is drafted in a way \nthat threatens the very integrity of the reforms we approved in 2012. \nWe should not do that. We should not weaken the commitment we made as a \nCongress in any way that would lead us in a situation in which we don't \nfollow through on the commitment we had to make sure that flood \ninsurance becomes actuarially sound and self-sufficient.\n\n[[Page S588]]\n\n  For what it is worth, I will share with my colleagues my belief that \nwe should not waive all budget points of order, although there may be a \npossibility that we can waive the budget point of order with regard to \nthe spending limit because, should we adopt the Toomey amendment, the \nflood insurance program's indebtedness would be alleviated by placing a \nfee on the insurance policies which benefit the very people who receive \nthe flood insurance subsidies.\n  I appreciate my colleagues Senator Menendez and others who are \nstriving to alleviate some of the harsh results of the transition of \nthe current law, but I think their proposal runs a risk of abandoning \nthe commitments that we made, and I believe their plan would add to the \ndebt.\n  I think the Toomey amendment would be the preferable way for us to \nmeet the problems of this very rough transition period we are in \nwithout adding to the debt and without threatening to abandon the good \ngoal of an actuarially sound flood insurance program.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                              lower rates\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the State of Michigan has traditionally \nbeen a donor State with regard to the National Flood Insurance Program. \nOver the life of the program, Michigan residents have paid far more in \npremiums than they have received in benefits. It was my understanding \nthat the flood insurance reform measure that was passed last year was \ndesigned to make the program more appropriately reflect the true flood \nrisks for insured properties. With the phaseout of subsidies for some \nhigh-risk properties, many Michigan residents expected last year's \nreforms to lead to a better balance between donor and recipient States \nand potentially lower rates for Michigan residents whose properties are \nlower risk.\n  I ask, is it correct that the bill before us, S. 1926, if passed, \nwould not prevent rates from decreasing if that rate would have \ndecreased under current law?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Yes, the Senator is correct. This bill will freeze the \neligibility for some subsidized properties that are required, under \ncurrent law, to move to risk-based rates. But freezing the eligibility \nfor some properties will not prevent any property owner from obtaining \nan elevation certificate and having their rate lowered to account for a \nlower risk reflected in the elevation certificate.\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and to lay \nthat motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 2706\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 2 minutes equally divided on \namendment No. 2706 offered by the Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. \nWhitehouse.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will vote \nenthusiastically for this amendment. Across the country, communities \nand local organizations are trying to revive rivers that have been \ndammed and blocked. When they go forward to remove a dam, when they go \nforward to put in a fish ladder, when they redesign a culvert to allow \nfor water passage, they have to file a flood plan.\n  FEMA requires them to pay a fee to have that flood plan assessed. The \nfee is almost always waived. But they still have to go through the \nwaiver process, which costs money and frankly can be as burdensome as \nsimply paying the fee. This eliminates that fee. It eliminates that \npart of the process and allows towns and small organizations more \nreadily to come to the aid of our old small rivers.\n  I think this is something we should be able to agree on with great \nstrength. It is noncontroversial. I urge my colleagues to vote yea.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2706) was agreed to.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and to lay \nthat motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I call up my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 2708\n\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, my amendment is very simple and \ncommon sense. Many homeowners who live across the United States live in \nhomes that simply cannot be elevated in order to protect or reduce \nflood risk because of their inherent structure. This is a problem that \nis true for cities in New York, cities in New Jersey. In reality, if \nyou live in a brownstone or you live in an apartment building, you \ncannot raise them to protect against flood damage.\n  To fix this problem, all my amendment does is require FEMA to provide \na uniform set of guidelines describing FEMA-approved methods of \nmitigation such as flood-proofing or using flood-proof building \nmaterials to help those homeowners reduce their risk of flood damage. \nFor example, do not leave computers and electrical equipment in your \nbasement. Bring them to the first and second floor.\n  Those kind of simple flood mitigation changes can easily save \nenormous amounts of money and the risk of flood damage from flooding. \nThe amendment also requires FEMA to consider any actions taken by \nhomeowners to implement the methods identified in those\n\n[[Page S589]]\n\nguidelines when calculating flood insurance premium risk rates. By \nproviding a clear set of mitigation guidance for homeowners, this \namendment will help homeowners with more options to reduce their flood \nrisk.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I believe it is \nnoncontroversial.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2708) was agreed to.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I move to reconsider and move to lay \nthat motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I know we are scheduled to take the \nfinal votes on this bill tomorrow morning and final passage at 2. I \njust wish to thank all of the colleagues who were so cooperative today \ndiscussing and moving through these amendments. I appreciate the \ncooperation--bipartisan cooperation, open debate process. I think it \nhas been very helpful. I think we are building a better flood insurance \nprogram for the country, which is our aim.\n  I thank Senator Menendez and Senator Isakson for their leadership \ntoday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \n15 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, this is the 56th time, the 56th \nconsecutive week that we have been in session in the Senate that I have \ncome to the floor to sound an alarm about carbon pollution and the harm \nit is causing to our oceans and to our coastal communities--the 56th \ntime. Frankly, I am getting a little sick of it. I am getting sick of \nthe Republican Party being completely the tool of the polluters. I am \nsick of the phony denial and of not getting anything done. I am sick of \nwhat it is going to say about American democracy if we keep failing at \nthis.\n  But I am going to keep pounding away because it is so vital to my \nocean State. We are a little State with a lot of coast. Our sea level \nis rising, driven by faraway melting glaciers and everywhere expanding \nsea water. As oceans warm, the water expands. That is what liquids do. \nDeniers look up thermal expansion of liquids and deny that.\n  The most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report \nprojected that sea level will likely rise 1\\1/2\\ to 3 feet by 2100 if \nwe do what the polluters prefer and ignore the clear scientific \nevidence. By the way, that is a conservative number.\n  These rising sea levels hit coasts hard, particularly when storms \nbeat those seas against our shores. It is not just me saying that, we \nare supposed to listen to the nonpartisan Government Accountability \nOffice around here. A 2013 GAO report on climate change effects said \nthis:\n\n       Storm surge, combined with sea level rise, is projected to \n     generate a wide range of negative impacts on roads and \n     bridges. For example, storm surges are projected to \n     increasingly inundate coastal roads, cause more frequent or \n     severe flooding of low lying infrastructure, erode road \n     bases, and ``scour'' bridges by eroding riverbeds and \n     exposing bridge foundations.\n\n  People from polluting States may think that is funny, may think that \ndoes not matter, but to a coastal State such as mine this is a serious \nthreat. This chart shows the worldwide measured change in sea level. \nThis is not some theory--measured change in sea level--as well as a \nnumber of different models projecting future sea levels.\n  We can see that sea level has been steadily rising over the past 130 \nyears, generally consistent with human fossil fuel use. Between 1901 \nand 2010, sea level rise was estimated at 1.7 millimeters per year. \nRecently updated satellite measurements from the University of Colorado \nSea Level Research Group show a rise of 3.2 millimeters per year from \n1993 to 2013.\n  The rate of increase has already nearly doubled. According to the \nIPCC, that rate is likely to accelerate. In Rhode Island, our tide \ngauge in Newport shows an increase in average sea level of nearly 10 \ninches since 1930. Consistent with the global trends, measurements at \nour Newport tide gauge show that the rate of sea level rise has also \nincreased in the past two decades.\n  Local coastal erosion rates have doubled from 1990 to 2006, and some \nfreshwater coastal wetlands are already transitioning to salt marsh \nfrom freshwater as they are inundated by the sea.\n  Our Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council has documented \n160 feet of shoreline lost to erosion in the town of South Kingstown \nsince 1951, a rate of 3 feet per year. A steady 3 feet per year is one \nthing, add a storm and surges can wipe up whole swaths of land at once, \nas we saw with Superstorm Sandy.\n  We can see the erosion here. Back in 1994, this beach pavilion was \nset back a good way from the water. By 2012, here, the ocean was just a \nfew feet from the structure. This is the roof that is here. This is the \nframing that is here. This is the very beginning of this walkway back \nhere. There is the ocean. The ocean has moved from here essentially to \nthere. Roads and other infrastructure that were once a safe distance \nfrom the shoreline were also battered by this terrible storm surge and \nwind.\n  The small, vibrant coastal town of Matunuck, RI, is under siege from \nthe advancing ocean. This chart shows how far the shoreline has shifted \nsince 1951. Here is the 1951 shoreline. This is the 2012 photo, showing \nhow much the sea has risen and eaten against the shores. In the last \ndozen years, beaches have eroded 20 feet.\n  The community now faces difficult decisions. The only road connecting \nMatunuck to neighboring towns is protected by only about 10 feet of \nsand now. The road provides access for emergency vehicles residents may \nneed. Underneath it lies their water main. If carbon dioxide emissions \ncontinue unchecked, another 5 feet of projected sea level rise is a \nreal possibility after the year 2100.\n  Matunuck's projected coastline with 5 feet of sea level rise can be \nseen in red. These are all houses. This is Roy Carpenter's Beach. These \nhouses have been here in some cases for generations and they are \ntumbling into the sea as the ocean encroaches on them.\n  This is famous Newport Harbor. In Newport, 5 feet of sea level rise \nwould inundate large portions of our vibrant downtown area, including \nAmerica's Cup Avenue, right here; including the Long Wharf Shopping \nCenter, which would be about here; and including the famous and \nhistoric Cardines Field, a great old baseball field.\n  Goat Island will be only a few specks of land. This is what 3 feet of \nsea-level rise would look like in Newport. Perrotti Park is gone. The \nAnn Street Pier is gone, not to mention the Newport Harbor Master's \noffice. He will be a lot closer to the harbor when it is pouring \nthrough his windows than he is right now. Wherever Rhode Island meets \nthe sea, our homes, communities, and our very economy are at stake.\n  Yet in Congress we sleepwalk, lulled by the narcotic influence of the \npolluting special interests. No wonder I am frustrated.\n  When my colleagues say they are worried about job loss in the \npolluting coal and oil industries, I am willing to listen. I am even \nwilling to help, but I am not willing to stand by while this is \nhappening in my home State and have us pretend it is not even real.\n  Rhode Island, of course, is not the only region experiencing sea-\nlevel rise, coastal erosion, and economic disruption. Rising seas \nconcern coastal regions across the country. With over 1,000 miles of \ncoastline, Florida is at grave risk from sea-level rise.\n  According to the World Resources Institute and an article published \nin ``Environmental Research Letters,'' of all the people and housing in \nAmerica threatened by sea-level rise, 40 percent is in Florida. That is \nbecause in Florida the flooding won't just be along the coast; low-\nlying inland areas are also at risk. That is because Florida is built \non porous limestone.\n  In New England, on our rocky shores, we could perhaps build levees \nand dams in some places to hold the oceans back. In Miami, they would \nbe building those structures on geological sponge. The water will seep \nright under. Using the best available science, the Southeast\n\n[[Page S590]]\n\nFlorida Regional Climate Change Compact assessed the risk to four south \nFlorida counties of sea-level rise. In those counties, 1 foot of sea-\nlevel rise would endanger approximately $4 billion in property. In \nMonroe County, three of the four hospitals, two-thirds of the schools, \nand 71 percent of emergency shelters are endangered by a 1-foot sea-\nlevel rise.\n  Go to 3 feet of sea-level rise in these counties. That would endanger \napproximately $31 billion worth of property. That is a lot of \ninfrastructure at risk.\n  This map shows 3 feet of sea-level rise in Miami-Dade County. The map \non the left shows current elevation in southern Miami-Dade compared to \n3 feet of sea-level rise on the right. These blue regions go \nunderwater. They have lost acres upon acres of that city.\n  This nuclear power station, Turkey Point, and this sewage treatment \nplant are virtually cut off from dry land. Yet what do we hear from our \nRepublican colleague from Florida? Denial, right along the polluter \nparty line.\n  Louisiana is teed up for the worst storm surge by the warming, rising \nwaters of the Gulf of Mexico. According to a U.S. Geological Survey-led \nstudy, between 1985 and 2010, Louisiana lost a football field an hour \nof land and wetlands to coastal erosion.\n  A recent poll shows that Louisiana voters understand and want action \non climate change. Seventy-two percent of Louisianans believe climate \nchange is a serious problem that threatens everyone. It is hitting \ntheir lives and yet our Republican colleague from Louisiana offers \nstreams of denial.\n  The State with the most coastline is Alaska. Another U.S. Geological \nSurvey study shows that coastal erosion of a 40-mile stretch along the \nBeaufort Sea has climbed from 20 feet per year between the mid-fifties \nand late seventies to 28 feet per year between the late seventies and \ntwo thousands and now has doubled to more than 45 feet per year between \n2002 and 2007.\n  Climate change is one of several factors at play and is contributing \nto this accelerating loss.\n  Earlier this month our Bicameral Task Force on Climate Change, which \nI lead with Chairman Waxman, welcomed Alaskans from the town of \nShishmaref, an Inupiat Eskimo village located on a small barrier island \n5 miles from mainland Alaska, to hear from them how climate change is \naffecting their homes. Their houses are literally falling into the sea \nthanks to sea-level rise and coastal erosion. Their centuries-old \nculture is crumbling away with each wave. This is a house in \nShishmaref. This is a house at Roy Carpenter's Beach in Rhode Island. \nWe can see how we sympathize with the town of Shishmaref.\n  In Alaska, Shishmaref is not alone. A recent GAO report showed that \n31 Alaskan villages are at risk. The 12 red dots shown are villages \nthat are now considering relocating completely. According to the U.S. \nCorps of Engineers, relocation costs are estimated at $100 million to \n$200 million for Shishmaref, and other villages could face similar \ncosts.\n  Stanley Tocktoo is the former mayor of Shishmaref. He came to our \nhearing and said:\n\n       No matter your politics, you can't ignore the facts. The \n     facts are that our village is being impacted by climate \n     change on a daily basis. And we need you to do something \n     about it.\n\n  He said:\n\n       No matter your politics, you can't ignore facts.\n\n  The painful truth, Mayor Tocktoo, is that in Congress, if you have \ncertain politics, you are actually obliged to ignore the facts. You are \nrequired to ignore the facts. Your big-money people--the big polluters, \nthe Koch brothers--insist on it. They demand that you ignore the facts.\n  Citizens United, that God-awful Supreme Court decision, means that \nthe big polluters' big money can drown out in elections--particularly \nin Republican primary elections--every reasonable person, Republican, \nIndependent, or Democrat, who understands that we need to act. The \nparty on the other side is stuck, trapped by the campaign finance rules \nand the big money of the big polluters.\n  We could, in Congress, be awake, helping and meeting the call of \nduty. We could be working with the President to implement his climate \naction plan.\n  The Environment and Public Works Committee, under the strong \nleadership of Chairman Barbara Boxer, recently held an oversight \nhearing on the President's climate action plan. What did we get in that \nhearing from our Republican colleagues? Denial, quarreling, and \nobfuscation--the polluter party line.\n  They actually brought in, as a Republican witness, a person whose \norganization took money from the Koch brothers, Exxon, and from other \nfar-right and denier foundations, including the notorious Donors Trust \nand Donors Capital Fund, which launders money from big donors who want \nto remain anonymous.\n  If people have not heard of this Donors Trust and Donors Capital \ngroup, a recent report out of Drexel University described this group as \nthe ``black box that conceals the identity of contributors,'' the \n``central component,'' and ``dominant funder'' of the denier apparatus. \nThis was who they chose as their witness.\n  We could, in Congress, be figuring out how a carbon pollution fee--\none that returns all of its proceeds back to the American people--could \nbest boost our economy, as some prominent Republicans have suggested. \nBut I sent a letter to my Republican colleagues summarizing the \nRepublican case for a carbon fee and not one responded.\n  The polluters have the Republican Party at their heels. It is a \ntragic state of affairs for a great political party.\n  Carbon pollution from the burning of fossil fuels is altering the \natmosphere and oceans. It is changing our climate. The scientific \nconsensus around this fact is overwhelming. Denial at this point is \npropped-up polluter-paid nonsense. Where carbon pollution hits the \noceans, denial requires people not only to reject science but to reject \nmeasurement. We measure sea-level rise. We measure ocean warming. We \nmeasure ocean acidification. It is not complicated. We measure sea-\nlevel rise, more or less, with a yardstick. We measure ocean warming \nwith a thermometer; we measure ocean acidification with simple litmus \ntests that everyone with an aquarium is familiar with.\n  Yet despite that incontrovertible evidence from our oceans, we \nsleepwalk on in Congress, thanks to a great political party's captivity \nby polluters. It is a disgrace. It will go down in history as a \ndisgrace.\n  We could strengthen our economy, we could save our great coastal \ncities and our age-old island villages, and we can leave things better, \nnot worse, for the generations that will follow us, but we have to pay \nattention to reality. We have to pay attention to the real evidence. We \ncan't be swept up in the toxic polluter-paid politics that infect \nWashington.\n  This matters immensely to Alaska. It matters immensely to the \ncitizens of Shishmaref. It matters immensely to the residents of \nFlorida who are looking at their cities; and it matters immensely to \nRhode Island, the Ocean State, because the undeniable changes from sea-\nlevel rise and warming are upon us and will only worsen. For once and \nfor all, it is time for us to wake up.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Would the Senator yield through the Chair for a colloquy?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I yield to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. First I wish to say how proud I am to listen to the \nSenator's words, to have him on the committee I am so honored to chair.\n  To learn today that the Senator made over 50----\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Fifty-six.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Fifty-six presentations on the floor of the Senate, \nregardless of the hour, regardless of his other pressing needs, the \nSenator is making the record that we must act to prevent the worst and \nmost catastrophic occurrences from climate change.\n  I wish to ask of the Senator a few questions because we have gone \nthrough a lot of these battles in the committee, and I think it is time \nthat people knew what happened. I am going to see if we can put \nsomething in the Record.\n  The Senator pointed out putting a price on carbons as the way we need \nto move. The Senator also pointed out that many countries outside of \nthe United States support it. Would the Senator please tell us, because \nhe has mentioned this before, who are some of the leaders of the \nRepublican Party?\n\n[[Page S591]]\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. One of the most prominent ones is George Shultz, who \nserved with great distinction, I believe, under three Republican \nPresidents.\n  Mrs. BOXER. True.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I ran into him in the last 10 days and I said: Thank \nyou for your work on carbon. It is important. He said: It is important. \nI said: We have to do a carbon fee. He said: Revenue neutral. I said: \nYes, we have to do a revenue-neutral carbon fee.\n  Revenue-neutral carbon fee means that the money that is generated by \nthe polluters pays for the harm they do to do to all the rest of us, \nwhich they otherwise get away with for free, and it goes back to the \nAmerican people. It is revenue neutral. It doesn't go into the \ngovernment and raise the size of government. It goes right back. We \ncould do it by lowering taxes, by paying off every student loan in the \ncountry. We could do it by giving seniors on Social Security a raise. \nWhat a good discussion that would be, to be having right here. But we \ncan't have that discussion because the other party is trapped by the \npolluters--trapped in their politics, trapped by their money.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. The point I am making is the Senator points out one very \nprominent Republican, but there are many more. I remember when I \nstarted out in politics, I was a county supervisor. The environment was \nthe one issue--one or two, the other one was a woman's right to choose. \nThose two issues were so bipartisan that we all came together. When we \nran for county supervisor, we didn't have a label. We ran just as an \nindependent person. But everyone backed the constitutionally protected \nright to choose and everyone backed cleaning up the environment.\n  So the Senator has described what has happened and he has used some \nvery colorful language from time to time, but I thought one of the \nthings he recently said--and I want to make sure I quote it right--is \nthat it is like this Capitol is surrounded by the lies of the polluters \nand we can't get the truth into this Chamber.\n  The Senator actually says it better.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. They have erected a barricade of lies, Madam \nChairman. They have erected a barricade of lies, and it is supported by \nan avalanche of money. If you go outside that barricade, you see \nenormous support for getting something done about climate.\n  Just to give the example of our corporate community--Coke and Pepsi, \nthe Mars corporation, which makes M and Mars bars, Ford and GM, \nApple, Nike, Walmart, on and on--we can go through the signal American \ncorporations, the heraldry of the American corporate world, and they \nare ready to get something done. But there is enough money that gets \nthrown by the polluters and enough threats made by them in Republican \nprimaries that our colleagues are trapped. Unless we build a coalition \nthat gets them a way out, that barricade will continue to inhibit \nprogress on this issue in this building.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Right. The dilemma we face is the window to act is \nclosing in on us. The Senator showed some extraordinary photos. One is \nup there now. We see that already climate change is creating climate \nrefugees.\n  There was a movie done called ``Climate Refugees,'' and it went out \nto the island nations of the world that many people never even knew \nexisted. The folks there, because of the sea level change and the \nchange in the weather and the fact that they can't grow the crops they \nused to and they can't rely on water, et cetera, have to be leaving \ntheir homes they have lived in for generations.\n  What the Senator is saying is so sad and shocking. It looks to me as \nthough he is having that in his own State.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. My colleague's point, that this used to be a \nbipartisan issue, is actually illustrated by this photograph. This is \nRoy Carpenter's Beach. It is a beach that got probably hit the hardest. \nThere were some bigger, older houses that got washed away down the \nshore, but this has a lot of these smaller houses that families have \nheld onto for generations. After Sandy, with the sea level rise and \nthen the storm, together, they knocked them into the water this way.\n  This individual right here is Lincoln Chafee. That is Governor \nChafee. He served in this body as a Republican, and he was one of the \nstaunchest environmentalists in this body. If you go back further, his \nfather John Chafee served as the chairman of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee. He was one of my colleague's predecessors, and he \nhelped lead the passage of the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act, a \nRepublican, and he was proud of it. He didn't hide from it.\n  It wasn't something the Republican Party had to run away from in \nthose days. Try to find that in the modern Republican Party. It is \nembarrassing what has happened to a great political party.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Senator Whitehouse raises the name of John Chafee and \nLincoln Chafee. I was friendly with both of those Chafees, John being \nmy chairman, a role model for me. I literally learned from him. Not \nonly was he a leader on the environment, he was a leader on so many \nother issues: sensible gun laws--sensible gun laws.\n  Something has happened to the Grand Old Party. Somebody once said \nmaybe they are the formerly Grand Old Party. But I have hope they will \nreturn and be the Grand Old Party, because I was here when we had \nleadership on the other side for a climate bill. We fell just a few \nvotes short. If we hadn't had a filibuster, we would have nailed it.\n  Putting a price on carbon is the only way to go, and my colleague \nmakes the case because there is a cost. What is the cost? We see it. \nThis is the cost. Yet those who are putting this dangerous pollution in \nthe air don't pay anything for it. As a matter of fact, they get \nsubsidies still.\n  The Senator and I sometimes talk offline here, and we say we are very \ncalm when we speak here because we know we have to have a sense of \ndecorum, but inside a lot of us are churning, because we love our \nchildren and we love our grandchildren and we love this Nation and we \nwant to be leaders and we want our Nation to lead. Yet we are having a \nterrible time. We have a situation where 97 percent of scientists say \nclimate change is happening and we know exactly why. It is human \nbehavior.\n  Our friend Angus King gave a remarkable presentation to the caucus \nthe other day, making the point that Senator Whitehouse made, which is \nthat this isn't conjecture, this is science. This is measurement. You \nmeasure it. You see it. You know what is happening. This isn't like \nwhen you are hit with a tragedy and you don't want to look at it; you \nlose somebody and you are in denial about it. We understand that, how \nthe human mind would do that. But this is science, and it is very \ndifficult.\n\n  I wanted to ask a couple more questions. I am truly enjoying this \ncolloquy. It reminds me of the old days when this used to happen more \nin the Senate.\n  My friend mentioned the President's Climate Action Plan, and he \ntalked a little bit about it yesterday. He said some very good \nimportant things about it. But I want to know if my friend is aware \nthere has already been filed by the minority leader here, the \nRepublican leader, a CRA--that is the Congressional Review Act--to \noverturn a rule that would in fact put in place some very important \npollution controls on new powerplants.\n  Does my friend, A, know he has filed this? Does my friend also know \nthe rule isn't even finalized, yet the Republican leader has filed \nthis? What does the Senator make of that?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. If the underlying problem weren't so serious, it \nwould be laughable that they are already challenging a rule that has \nnot even been promulgated yet. They are sort of prechallenging it. It \njust shows what a pell-mell tumble our Republican colleagues will \nsubject themselves to in order to keep in the good graces of the \npolluting industries. Again, it is embarrassing. It ought to be \nembarrassing.\n  But I think there is hope. One of the signs of hope is the polling \ninformation among young Republican voters. Young Republican voters \nunder the age of 35--not very young but young Republican voters under \nthe age of 35--when asked about climate denial and asked what their \nview is of people who espouse climate denial say they think they are \nignorant, out of touch or crazy. That is the young cohort of the \nRepublican Party. That is what it believes.\n\n[[Page S592]]\n\n  So time, obviously, is on the side of reason and science and the \nplain evidence people see in front of their noses across this country, \nwhether they are farmers, fishermen, hikers or skiers. Anybody who has \ncontact with the outdoors understands this is absolutely real. It is \nonly people in this little hot house of polluter-paid intrigue that the \ndenial strategy still stands up, and it is our job to knock it back \ndown.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Absolutely. I think the other point the Senator made is \ntying this all to Citizens United and the fact that these polluters are \nonly focused on this: They do not want competition. Let us be clear. \nThese multinationals do not want competition. The fact is they see \nsolar on the horizon, wind, geothermal, clean energy. They even see \nnatural gas, which has, if it is done right, half of the carbon \npollution, and they are holding on through this ride of the century. \nThey will not work with us. It is more than sad.\n  But I will say this in closing my remarks tonight. We have a new \nenergy, if you will, in this body. We have more than 20 percent of this \nSenate that has formed together in our action task force that Senator \nWhitehouse and I are heading. We are going to take action. We are going \nto be heard. We are going to wake the Congress, which is what has to \nhappen.\n  I want to say to my friend how much it means to me--someone who felt \npretty much isolated on these issues for a while--and how important it \nis that even though my colleague said--and I quote him--you were sick \nof coming down and speaking, I hope you will not get sick of it. I hope \nyou will not get tired of it. I will predict, and the Senator knows I \nam right, a lot of us are going to be joining him pretty soon. So not \nonly will my colleague's voice be heard but many other voices will be \nheard and that will echo around this Nation.\n  There are so many issues we have to deal with. Lord knows, we so \nagree with the President on strengthening the middle class. We so agree \nthat we need to confront the challenges of deficits and jobs and \neducation and health care. By the way, from my State, that is going \ngang busters--the Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare. We are signing up \nthousands of people a day. It is moving the country forward. But with \nall these issues we have to deal with, we have to save the planet. We \nhave to save the planet.\n  I do have another question for my friend. Some of our colleagues say: \nOh, you see this freezing cold and all the snow, this proves there is \nno climate change. There is no global warming. It is freezing. Of \ncourse, the scientists I talk to are telling me they predicted extreme \nweather. That is what they predicted.\n  Look at what happened in poor Atlanta today, where there is this \nschoolbus that has been sitting out on the road, somebody said, from 4 \nyesterday until 8 this morning. These people are stuck because of an \nunexpected icy snowfall. Here is the thing. It is called a vortex. The \nreason it happens, as explained to me by the scientists--and one of \nthem just came onto the floor now--is that the jet stream has changed \nso much because of the warming in the Arctic so that instead of holding \nup that cold air in the Arctic, the cold air is turning around and \ncoming back down, and we haven't seen that in a while.\n  So you can't just say it is cold today, there is no climate change. \nIf there is extreme weather--and we have it in California. We have a \ndrought we have never, ever, ever seen. I went through the one in the \n1970s. I remember that, where we used the water in the tub to flush the \ntoilets and we tried to recycle the water from our dishwashers and \nwashing machines. But we have a worse situation, and it was predicted.\n  So I wish to ask my friend, because he has done so much reading, is \nit not true this extreme weather was predicted in the U.N. reports and \nin many other reports?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Absolutely. Indeed, years ago one expert in this area \nwrote that, in terms of the experience that people would have--yes, the \nplanet is warming--but the experience that people would have wouldn't \nbe just of warming. It would be of weirding weather--weird weather--and \ntruly the better name would be not global warming, but it would be \nglobal weirding. That is because, very simply, when you add energy--\nheat energy in this case--to a closed system by trapping it with more \ncarbon dioxide in the atmosphere, you speed things up. You make storms \nstronger, you change weather patterns, and you see things that you have \nnot seen before.\n  So the things people are seeing now--not specifically and not that \nstorm, but the patterns that people would see more extreme weather of \nvarious kinds--were indeed predicted. The fact that it is happening is \nexactly consistent with what the scientists have been warning us about.\n  Mrs. BOXER. It is so because it was 7 years ago when I took the \npanel. I think it was 7 years ago that I took the gavel--I don't even \nremember; time goes so fast when you are having fun--I took that gavel \nand the first thing we did is we had a hearing on climate.\n  By the way, I urge my colleague, you should see--we put together a \nGreen Book of all of my colleagues' statements--how many Republicans \nwere with us then. Olympia Snowe had a great piece in there. John \nMcCain had a great piece in there. Judd Gregg had a great piece.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. John Warner.\n  Mrs. BOXER. John Warner had a great piece in there, and others. It \nmade me so proud.\n  At that hearing we had all these experts talk about the fact that, \nover time, temperatures would go up. But in between, as you say, it is \nnot a matter of the weather that day, but it is the pattern over time \nand what happens over time. You have these extremes but over time the \nwarmth kicks in. We are seeing it happening. The American people are \nsmart. They get it.\n  We are just not going to let up. As calm as we sound now, that belies \nwhat we feel inside and the obligation that we have to act. I guess \nthis is as good a time as any to tell the American people they will see \nmore of us, and more colleagues will work on this.\n  I thank Senator Reid because Senator Reid has elevated this issue in \nour caucus, devoting more time to this issue. He cares about this. He \nis a wonderful family man with a lot of grandchildren. He wants to give \nthem what so many of us have had--the beauty of this country, the \nlivability of this country. There will be more of this to follow.\n  I ask my colleague if he wants to close, and I yield to him.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I thank the chair for her staunch leadership. She is \nsuch an ally and leader for us. It really is very exciting, and, yes, \nyou will see considerably more activity.\n  I will close by telling one personal story because very often you are \ndealing with statistics, and you are dealing with figures, and you are \ndealing with things that are happening on a large scale when you talk \nabout climate change.\n  I remember this day. I remember this day, walking along and meeting \nwith these homeowners whose houses these were. I remember talking to \nthe lady whose house--I think this one was right here--the Governor is \nlooking into.\n  She remembers, as a child, being in that house. In front of this \nhouse she had a lawn, a lawn where they could throw Frisbees and play \nWiffle ball.\n  On the other side of the lawn was a road that gave access along the \nshoreline, a sand road. On the other side of the road was a parking lot \nwhere people would come and bring their cars, and on the other side of \nthe parking lot was the beach that was so long down to the water, and \nshe could remember running as a kid. You know, when the summer Sun \nbeats down on the beach and the sand gets so hot that it hurts your \nfeet, and you have to dash to get your feet into the water because they \nare hot, hot, hot as you run when you are a little kid? And she would \nmake that long run and think what a long run it was to get down that \nhot sand and into the cool, clear waters of Narragansett Bay.\n  That beach is gone. That parking lot is gone. That road is gone. Her \nlawn is gone, and this is what has happened to her house.\n  If people want to know why we are not going to give up--yes, I am \nsick of it. I am sick of having to come here and do this. It is \ntiresome to have no progress and have people not listen and have it be \nbecause of, frankly, scandalous polluter-paid interference and \ninfluence in this building. Yes, I am\n\n[[Page S593]]\n\nsick of it. But I am not going to stop, not while this is happening to \nmy home State of Rhode Island.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Agreement--S. 1926\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nleader remarks on Thursday, January 30, the Senate resume consideration \nof S. 1926, with the time until 11:15 a.m. equally divided between the \ntwo leaders or their designees, with the final 10 minutes equally \ndivided between Senator Menendez or his designee, and Senator Toomey or \nhis designee, with Senator Toomey controlling the final 5 minutes; that \nat 11:15 a.m., the Senate proceed to votes in relation to the following \namendments: Toomey amendment No. 2707, as modified; Coburn amendment \nNo. 2697; Merkley amendment No. 2709, as modified; and Heller amendment \nNo. 2700; further, that upon disposition of the Heller amendment, the \nSenate recess until 2 p.m.; at 2 p.m. when the Senate reconvenes, the \nSenate proceed to vote on passage of the bill, as amended; finally, \nthere be 2 minutes of debate prior to each vote, equally divided in the \nusual form; and that all after the first vote be 10-minute votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today I come to the floor to recognize \nan important anniversary. Five years ago today, President Obama signed \nthe Lilly Ledbetter Act into law. This important law has kept \ncourthouse doors open to allow women to address pay inequality by \ncorrecting a misinterpretation by the Court on the statute of \nlimitations when women seek redress. But the fight for equal pay \ncontinues, and we need to take action to fix the pay gap, which is what \nI want to discuss today.\n  On June 10, 1963, President Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act into \nlaw. This landmark legislation prohibited discrimination on the basis \nof sex in the payment of wages by employers. The goals of the \nlegislation were groundbreaking. It was the first time Congress acted \non this issue, addressing what was a real and growing problem as more \nwomen entered the workforce. But it has been over 50 years since the \nEqual Pay Act became law, and since then, a lot of things have changed.\n  A recent Pew Research study found that women are the primary earner \nin 40 percent of households today. Additionally, many of these women \nare the sole earners. But what is often missed in the discussion about \nequal pay is the impact the pay gap continues to have on these \nhouseholds who are dependent on the salaries of women.\n  The pay gap results in $4,000 less per year for working families, and \n$434,000 less over a lifetime. Imagine what these families could \naccomplish if they simply got what they were owed. With the rising \ncosts for child care, medical care, and filling up the family car, \nthese families are held down by unfair and unjust pay policies.\n  While these are the day-to-day impacts of the pay gap, there are also \neven greater consequences over a lifetime. The pay gap affects your \nincome, your pension, and your Social Security. Women's Social Security \nbenefits are only 71 percent of men's benefits. The average income for \nwomen from private pensions is only 48 percent of men's. The \nconsequences of our inaction on pay equity are following women out of \nthe workplace and further impacting their lives down the line.\n  For years I have fought for a solution to this--the Paycheck Fairness \nAct. The Paycheck Fairness Act builds on the Equal Pay Act to help \nclose the pay gap. Under the Paycheck Fairness Act, employers will no \nlonger be able to retaliate against workers for sharing information \nabout wages. Right now, if you ask someone what they get paid you can \nget fired. For years, Lilly Ledbetter was humiliated and harassed \nbecause she tried to find out what she was making compared to her \ncolleagues. Women will also no longer be able to only seek back pay \nwhen they are discriminated against. Under this legislation they are \nalso able to seek punitive damages.\n  Under the Paycheck Fairness Act, employers will no longer be able to \nuse almost any reason imaginable to justify paying a woman less than a \nman. And under this legislation, women will no longer be on their own \nin fighting for equal pay for equal work. This bill includes education \nand training so women can strengthen their negotiation skills and learn \nabout wage discrimination.\n  In this country, they say: Work hard, play by the rules, and you will \nget ahead. We work hard every day but we find the rules are different \nfor women and men. In 1963, women made 59 cents for every $1 made by \nmen. And more than 50 years later, we have made an 18-cent gain. In \n2012, women made 77 cents for every $1 earned by men. Fifty-two years \nand 18 cents--that is not rewarding hard work, and it is certainly not \nplaying by the rules.\n  Today, on the 5th anniversary of the Lilly Ledbetter Act, I call on \nmy colleagues to join me in stepping up to the plate and fixing the pay \ngap by supporting the Paycheck Fairness Act. Let's end pay inequity and \nend the policies that keep women uneducated and unequipped to fight for \ntheir fair share.\n  It is not just for our pocketbooks--it is about the family checkbooks \nand getting it right in the law books. It is also about the generations \nof women to come. Let's finish what we started, and let's make sure it \ndoesn't take another 50 years to end pay inequity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/29/senate-section/article/S593-4", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S593-S594]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                UKRAINE\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, in 1991 the free world cheered as Ukraine \nand other former Soviet republics gained their independence. \nUnfortunately, Ukrainian democracy is now under siege, as peaceful \nantigovernment protests have been met with brutal violence.\n  Over the past few years, reports of popular protests against \noppressive regimes have become commonplace. Yet the frequency of such \nevents does not obviate our moral responsibility to stand shoulder to \nshoulder with freedom-loving people around the world who seek to throw \noff unjust and despotic regimes in pursuit of liberty, democracy, and \nthe rule of law.\n  The United States has been a strong supporter of the Ukrainian \npeople's efforts to create a strong nation, built on\n\n[[Page S594]]\n\ndemocratic and free market principles. Ukraine made a significant step \ntoward achieving these goals when it adopted its first democratic \nconstitution in 1996. But under the Yanukovych Administration, the \nbasic liberties of the Ukrainian people have been trampled. Recent \nelections have fallen short of international standards, and the \ngovernment has used the courts to neutralize opposition leaders, \nsending former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko to prison for 7 years on \ntrumped-up, politically motivated charges. Meanwhile, President \nYanukovych continues to pursue closer ties with Russia, in spite of the \nUkrainian people's clear preference for closer ties with Europe.\n  In addition to the moral imperative we have to support basic human \nrights, the United States must also recognize that Ukraine--with a \npopulation of 45 million and a territory comparable in size to that of \nFrance--occupies a unique, sensitive, and strategically important \nposition between Russia and our NATO allies Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, \nand Romania. The future of Ukraine will be determined by what happens \nin the days ahead, and it will have a direct bearing on U.S. interests \nfor years to come.\n  On occasion, protesters have clashed with police, with reports of \nmany injuries and several deaths. Although recent reports from Kiev \nindicated that protesters had seized the Ukrainian Justice Ministry, \nthey voluntarily gave up the building to avoid creating difficulties in \nnegotiations between the Ukrainian Government and the opposition. \nOpposition leaders have said they will continue pressing for democratic \nconcessions, including free and fair elections and the abolition of \nsweeping new antiprotest laws. Their efforts to avoid violent \nconfrontation should be encouraged, and their valid demands supported.\n  It is imperative that the United States send an unequivocal message \nto the Ukrainian people that we support their efforts to restore \ndemocracy and the rule of law. At the same time, we must make clear to \nPresident Yanukovych that the only hope for a strong, peaceful, and \nindependent Ukraine lies in building ties with Europe, the United \nStates, and other freedom-loving countries around the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/29/senate-section/article/S594-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S594-S596]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         VERMONT ESSAY WINNERS\n\n Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask to have printed in the \nRecord finalist essays written by Vermont High School students as part \nof the Fourth Annual State of the Union Essay contest conducted by my \noffice. These 7 finalists were selected from over 380 entries.\n  The essays follow:\n\n\n    Raihan Kabir, South Burlington High School, Grade 12 (Finalist)\n\n       How a country collects and allocates its resources takes \n     precedence in outlining the foundation of equality and \n     general welfare. We as individuals rely on a revenue of both \n     incomes and loans, which makes for a crude economic model of \n     spending. This holds true for our government. As the nation \n     dives deeper into debt and countries around the world \n     experience protests and riots over austerity measures, it is \n     clear that additional tax dollars are necessary to reduce \n     debt, support society, and give rise to the economy.\n       Tax increases will put the definition of taxation back into \n     its actuality. The United States tax rates are theoretically \n     graduated by income level, meaning that lower income ranges \n     pay a lower rate than higher income ranges. However, those in \n     a higher tax bracket often have more deductions to further \n     equalize their effective rate with that of the middle or \n     lower brackets. A decline in tax rates for the most wealthy \n     is a disproportionate advantage for the already financially \n     capable members of our society, which further instigates the \n     income disparities that threaten our democratic ideals. The \n     top percent of Americans possesses more wealth than the \n     entire bottom 90 percent; the 400 wealthiest Americans have a \n     greater combined net worth than the entire bottom 150 \n     million; and yet, everyone is paying a similar effective \n     rate. Not everyone is currently contributing their fair share \n     to society, and living in a nation with the largest amount of \n     debt in the world, this matter of fact is unacceptable. Tax \n     increases will make the theory of taxes a reality and restore \n     economic equality.\n       Though our current fiscal path is unstable, increasing \n     taxes will reduce national debt and put us on the right track \n     back to recovery. With a 16 trillion dollar debt that is \n     rising at the rate of 6 billion dollars a day (4 million \n     dollars every minute), every family in America would owe \n     about $50,000 to various countries around the world if the \n     burden trickled down to the general public. When the \n     government needs money, it sells treasury bills (similar to \n     savings bonds) to investors, who cash them in after an \n     average of ten years for the original amount plus interest. \n     Though a certain amount of debt is arguably helpful for the \n     economy, consistently high deficits force the government to \n     offer higher, more appealing interest rates; investors \n     eventually realize that the country is unlikely to pay back \n     the money it borrows and they stop lending, which crushes the \n     economy, as most recently witnessed in Greece. Our current \n     national debt is greater than the economies of the United \n     Kingdom, Australia, and China, combined. Stopping this \n     vicious economic cycle requires less foreign-reliance and \n     more self-sustenance, which is feasible if and only if we \n     increase taxes.\n       Tax increases will ensure the funding and availability of \n     certain social programs and necessary expenditures on \n     infrastructure without the need to excessively issue bonds. \n     Taxes currently fund public services of insurance, such as \n     Social Security and Medicare, of welfare, such as the Pell \n     Grant and Food Stamp programs, and of infrastructure, such as \n     the scholastic and interstate highway systems. Nobel laureate \n     of economics Paul Krugman affirms a current necessity for \n     increased taxes in his following statement:\n       [Regarding] proposals to raise the age of Medicare \n     eligibility to 67 . . . outlays would fall only by $125 \n     billion over the next decade . . . and even when fully phased \n     in, this partial dismantling of Medicare would reduce the \n     deficit only about a third as much as could be achieved with \n     higher taxes on the very rich . . . don't believe anyone who \n     claims otherwise.\n       Taxes pay for important programs that go unpaid by spending \n     cuts. The Bureau of Economic Statistics reports that the \n     average standard of living, determined by comparing adjusted \n     incomes and poverty rates, has increased in years with a \n     higher annual budget and decreased in years on the contrary. \n     According to the New York Times and the Board of Economic \n     Advisors, there is a direct correlation between the amount of \n     money provided to the government in the national budget and \n     the quality of life in the United States, as determined by \n     the rate of poverty. This makes logical sense; our standard \n     of life escalates as we make fiscal contributions to society. \n     Yet we continue to have the lowest tax rate in the world. \n     Taxes are imposed so that roads get fixed, so we get an \n     education, and so people don't invade our country. Taxes are \n     imposed to protect our rights. The government imposes taxes \n     on us for our own benefit, and by raising them, we will \n     improve the living conditions and quality of life in America.\n       Tax increases will lead to economic growth and prosperity. \n     In 1990 and again in 1993, President Clinton enacted deficit-\n     reduction legislation that raised taxes for high income \n     taxpayers; as a result, economic growth and job creation were \n     strong. Within this period of a sensational economy, capital \n     gain rates were cut, and there was a 20% increase in job \n     availability for a total of 21 million new jobs. However, \n     after the Bush Tax Cuts of 2001 and the Bush Recession, job \n     growth lagged behind GDP growth, there was 0% net job growth, \n     and with continuous population growth, there were record high \n     unemployment rates. Tax increases have helped society and the \n     economy in the past, and they will help again.\n       In any case of regulatory action, the value to be upheld is \n     the quality of life. By reducing debt, supporting society, \n     and giving rise to the economy, the nation will better ensure \n     a standard of well-being for its citizens. The government of \n     these United States is to assure life, liberty, health, and \n     happiness, in our pursuit of the American dream. Lincoln said \n     it best in his Gettysburg Address: ``that government of the \n     people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from \n     the earth.'' The prioritization of tax increases over \n     spending cuts is essential to future policy in the United \n     States of America to sustain the American public.\n\n\n Fiona Higgins, Champlain Valley Union High School, Grade 12 (Finalist)\n\n       There are many issues facing the United States. Personally, \n     I believe one of the most critical domestic issues is \n     reproductive rights.\n       Every step back to pre-Roe v. Wade is sensationalized in \n     the media, and rightfully so. The issue is much more far \n     reaching than pro-life versus pro-choice; it is both a human \n     rights issue and an economic issue.\n       Firstly, it is a human rights issue. It is a matter of \n     women having control over their own decisions, their bodies, \n     and their lives. Western women strive to liberate women who \n     they view as oppressed, but these same western women don't \n     realize that their freedoms are also disappearing. Women and \n     men alike have the right to decide what happens to their \n     bodies. Restricting access to contraception and health \n     services violates this human right for both genders.\n       Secondly, it is an economic issue. Children cost money. \n     When parents cannot support their family, they are prone to \n     apply for welfare and other government programs that were put \n     in place to help low-income families. These programs are \n     needed, but the federal government could decrease the need \n     and the cost of these programs if it focused on education and \n     access to contraception. In low-income neighborhoods, people \n     are often not able to access contraception. This takes\n\n[[Page S595]]\n\n     away lower-income women's autonomy as well as perpetuating \n     the cycle of poverty. If there were more accessible systems \n     in place, these systems (rather than chance) would help \n     families plan for the future, and allow them to decide to \n     have children (rather than chance). In addition, a decreased \n     level of government spending would curb the growth of the \n     debt, which would aid the struggling economy.\n       A woman rarely thinks to herself, ``I'd like to have an \n     abortion instead of using contraceptives this time.'' That is \n     lunatic. Abortions happen out of necessity. If they were \n     illegal or severely restricted, women would still get them, \n     but the procedures would be unsafe and deadly. If members of \n     Congress truly want to protect the unborn and create a \n     diminished welfare-dependent state, they must focus on \n     education and accessibility; this strategy will also lower \n     government spending in the long run.\n       Instead of going backwards, the United States should be \n     moving forwards. Members of Congress must recognize that \n     women have an inalienable right to privacy with regard to \n     their bodies, a right that we should not have to fight for. \n     Education and access to contraceptives needs to be more \n     widespread, thereby improving our dire economic situation and \n     our quality of life.\n\n\n           Owen Deffner, Thetford Academy, Grade 7 (Finalist)\n\n       2013, America has had quite a year, with many ups and \n     downs. Everything from the government shut down, to what I'd \n     call: an official economic recovery. We have witnessed a \n     terrible civil war in Syria where tremendous bloodshed has \n     occured. America has hosted many natural disasters too, \n     everything from intensely cold temperatures to violent \n     tornadoes. In these tragic times America has stepped up its \n     game and delivered, helping our neighbors when they are \n     struggling. This is the America that our allies look up to; \n     the friendly, hospitable, welcoming America that we all \n     contribute to every single day. Let's keep that good, \n     positive America in our hearts this year.\n       11 million people are in America illegally. These people \n     have come to this great nation in search of a better life. \n     These people are trying to achieve the American dream. \n     Immigrants are trying to send money home to their family in \n     another country, some are trying to provide for their family \n     here in the US. All the while they are constantly worried \n     that our government will deport them back to their home \n     country. This is not right, it's not okay that we don't \n     welcome them into our nation. I want the path to citizenship \n     easier for them so that they can get what they wanted to get \n     by coming here. Let's be a bit more hospitable to people who \n     are just trying to help their family.\n       Our status on the issue of the environment is not looking \n     up. America has the great opportunity to help lead the fight \n     against climate change. America must set high standards \n     concerning the environment so that other countries will \n     follow to help reduce the risk of the world's surface covered \n     in water. Inside America to confront this issue head on we \n     need to educate Americans on what is okay and not okay to \n     recycle and how to compost or break down food into soil for \n     our farms and gardens. This is a plan that will work and that \n     we must initiate this year.\n       Our country is very behind on a major issue. America's \n     education system is well behind many other well developed \n     global powers. We need to fix that issue from the bottom up \n     starting in our pre and elementary schools, with more \n     emphasis on math and science. At higher levels, more \n     affordable college and university opportunities for the lower \n     and middle-class. We need to invest more time and education \n     in our education and we need to now!\n       All of these ideas I am proposing are simple and should be \n     easy to carry out with a bit of willingness from both \n     parties. I am not asking to overhaul anything just some easy \n     doable requests that all of us can help to accomplish. \n     America should look to the future, to the next generation \n     growing into adulthood. Let's get back on track for these \n     young men and women who have high hopes for themselves and \n     their country.\n\n\n     Emily Martin, Vergennes Union High School, Grade 10 (Finalist)\n\n       The United States of America is an amazing country to call \n     home. However, in the modern day we as a nation face problems \n     that challenge our ingenuity and integrity. The world today \n     is one of war, whether that is physical, or political. We \n     struggle to find resources to continue on living the way we \n     have for as long as we can remember, yet forget that the \n     earth which we walk on is a fragile one. The United States is \n     no exception. We often find ourselves between a rock and a \n     hard place; dealing with complex issues such as health care \n     for all, or additional billions of dollars in debt; the \n     Continuation of fighting a war which is not ours, or \n     withdrawing our troops and allowing innocent people to face \n     an uncertain future. Spend billions in foreign oil to keep \n     companies in business, or convert to clean energy and watch \n     the economy crumble. The list of hard choices goes on and on. \n     The reality is, we no longer live in a time when decisions \n     are cut and dry and each decision resonates into our future \n     with force.\n       As a nation, we face an increasingly unpredictable future, \n     and without reassurance of our outcome, fear can cause \n     bitterness and ignorance. Education, the economy, politics, \n     and the fate of an ever-changing climate put an enormous \n     amount of stress on us a people. There is no certain cure for \n     the issues we deal with a nation, but the first step towards \n     solution and unification. As a country, it's time that we put \n     aside our grudges, opinions, and preferences and work as a \n     whole to support America's path towards growth, safety, \n     security and stability. The United States of America has been \n     a country that others look to as a role model and to some as \n     a beacon of freedom and safety. We have more than ourselves \n     to work for; there are millions of people around the world \n     who rely on our help and support. We need to shed the selfish \n     shells, and work as a people, not as a political party or \n     organization. Whether you are a Republican, Democrat, and \n     Libertarian it doesn't matter, because America is your home, \n     and at the end of the day we all have to learn to coexist and \n     benefit from each other's support. This is how we will help \n     to secure America's future, America's education, industry and \n     healthcare. Unification is the first step towards solution.\n       If we need reminding of the impact of dissention and \n     fracturing of our political system, the Civil War looms in \n     the hearts and from the pages of our history, when compromise \n     not only failed, but conversation stopped. The State of the \n     Nation in America is painful obvious even to the young people \n     and the children. If we don't remember how to talk to each \n     other, work together and accomplish the majority rule \n     established as a framework in the US Constitution, we stand \n     to lose more than a budget. We stand to lose our democracy.\n\n\n     Nick Majeski, Woodstock Union High School, Grade 11 (Finalist)\n\n              Bribes from Fast Food: A State of Corruption\n\n       In the year 2014, the union is majorly corrupt; the country \n     is run by a capitalist nightmare of over-powerful healthcare, \n     tobacco, and food industries. From their very beginnings at \n     the turn of twentieth century, the fast food industry has \n     steadily become more and more powerful and influential. \n     Spawning from this growth in influence, the union has \n     steadily declined into a state of corruption at the hands of \n     the fast industry, with these major food chains bribing \n     government workers in high positions.\n       Government agencies controlling food, such as the FDA, \n     USDA, and EPA may have been created with good intentions, but \n     when a higher up does not believe they are being paid enough \n     money for their job, they are known to be tempted to accept \n     bribes and submit to being the puppets of fast food \n     corporations, looking to exploit their power to lower the \n     standards of their products. An article on Naturalnews.com \n     explained how, in a survey given to workers at the FDA and \n     USDA, one fourth of the survey takers admitted to have \n     changed policies for corporate gain. On one hand this is not \n     morally right both in the way that our government officials--\n     who were elected by the people--are accepting bribes, and \n     also that they are changing policies allowing even less \n     healthy food that causes diseases--more money to health care; \n     another corrupt industry in the United States.\n       Corrupt FDA, USDA, and EPA fat-cats obviously do not want \n     to break their ties with fast food puppeteers; this brings \n     more corruption directly into the government organizations \n     themselves. In the Naturalnews.com article the writer \n     explains that many innocent workers at organizations like the \n     FDA and USDA are demoted or even fired for trying to do their \n     job and not keeping their mouths shut about corruption they \n     have witnessed. The higher-ups in charge of these huge \n     organizations influence immoral decisions that bring dirty \n     money to their own pockets; they change state standards to \n     very low standards and do not require food companies to tell \n     customers when the food was made, processed or cooked.\n       Despite all this--mostly widely known information--this \n     corruption is still going on and growing. According to \n     Fastfoodnationhonorsproject.weebly.com ties between congress \n     and fast food are too strong to vote against certain \n     policies. This means that the way to lower corruption in the \n     food industry would have to be to take direct action.\n       Despite knowledge of corruption being well known in \n     America- Supersize Me is a mainstream movie- there is not \n     very much motivation to stop bribes from the food industry. \n     This is a problem that should not only be addressed, but \n     worked towards solving as well.\n\n\n         Holly Thayer, Milton High School, Grade 12 (Finalist)\n\n       My fellow Americans, I stand here before you to evaluate \n     the state of our great nation. Over the past year our economy \n     has risen as the Gross National Product increased 4.1% in the \n     third quarter, and the National Deficit went down $1.8 \n     Billion. As of November, the national unemployment rate has \n     dropped to 7% and personal income has risen, proving that our \n     nation is moving out of the recession, and America is once \n     again becoming a nation of economic growth and wealth.\n       2013 saw an increase in revolutions around the world, from \n     Syria to Egypt, many countries around the world are \n     experiencing the same revolution the United States and our \n     ancestors endured in order to gain our individual freedoms. \n     Through the government and all of our national forces, we \n     must work together to give aid in the form of resources and \n     money, to assist the new governments that are the result of \n     these revolutions, and ensure that there is smooth turn over \n     of\n\n[[Page S596]]\n\n     power. The United States must also create a coalition of our \n     allies, along with the United Nations, to create an agreement \n     that delegates the responsibilities and costs of helping \n     these nations form new governments, and ensures that the re-\n     created states are not intruding on an individual's human \n     rights.\n       The production of Genetically Modified Organisms, GMOs, \n     that are then placed in processed foods or on crops and used \n     as an insecticide, have created a serious health risk for \n     myself, and all my fellow Americans. It has been proven that \n     GMOs can lead to serious health issues and impose high health \n     risks. We must work together with the agricultural farmers \n     and corporations that use GMO's to research the other options \n     that these businesses have in order to ensure plant safety, \n     without endangering the public health at the same time. Then \n     we must create a grant program that would give states and \n     localities money to allocate to farmers and organizations \n     that agree to not use GMOs. For companies that still use \n     GMOs, we must toughen the regulations on the use of them, \n     through only allowing a regulated amount to be present in \n     foods, and make it mandatory that this presence is labeled on \n     every package of a product.\n       Educated masses lead to innovations and improvements in \n     every aspect of life. Currently, around 30% of Americans have \n     obtained a college degree. In order to have an educated \n     citizenry, we need to make federal aid for students planning \n     on going to college more available. To do this, we need to \n     restructure the system that is used to disperse federal \n     financial aid. If we create a formula, based on family \n     income, and reduce the importance and use of merit based \n     scholarships, while increasing the use of incentive programs, \n     then allocate the money based on this system, we could \n     effectively make financial aid more available and abundant, \n     and therefore increase the percentage of Americans who have a \n     college degree, creating an educated citizenry.\n       Thank you, God Bless America.\n\n\n    Delaney Spink, South Burlington High School, Grade 12 (Finalist)\n\n       I can't claim to know a lot about politics. In fact, I make \n     a point to stay as uninvolved in it as possible. In a \n     nutshell, all I know is that Obama is our president, and that \n     I should never bring up politics with my grandfather, unless \n     I'm willing to spend the next three or four hours listening \n     to him denounce every decision our government has made since \n     the 1920's. When our class was told we had to write this \n     essay, my first thought was, ``I have no idea what the state \n     of our union is. How am I supposed to write about how to fix \n     it?''\n       I'd bet that every single other student in my classroom was \n     having the same thought, save the one or two kids that are \n     really into politics, and, as we all know, are going to win \n     this competition. This got me thinking, and I've come to a \n     conclusion. The problem with our country is that not enough \n     young people know what the problem is. Ironic, isn't it?\n       When I think of our government, I think of old white men. \n     Now, I know this is a very stereotypical generalization that \n     I'm making. Women are getting involved, and, hey, our \n     president is black. We seem to be doing better, based on the \n     limited information that I have. But, whether they're diverse \n     or not, the people making decisions for our country are old. \n     This isn't entirely a bad thing; older people have more \n     experience, confidence, and knowledge. All I'm saying is that \n     that wisdom needs to be balanced with the fresh perspectives \n     of our country's younger generations. Younger people need to \n     start getting more excited about politics, myself included. \n     We need to start looking at it as an exciting opportunity to \n     change what we think should be changed, instead of as a \n     boring subject that our uncles argue about over Thanksgiving \n     dinner.\n       Now, I know there are probably many kids out there that are \n     interested in politics. That's great, but I also know that \n     the vast majority of kids, like myself, are simply \n     uninterested. The solution lies with us, and we need to \n     motivate ourselves. It can't come from the adults. If this \n     essay somehow makes it to anyone important, please don't take \n     this as a sign that you need to launch a national ``Politics \n     are Cool, Yo!'' campaign. It won't work. It needs to be \n     started by the kids. We need to start clubs, be in our school \n     governments, or even just watch the news.\n       I don't have a perfect solution, seeing as I am, for now, \n     one of the aforementioned uninterested students. But, I know \n     this: If politics can become more accessible to young people \n     in any way, shape, or form, we will take notice, and, \n     eventually, get involved. It's our country too. We want to be \n     just as involved as Grandpa Bill and Senator Sanders. One of \n     us just needs to lead the way.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/29/senate-section/article/S596-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S596-S597]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TEXT OF A PROPOSED THIRD AMENDMENT TO THE AGREEMENT FOR CO-OPERATION \n   BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND THE INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC \n                          ENERGY AGENCY--PM 28\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I am pleased to transmit to the Congress, pursuant to sections 123 b. \nand 123 d. of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. \n2153(b), (d)) (the ``Act''), the text of a proposed Third Amendment to \nthe Agreement for Co-operation Between the United States of America and \nthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) (the ``Amendment''). I am \nalso pleased to transmit my written approval, authorization, and \ndetermination concerning the Amendment, and an unclassified Nuclear \nProliferation Assessment Statement (NPAS) concerning the Amendment. (In \naccordance with section 123 of the Act, as amended by title XII of the \nForeign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-\n277), a classified annex to the NPAS, prepared by the Secretary of \nState in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, \nsummarizing relevant classified information, will be submitted to the \nCongress separately.) The joint memorandum submitted to me by the \nSecretaries of State and Energy and a letter from the Chairman of the \nNuclear Regulatory Commission stating the views of the Commission are \nalso enclosed. An addendum to the NPAS pursuant to section 102A of the \nNational Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 403-1), as amended, is being \nsubmitted separately by the Director of National Intelligence.\n  The proposed Amendment has been negotiated in accordance with the Act \nand other applicable law. In my judgment, it meets all applicable \nstatutory requirements and will advance the nonproliferation and other \nforeign policy interests of the United States.\n  Pursuant to the proposed Amendment, the Agreement for Co-operation \nBetween the United States of America and the International Atomic \nEnergy Agency, signed at Vienna May 11, 1959, as amended and extended \nFebruary 12, 1974, and January 14, 1980 (the ``Agreement''), would \ncontinue to provide a comprehensive framework for peaceful nuclear \ncooperation with the IAEA and facilitate our mutual objectives related \nto nonproliferation and the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.\n  The primary purposes of the Agreement are to enable exports from the \nUnited States of nuclear material and equipment to IAEA Member States \nfor research reactors and, in certain cases, for power reactors, and to \nenable transfers from the United States of small samples of nuclear \nmaterial to the IAEA for safeguards and research purposes.\n  Under the proposed Amendment, the term of the Agreement will be \nextended an additional 40 years for a total term of 95 years.\n  The Agreement permits the transfer of material, equipment (including \nreactors), and facilities for nuclear research and nuclear power \nproduction. It does not permit transfers of Restricted Data, sensitive \nnuclear facilities, or major critical components of such facilities, \nor, unless specifically provided for in a supply agreement or an \namendment thereto, transfers of sensitive nuclear technology. In the \nevent of termination of the Agreement, key nonproliferation conditions \nand controls continue with respect to material, equipment, and \nfacilities subject to the Agreement.\n  A more detailed discussion of the IAEA's nuclear nonproliferation and \npeaceful uses activities is provided in the NPAS and in a classified \nannex to the NPAS submitted to you separately.\n  I have considered the views and recommendations of the interested \nagencies in reviewing the proposed Amendment to the Agreement and have \ndetermined that its performance will promote, and will not constitute \nan unreasonable risk to, the common defense and security.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the General \n     Assembly of the State of Ohio memorializing the Congress of \n     the United\n\n[[Page S598]]\n\n     States to oppose any legislation that requires Social \n     Security coverage for members of any of Ohio's state \n     retirement systems; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 190\n\n       Whereas, Ohio has a long history, predating the creation of \n     Social Security, of providing retirement, disability, and \n     survivor benefits to its state and local public employees \n     through its own state retirement systems; and\n       Whereas, These state retirement systems, the Public \n     Employees Retirement System, Ohio Police and Fire Pension \n     Fund, State Teachers Retirement System, School Employees \n     Retirement System, and State Highway Patrol Retirement \n     System, have combined assets of over $165 billion and provide \n     retirement, disability, and survivor benefits to over 1.5 \n     million members, retirees, and beneficiaries; and\n       Whereas, The state retirement system plans are offered in \n     lieu of Social Security; and\n       Whereas, Ohio's state retirement systems are required by \n     Ohio law to accumulate and maintain, through employer and \n     employee contributions and investments, the necessary funds \n     to pay all benefits promised by the Ohio General Assembly; \n     and\n       Whereas, The state retirement systems are well-managed and \n     free of the financial problems facing Social Security; and\n       Whereas, Any federal mandates that require Ohio public \n     employee participation in Social Security or other federal \n     pension programs would devastate Ohio's state retirement \n     systems, weaken the retirement security of its public \n     employees, and jeopardize their retirement benefits: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That we, the members of the 130th General \n     Assembly of the State of Ohio, in adopting this resolution, \n     urge the Congress of the United States to oppose any \n     legislation containing provisions that would require Ohio's \n     public employees who are members of a state retirement system \n     to participate in Social Security or any federal pension \n     program; and be if further\n       Resolved, That we, the members of the 130th General \n     Assembly of the State of Ohio, either in whole or in part, \n     will meet with the members of the Ohio Congressional \n     delegation whenever feasible to express our opposition to any \n     federal legislation that would require Ohio's public \n     employees who are members of a state retirement system to \n     participate in Social Security or any federal pension \n     program; and be it further\n       Resolved, That we, the members of the 130th General \n     Assembly of the State of Ohio, encourage our fellow members \n     to personally meet with each Senator and Representative in \n     the Ohio Congressional delegation to further express our \n     opposition to any federal legislation that would require \n     Ohio's public employees who are members of a state retirement \n     system to participate in Social Security or any federal \n     pension program; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Clerk of the House of Representatives \n     transmit duly authenticated copies of this resolution to the \n     President of the United States, the President Pro Tempore and \n     Secretary of the United States Senate, the Speaker and Clerk \n     of the United States House of Representatives, each member of \n     the Ohio Congressional delegation, and the news media of \n     Ohio.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-191. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania \n     memorializing the Congress of the United States to pass and \n     the President of the United States to sign the Marketplace \n     Fairness Act of 2013; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 571\n\n       Whereas, As the result of a series of United States Supreme \n     Court cases dealing with state taxation of mail order catalog \n     retailers, including Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, 504 U.S. \n     298 (1992) and National Bellas Hess, Inc. v. Department of \n     Revenue of Illinois, 386 U.S. 753 (1967), a state is \n     generally unable to require a retailer without a physical \n     presence in that state to collect sales and use tax on its \n     behalf; and\n       Whereas, Pennsylvania has long imposed a sales tax on each \n     sale at retail of tangible personal property or taxable \n     services within this Commonwealth, with the retailer required \n     to collect the tax from the purchaser and to remit the \n     collected tax to the Commonwealth; and\n       Whereas, If the retailer does not collect the sales tax on \n     a taxable sale at retail, and the purchaser uses the \n     purchased item or service within this Commonwealth, the \n     purchaser is legally required to pay use tax directly to the \n     Commonwealth; and\n       Whereas, The burden on individual purchasers or consumers \n     to track, calculate and remit the correct amount of use tax \n     is significant, resulting in low rates of compliance and \n     reduced state tax collections; and\n       Whereas, A 2011 study by Robert Strauss, Professor of \n     Economics and Public Policy at the Heinz College, Carnegie \n     Mellon University, projected that Pennsylvania would lose \n     between $254 million and $410 million in sales and use taxes \n     in 2012 due to the inability to require retailers without a \n     physical presence in this Commonwealth to collect sales and \n     use taxes; and\n       Whereas, The Pennsylvania Department of Revenue has taken \n     measures to improve the collection of this tax, including the \n     addition of a section for the use tax on the standard \n     Pennsylvania tax return form (PA-40) and by clarifying the \n     nexus standard for retailers with physical presence in this \n     Commonwealth through a subsidiary, representative or agent; \n     and\n       Whereas, While the recent measures by the Department of \n     Revenue to improve collections have resulted in increased \n     compliance, much remains uncollected; and\n       Whereas, The inability to collect sales and use tax on \n     purchases made from retailers that do not have a physical \n     presence in this Commonwealth has created a disadvantage for \n     this Commonwealth's brick-and-mortar retailers that are \n     required to collect the sales and use tax; and\n       Whereas, The 2011 study by Professor Strauss projected that \n     uniform collection of the sales and use tax across all \n     retailers would result in job growth by Pennsylvania-based \n     brick-and-mortar retailers of between 1,530 and 2,766 jobs, \n     which would generate between $66 million and $119 million in \n     wages; and\n       Whereas, The growth of retail sales on the Internet has \n     exacerbated the problem for taxpayers and the Commonwealth \n     far beyond the circumstances considered when the Quill case \n     was decided; and\n       Whereas, Congress is in the best position to standardize \n     the nationwide collection of sales and use taxes from \n     retailers that do not have a physical presence in the state \n     where the tax is due; and\n       Whereas, The United States Supreme Court stated in Quill \n     that the problem ``is not only one that Congress may be \n     better qualified to resolve, but also one that Congress has \n     the ultimate power to resolve''; and\n       Whereas, On May 6, 2013, the United States Senate passed \n     the Marketplace Fairness Act of 2013, which would provide \n     nationwide standards for the collection of sales and use \n     taxes from out-of-state retailers, by a vote of 69 to 27; and\n       Whereas, The Marketplace Fairness Act of 2013 is currently \n     being considered by the Committee on the Judiciary in the \n     United States House of Representatives; and\n       Whereas, On September 18, 2013, Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-\n     Va.) and Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, Commercial and \n     Antitrust Law Chairman Spencer Bachus (R-Ala.) issued a \n     statement outlining the framework the committee will follow \n     when considering the legislation; and\n       Whereas, The Marketplace Fairness Act of 2013 would simply \n     standardize the collection of existing taxes that are already \n     due; it would not expand an existing tax nor would it create \n     a new tax; and\n       Whereas, The additional revenue that is already due to the \n     Commonwealth that would be collected under the Marketplace \n     Fairness Act of 2013 could be used to prevent future tax \n     increases and to provide tax relief to all Pennsylvanians; \n     and\n       Whereas, A 2013 study by economists Arthur B. Laffer and \n     Donna Arduin projects that over the next ten years the \n     enactment of the Marketplace Fairness Act of 2013 could \n     empower states to implement pro-growth tax policies that \n     would result in a nationwide increase in gross domestic \n     product (GDP) of $563.2 billion and add over 1.5 million new \n     jobs, with $15.1 billion in GDP growth and 43,000 new jobs in \n     Pennsylvania: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives memorialize the \n     Congress of the United States to pass and the President of \n     the United States to sign the Marketplace Fairness Act of \n     2013, or a similar act, to provide uniform measures for the \n     collection of states' sales and use taxes; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, to the presiding officers \n     of each house of Congress and to each member of Congress from \n     Pennsylvania.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-192.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify \nsafe harbor requirements applicable to automatic contribution \narrangements, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Retirement \nSecurity Act of 2014, legislation I am sponsoring with my good friend, \nthe senior Senator from Florida and the chairman of the Special \nCommittee on Aging. Our bill would encourage small employers to offer \nretirement plans, encourage employees to save more for their \nretirement, and ensure that low- and middle-income taxpayers are able \nto claim tax benefits for retirement savings already authorized in law.\n  I thought it was interesting last night that the President, in his \nspeech, highlighted what is a growing problem in this country; that is, \nthat people who have not saved sufficiently to have a comfortable \nretirement.\n  The legislation we are introducing today is an outgrowth of our work \ntogether on the Special Committee on Aging. Last fall, the committee \nconducted a hearing on retirement security, where we heard from \nwitnesses that far too many American seniors have real reason to fear \nthat they will outlive their savings. According to the nonpartisan \nCenter for Retirement Research at Boston College, there is an estimated \n$6.6 trillion gap between the savings American households need to \nmaintain their standard of living in retirement and what they actually \nhave. That is an enormous gap that speaks to the fact that we need to \nshine a light on this problem.\n  Nationally, one in four retired Americans has no source of income \nbeyond Social Security--in Maine, the number is one in three. Four in \nten seniors rely on that vital program for 90 percent of their \nretirement income. Yet Social Security provides an average benefit of \njust $1,294 per month--less than $16,000 per year. It is hard to \nimagine stretching those dollars far enough to pay the bills--certainly \na ``comfortable retirement'' is out of the question.\n  According to a Gallup survey published in 2012, more than half of all \nAmericans are worried they will not be able to maintain their standard \nof living in retirement, up sharply from 34 percent two decades ago. \nThey are right to be concerned: projections published in 2010 by the \nEmployee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI) show that nearly half of \n``Early Boomers''--those between the ages of 56 and 62 when the study \nwas conducted--are at risk of not having enough money to pay for basic \ncosts in retirement, including uninsured health care costs.\n  There are many reasons for the decline in retirement security facing \nAmerican seniors, including the severity of the recent financial \ncrisis, rising health care costs, the need for long-term care, and the \nfact that Americans are simply living far longer than they did in the \npast. The shift from employer-based ``defined benefit'' plans--\npensions--to ``defined contribution'' plans like 401(k)s, also has \nplayed a role.\n  Another contributing factor we found is that employees of small \nbusinesses are much less likely to participate in employer-based \nretirement plans. According to a recent GAO study, more than half of \nthe 42 million Americans who work for businesses with fewer than 100 \nemployees lack access to a work-based plan to save for retirement. Cost \nand complexity are among the reasons plans are not more widely offered \nby small businesses.\n  Chairman Nelson and I believe that making it easier for smaller \nbusinesses to provide access to retirement plans for their workers \nwould make a significant difference in the financial security for many \nAmericans. That is why the bill we are introducing today focuses on \nreducing the cost and complexity of retirement plans, especially for \nsmall businesses, and on encouraging individuals to save more for their \nretirement. Let me describe some of the provisions of our bill:\n  First, our bill would allow small businesses to enter into multiple \nemployer plans (MEPs) to jointly offer retirement programs to their \nemployees. This allows small companies to share the administrative \nburden of a retirement plan, which helps to lower costs. Current law \ndiscourages the use of MEPs because it requires a connection, or \n``nexus,'' between unrelated businesses in order to join a MEP, such as \nmembership in the same trade association. Our bill would waive the \nnexus requirement for businesses with fewer than 500 employees. So as \nnot to discourage growth, our bill provides a long phase-out, under \nwhich businesses are not automatically disqualified from a MEP when \nthey hire their 500th employee.\n  Second, our bill makes joining a MEP a more attractive option for \nsmall businesses. Under current law, if one employer in a MEP fails to \nmeet the minimum criteria necessary for retirement plans to obtain tax \nbenefits, all employers and their employees could lose their tax \nbenefits. These benefits are substantial. For employees, they include \ndelaying the taxation of income contributed to a plan until funds are \nwithdrawn. For employers, plan disqualification could result in limited\n\n[[Page S601]]\n\ndeductions and a higher tax burden. Our bill directs Treasury to issue \nregulations to address this uncertainty, and protect members of a MEP \nfrom the failure of one bad apple to meet its obligations.\n  Third, our bill reduces the cost of maintaining a retirement plan. \nCurrent law requires that participants in a retirement plan receive a \nvariety of notices. Our bill would direct Treasury to simplify, \nclarify, and consolidate these required notices, which creates savings \nthat can be passed on to employers.\n  As ranking member of the Special Committee on Aging, I have heard \ncountless stories of retirees whose savings did not go as far as they \nanticipated. Adequate savings reduce poverty among our seniors during \nwhat should be their golden years. As the HELP Committee noted in a \nJuly 2012 report, elder poverty also increases Medicare and Medicaid \ncosts and strains our social safety net. Giving those not yet at \nretirement age more opportunities to save, and to save more, may help \nto ease this additional burden on entitlement programs that already are \nprojected to be unsustainable.\n  The Retirement Security Act of 2014 encourages those still in the \nworkforce to save more for retirement. Retirement plans are often \ndesigned to comply with existing safe harbors to prevent the IRS from \nchallenging the tax benefits that flow to employees and employers. The \nexisting safe harbor for so-called ``automatic enrollment'' plans \neffectively caps employee contributions at 10 percent of annual pay, \nwith the employer contributing a ``matching'' amount on up to 6 \npercent. Our bill creates an additional safe harbor for these plans \nthat would allow employees to receive an employer match on \ncontributions of up to 10 percent of their pay. Employees would be able \nto contribute more than 10 percent, albeit without an employer match \nfor contributions above 10 percent.\n  I recognize that businesses that choose to adopt a plan with this new \noptional safe harbor may face additional costs due to the increased \nemployer match. That is why our bill helps the smallest businesses--\nthose with fewer than 100 employees--offset this cost by providing a \nnew tax credit equal to the increased match.\n  I wish to emphasize that the new retirement plan options for \nbusinesses included in our bill are just that--options. No business, \nlarge or small, would be required to offer a retirement plan under the \nRetirement Security Act of 2014. Some firms, facing an uncertain \neconomy and rising health care costs, may choose to spend their limited \nresources elsewhere. Accordingly, our bill ensures that current \nmeasures to encourage savings are functioning as they were intended. \nOne such measure is the so-called ``saver's credit,'' which reduces the \ntax burden on low- and middle-income individuals who contribute to \nretirement plans, including IRAs and 401(k) plans. Yet this credit \ncannot be claimed on a Form 1040EZ, which is used by individuals with \nincome under $100,000. A 2013 survey found that only 23 percent of \npeople with household incomes of less than $50,000 per year, the group \nmost likely to qualify, was even aware of the saver's credit. To \naddress this, our bill directs Treasury to make the credit available on \nForm 1040EZ.\n  In light of the positive effects this bill would have in \nstrengthening retirement security for millions of Americans, I urge my \ncolleagues to join Chairman Nelson and me in supporting the Retirement \nSecurity Act of 2014. I am very pleased we have a number of groups that \nhave endorsed our bill. I expect to have more to say about that next \nweek. But at this point I encourage my colleagues to take a look at the \nhearing that Chairman Nelson and I held in the Special Committee on \nAging that focused the spotlight on this problem. We simply have too \nmany of our seniors who are in their retirement years without \nsufficient funds for a comfortable retirement, and that can and should \nchange.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, first of all, I thank my coleader of the \ncommittee, the great Senator from the State of Maine, who has been not \nonly a great leader but also a terrific copartner as we try to offer \nleadership to the Special Committee on Aging.\n  We are literally trying to make bipartisanship work. It is only \nbecause of folks such as Senator Collins that this is working and, as a \nresult, we have a terrific committee. The members participate, they \ncome, they are engaged, they ask the questions of the witnesses. As \nSenator Collins said, as a result of one of these hearings, under her \nleadership, she suggested putting together this important piece of \nlegislation.\n  Our committee held a hearing last fall called ``The State of the \nAmerican Senior.'' We wanted to look at the financial security of the \naverage senior in retirement. We didn't like what we heard. Fewer than \nhalf of the workers even have access to a retirement plan, and those \nnumbers shrink when we talk about employees who work for small \nbusinesses. One-third of the private sector employees work at small \nbusinesses, and nearly 72 percent of businesses with under 100 \nemployees offer no savings plan. I will repeat that: Of businesses \nunder 100 employees, 72 percent do not offer a savings plan.\n  So what do seniors then end up with? They rely on Social Security to \nget by in retirement, and that is simply not enough money to pay for \nhousing and medical care and other expenses. Take, for example, my \nState of Florida, where more than three in five people get half of \ntheir retirement income from Social Security. Here is a shocker: One-\nthird of Floridians only receive Social Security income--one-third of \nall of the 20 million people in Florida receive Social Security income. \nThat is all they receive is their Social Security.\n  So there is a problem that needs to be fixed. Too many people are \ngetting by with too little. So Senator Collins and I have come together \non this legislation aimed at increasing access to savings plans and \ncreating more opportunities for those in retirement, to put more money \naside ahead of their retirement.\n  Senator Collins explained it: We are going to try to pool all the \nsmall businesses together with their resources to take advantage of the \neconomies of scale to create one plan, and it increases safe harbors \nfor things such as automatic enrollment and escalation contributions, \nwhich have been shown as ways to get people to save more.\n  This is commonsense legislation. It is bipartisan. It is a great \nprivilege for me to work with Senator Collins on this legislation and \non our committee work.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 1971. A bill to establish an interagency coordination committee or \nsubcommittee with the leadership of the Department of Energy and the \nDepartment of the Interior, focused on the nexus between energy and \nwater production, use, and efficiency, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, vast amounts of water are used every \nday to produce vital fuels and to cool powerplants in the United \nStates. Without this water supply, most of our electricity would stop \nflowing and our economy and other essential functions would come to a \ncomplete stop. At the same time, a great deal of electricity is needed \nto treat, transport, and convey water across the country not only to \nsupport economic growth and well-being but also to sustain basic life. \nThese inseparable links of ``water for energy'' and ``energy for \nwater'' comprise the energy-water nexus.\n  I believe that the Federal agencies can and must do more to ensure \nthat we have the best possible data, technology, and know-how to ensure \nthat this nexus is well understood and continuously optimized to \nsustain quality of life and promote economic growth. To that end, I am \nintroducing a bill today entitled ``The Nexus of Energy and Water for \nSustainability Act of 2014'' or the ``NEWS Act of 2014'' for short.\n  The NEWS Act instructs the Director of the Office of Science and \nTechnology Policy to establish a committee or a subcommittee under the \nNational Science and Technology Council to coordinate and streamline \nthe activities of all Federal departments and agencies on energy-water \nnexus issues. This new panel will be cochaired by the Secretaries of \nEnergy and Interior and will\n\n[[Page S602]]\n\nbe tasked with identifying all relevant energy-water nexus activities \nacross the Federal Government; enhancing the coordination of effective \nresearch and development activities, both ongoing and in the future; \nworking to gather and disseminate data to enable better practices; and \nexploring relevant public-private collaboration. The bill also calls \nfor the Office of Management and Budget to submit to the relevant \ncongressional committees a so-called crosscut budget soon after \nenactment of this act. The cross-cut budget will detail various \nexpenditures across the Federal Government related to energy-water \nactivities and will greatly assist in our coordination and streamlining \nefforts.\n  I believe this is a strong bill that deserves to be considered and \npassed in this Congress. I am grateful to Senator Wyden for sponsoring \nit with me, and look forward to working with every member in this \nChamber to address these important issues.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1971\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to improve management of the National Laboratories, \nenhance technology commercialization, facilitate public-private \npartnerships, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I rise to speak about a bill introduced \ntoday--a bipartisan bill--a bill that will strengthen America's \ninnovation economy.\n  Over the last 60 years our national laboratories have served as \nleading centers of research and discovery in America. Today we have 17 \nDOE labs charged with three broad research missions: science, energy, \nand national security. Although they have grown and changed since their \nfounding to encompass much broader ranges of work and are successful in \ncarrying out their primary missions, labs are not fully optimized to \ntake part in today's innovation culture. That is a problem, because in \nthis century of rapid change, America's best competitive advantage \nremains our capacity to innovate.\n  Over the coming months, I will be talking more about a few things \nCongress can do to streamline and jumpstart our Nation's hubs of \ndiscovery so that we can thrive as a 21st-century innovation economy.\n  At the top level, it will mean reauthorizing the America COMPETES Act \nto reaffirm our commitment to the robust national strategy for science \nand technology programs that will continue to be a critical \nunderpinning of American prosperity.\n  And one part of that is how our national labs operate, which is why \ntoday Senator Rubio and I have introduced the America INNOVATES Act.\n  Already, our labs have incubated many groundbreaking innovations.\n  Their research has led to breakthroughs from new Melanoma and HIV/\nAIDS treatments to IED detonators that can save the lives of our troops \nin combat. And that research is critical because although the private \nsector will continue to be a key source of innovation, the Federal \nGovernment has and will continue to play a central role in advancing \ninnovation.\n  Why is that? Private markets, historically speaking, tend to \nunderinvest in R relative to the potential benefits to society. This \nis especially true in the energy sector.\n  But, if there is a problem that I have heard since coming to \nCongress, It is that too often, the great work of our scientists \ndoesn't translate to the marketplace.\n  Right now, too much groundbreaking science and too many innovative \nideas never leave the walls of our national labs, squandering enormous \npotential in the commercial market.\n  Now, in our bill, we continue to support our labs' core mission. We \nare\n\n[[Page S603]]\n\nnot proposing anything drastic. What we are doing is modernizing the \nlabs for the 21st century--so ideas in the lab can more effectively \nbecome innovations in the market. Luckily, we need only look to the \nlabs themselves for inspiration on how to do this.\n  We make two broad proposals.\n  First we are integrating the management of the Department of Energy's \nscience and energy programs to improve the linkages between basic and \napplied sciences. This will allow the early stages of research and \ndevelopment to be translated more efficiently, and it is something that \nSecretary Moniz has signaled he supports and is moving forward on.\n  Second we are giving the national labs more power to work with the \nprivate sector to ensure that more scientific discoveries can turn into \ncommercial breakthroughs.\n  Together, these steps would allow us to streamline the labs' work so \nit can more quickly and effectively translate into the transformative \ninnovations that can create jobs and grow our economy.\n  Now, to explain what our proposals intend to achieve, I will walk \nthrough what is known as the innovation pipeline, which shows how basic \nscience research can become a world-changing innovation.\n  First, I will use the example of the great work that scientists at \nthe National Renewable Energy Lab in Golden, CO, are doing to advance \ncellulosic ethanol technologies.\n  One of our country's big challenges today is reducing our dependence \non foreign oil, and to do that we need new fuel options that we can \ncreate here in America.\n  Cellulosic ethanol is an advanced biofuel with a lot of promise \nbecause it is produced from abundant materials like grasses and wood \nchips as well as other types of biomass and waste. And because these \nmaterials are so abundant, cellulosic ethanol has the potential to \nreplace a significant portion of our Nation's petroleum consumption.\n  The challenge comes, however, because, unlike corn, these cellulosic \nmaterials are made of complex starches that are harder to break down \ninto ethanol.\n  To make the promise of cellulosic ethanol a reality, we needed to \ndevelop the enzymes and micro-organisms that could break down and then \nferment those complex starches.\n  That is where the innovation pipeline comes in. At the NREL in \nColorado, scientists started at this first step here--basic science. \nBasic science is very fundamental, it is the study of the elementary \nprinciples of the universe--really discovery level science.\n  Enzymes are large biological molecules that are nature's catalysts--\naccelerating metabolic processes that sustain life.\n  To develop enzymes and micro-organisms capable of converting starchy \nbiomass into cellulosic ethanol, you need to start at the fundamentals \nof biology and biochemistry. This includes studying the intricate \ndetails of the relevant biochemical processes, as well as probing the \nproteins and amino-acids that form the building blocks of enzymes down \nto the submolecular level.\n  At this point, scientists can move into the applied science stage of \nthe pipeline. Applied research generally concerns translating those \nbasic, fundamental principles into an application.\n  In this example, scientists apply the insights gained from the \nfundamental basic science stage to develop new enzymes with desired \nperformance traits such as high selectivity, specificity, and stability \nto enable effective and efficient conversion of the complex starches \ninto ethanol.\n  Applied research can also include controlled lab-scale demonstrations \nto test how effectively these newly developed enzymes and micro-\norganisms can turrijsay, wood chips, into fuel.\n  Still in the lab and far from full commercial scale production, the \nkinds of small discoveries that happen at the applied science level act \nas an early demonstration that something new is possible.\n  At the applied research stage, we are still far away from creating \nsomething ready for the market, but between these two stages our \nscientists have gone from the basic science of how an idea may work to \nactually demonstrating that it could work in practice.\n  At this point now, the private sector is more likely to see its \npotential value. Our scientists have shown that the technology is \npossible, and next we move to the commercialization and scaling and \ndeployment phases, where private investors and companies take the \ntechnology our lab scientists have developed and make it a product that \ncan succeed in the market.\n  During the applied research stage at NREL, scientists were hard at \nwork showing that they really could produce cellulosic ethanol \nefficiently and cheaply--eventually meeting their goal to make it price \ncompetitive with conventional fuels in today's commercial market.\n  That is where we are right now with cellulosic ethanol. Companies \nacross the country, such as DuPont, Poet, and others, are currently \nbuilding plants to produce cellulosic ethanol at large scale and at \ncompetitive prices.\n  So that is one model of public-private partnerships for innovation--\nwhere the basic and applied science research can begin in the lab and \nthen be transferred to private sector companies who can create a \ncommercial product.\n  I had the opportunity last year to witness another model of public-\nprivate partnerships for innovation at the Lawrence Berkeley National \nLab, which is home to the Advanced Light Source, or ALS. The ALS serves \nthousands of researchers--from private sector scientists to university \nresearchers--who use light sources such as soft xrays, ultraviolet \nlight, and infrared light to conduct a wide range of scientific \nexperiments. Experiments at the ALS are performed at nearly 40 beam \nlines that can operate simultaneously around the clock and year-round.\n  The facility's resources would be too expensive for any one company \nto invest in alone, but by building a public facility that then is \npartly sustained by fees and targeted infrastructure investments by \nusers, the ALS becomes a place where many different partners can come \nto test new ideas and approaches.\n  In terms of the innovation pipeline, what the Berkeley Lab and its \nALS do is allow a diverse range of researchers to engage in various \nstages of research under one roof. The unique capabilities offered at \nthe ALS also attract many industry partners and encourages productive \npublic-private collaboration.\n  A good example of this is the partnership between the lab and the \nsemiconductor industry.\n  Semiconductor technology is one of the most transformative scientific \nbreakthroughs of the 20th century. Semiconductors are at the heart of \nwhat makes a computer work. Their constant advancement is what allows \nus today to hold the computing power of last generation's supercomputer \nin our pockets.\n  However, the manufacturing techniques previously used to produce new, \nsmaller, and more powerful semiconductor products aren't adequate to \nbuild the next generation of nano-electronic devices.\n  So what has happened is a consortium of companies including Intel, \nIBM, HP, and Dow Chemical--called SEMATECH--came together to leverage \nthe unique capabilities at the lab to advance semiconductor \nmanufacturing technology for next-generation electronics.\n  As the lab reports, ``[By] tapping into the Center's long term \nexpertise in short wavelength optics and the unique properties of the \nALS Synchotron facility, SEMATECH funded the development of the world's \nhighest resolution projection lithography tool and highest performance \n[extreme-ultraviolet] microscope''--developments that were only \npossible because of the facilities and expertise at the lab.\n  Having then developed new tools capable of manufacturing the next \ngeneration of semiconductor devices, a company like Intel can take the \nnew technology and scale it up in their own plants.\n  Of course, there are many variations of public private partnerships \nthat our labs can and have utilized to take ideas from the lab to the \nmarket. These two examples--cellulosic ethanol and the advancement of \nsemiconductor manufacturing technology--show us what is really possible \nby working in partnership with our national labs.\n\n[[Page S604]]\n\n  In our bill Senator Rubio and I are trying to expand the flexibility \nand freedom of all our labs to innovate and build productive \npartnerships so that every research project has the potential and \nopportunity to eventually enter the market.\n  As we see here on the innovation pipeline, the payoff for all this \nwork doesn't come until the very end, so one of the best things we can \ndo is focus our policies to make the movement of ideas through the \npipeline as efficient as possible.\n  While there are plenty of areas where Senator Rubio and I disagree, \nwe have come together on the America INNOVATES Act because we both \nagree that government has a role to play investing in the early \nscientific research that can lead to innovations that change our world.\n  In this bill, we aren't talking about expanding government or calling \nfor new spending or regulation, we are talking about the early science \nwork that only government can fund because there isn't yet a clear \npayoff for the private sector and finding out how to connect the \nnational labs and the private sector along this innovation pipeline in \na better and stronger way to deliver more products to the American \nmarketplace and the world markets.\n\n  Once again, I thank my Republican colleague Senator Marco Rubio. I \nurge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join us in supporting \nthis bipartisan innovation jobs bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/29/senate-section/article/S604-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S604]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 341--OBSERVING THE 100TH BIRTHDAY OF CIVIL RIGHTS \n   LEADER DAISY BATES AND HONORING HER LEGACY AS AN AMERICAN HEROINE\n\n  Mr. PRYOR submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.
