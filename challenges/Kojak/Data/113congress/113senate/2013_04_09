Mr. President, the time until 11:30 today will be equally \ndivided between the majority and the minority. The Democrats will \ncontrol the first 30 minutes and the Republicans the final 30 minutes. \nAt 11:30 the Senate will proceed to executive session to consider the \nnomination of Patty Shwartz to be a circuit judge for the Third \nCircuit. At noon there will be a rollcall vote on her nomination. The \nSenate will then recess from 12:30 until 2:15 to allow for our weekly \ncaucus meetings.\n\n\n                Congratulating the Louisville Cardinals\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I first wish to extend my congratulations to \nSenator McConnell and the Louisville Cardinals for their successful \nNCAA championship. It was remarkable how they were always coming from \nbehind to wind up winning. They did it not with offense but with \ndefense. I was very impressed with the team but most of all impressed \nwith their coach Rick Pitino. Rick Pitino on yesterday was also \nselected, with Jerry Tarkanian, to be a member of the Basketball Hall \nof Fame, and certainly they deserve that--both of them.\n  In addition to congratulating my friend Senator McConnell, it is also \nimportant to recognize my deputy chief of staff Dave McCallum, who is a \nrabid Louisville fan. When I went down to participate in a program \nSenator McConnell set up, I took David McCallum with me. He loves those \nLouisville Cardinals, and today he has more reason to like them and \ntonight even more reason because in the championship game tonight we \nhave the University of Connecticut playing the Louisville Cardinals for \nthe women's championship. So I am very mindful of how strongly Senator \nMcConnell feels about his Louisville Cardinals.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Would my friend yield for an observation?\n  Mr. REID. Yes. I just wanted to say I won't get into the politics of \nsports in Kentucky because I don't understand them, but I know how much \nSenator McConnell cares about the Louisville Cardinals.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would say to my good friend from \nNevada that one of the things we enjoy talking about is sports, and he \nis a big UNLV fan as well. I would like to report to my friend through \nthe Chair that it was a fun evening. It was absolutely exciting to be \nthere. I was also grateful to the majority leader for coming down to \nthe University of Louisville a few years ago. I was glad I had a chance \nto be there and to see it in person.\n  Basketball in a football facility is a little odd. There were 75,000 \npeople there. I am not sure many people up at the top even saw the \nplayers. But we were a little closer to the floor, and it was a \nwonderful experience.\n  I thank the majority leader for his comments.\n\n\n                            Jerry Tarkanian\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I mentioned the Basketball Hall of Fame. \nJerry Tarkanian made it into the hall of fame--20 years too late, but \nhe made it. Why didn't he get in earlier? Because this courageous man \ntook on the NCAA, which has absolute control over college athletes. I \nhope that as the years go by, we as a Congress will take a look at that \nmore closely.\n  But I don't want to move away from the important day it is in Jerry \nTarkanian's life. Jerry is now over 80. He doesn't get around like he \nused to, and he doesn't chew on the towels like he is famous for. Here \nis a man who was held out of the hall of fame for far too long. This \nman won 990 games as a coach. He had more than an 80-percent winning \nrecord. He is a very fine man with a good family. His wife is a member \nof the Las Vegas City Council. He\n\n[[Page S2476]]\n\nbrought such excitement to Las Vegas. He coached the Runnin' Rebels \ninto four final fours, won the championship once, and but for some \npolitics within the university system, he would probably still be \ncoaching there. Some things came up so that he no longer was able to \ncoach at UNLV. But I admire him as a person and certainly send my \ncongratulations to all of those Runnin' Rebel fans today because we \nhave something to celebrate.\n  Finally, he took on the NCAA and won. He won a large money judgment \nagainst them as a result of how they treated him--it was so unfair--him \nand his players. People throughout the State of Nevada who played for \nhim and who are now successful businesspeople--they are teaching \nprofessionals around the State, they are doing all kinds of good things \nin the State and around the country because of Jerry Tarkanian and the \nteam he had and mainly his wife. She was so good with those young men \nwho came to UNLV. She was, among other things, a speech therapist. She \nunderstood these young men, and they cared about her as much as \nthey did about Jerry.\n\n\n                              Gun Control\n\n  Mr. President, as do most Americans, I believe the second amendment \nguarantees the right to bear arms. As a young boy--12 years old--on my \nbirthday I got a gun, but it wasn't some little pea shooter, it was a \nblunderbuss, a 12 gauge shotgun, bolt action. Boy, that is a big gun. I \nstill have it. I have had it reblued. I had the stock reworked. It is a \nbeautiful gun. My parents sent away through the Sears catalog for that \npresent for me. That gun was a real extravagance for them. It cost $28, \nbut, oh, did I have fun with that great big gun that was bigger than I, \nand it kicked so much then, but I could handle it. I didn't get to \nshoot it a lot because shotgun shells were expensive.\n  So, like most Americans, I also believe the right to bear arms must \nbe balanced with the rights of all little boys and girls in this \ncountry, whether they live in inner-city Chicago or sleepy Newtown, CT, \nto grow up safe from the threat of gun violence. Most gun owners are \ngood. The vast majority of gun owners are good, responsible people who \nlove target shooting and hunting and want to protect their homes and \ntheir families. But we have a responsibility to do everything in our \npower to keep guns out of the hands of convicted criminals and those \nwho suffer from mental illnesses that make them a danger to themselves \nand to others. We understand that now more than ever with the terrible \nslaughters in Aurora, CO, and Newtown, CT. We have a responsibility as \na body to safeguard the most vulnerable and our most precious \nresource--the kids, our children, our babies.\n  The terrible tragedy at Newtown was a wake-up call. We are really \nfailing, and we need to do more. Newtown will always remember those \nlittle boys and girls, some of them shot multiple times, little \nchildren--5-year-old kids, 6-year-old children.\n  These are just names to us, but to the people of Newtown, Olivia \nisn't just a name; Olivia is a little girl who had a family who loved \nher. Newtown is a little town, relatively speaking. They know Jack. We \nhave a responsibility to safeguard these little kids, and unless we do \nsomething, more than what is the law today, we have failed.\n  It is long past time for a thoughtful examination of the lax laws and \nculture of violence that put Newtown and Aurora, Oak Creek and Carson \nCity, NV, on the map for such a devastating reason. I only hope my \nRepublican colleagues will allow us to have that conversation. I hope \nRepublicans will stop trying to shut down debate and start engaging on \nthe tough issues we were sent to Washington to tackle.\n  There has been a huge cry in this body--for 2 years plus the months \nof this Congress--of people saying: Let's have regular order. Let's \nhave amendments. So I was relatively kind of stunned when I got a \nletter during our break from 13 Republican Senators. They are the same \nSenators who yell and scream the most about regular order and \namendments, but in this letter to me--short, direct, and to the point--\nthey say: You are going to have no ability to go to the gun legislation \nbecause we are going to stop it. We don't think there should be a \ndiscussion or debate on guns.\n  Now, how would I describe these 13 Senators who sent me this letter? \nI want to do this respectfully because they have a right to their \nopinions even if they are illogical and even if they are speaking out \nof both sides of their mouths. What does that mean, speaking out of \nboth sides of their mouths? It is very succinct what it means. It \nmeans--and it is described as a verb, looking it up on the Internet--to \nsay different things to different people about the same subject. That \nis what they have done. They have been yelling and screaming: We want \nregular order.\n  The other night when we were doing the budget that went on until 5 \no'clock in the morning, one of the Senators who signed this letter \nstood and said: We want to offer all the amendments we want to offer. \nNo one has the right to stop us from offering amendments. So that is \nwhat we did. But today he feels differently. Today he is speaking out \nof both sides of his mouth, saying different things to different people \non the same subject.\n  A former Republican Congressman from Florida is now a talk show host, \nand he is very popular. He has a program called ``Morning Joe.'' Here \nis what ``Morning Joe'' is reported as having said: Scarborough tears \ninto GOP filibuster on gun bill and says, ``Is anybody awake in my \nparty?'' Here is what he said:\n\n       With 92 percent of Americans supporting background checks, \n     Scarborough noted, it is really hard to figure out what the \n     political calculation is. It is a 90-10 issue that involves \n     the massacre of 20 children. Is anybody awake in my party on \n     the Hill?\n\n  That is what former Congressman Joe Scarborough said.\n  As President Obama has said, it is impossible to prevent every \nsenseless tragedy, but we owe it to our children to at least try.\n  It is only common sense that felons who couldn't pass a background \ncheck in a gun store should not be able to walk into a gun show and buy \na deadly weapon.\n  This is not hyperbole. Forty percent of the guns sold in the United \nStates each year--including many used to commit crimes--are sold \nlegally at gun shows or through private sales without even the most \nbasic background check.\n  Three years ago, one of those guns--a shotgun purchased legally \nwithout a background check during a 2008 gun show in Kingman, AZ; about \n90 miles from Las Vegas--was used to devastate the largest courthouse \nwe have in Nevada, the brandnew Lloyd D. George Federal Courthouse in \nLas Vegas. It happened just as prospective jurors were arriving for the \nday.\n  This man walked in and started shooting. He blasted at every place \nthat only a gunshot can do. He killed Stanley Cooper of Sandy Valley, \nwho was a security guard. He was killed instantly in this hail of \nbuckshot going around the courthouse. He ran after his gun became empty \nto reload, and he was eventually killed; that is, the man who caused \nall this carnage.\n  But Stanley Cooper, this good man who was there, left behind a \nbrother, four sons, a daughter, seven grandchildren, and two great-\ngrandchildren. He loved to spend time with his grandchildren and great-\ngrandchildren. He loved horses and spending time outdoors. That is why \nhe lived in Sandy Valley.\n  He was no stranger to guns. He spent 26 years serving his community \nas a Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department officer. The man who shot \nhim, on the other hand, was a convicted felon with no right to carry a \nfirearm. He certainly could not have passed a criminal background \ncheck. But the shooter never had to get one. He just went to one of \nthese gun shows and bought this shotgun--the same basic shotgun I got \nwhen I was a 12-year-old.\n  Requiring a simple background check every time a gun is sold is \ncommon sense.\n  As a brandnew member of the Nevada State legislature, I was a kid, \nbut Sheriff Lamb, who was the sheriff of Clark County at the time--and \nnow they have a TV program running; Dennis Quaid is playing Ralph \nLamb--he came to me and said: I need to do something because we need \npeople to wait a little while before they purchase a handgun.\n  I went to the legislature not understanding the process totally, but \nI introduced legislation that passed and became the law, that in Nevada \nif\n\n[[Page S2477]]\n\nsomeone purchases a handgun, they have to wait 3 days to pick it up. It \nis believed that alone has saved the lives of many people. Sometimes \npeople, in a fit of passion, will purchase a handgun to do bad things \nwith it--even as my dad did--kill themselves. Waiting a few days helps.\n  Requiring a simple background check every time a gun is sold is \ncommon sense. We are not asking for a 3-day waiting period. We have \ntechnology now. That does not take that long. But it is common sense. \nThat is why more than 90 percent of Americans--including the vast \nmajority of gun owners, the majority of people who belong to the NRA--\nsupport our proposal to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and \nthose with mental illnesses. That is what a universal background check \nis all about.\n  This legislation would also crack down on anyone who buys a gun as \npart of a scheme to funnel it to criminals--reducing violent crime and \nprotecting police officers. The three things that are in the bill that \nis now before this body all were reported out of the Judiciary \nCommittee, led by Pat Leahy. If anyone thinks that Pat Leahy is a wimp \non guns, they have another thought coming. He is from the State of \nVermont. He boasts about a gun he has. He has a .50 caliber gun. I do \nnot know why he wants one, but he has one. He is a man who loves to \nshoot his guns. So this bill is reported out of the Judiciary \nCommittee, led by one of the people who knows as much about guns as \nmany people in this body--and more, I should say.\n  This bill that came out of that committee gives schools across the \ncountry the resources to improve security and keep kids safe. It is \ncalled school safety. It has Federal trafficking in it.\n  This legislation will not prevent every crime, especially those awful \ncrimes, and background checks will not keep guns out of the hands of \nevery violent madman, and we all know that. But we owe it to the \nAmerican people to act as if there is a chance to save even one life--\nwhether that life belongs to a great-grandfather such as Stanley Cooper \nor these babies who barely began to live in Newtown, CT.\n  They deserve a vote.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cowan). The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                Congratulating the Louisville Cardinals\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am going to take another opportunity \nto congratulate the Louisville Cardinals for an incredible championship \nwin last night. It was a truly exciting game. I know my colleagues from \nMichigan take great pride in the fact that not just one but two of \ntheir schools were in the Sweet 16.\n  But you know we Americans love a story about somebody getting knocked \ndown and picking themselves up again. That is why it was such a great \nmoment to see Kevin Ware cut the net last night. They had to lower the \nrim a bit, as I am sure it is difficult to climb a ladder with a cast \non your right leg, but let me just say to him and to the entire \nUniversity of Louisville, my undergraduate alma mater: Well done. You \nhave truly made our State proud.\n\n\n                     Remembering Margaret Thatcher\n\n  Today, Mr. President, I plan to talk about the President's budget, \nbut first I also wish to say a word about Margaret Thatcher.\n  Margaret Thatcher was one of the most transformative political \nfigures of the 20th century. She was a revolutionary, a tireless \ntribune for what she called ``popular capitalism''--her ``crusade to \nenfranchise the many.'' Thatcher's methods were razor-sharp wit and the \nforce of her will, which had toughened through decades of literally \nplowing through obstacles.\n  A woman of humble beginnings, she charged headfirst against a cross-\npartisan ruling class that had become calcified in office, an elite \nclique that had grown impotent in the face of the sort of postwar \neconomic challenges that have long since drained the vitality from \nWestern democracies that never had a leader like her.\n  The starched dukes and faceless union men who traditionally \nalternated the reins of British power sneered at ``that woman,'' as \nthey called her--the ``grocer's daughter'' who knew nothing of their \nways, whose middle-class instincts were unsuited to the business of \ngoverning. Yet she outmaneuvered them all.\n  When Margaret Thatcher finally wrested the keys of office from those \nwho had made peace with Britain's decline in a way she never could and \nnever would, she set in motion a whirlwind of reforms.\n  None of those were easy. The vested interests opposed her every move. \nBut in the teeth of fierce opposition, she ignited what could best be \ndescribed as a political and economic earthquake--one with a tide of \nglobal reverberations.\n  The kind of policies and ideas she inspired saw dictatorships and \nentrenched bureaucracies come crashing down, grinding poverty lose its \ngrip, and the fossils of socialism recede into the surf. In the wake of \nthis wave of reform stood freer people with a greater say over their \nown lives and a greater hope for the future.\n  That is Margaret Thatcher's legacy. In some ways, the parallels to \nour own day are hard to escape.\n  When Margaret Thatcher took office, Britain was gripped by wrenching \neconomic turmoil--turmoil of a somewhat different kind than, but not \nentirely dissimilar to, our own. But through unbending confidence in \nthe power of free markets and in the power of free people to order \ntheir lives more intelligently than centralized elites, she literally \nturned the tide.\n  So we mourn her passing, but we still have much to learn from her \ncourage and example. Because in the years ahead, we will need to draw \nfrom it as conservatives look to turn the tide in the United States and \nto set about a renewal of our own.\n\n\n                         The President's Budget\n\n  Tomorrow the President is set to unveil his budget--the details of \nhis plan for America's future. Is it going to be a visionary blueprint \nthat focuses on growing the economy instead of the government, a budget \nthat can help, rather than continue to hurt, job creation? Is it going \nto be a budget that balances 10 years from now, 20 years from now, \never? Is it going to be a reformist document that makes bold choices? \nWill he finally drop the tax hike fanaticism that is, frankly, starting \nto enter the realm of the absurd?\n  From what we have heard so far, the prospects do not look all that \ngreat. We hear that, just like the Senate Democratic budget, it will \nnever balance--ever. We hear it contains only about $600 billion or \nless in deficit savings over 10 years, which is roughly the level of \nthe deficit in the first 6 months of this fiscal year. We hear it \ncontains new spending proposals and does little to address the drivers \nof our debt. We hear it contains tax hike upon tax hike upon tax hike--\nand, in fact, all the deficit reduction I just mentioned would be \nderived from myriad tax increases rather than spending reductions.\n  So apart from reports of a modest entitlement change--and we will \nneed to see the details on that--it sounds as if the White House just \ntossed last year's budget in the microwave.\n  Look, this budget is already 2 months late, so I sincerely hope it is \nnot the case that it is just a warmed-over version of last year. \nBecause if it is, what a colossal waste of time and what a \ndisappointment. The American people deserve a lot better than that.\n  In a statement released yesterday, President Obama said Margaret \nThatcher taught us that ``we are not simply carried along by the \ncurrents of history . . . [that] we can shape them with moral \nconviction, unyielding courage and iron will.''\n  What I am saying this morning is that this is your moment to do just \nthat, Mr. President--your moment.\n  Lady Thatcher did not save her country from the abyss by taking half-\nmeasures or tiptoeing around special interest groups. She pushed \nthrough groundbreaking reform after groundbreaking reform, usually \nunder heavy fire from all sides, and often over the objections of \npowerful leaders in her own party and Cabinet.\n  Had she governed by opinion poll, I am sure she would have been a lot \nmore popular while in office, and Britain would have never recovered \nfrom the abysmal state in which she found it.\n  So, Mr. President, if you are ready to embrace bold reform, to take \nthe steps that are needed to make our entitlement programs permanently \nsolvent\n\n[[Page S2478]]\n\nand grow the economy, then Republicans are ready to work with you \nbecause the time for pretending America's challenges can be solved with \nmore of the same is over--over. The time has come to summon the \npolitical courage to move beyond the status quo, to put the tax hikes \nand the poll-tested gimmicks aside, and to do finally what must be \ndone.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the leadership time \nis reserved.\n  Under the previous order, the time until 11:30 a.m. will be equally \ndivided and controlled between the two leaders or their designees, with \nSenators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each, with the \nmajority controlling the first 30 minutes and the Republicans \ncontrolling the second 30 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/09/senate-section/article/S2478-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2478-S2482]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n NOMINATION OF PATTY SHWARTZ TO BE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE \n                             THIRD CIRCUIT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Patty Shwartz, \nof New Jersey, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Third Circuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 30 \nminutes of debate equally divided in the usual form.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last month Senate Republicans filibustered \nthe nomination of Caitlin Halligan to fill a vacancy on the D.C. \nCircuit that arose when Chief Justice Roberts left the D.C. Circuit to \njoin the Supreme Court 8 years ago. Caitlin Halligan is a woman who is \nextraordinarily well-qualified and amongst the most qualified judicial \nnominees I have seen from any administration. It is a shame that narrow \nspecial interests hold such influence that Senate Republicans blocked \nan up-or-down vote on her confirmation with multiple filibusters of her \nnomination and procedural objections that required her to be nominated \nfive times over the last 3 years.\n  Had she received an up-or-down vote, I am certain she would have been \nconfirmed and been an outstanding judge on the United States Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia. Instead, all Senate Republicans \nbut one supported the filibuster and refused to vote up or down on this \nhighly-qualified woman to fill a needed judgeship on the D.C. Circuit. \nSenate Republicans attacked her for legal advocacy on behalf of her \nclient, the State of New York. It is wrong to attribute the legal \npositions a lawyer takes when advocating for a client with what that \nperson would do as an impartial judge. That is not the American \ntradition. That is not what Republicans insisted was the standard for \nnominees of Republican Presidents but that is what they did to derail \nthe nomination of Caitlin Halligan.\n  Also disconcerting were the comments by Republicans after their \nfilibuster in which they gloated about payback. That, too, is wrong. It \ndoes our Nation and our Federal judiciary no good when they place their \ndesire to engage in partisan tit-for-tat over the needs of the American \npeople. I rejected that approach while moving to confirm 100 of \nPresident Bush's judicial nominees in just 17 months in 2001 and 2002.\n  The filibuster of the nomination of Miguel Estrada was different. It \nwas to obtain access to information about his work and whether he acted \nideologically as his supervisor at the Office of Solicitor General had \nalleged. Had we gotten access to those materials, there would have been \na vote on the Estrada nomination. Republican Senators now demand access \nto all sorts of materials while filibustering for the first time in our \nhistory the Secretary of Defense and the Deputy Attorney General of the \nUnited States, as well as the nominee to head the CIA and judicial \nnominees. They cannot do that and still complain about the Estrada \nnomination.\n  Now that Senate Republicans have during the last 4 years filibustered \nmore of President Obama's moderate judicial nominees than were \nfilibustered during President Bush's entire 8 years--67 percent more, \nin fact--I urge them to abandon their misjudged efforts that sacrifice \noutstanding judges for purposes of partisan payback.\n  Today the Senate will finally consider another circuit court \nnomination that has been delayed for no good reason. The nomination of \nJudge Patty Shwartz of New Jersey to the Third Circuit has been \nneedlessly stalled for 13 months since being favorably reported by the \nJudiciary Committee. This is another of the many judicial nominees who \ncould have been confirmed last year. She is another qualified nominee \nwho is supported by her home state Senators and by the Republican \nGovernor of New Jersey. After this prolonged and unnecessary delay, I \nam pleased that she will finally be allowed to join the Third Circuit \nto serve the people of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and the \nVirgin Islands.\n  In 10 years as a United States Magistrate Judge in the District of \nNew Jersey, Judge Shwartz has handled more than 4,000 civil and \ncriminal cases and presided over 14 cases that have gone to verdict or \nfinal judgment, including 11 jury trials. Before becoming a judge, \nJudge Shwartz spent 14 years as an assistant U.S. attorney in the \nDistrict of New Jersey, where she ultimately rose to become chief of \nthe Criminal Division. During her time as an assistant U.S. attorney, \nJudge Shwartz tried more than 15 jury cases to verdict, all as sole or \nchief counsel. It was while serving in the U.S. attorneys Office that \nChris Cristie, then U.S. attorney and current Governor of New Jersey, \nbecame acquainted with her and her work.\n  Governor Christie has written to the committee in support of Judge \nShwartz's nomination. He said that she ``was an impressive Criminal \nChief; hard working, bright, articulate, great with people and \nconversant with the law.'' He added: ``As a Magistrate Judge, she also \nperformed admirably and garnered the respect of the entire legal \ncommunity. Again, her hard work, amiable personality, patience, \nintelligence, and knowledge of the law were lauded by all who appeared \nbefore her.'' I ask unanimous consent that his full letter be printed \nin the Record at the conclusion of my statement.\n  The American Bar Association Standing Committee on the Federal \nJudiciary has rated Judge Shwartz unanimously well qualified, the \nhighest possible rating from its nonpartisan peer review. She has the \nsupport of Senator Lautenberg and Senator Menendez.\n  By any objective measure, Judge Shwartz is a nominee with solid legal \ncredentials and qualifications. Rather than evaluating her on her \nrecord, some have tried to claim there is an issue because Senator \nMenendez met with her before supporting her. They infer, despite \ndenials by the nominee and Senator Menendez, that she must have made \nhim some untoward commitment on how she would rule on some matter. \nThere is no basis for that claim.\n  It is past time for the Senate to consider her nomination on the \nmerits of her record and to confirm her. Her nomination has been \nstalled on the Senate floor for 13 months. This is just one example of \nthe unnecessary delays that prompted a New York Times editorial about \nthe delays in filling judicial vacancies. I ask unanimous consent that \na copy of that editorial be printed in the Record at the conclusion of \nmy statement.\n  Judged on her qualifications and her record, Judge Patty Shwartz \nshould be confirmed by an overwhelming bipartisan vote. She should not \nhave been delayed for more than a year. Sadly, this is not an isolated \ncase but one in a steady pattern of obstruction. This is especially \nharmful at a time when judicial vacancies remain above 80. Filibusters \nand delays based on fictions do not help Americans seeking justice in \nour\n\n[[Page S2479]]\n\nFederal courts. Instead, they cause delays, overcrowded dockets, \noverburdened courts and have gone on too long.\n  When confirmed, Judge Shwartz will be one of just three women serving \nas active judges on the Third Circuit. It is time to move forward in a \nbipartisan fashion to vote to confirm this qualified nominee so that \nshe may better serve the American people as a member of the United \nStates Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              State of New Jersey,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                   Trenton, NJ, February 11, 2013.\n     Senator Chuck Grassley,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Senator Patrick Leahy,\n     Russell Senate Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators:  I write in support of Magistrate Judge \n     Patty Shwartz' nomination to be a Judge on the Third Circuit \n     Court of Appeals. When I became the United States Attorney in \n     the District of New Jersey in 2001, Judge Shwartz was the \n     Chief of the Criminal Division, a very important and taxing \n     job in a large prosecuting office. Judge Shwartz was an \n     impressive Criminal Chief; hard working, bright, articulate, \n     great with people and conversant with the law. She remained \n     my Criminal Chief until she became a Magistrate Judge.\n       As a Magistrate Judge, she also performed admirably and \n     garnered the respect of the entire legal community. Again, \n     her hard work, amiable personality, patience, intelligence \n     and knowledge of the law were lauded by all who appeared \n     before her. I am sure that if she were elevated to sit on the \n     Third Circuit Court of Appeals she would prove an excellent \n     judge for all of the same reasons she was an excellent \n     prosecutor and Magistrate Judge. She has my full support for \n     the position for which I believe she is well suited.\n       If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                   Chris Christie,\n     Governor.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                       [From the New York Times]\n\n                         Courts Without Judges\n\n                        (By the Editorial Board)\n\n       The number of vacancies on the nation's federal courts has \n     reached an astonishingly high level, creating a serious \n     shortage of judges and undermining the ability of the \n     nation's court system to bestow justice.\n       Of 856 federal district and circuit court seats, 85 are \n     unfilled--a 10 percent vacancy rate and nearly double the \n     rate at this point in the presidency of George W. Bush. More \n     than a third of the vacancies have been declared ``judicial \n     emergencies'' based on court workloads and the length of time \n     the seats have been empty. By far the most important cause of \n     this unfortunate state of affairs is the determination of \n     Senate Republicans, for reasons of politics, ideology and \n     spite, to confirm as few of President Obama's judicial \n     choices as possible.\n       Numbers compiled by the Senate Judiciary Committee tell the \n     story. Mr. Obama's nominees for seats on federal courts of \n     appeal, the system's top tier below the Supreme Court, have \n     waited an average of 148 days for their confirmation vote \n     following the committee's approval, more than four times \n     longer than Mr. Bush's nominees. For Mr. Obama's nominees to \n     federal district courts, the average wait time has been 102 \n     days, compared with 35 days for Mr. Bush's district court \n     choices.\n       The prestigious and important United States Court of \n     Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit offers a \n     particularly striking example of Republican obstructionism. \n     The 11-seat court rules on most appeals from federal \n     regulatory agencies and has exclusive jurisdiction over \n     national security matters. It has four vacancies; the last \n     time the Senate confirmed someone to the court was 2006.\n       Mr. Bush appointed four judges to the court, a feeder to \n     the Supreme Court, but whether the Senate will allow Mr. \n     Obama to appoint any remains to be seen. Mr. Obama's first \n     nominee for the court, Caitlin Halligan, withdrew from \n     consideration last month after Senate Republicans \n     filibustered for a second time. Those critics echoed the \n     National Rifle Association's ridiculous portrayal of her as a \n     legal activist outside the mainstream because she had filed a \n     brief in opposition to the gun industry when she was New York \n     State's solicitor general.\n       The real reason, as everyone knows, was to prevent Mr. \n     Obama from adding balance to a generally conservative court. \n     He may fare better with his latest nominee, Sri Srinivasan, a \n     lawyer whose background working in the United States \n     solicitor general's office under both President Bush and \n     President Obama should help his chances.\n       Nominees for other important government posts have also \n     been held up for partisan reasons. Some Republicans say this \n     is simply payback for the Democrats' filibustering of Bush \n     nominees. But while neither party should be in the business \n     of obstructing judicial nominees, unless they are unqualified \n     or unacceptably extreme, a retaliatory response based on \n     politics hurts all who rely on courts to protect their rights \n     and uphold the law.\n       It is also worth noting that Mr. Obama has not been putting \n     forth candidates with strong ideological profiles. His \n     nominees are decidedly moderate, which was not always true of \n     the Bush judicial choices that the Democrats felt compelled \n     to filibuster.\n       Mr. Obama could help reduce the problem by speeding up his \n     nominations. The White House appears to have sharpened its \n     focus since the election, but currently, 62 district and \n     circuit court vacancies have no nominees.\n       The Halligan filibuster got some Democratic senators \n     talking about a bolder strategy, including revisiting \n     filibuster reform and making it harder for senators to \n     torpedo or delay nominations to judicial vacancies in their \n     home states. Another proposal is to have Mr. Obama make \n     simultaneous nominations to fill the four vacancies on the \n     District of Columbia Circuit, which would force Republicans \n     to come up with plausible reasons to oppose each of them. In \n     the face of political paralysis, these ideas are worth \n     embracing.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I see the distinguished Senator from Iowa, \nand I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today the Senate will consider the 10th \njudicial nomination this year. With today's expected action, we will \nhave confirmed four circuit and six district nominees. At this point in \n2005--and that was the beginning of President Bush's second term, \ncomparable to what we are talking about for President Obama--the Senate \nhad confirmed zero judicial nominees. Let me repeat that. At this point \nin 2005, the Senate had confirmed not 10, not 4, not even 1 judicial \nnominee, so that comes out to be zero.\n  The quick pace of this year comes on top of a very productive 112th \nCongress in which 111 judges were confirmed. In the last Congress, we \nconfirmed more judges than any other Congress--going back 20 years to \nthe 103rd Congress.\n  Despite this progress and our continued cooperation with the \nPresident and Senate Democrats, we continue to hear unfounded \ncriticism.\n  For example, last week the White House spokesperson criticized the \nSenate for what he characterized as arbitrary and unique delays in \ngetting nominees confirmed. In a previous post on its website, the \nWhite House complained about unprecedented delays in the Senate \nconfirmation process.\n  While acknowledging the Senate had confirmed nine judicial nominees \nthis year, the White House noted that ``these nine judges waited 144 \ndays for a floor vote, compared to President Bush's nominees who waited \nan average of 34 days for a vote at this point in President Bush's \npresidency.''\n  As I stated, at the same point in 2005, none of President Bush's \nnominees had been confirmed--not one.\n  The purported statistic of the ``average of 34 days'' is without \nfoundation. It took until June for President Bush to reach 10 judicial \nconfirmations. President Bush wouldn't have another lower court \nnomination until October of that year.\n  But that delay in confirmations wasn't because there weren't \nnominees. By the beginning of April 2005, 21 judicial nominations had \nbeen submitted to the Senate.\n  President Bush's first four confirmations came in April 2005. The \nfirst two of those nominees were nominated in September 2004 and \nconfirmed about 6 months later.\n  The other two nominees waited much longer. Robert Conrad was first \nnominated April 28, 2003 to the Western District of North Carolina.\n  He was confirmed a full 2 years later on April 28, 2005--not 34 days, \nas the White House implies.\n  His colleague, James C. Dever III, nominated for the Eastern District \nof North Carolina, waited even longer. He was first nominated in May \n2002 and waited nearly 3 years before being confirmed on April 28, \n2005.\n  So this notion of unprecedented, unique and arbitrary delays simply \nignores the facts and, in the process, distorts history.\n  In addition to the White House, we hear Senate Democrats grumbling \nabout nominations and calls for changing the rules of the Senate. Of \ncourse, the majority would have to break the rules to change the rules.\n  Such intemperate comments utterly fail to recognize the work the \nSenate has already accomplished in approving judges.\n  The purported justification is the number of judges on the calendar--\n\n[[Page S2480]]\n\npresently at 15. Where was their similar concern in April 2004, when \nthe number of nominees on the Executive Calendar was nearly double what \nit is today?\n  A second prong of this debate concerns the vacancy rate in the \nFederal judiciary. Blaming judicial vacancies on the Senate \nconfirmation process is unfounded and a distortion of the process. The \nvacancy rate is due to the failure in the White House to send \nnominations to the Senate.\n  Presently, 62 of the 87 vacancies--71 percent--have no nominee. For \nthe 35 vacancies categorized as ``judicial emergencies,'' only 9 have a \nnominee--74 percent have no nominee.\n  I would like to say a few words about today's nominee. I do have \nconcerns about this nomination which have not been satisfied.\n  Unfortunately, I am unable to support the nomination, although I \nexpect Judge Shwartz will be approved as a United States Circuit Judge \nfor the Third Circuit. I congratulate her on her confirmation and hope \nthat she performs her duties in a skilled manner, demonstrating \njudicial temperament, with respect for the law and Constitution.\n  This nomination started out troubled. Not because of Republican \nopposition, but because of concerns expressed by her home State \nDemocratic Senator.\n  Originally, Judge Shwartz's home State Senator questioned her \nintellectual fitness for the court stating she ``did not adequately \ndemonstrate the breadth of knowledge of constitutional law and pivotal \nSupreme Court decisions.''\n  Concerns were also expressed that she ``misapplied the application of \nstrict scrutiny versus rational basis review'' and ``did not express \nsubstantive knowledge as to the scope of the rights of corporations \nunder the Constitution or jurisprudence on the constitutional limits of \nExecutive Branch powers.'' According to press reports, she specifically \nmisapplied the law after speaking about Citizens United.\n  These are pretty serious issues. So, Judge Shwartz was asked about \nthem during her hearing, specifically the discussion on Citizens \nUnited. But she denied it happened, testifying instead that she did not \ndiscuss any specific cases, only general principles.\n  However, in follow-up written questions for the record, Judge Shwartz \nchanged her story and said that she and her home State Senator had \ndiscussed two specific cases: Citizens United and Roe v. Wade.\n  I find this after-the-fact disclosure troubling. Not only was it \ninconsistent with her hearing testimony, but it prevented me and other \nSenators from following up regarding what discussions she apparently \nhad regarding Citizens United and Roe v. Wade.\n  Because of the ambiguity surrounding these interviews and Judge \nShwartz's inconsistent testimony, questions remain as to what \nunderstandings were reached or what assurances Judge Shwartz may have \ngiven to gain support from her home State Senators.\n  Unfortunately, her Committee hearing failed to remove the doubts that \nwere initially raised. Again, these were raised by her home State \nSenator.\n  Furthermore, because of her lack of candor at her hearing, I was \nunable to come to a determination that she is prepared to be a Circuit \nJudge. I share the doubts raised regarding her limited knowledge of \nconstitutional law; misapplication of standards of review; and \ninadequate understanding of substantive areas of laws.\n  Accordingly, I cannot support this nomination. I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record her biographical information.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Patty Shwartz is nominated to be United States Circuit \n     Judge for the Third Circuit. Judge Shwartz received a B.A \n     from Rutgers in 1983 and a J.D. from the University of \n     Pennsylvania Law School in 1986. Upon graduation, Judge \n     Shwartz worked for a year as an associate with the law firm \n     of Pepper, Hamilton & Scheetz. In 1987, Judge Shwartz began a \n     two-year clerkship with Judge Harold A. Ackerman of the U.S. \n     District Court of the District of New Jersey.\n       Immediately after her clerkship, she began a fourteen-year \n     career as a criminal prosecutor with the U.S. Attorney's \n     Office for the District of New Jersey. During her time as an \n     Assistant U.S. Attorney, she prosecuted individuals for \n     violent crime, drug trafficking, and white collar cases. \n     After several years, she was assigned to the Special \n     Prosecutions Division, handling public corruption cases. A \n     short time later, Judge Shwartz was promoted to Deputy Chief \n     of the Criminal Division where she supervised dozens of line \n     prosecutors. In February of 1999, she was promoted to Chief \n     of the Criminal Division, which she held until 2001.\n       In 2001, she began a brief stint as Executive Assistant \n     U.S. Attorney, supervising the Criminal, Civil, and Fraud \n     Divisions. In 2002, she returned to serve as Chief of the \n     Criminal Division, overseeing the expansion and \n     reorganization of the division. According to her \n     questionnaire, Judge Shwartz has tried more than fifteen \n     criminal cases to verdict.\n       In 2003, Judge Shwartz was appointed to be U.S. Magistrate \n     Judge for the District of New Jersey. As Magistrate Judge, \n     she has managed all aspects of the pre-trial process in over \n     4,000 cases. She is responsible for convening scheduling \n     conferences, resolving discovery disputes, ruling on \n     nondispositive motions, holding settlement conferences, and \n     presiding over final pretrial conferences.\n       As Magistrate, Judge Shwartz has presided over ``in whole \n     or in part'' more than 70 civil cases by consent of the \n     parties. She has presided over eleven jury trials (ten civil \n     cases and one criminal case) and twenty-two bench trials \n     (three civil cases and nineteen criminal cases) from start to \n     finish.\n       The American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the \n     Federal Judiciary gave her a unanimous ``Well Qualified'' \n     rating.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection. The Senator from New Jersey \nis recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise in support of the \nconfirmation of Judge Patty Shwartz to the Third Circuit Court of \nAppeals, a nomination which has finally come to the floor, and the time \nhas come to confirm Judge Shwartz. I express my full support and urge \nmy colleagues to do the same. I am happy we were able to work out the \nvote on this nominee without a cloture vote, which is incredibly \nimportant.\n  I want to refer to my distinguished colleague, the ranking member of \nthe Judiciary Committee, who mentioned a home State Senator--who \nhappens to be me--and to clarify some issues.\n  I have always taken the role of advice and consent for judicial \nnominations very seriously, as I am sure we all do. Appointments to the \nFederal bench are lifetime appointments, and the circuit court is often \nthe last stop before the U.S. Supreme Court. That makes that \nresponsibility even greater. Very few Americans, if they appeal, get \npast the circuit court to Supreme Court consideration.\n  We know the process can be long and difficult; sometimes overly \npartisan on both sides based on legitimate concerns and personal \nbeliefs. In the end we always look to confirm the best and most \nqualified individuals. We conduct a thorough review of the nominees, \ntheir understanding of the law, their intellect, their analytical \nthinking and reasoning, and we make our decisions--and I have made \nmine--about the nominee.\n  I had the opportunity on more than one occasion to discuss with the \njudge issues that I believe reflect the high standards to which a \nnominee should always be held. There is no understanding between this \nnominee and me as to how she would rule in any given set of \ncircumstances. There was a suggestion about what the law is today in \nboth those instances. I am sure the judge simply did not recall the \nspecifics of that at the time of the hearing but was forthright in \ncoming back and saying: Yes, there were two cases. The simple \ndiscussion of what is a Supreme Court decision is, in my mind, not only \nappropriate, but at a circuit court level is more than desirable.\n  In the totality of our discussions Judge Shwartz indicated to me the \ntype of intellectual rigor, the knowledge that in fact guarantees to me \nthat she deserves the lifetime appointment to which I expect the Senate \nwill confirm her. The fact that I come to the floor today in full \nsupport of her confirmation speaks not only to her qualifications but \nto her character and to her judicial temperament and suitability to \nserve on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Aristotle said: ``Character may be called the most effective means of \npersuasion.''\n  I can say that, having spent time meeting with Judge Shwartz, I am \nabsolutely persuaded that she is a person of character and meets the \nhighest standards for any nominee.\n\n[[Page S2481]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to unanimously confirm this highly qualified \nwoman who, I know, will serve honorably and serve well.\n  Judge Patty Shwartz is a proud New Jerseyan. She has been a \nmagistrate judge for the District of New Jersey since 2003.\n  Originally from Paterson, she graduated from Rutgers as a Henry \nRutgers Scholar with the highest honors.\n  After college, Judge Shwartz went to the University of Pennsylvania \nLaw School, edited the law review, and was named Outstanding Woman Law \nGraduate.\n  She has been an associate in Philadelphia at Pepper, Hamilton & \nScheetz, clerked for the Honorable Harold A. Ackerman of the District \nCourt for the District of New Jersey, and, in 1989 joined the U.S. \nAttorney's Office for the District of New Jersey.\n  She rose to the position of deputy chief of the criminal division and \nthen to chief of the criminal division serving as the Executive \nAssistant United States Attorney.\n  She has handled over 4,000 civil and criminal cases, and, since 2009, \nshe has been an adjunct professor at Fordham University School of Law.\n  She is on the advisory board for the Association of the Federal Bar \nof the State of New Jersey, the Board of Advisors for the Historical \nSociety of the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, and \nthe Board of Directors of the Federal Magistrate Judges Association, \nwhere she represents the Third Circuit.\n  She is clearly highly qualified--a woman of distinction who deserves \nconfirmation.\n  If experience, character, and temperament are the most persuasive \nweapons in a judicial nominee's arsenal, then Judge Shwartz comes \nbefore this chamber very well-armed.\n  Let me say to my colleagues who may not have had the opportunity to \nlook as closely at this nominee's record as I have, in making my \njudgment I have had the benefit of invaluable advice and counsel from \nmany members of the Federal bar whose opinions I sought. They are both \nDemocrats and Republicans, and they affirmed what I subsequently \ndiscovered for myself in discussions with her; that there is not a \nsingle reason to vote no on this nomination.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to send a message that although the process can \nbe long and fraught with conflicting opinions, in the end it bends \ntoward the best and brightest, and Judge Patty Shwartz is proof of it.\n  She has strong bipartisan support not only from both the Senators \nfrom New Jersey but also our Governor Chris Christie. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in voting to confirm Judge Patty Shwartz to the \nThird Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, it is my great honor to once again \nexpress my strong support for the Senate confirmation of Magistrate \nJudge Patty Shwartz to the United States Third Circuit Court of \nAppeals.\n  It has been a long road, but it's great to finally reach this day. I \nbegan the process of recommending Judge Shwartz to President Obama \nalmost 2 years ago, and since her first nomination by the President 18 \nmonths ago I have had the privilege of shepherding her candidacy \nthrough the Senate. During that time, I have worked with colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle to ensure she has bipartisan support. And \nearlier this year, I personally communicated with a number of my \nRepublicans colleagues to assure them of her qualifications for the \nposition and sterling reputation in the legal community.\n  It hasn't been an easy or quick process by any means, but because her \ncandidacy is so strong, and because so many people believe in her, we \nhave reached this proud moment where we can confirm her, and without a \nfilibuster.\n  Her confirmation is well-deserved, because putting Judge Patty \nShwartz on the Federal bench will be a great service to our nation and \nour justice system. She brings 25 years of public service to the \nbench--years she spent as a teacher, an attorney, and a judge.\n  Judge Shwartz graduated from Rutgers University with the highest \nhonors and received her law degree from the University of Pennsylvania \nLaw School, where she was an editor of the Law Review and was named her \nclass's Outstanding Woman Law Graduate.\n  Since 2003, Judge Shwartz has served as a U.S. Magistrate Judge in \nthe District of New Jersey, where she has handled more than 4,000 civil \nand criminal cases. And within the New Jersey legal community, she has \nearned a solid reputation for dispensing justice fairly and wisely.\n  She will make an excellent addition to the Third Circuit Court of \nAppeals.\n  The opportunity to nominate Federal judges is a sacred duty. I have \nfelt lucky to recommend many eminently qualified, impressive, and \naccomplished individuals.\n  Yet rarely have I seen such an outpouring of support for a single \njudicial candidate as I have with Judge Shwartz.\n  John Lacey, past President of the Association of the New Jersey \nFederal Bar, said Judge Shwartz is, ``thoughtful, intelligent, and has \nan extraordinarily high level of common sense.''\n  Thomas Curtin, the chairman of the lawyers' advisory committee for \nthe U.S. District Court of New Jersey, said, ``Every lawyer in the \nworld will tell you that she's extraordinarily qualified, a decent \nperson, and an excellent judge.''\n  And seldom has someone had such a distinguished career working for--\nand earning the respect of--people on both sides of the aisle.\n  From 1989 to 2003, Judge Shwartz served in the U.S. Attorney's Office \nfor the District of New Jersey. In this role, she supervised hundreds \nof criminal cases, including cases concerning civil rights, violent \ncrimes, drug trafficking, and fraud.\n  And in the U.S. Attorney's Office, she served under three Republican \nU.S. Attorneys: current Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito; former \nSecretary of Homeland Security under George W. Bush, Michael Chertoff; \nand New Jersey's current Governor, Chris Christie.\n  Governor Christie has been especially outspoken in his praise of \nJudge Shwartz. He has said, ``Judge Patty Shwartz has committed her \nentire professional life to public service, and New Jersey is the \nbetter for it.''\n  That is his statement. Now, if Governor Christie and I agree on \nsomething so adamantly, you know it's right.\n  Judge Shwartz's roots in New Jersey run deep. Like me, she is a \nnative of Paterson, NJ, where she learned the value of hard work from \nher parents, who owned and operated a store for more than 50 years.\n  And as anyone who has met or worked with Judge Shwartz can attest, \nshe inherited every ounce of her parents' strong work ethic--and then \nsome.\n  After years of hard work, today is a great and triumphant day. I look \nforward now to seeing Judge Patty Shwartz take her place on the Federal \nbench. I can say with certainty that our justice system--and the \ncountry--will be better for it.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican whip.\n\n\n                     Stabbing at Lone Star College\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I have a couple matters I wish to \ndiscuss, but before I get to that, we have been advised--through the \nnews media--that there have been multiple victims who have been injured \nduring a stabbing attack at the Lone Star College CyFair campus in \nTexas. One person has been taken into custody.\n  Unfortunately, this is the second time, in a short period of time, \nthat the Lone Star College campus has been struck with acts of \nsenseless violence, and I think it is appropriate to say here and now \nthat our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families. \nWe hope law enforcement does its typically good job and finds those \nresponsible to make sure those who are responsible are prosecuted to \nthe fullest extent of the law.\n\n\n                            Border Security\n\n  Madam President, I wish to remind my colleagues that if they don't \nknow where they are going, then they will probably never know when they \nget there. Stated another way: If you don't measure the size of a \nproblem, you will never know how close or how far you are away from \nsolving it. It seems like common sense. But since 2010, the Department \nof Homeland Security has used the metric or the measuring stick of \noperational control to determine how successful it is about detaining \nthose who cross our southwestern border illegally. This is a matter of \nbasic public safety since we know drug cartels, human traffickers, and \nother criminals regularly exploit this porous southwestern border in \norder to do their dastardly deeds.\n  For some reason, the Department of Homeland Security has dropped this \nmetric or measuring stick of operational control altogether, and so far \nthey have yet to replace it with some other measuring stick or some \nother way to determine how successful or unsuccessful they have been. \nIt has literally been 3 years since the Department of Homeland Security \nhas had a functional measurement of border security.\n  Again, this is about public safety. This is about deterring and \nstopping criminals and others who come across the border to deal in \ndrugs or in human lives. During this same time period, the Government \nAccountability Office has reported that the Department of Homeland \nSecurity had achieved operational control--this was about 3 years ago--\nof less than 45 percent of the southwestern border.\n  The Los Angeles Times wrote a story recently that showed between \nOctober 2012 and January of 2013, the Department of Homeland Security \nfailed to apprehend at least 50 percent of the people who attempted to \ncross the border without proper paperwork; in other words, illegal \nborder crossers.\n  I think, by any measure, whether one is a Democrat or Republican, \nIndependent, no matter what your political stripes, this is \nunacceptable, and we need to do better.\n  Earlier today, I introduced legislation that would require the \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials to verify how much \noperational security we actually have along our borders. The Border \nSecurity Results Act of 2013 would also require the Department of \nHomeland Security to develop a comprehensive strategy--something we \nhave been missing for a long time--for achieving operational control of \nevery single border sector.\n  My State has 1,200 miles of common border with Mexico. We know that \nmuch of the illegal activity does not even start in Mexico but comes up \nthrough Central America. People around the world know that if they can \nget to Central America and pay the human smugglers enough, they can \nmake their way into the United States. Even though we have beefed up \nthe Border Patrol, the Department of Homeland Security, and applied new \ndetection techniques so our border is more secure than it was, last \nyear alone 360,000 people were detained by coming across the southern \nborder. If we believe the Los Angeles Times story, which I think rings \ntrue, at least twice that many people actually tried--half were \ndetained, half made it across.\n  This bill would define operational control as a threshold in which \nU.S. authorities in a given sector are apprehending at least 90 percent \nof the people who are coming across, and it would require the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to gain full situational awareness \nthrough technology, boots on the ground, and results-based metrics.\n\n  Metrics is just a fancy word. It is a measuring stick. It is a \nyardstick. Not only do we need to talk about the numbers, we need to \ntalk about the very human tragedy associated with these numbers and \ninadequate border security.\n  As I said, a porous United States-Mexican border also encourages drug \nand sex traffickers, including all sorts of criminals who prey on \nchildren, the weak, and the vulnerable. By gaining operational control \nof our borders, we can save lives and protect innocent human life.\n  We can also safeguard the basic property rights and civil rights of \npeople who live along the border while we respect those who play by the \nrules and who are now trying to pursue their American dream as legal \nimmigrants to the United States. This is not designed to deter people \nwho want to play by the rules and who want to enter this country to \nwork and provide for their family according to the law of the land and \nseek to achieve their American dream.\n\n[[Page S2483]]\n\n  This is also not an alternative to fixing our broken immigration \nsystem, but it is complementary of the work being done of the so-called \nGang of 8--four Republicans and four Democratic Senators--as well as \nHouse negotiators who are trying to work out just exactly what border \nsecurity actually means, how to measure it, and how to know if the \nDepartment of Homeland Security is doing the job. Even as we debate the \nlarger issue of Homeland Security, everyone, Democrat and Republican \nalike, believes this is an essential component of a comprehensive bill.\n  In short, we should be doing everything possible to encourage the \ntype of legal immigration that benefits our economy and our broader \nsociety while discouraging and deterring illegal entry into the \ncountry, which unfortunately, is being exploited by drug cartels, human \ntraffickers, and other criminals.\n  The United States-Mexico relationship is about far more than just \nimmigration security. This is not limited to just Mexico. This is very \nimportant. Mexico is our third largest trading partner. There are 6 \nmillion jobs in America that depend on cross-border traffic and trade \nwith the country of Mexico. By the way, their economy is growing at a \nmuch faster rate than ours. It is something we can look at and be \nenvious of and hopefully we can ultimately emulate.\n  The health and success of Mexico's economy is important to the \neconomy of the United States for the reason I just mentioned. There are \nnow millions of jobs which depend on trade with our southern neighbor, \nincluding hundreds of thousands of jobs in my State of Texas alone. \nUnfortunately, our land ports of entry along the United States-Mexican \nborder have not kept pace with the rapid expansion of bilateral \neconomic ties, and they are suffering from both inadequate \ninfrastructure and inadequate staffing. Wait times at the border for \npeople who are playing by the rules and trying to enter the country \nlegally have grown unacceptably long.\n  The Border Security Results Act would help mitigate this problem by \nrequiring the Department of Homeland Security to devise a plan to \nreduce the wait times by at least 50 percent. I might add, when we \nthink about security and the economy, these go hand in glove because \nthe very same people who are working to provide security from illegal \nentry are the very same ones often facilitating legitimate trade and \ncommerce. By reducing wait times at the United States-Mexican border, \nwe would facilitate greater bilateral trade and faster job creation on \nboth sides of the Rio Grande River. That is just one additional reason \nthat the Border Security Results Act deserves to become law as soon as \npossible.\n  Again, on this point, this is entirely complementary of the work and \nnegotiations that are taking place now in the Senate among the Gang of \n8, who will report to us any day now on their framework and how they \nthink we ought to move forward on the immigration issue. But until we \nregain the public's confidence that the Federal Government is doing its \njob at this international border in terms of legitimate trade, \ndeterring common criminals, and drug and human traffickers, then I \ndoubt our chances for success on the larger issue are very good.\n\n\n                        President Obama's Budget\n\n  Before I conclude, I wish to say a few words about President Obama's \nbudget request. As we all know, the due date for the President's budget \nwas February 4. One might say: February 4 has long passed. That is \ncorrect. It was the day after the Super Bowl. But here we are 2 months \nlater, and the President has defied the requirements of the law which \nsays the President must submit his proposed budget the first Monday of \nFebruary.\n  Unfortunately, he is the first President in modern history not only \nto have failed that deadline but to see the Senate and the House \nactually move forward with our respective budgets before the White \nHouse releases its own.\n  If the President, who is obviously the leader of the free world and \nCommander in Chief of the United States military, wants to be relevant \nto the largest, most important domestic issue facing this country, \nwhich is how to get control of our debt and deficit and how to get the \nAmerican Government to live within its means, I cannot think of \nanything more likely calculated to lead to his irrelevancy than to wait \nuntil the House and the Senate have already dealt with our budgets and \nsubmit his budget. That is what has happened.\n\n  Tomorrow is the big day when we finally get to see the President's \nbudget proposal. According to some press reports, we already have an \nidea of what is in it. For one thing, the President's budget will not \nbalance. It is not a balanced budget. The President likes to talk about \nbalance when discussing economic matters. Well, the President's budget \ndoesn't balance in 10 years or in 20 years or ever. What it will do, we \nare told, is increase spending by hundreds of billions of dollars--\nmoney we simply don't have. Right now the Federal Government is \nspending roughly 25 cents out of every dollar, of money we have to \nborrow from China or other creditors, just to pay to keep the \ngovernment operating at its current level.\n  We are also told the President's budget would impose hundreds of \nbillions of dollars in new taxes--this is after, on January 1, the \nPresident signed into law a $600 billion tax increase as a result of \nthe fiscal cliff negotiations. Meanwhile, the President's budget would \nmake it harder for Americans to save for their own retirement. I find \nthat bewildering. Why in the world would the President want to \ndiscourage the American people from saving for their own retirement, \nparticularly at a time when he has done nothing to shore up Social \nSecurity or Medicare, which seniors rely upon. So if the Federal \nGovernment is not going to do that--in other words, not going to do its \njob of shoring up Social Security and Medicare--why in the world would \nwe further discourage people from saving on their own?\n  Indeed, from what we have heard, this budget is filled with the same \nsorts of tax and spend policies the President has been promoting since \nday one. I will give him credit--the President has been consistent \nthroughout. Our country can't afford that kind of policy, not when we \nare suffering from the longest period of high unemployment since the \nGreat Depression and not when millions of Americans have been jobless \nfor more than 6 months.\n  I would remind colleagues that President Obama has presided over an \neconomy where half a million Americans left the workforce last month, \nbringing our labor force participation rate down to a 34-month low. \nWhat does that mean? Well, it means people have given up. People have \nbeen out of work so long--even though the unemployment rate has hovered \naround 8 percent, then 7.7, 7.6, the only reason it has come down is \nbecause hundreds of thousands of Americans have given up looking for \nwork, so they have taken them out of that calculation, which actually \ngives a false impression of the unemployment rate decreasing. But we \nall know the economy is growing very slowly--.6 percent the last \nquarter. It needs to grow 3 and 4 percent for our economy to take off \nand create the private sector jobs that are important to get Americans \nback to work.\n  The President of the United States may truly believe his proposed \nbudget represents a compromise, but in the real world it does \nabsolutely nothing to address our biggest long-term fiscal problems, \nincluding Medicare, which, for every dollar a typical Medicare \nbeneficiary has put into the system, they draw down $3. That is \nunsustainable. The President's proposed budget contains, again, another \nmassive tax increase even though President Obama has already presided \nover a Federal Government that has raised taxes on the American people \nby $1.7 trillion.\n  Last week White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said the President's \nbudget ``is not what he would do if he were king.'' Well, we haven't \nhad a king in a long time--never in this country--and I can only assume \nCarney meant President Obama would like to raise taxes even more if he \ncould and increase spending even more if he could and do even less if \nhe could to reform our vital programs, such as Social Security and \nMedicare.\n  In so many ways this budget sounds more like a PR stunt than actually \nbeing designed to address the Nation's biggest challenges. It may help \nthe\n\n[[Page S2484]]\n\nPresident secure favorable media coverage, but it fails to offer \nserious solutions to America's biggest long-term challenges.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Donnelly). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I know that pending is the firearms \nlegislation, which America is watching very closely, and which we will \nspeak to at length as we proceed to this measure. I, of course, will \ncome to the floor at that time to address some of the issues which were \nbrought up in the Senate Judiciary Committee. One of the bills that is \nbeing brought forward under this firearms act is one related to straw \npurchases--purchases by an individual who can legally purchase a gun so \nthat firearm can be given to someone who could not because of a felony \nconviction, for example, or perhaps mental instability.\n  Those third-party purchases--straw purchases--have become the scourge \nof many communities. One of them is the city of Chicago, IL, which I \nrepresent. We found that about 9 percent of the crime guns confiscated \nin Chicago over the last 10 years came from the State of Mississippi--\nMississippi. So how did those guns get from Mississippi to the mean \nstreets and alleys and backways in Chicago? Well, some people decided \nthey could make some money by filling up the trunk of a car with easily \npurchased guns in Mississippi, driving up to Chicago, and selling them \nto gangbangers and thugs and drug kingpins in some dark alley late at \nnight. That is a profitable business for some, but it has proliferated \nfirearms and weapons in the city of Chicago to a level that many people \nfind incredible.\n  Our superintendent of police, Garry McCarthy, came to Chicago from \nthe New York City area. He learned that the per capita possession of \nfirearms in the city of Chicago--per capita--is roughly six times what \nit is in the city of New York--six times more firearms. We are awash, \nflooded with these firearms, and most of them, virtually all of them, \nare coming in from outside the city--9 percent from Mississippi, 20 \npercent from one firearms dealer in the suburbs of Chicago.\n  Well, I can tell you these guns are not being purchased by end users \nin most instances. They are being purchased by girlfriends, by \npartners, those who could clear a background check and buy a gun and \nhand it over to someone else who commits a crime.\n  One of the provisions in the firearms bill that I authored with \nSenator Kirk, Senator Collins, Gillibrand, and, of course, our \nchairman, Patrick Leahy, relates to whether we are going to throw the \nbook at those who purchase guns with the knowledge or reasonable belief \nthat they are going to prohibited purchasers or to be used in the \ncommission of a crime; and we do. The penalty starts at 15 years of \nhard time. In Chicago at a press conference we said: Girlfriend, think \ntwice. Is he worth it? Is he worth 15 years behind bars for you to go \nbuy that gun in the suburbs, hand it over to that gangbanger who kills \nsomebody that night?\n  That is what folks have to put into their calculation of whether they \nare going to take that risk. That is one of the provisions in this \nfirearms bill. I would like to think everybody would agree with this \nprovision. Unless one happens to be in that rare group of Americans who \nbelieve selling firearms in volume, no matter whom they are sold to, is \nthe best thing for our country, then they have to agree that clamping \ndown with Federal hard time for those who make straw purchases is a \ngood idea. I think it is. It is the lead measure in this firearms bill \nthat will come before us.\n  There are other measures in there that have been somewhat more \ncontroversial, and we will come to them during the course of the \ndebate. But I have asked for this time as in morning business to speak \nto two unrelated issues, not to diminish the importance of the firearms \nbill, which I have spoken to already, but to speak to two other issues \nwhich I hope will be taken up seriously by the Senate soon.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Durbin pertaining to the introduction of S. 673 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n\n                          For-Profit Colleges\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have come to the floor many times to \ntalk about for-profit schools. It is another consumer issue. It is a \nvery serious one. I come to the floor to describe to my colleagues and \nput on the record of the Senate some of the things that are taking \nplace across America today that I think are nothing short of \noutrageous, things that we can stop--we have the power to stop in the \nSenate.\n  Let me tell the story of Sharon LoMonaco. Sharon is a 65-year-old \nwoman who is on Social Security and in debt because of her student \nloans. Sharon attended the Art Institute of Pittsburgh, a for-profit \ncollege owned by Education Management Corporation. Sharon saw a \ncommercial and was attracted to the school and called them. Then the \nrecruiter at the school kept calling and calling her until she finally \nagreed to sign up. Sharon says the recruiter acted as if he were her \nbest friend, told her everything would be great, and then practically \nfilled out her financial aid forms for her. She ended signing up for \n$55,000 in loans, to the Art Institute of Pittsburgh.\n  She started the program and started to question almost immediately \nthe quality of the education she was receiving. But she stayed in \nschool--that is, she stayed until her money ran out. Sharon received a \nPell grant, which is a grant given to low-income individuals in America \nto go to college, but she had also exhausted her Federal student aid \neligibility. She was borrowing money even while she was putting the \nPell grant into the cost of her education. She could not get any more \nFederal loans and could not qualify for private student loans. She had \nno choice--she had to drop out of the Art Institute of Pittsburgh. She \nnow attends a community college and is trying to finish her degree \nthere. For now her loans are deferred, but every day, she wakes up and \nworries about what will happen when the day comes and she will have to \nstart to pay them back.\n  Unfortunately, Sharon is not alone. Every week, former for-profit \ncollege students who attended one of the schools like the Art Institute \nof Pittsburgh that are run by the EDMC corporation find they are \ndrowning in debt and contact our office. We have invited them to tell \nus their stories.\n  Let me talk a little bit more about the type of business EDMC runs--\nthat stands for the Education Management Corporation. It received over \n77 percent of its total revenue from Federal student aid programs. \nHowever, according to a 2012 HELP Committee report Senator Tom Harkin \nfiled, if all Federal aid is included--that means counting GI Bill \nfunds, Department of Defense tuition assistance money--EDMC receives 80 \npercent of its total revenue from the Federal Government. This is not a \nbusiness, this is an outlet for Federal taxpayers' dollars to subsidize \na private company. Eighty percent of its revenue comes in the form of a \ncheck from the Federal Government.\n  It is only 20 percent away from being a total Federal agency, but, \nbelieve me, the salaries that are paid and the profits that are taken \nby this so-called private sector company would not even be considered \nat the Federal level.\n  For-profit colleges received $32 billion in Federal student aid funds \nin the 2010-2011 academic year. This might seem like a good investment \nfor the Federal Government to make--that is, if students were actually \nlearning, graduating, and getting jobs in their chosen fields and \npaying off their loans. They are not. Over 23 percent of the students \nwho attended the Art Institute of Pittsburgh are going to default on \ntheir student loans within 3 years.\n  Sharon LoMonaco is not alone. More and more older Americans are in \ndebt either because they went to school later in life or, in a gesture \nof kindness, cosigned costly private student loans for their children \nor grandchildren. According to the Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau, outstanding student loan debt now tops $1\n\n[[Page S2485]]\n\ntrillion in America. These are people who were retired and planning to \nlive a life of comfort. They cannot anymore. A grandmother cosigns a \ngranddaughter's student loan for her, the granddaughter defaults, and \nthey are now collecting and garnishing grandma's Social Security check. \nIn Sharon's case, she worries her Social Security check will be \ngarnished in the future.\n  While other types of household debt continue to decline, there is one \nthat does not: student loan debt. Between 2004 and 2012, there was a \n70-percent increase in the average amount being borrowed for college. \nBorrowers like Sharon, clearly over the age of 30, make up 67 percent \nof the total outstanding student loan debt.\n  There are some for-profit colleges that are doing the right thing--\neducating students to succeed in the workforce--but there are other bad \nactors, such as EDMC, that continue to spend a large portion of their \nrevenue on marketing rather than educating. This committee report from \nthe HELP Committee in the Senate found last year that for-profit \ncolleges spent an average of 22 percent of their revenue on marketing \nand recruiting. One particular school we looked at today is trying to \nhold out that it is educating and training members of the military. It \nturns out they have hundreds of recruiters trying to get military \nfamilies to sign up and 1 job placement counselor. You know what their \npriorities are: Sign them up and get their money.\n  Congress needs to raise the standards for for-profit colleges and \nstop this unrestricted flow of funds to these schools that are failing \ntheir students.\n  I have been giving these speeches on the floor for some time now. \nSenator Harkin of Iowa, who is the chairman of the HELP Committee, has \nhad extensive investigations of these for-profit schools. Some of them \nare struggling. Their share value has gone down. They are not making \nmoney the way they used to. But they are still very much in business.\n  What we should remember is what I have told folks are the three most \nimportant numbers:\n  Twelve. Twelve percent of all college students go to for-profit \nschools. University of Phoenix, Kaplan, DeVry, EDMC--12 percent go to \nthese for-profit schools. These for-profit schools take out over $30 \nbillion a year in Federal aid to education. Twelve percent of the \nstudents, and they take 25 percent of all of the Federal aid to \neducation. They know where the money is. They are grabbing it as fast \nas they can. Forty-seven is the third number you ought to remember. \nForty-seven percent of the student loan defaults are students and their \nfamilies from for-profit schools.\n  Many of these schools are just plain worthless. Some of the students \ncould never tell.\n  They say: Well, Senator, wait a minute, if you are giving Federal \nPell grants to these schools, then isn't the Federal Government \nacknowledging the school is a good school?\n  Sadly, that is an in escapable conclusion, a wrong one. They are not \ngood schools. Yet we continue to allow them to tap into Federal funds. \nOh, there are exceptions. Some of them do train people for good jobs. \nBut too many of them are worthless.\n  These poor students, high school students are inundated with all of \nthis advertising and marketing to go to those for-profit schools. They \nare lured into it. There was a commercial that used to run on \ntelevision here in Washington. I think they finally pulled it off the \nair. It showed this lovely young girl. She was in her pajamas in her \nbedroom with her computer on the bed. She said: I am going to college \nin my pajamas. It was an advertisement for a for-profit school.\n  I do not want to suggest that online education is a bad thing. I \nthink it can be a good thing. But this notion that you can go to school \nso easily and come up with a valuable degree is one that people ought \nto stop and think about. What we know now is that many students who do \nnot know which way to turn coming out of high school would be well \nadvised to go first to a community college. It is local. It is \naffordable. It offers a lot of options. You can learn a lot about \nyourself and what you might want to be when you grow up and do it \nwithout going deeply in debt.\n  What we are discovering is more and more students are signing up for \ndebt they do not comprehend well. What does it say when a student has \nto borrow $20,000 a year to get an undergraduate degree, or $80,000 in \ndebt for 4 years? Is it worth it? Many students are starting to ask \nthis question.\n  When I grew up college was a given. Go to college; it is the only way \nto succeed.\n  Now students are asking the hard questions. Is it worth that much \ndebt? Will it really help me that much? There are questions which need \nto be asked and answered. Sometimes these questions are being answered \nby young people who have had no experience in the world. They have not \nyet borrowed money for anything. Perhaps their parents never attended a \ncollege or any institution of higher education. They are excited about \ngoing to college and sign on the paper because they don't want to miss \na class. The next thing they realize is they are stuck in these \nschools.\n  After a period of time, possibly 4 or 5 years later, some may \nactually finish in these for-profit schools only to discover their \ndiplomas are worthless and cannot help them secure a job.\n  A young lady went to Westwood College, one of the most notorious for-\nprofit schools in the Chicagoland area, for 5 years. She completed a \nlaw enforcement degree from Westwood. There wasn't a single employer \nwho would recognize her degree when she went out into the real world.\n  Where is she now? She is living in her parents' basement. This is the \nonly place she may reside because she is $85,000 in debt to Westwood \nCollege for a worthless diploma. This isn't fair.\n  We need to do a better job at the Federal level in accreditation to \nensure these schools are worth their tuition. Secondly, we need to \ndemand full disclosure in terms of how much their education costs. What \nkind of debt obligation is the student incurring? What is the \nlikelihood they will get a job? How many of these students are dropping \nout and defaulting on their loans long before graduation?\n  These are important questions which need to be asked and answered. It \nis tough. This is an industry which is politically well connected and \nput themselves in a favored position in the bankruptcy court--through \nfriends in the U.S. Congress. They wish to protect their profitmaking, \neven at the expense of a lot of these students and their families.\n  We can do better. We need to establish standards which restore the \nconfidence of American families and these future students in the \ninstitutions they attend.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Murphy). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               ObamaCare\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor as someone who has \njust traveled around my home State of Wyoming for the last couple \nweeks, talking to people, listening to what they have to say. I do it \nas a doctor as well as a Senator, but people there know me as a doctor \nbecause I practiced medicine in Wyoming for 25 years, taking care of \nfamilies from all around the State. So it is not surprising that in \nevery town I visit, people ask me what is happening with regard to the \nPresident's health care law.\n  People around Wyoming continue to be very worried--worried that there \nis going to be a new layer of Washington between them and their doctor. \nPeople don't want anyone between them and their doctor, not an \ninsurance company bureaucrat, not a Washington bureaucrat. So families \nare worried they are not going to be able to keep the insurance they \nhave now and maybe insurance that works pretty well for them--insurance \nthey like, they want, and they can afford. But they are concerned they \nare not going to be able to keep what they have.\n\n[[Page S2486]]\n\n  Employers are also worried. They are worried they are not going to be \nable to afford the health care mandates under the President's health \ncare law.\n  That is what I heard as I traveled around the State. I will be back \nin Wyoming again this weekend, traveling to a number of communities, \nand I expect I will hear the same thing this weekend. I am sure Members \nof the Senate have heard concerns similar to this from people all \naround their home State, as they visited around and listened to the \nvoters over the last couple weeks.\n  While we were out hearing from folks and families back home, there \nhas actually been a lot in the national news the last couple weeks \nmaking the very same points I was hearing in Wyoming, and that is what \nI wish to talk about today.\n  We have had one headline after another about the dangerous side \neffects of the health care law. For one thing, employers in Wyoming \naren't the only ones who are worried about how much the law is going to \ncost, how it is going to have an impact on them and their businesses \nand their ability to hire more people.\n  According to a news survey by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the \nhealth care law's expensive new mandates are now the No. 1 concern of \nsmall businesses across the country. Seventy-one percent of small \nbusinesses say the law makes it harder for them to hire new workers. \nOne-third say they plan to actually reduce hiring or cut back hours \nbecause of the employer insurance mandate. Twenty-two million Americans \nare out of work or are working less than they would like, and that is \nwhat we saw in the dismal jobs report just this last Friday.\n  You say, why is that? The Federal Reserve's Beige Book came out last \nmonth, and companies all around the country are saying: We are not \ngoing to hire because of the uncertainties and mandates in the \nPresident's health care law.\n  The recession ended 4 years ago, but the only way our economy is \ngoing to get back on track is if we free the private sector to start \nhiring in far greater numbers than they are willing to do right now. \nBut the President's No. 1 signature accomplishment, his law, makes it \nactually harder for businesses to hire more people. One would expect \nthe President would want to make laws that would make it easier for \nemployers to hire more people.\n  There was another headline on how the President's health care law is \nhurting small businesses. Here is what the New York Times says: ``Small \nFirms' Offer of Plan Choices Under Health Law Delayed.''\n  What they are talking about is the promise the President made that \nhis health care law would help small businesses find affordable health \ncare plans. Of course, that is a desirable goal. The problem is the law \ndoesn't bring out what the goals may have been. The law was supposed to \ncreate a new insurance market for small employers. That is what they \nare promised. Their workers would then have a variety of choices so \nthey could pick the plan that worked best for them.\n  The New York Times article says:\n\n       The promise of affordable health insurance for small \n     businesses was portrayed as a major advantage of the new \n     health care law, mentioned often by White House officials and \n     Democratic leaders in Congress. . . .\n\n  That is what the New York Times says that the President of the United \nStates was telling the American people:\n\n       The promise of affordable health insurance for small \n     businesses was portrayed as a major advantage of the new \n     health care law, mentioned often by White House officials and \n     Democratic leaders in Congress. . . .\n\n  So what is going on? The administration admits things haven't worked \nout the way they had promised.\n  They can't meet the law's deadline, so it is going to delay the \nentire program for a full year to 2015. Of course, the Obama \nadministration says it will not delay the mandate until 2015. So you \nhave to provide the health insurance now, in 2014, but: Sorry. We made \nsome promises, but they are not going to happen until 2015. You still \nhave to pay right now and do this.\n  So small businesses are going to get hit with the higher costs of \nproviding the insurance, but they don't get the program that was \nsupposed to help them in the first place--the program promised by the \nDemocrats in this body who voted for it and promised by the President \nof the United States who in many ways went on to deliberately deceive \nand mislead the American people as a result of what we are now finding \nis in the health care law. I am happy to see the national press \nreporting it because we are sure hearing it from people around the \ncountry.\n  What we see now is that if a business wants to offer its workers \ninsurance through an exchange, it has to pick one plan for all the \npeople. The workers are going to get none of the choices they were \npromised. According to Washington and this administration and this \nPresident, now one size has to fit all.\n  Even in a business where the employees now currently have several \nchoices, they are going to lose their options. They are not going to be \nable to pick the insurance plan that is right for them and for their \nfamilies. That is what is happening to Zachary Davis.\n  Zachary Davis owns a couple ice cream shops and a restaurant in Santa \nCruz, CA. He has 20 full-time workers and today he offers them health \ninsurance.\n  Isn't that the goal? Workers--offer them health insurance. These \nworkers range in age from college students to seniors, so they have \ndifferent needs at different ages, different fears, different concerns, \ndifferent needs. What the younger ones prefer are lower premiums and \nthen higher out-of-pocket costs if they happen to get sick. That is \nbecause they are healthy and they do not really go to see a doctor very \noften. The older workers who work in the same company visit doctors \nmore frequently, as would be expected, so they are more interested in a \nposition where their policies maybe have higher premiums but lower \ndeductibles. People want to make choices.\n  Right now the employees who work for Zachary have actually three \ndifferent plans that fit their needs. They get to choose. But what \nZachary Davis has told CNN is that limiting his workers to a single \nplan would be a deal breaker and it would keep him out of the \nexchanges. He said:\n\n       That would not be a good fit for us. For a business like \n     ours--and a lot of businesses I deal with on a regular \n     basis--I can't see that making sense.\n\n  He is right. It doesn't make a lot of sense. But that is what \nPresident Obama's health care law has given the American people--\nsomething that doesn't make sense and another broken promise, another \nhurdle to get in the way of job creators, another failure of the \nWashington bureaucracy, and another burden on workers who like the \ninsurance they had before and now are not going to be able to keep it.\n  During the 2 weeks we have been traveling our States and traveling \nthe country, there has been headline after headline. Here is one more \nheadline from an Associated Press story. This headline says: ``Health \nOverhaul to Raise Claim Cost 32 percent.'' That is a 32-percent average \nincrease in claim costs. This is a new report by the Society of \nActuaries.\n  The Wyoming Tribune Eagle in Cheyenne--this is Wednesday, 27, 2013: \n``Health Overhaul Bumps Up Claim Cost 32 Percent. And If Insurance \nCompanies Have To Pay More, You Can Bet We Will, Too.''\n  ``And If Insurance Companies Have To Pay More, You Can Bet We Will, \nToo.''\n  On average, insurance companies will have to pay out 32 percent more \nfor medical claims on individual health policies because of the health \ncare law, so that is going to drive up premiums for all of us. It \ndrives up how much hard-working Americans have to pay to get medical \ncare and to buy insurance. Why? The President's health care law.\n  Here is how the Associated Press summarized it. It said:\n\n       Obama has promised that the new law will bring down costs. \n     That seems a stretch now.\n\n  This is not me, this is the Associated Press: ``That seems a stretch \nnow.'' I would say it is actually an understatement. Costs will not go \ndown because of the health care law because the law does nothing to \nhelp costs go down or make them go down. In fact, it does many things \nthat actually cause costs to go up. All of the mandates, all of the new \nexpenses, all of the new taxes--that is all going to add to the average \nincrease of 32 percent. But that is just\n\n[[Page S2487]]\n\nthe average. When we look at the increases in some States, we really \nstart to see how much worse off a lot of people are going to be. In \nOhio, we see an increase of 81 percent; in Wisconsin, up 80 percent; \nIndiana, up 68 percent; right next door to us in Maryland, up 67 \npercent; Idaho, up 62 percent. In my own State of Wyoming, people are \nfacing a 32-percent increase. It is right at the national average.\n  This article in the newspaper, when you go to it, it says, ``Overhaul \nincreases could top 50 percent for certain States.'' Here we see in \nmany States that is the case. They have a list, State by State, of each \nof the State's claims--change in claims cost in health overhaul. That \nis what the American people are facing. These are terrible numbers, but \nthey are absolutely predictable. In fact, some of us did predict that \nis what would actually happen. The American people cannot afford for \nhealth care costs to go up by 81 percent, as we are seeing in Ohio, or \neven by 32 percent, which is the national average. That is not what the \nPresident promised.\n  Finally, I want to point out just one more headline, one more broken \npromise the President made. We all remember when the President said \nthat if you like your insurance plan, you can keep it. He said, ``No \none will be able to take that away from you.'' The President of the \nUnited States said, ``No one will be able to take that away from you.''\n  Now we have another story from CNN. It says, ``Most Individual Health \nInsurance Isn't Good Enough For ObamaCare.'' This article talks about a \nUniversity of Chicago study--talking about Chicago, the President's \nhometown. The study reported--from CNN--the University of Chicago \nreported that more than half of the individual insurance plans \ncurrently on the market will not be allowed to exist under the \nPresident's health care law--more than half. Fifteen million Americans \nbuy individual plans, and half of those plans are going away. Even if \nthese people like their coverage, the President says: Too bad. His \nhealth care law is taking it away from them.\n  Not only will the law eliminate more than half of the plans, most of \nthe ones that remain are going to cost more next year. Why? It is \nbecause of what the administration calls the essential health benefits. \nThese are specific individual mandates that require insurance plans to \ncover a wide range of services. For most consumers, it is going to mean \na more extensive and a longer list of benefits. These higher benefits, \nof course, mean higher costs.\n  So people cannot just get the insurance that they and their family \nwant, the insurance that is right for them as a family and the \ninsurance that they can afford. No. They have to buy Obama \nadministration-approved health insurance. That is insurance that is \ngoing to be much more expensive than what they might want, they might \nneed, or they can afford. It may not even do them any good. So despite \nwhat the President has promised to the American people, they are not \ngoing to be able to keep the insurance they have. The options that are \nleft to them are going to cost more.\n  These are just a few of the headlines--a few of the headlines we have \nseen just since we went out a couple of weeks ago and traveled the \nStates. These are all fresh, new headlines from the last 2 weeks, but \nevery day we get more and more information about the bad side effects \nof this terrible health care law. The President's health care law is \nunraveling before our eyes.\n  The American people knew what they wanted from health care reform. \nThey wanted the care they need from a doctor they choose, at lower \ncost. That is what the President promised the American people they \nwould get from his health care law, but all the people of the country \nhave seen are rising costs, less choice, and a larger Washington \nbureaucracy.\n  It is time for President Obama to finally admit that his health care \nlaw is dragging down the American economy. It is time for Congress to \nrepeal this terrible law and replace it with the kind of reform that \nworks.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I come to the floor to discuss the \nPresident's budget, which we understand will be released tomorrow. The \nbudget comes out at a time when there is a lot of economic news \nfloating around. The jobs report came out last week and indicated that \njob growth had been much slower than expected. There were about 190,000 \njobs that were expected to be created, but there were only 88,000 jobs \ncreated, according to that report.\n  Although the unemployment dropped a little to 7.6 percent--if we \nfactor in the number of people who had quit looking for jobs, which was \nhalf a million people--we had a labor participation rate which is \nliterally the lowest since 1979. We have to go back to Jimmy Carter's \nPresidency to find a time when the labor participation rate hit that \nlow number where 63.3 percent of the people who are eligible to work \nare actually out looking for work. There a lot of people who have \ncompletely quit looking.\n  We also looked at the U-6 number, which measures employment in a \ndifferent way. It adds in the number of people who are no longer \nlooking for work or who are working part time but would like to work \nfull time. The unemployment rate for that is about 13.8 percent. This \nis a very sluggish, weak economy, where there are a large number of \npeople across this country who continue to be unemployed, who continue \nto try and make their way without the advantage of having a job out \nthere to pay their bills.\n  It strikes me that as the President releases his budget, the \nfundamental question which should be asked in the context of the \neconomic data I have just mentioned is what will his budget do to \ncreate jobs, grow the economy, and increase the take-home pay for \nmiddle-class Americans. To me, that seems to be the question we ought \nto use as we evaluate not only the President's budget but other budget \nproposals that have been made here in the last few weeks.\n  When I say other budget proposals, of course, the House and Senate \nhave both adopted budgets. The House passed their budget. They have \npassed their budget every year on time. The Senate, for the first time \nin 4 years, actually adopted a budget a couple weeks ago, and tomorrow \nwe will finally have the President's budget, which, interestingly \nenough, was due on February 4. We were supposed to get the President's \nbudget February 4. Typically, his budget would kick off the debate on \nthe budget. It would be the starting point on which the two Houses of \nCongress--the House and Senate--base their budgets and gives them a \nlittle information as they move forward, but this is completely in \nreverse.\n  In fact, I think this is the latest the President has released his \nbudget since about 1920. We have to go back almost 100 years to find a \ntime when the President has released his budget at a later date than he \ndid this year. So his budget comes after the fact. That being said, I \nhope when it does become public and we begin to dig into it a little \nbit and look at what is in it, we will have a more definitive answer to \nthe questions: What are we going to do to create jobs? What are we \ngoing to do to grow the economy? What are we going to do to increase \nthe take-home pay of working Americans? To me, that is fundamentally \nwhat we ought to be focused on in light of the very abysmal jobs report \nfrom last week.\n  What we are hearing about it--and again we will not know the final \ndetails until we see this tomorrow--is it is going to consist of a huge \nnew tax increase. It will be another $1 trillion tax increase on top of \nthe $1.7 trillion in tax increases that the President has already \nsigned into law. If we go back to ObamaCare--the health care bill that \npassed a few years ago--it included $1 trillion in new taxes. We had \nthe fiscal cliff deal, reached on January 1 of this year, which had \n$620 billion in new taxes. If we take ObamaCare, the fiscal cliff deal, \nand then add in some other taxes that have been imposed since the \nPresident took office, we are now over $1.7 trillion in new taxes and \nnew revenue.\n\n[[Page S2488]]\n\n  So when the word came out that the President's budget was going to \ninclude another $1 trillion in new taxes on top of the $1.7 trillion \nalready mentioned, we need to ask the questions: At what point does \nthis do serious harm to the economy? At what point do we get to that \njuncture where we have so much burden, so many new taxes and new \nregulations imposed upon our economy, that it becomes increasingly \ndifficult, if not impossible, to create jobs and get the economy \ngrowing at a faster rate. In fact, what we are hearing, at least at \nthis point, is that we have $1 trillion in new taxes, which means \noverall we would have a $600 billion number in terms of deficit \nreduction.\n  We have been told the President's budget replaces the sequester, \nwhich had $1.2 trillion in spending cuts. If there is just $600 billion \nin deficit reduction, what that essentially means is that all the \ndeficit reduction is in the form of higher taxes. We have $1 trillion \nin new taxes, $600 billion in deficit reduction, and we are completely \nreplacing the $1.2 trillion in spending cuts that is currently in \neffect, unless, of course, as is proposed in the President's budget, at \nleast we are told is proposed in the President's budget is going to be \nreplaced.\n  My point simply is this: In this country, we have a sluggish economy, \nchronic high unemployment, massive amounts of debt, all of which can \nbe, if not entirely, at least partially cured and fixed by a more \nrobust, more expansive and growing economy, growing at a more historic \nrate. The economic growth we have seen since this President took \noffice, the average is .8 percent--eight-tenths of 1 percent is the \naverage economic growth in 4 years since the President has been in \noffice.\n  The historic average over the past 60 years is about 3.3 percent, and \nthat includes 11 recessions. We have been through 11 recessions in the \nlast 60 years, and still we have an average growth rate of 3.3 percent. \nIt is not terribly robust, but on average at least it is good enough to \nkeep the economy chugging along, to keep throwing enough jobs out there \nto keep a majority--or at least keep the unemployment rate at a \nreasonable level and keep Americans employed. Yet in the last 4 years \nthe average is .8 percent.\n  Last year, we looked at 1.5 percent to 2 percent, in that \nneighborhood, but the fact is, until we start growing at a faster rate, \nwe will be plagued by chronic high unemployment and we will continue to \nhave these massive deficits year over year. As we all know, when we \nhave a growing and expanding economy, people are working, investing, \nmaking money, and paying taxes. When the economy is growing, we get \nmore tax revenue, and that makes the fiscal imbalances look smaller by \ncomparison as well.\n  The real objective we ought to have in front of us if we want to deal \nwith the fiscal imbalance and if we want to deal with the sluggish \neconomy out there is policies that will promote economic growth, \npolicies that make it less expensive and less difficult for people in \nthis country to create jobs. We should not add more taxes, not add more \ncosts in the form of new regulations, not impose more burdens on the \neconomy but unleash the economy and allow it to grow and allow people \nin the economy to create jobs.\n  There are a number of reasons why that cannot happen. As I said, we \nhave $1.7 trillion in new taxes that have been put on the economy since \nthe President took office. His budget, as we are told, is going to \ninclude another $1 trillion in new taxes. We have new health care \nmandates that businesses--small businesses, large businesses, \nbusinesses of all sizes--are reacting to. It is something I hear more \nabout now when I travel my State than almost anything else.\n  When we talk to people who create the jobs, there is uncertainty \nabout how this is going to be implemented. There are lots of delays in \nterms of its implementation. We are looking at significant increases in \npremiums across many different age groups.\n  We heard the Senator from Wyoming, who was down here earlier, talking \nabout the impacts of health care and what it will mean to the economy, \nwhat it will mean to people who buy their health insurance in the \nindividual marketplace, people who acquire it through their employer. \nObviously, there are people who might be forced into exchanges. There \nis just a tremendous cloud of uncertainty which hangs over our economy \nright now. Much of it is due to government policy generated in \nWashington, DC. Many of those policies come back to the budget. What is \nthe vision we have for the future of this country?\n  The budget is a vision statement, as has been stated by Vice \nPresident Biden in the past. It sort of lays out a policy framework for \nthe two parties and their respective ideas about how to grow the \nAmerican economy, how to get people back to work, how to improve the \nstandard of living and the quality of life and the take-home pay for \nmiddle-class Americans. Again, that is what I would argue the budget \ndiscussion we have should be focused on.\n  It strikes me as somewhat unusual and ironic that the President, \nafter getting $1.7 trillion in new taxes since he took office, would \nsubmit a budget that is several months late, filled with new tax \nincreases, and would put even more burdens on an already fragile \neconomy. Yet that is what we are hearing is going to be in his budget.\n  There are some other things which I would hope he will include in \nthat budget. We are told he is going to propose a modest and what I \nthink is a bipartisan entitlement reform known as chained CPI that \nwould change the calculation in some ways and would be more reflective \nof cost and the economy when it comes to calculating benefits for \ncertain programs. But it is a small change in terms of what the \ndimensions of the problem are.\n  In fact, if we are going to do anything serious and meaningful to \ndeal with the runaway spending and debt, we have to--in a structural \nway--reform these programs on the mandatory side of the budget that are \ngrowing at two to three times the rate of inflation and are \nunsustainable.\n  If we look at what drives Federal spending today, it is mandatory \nspending, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid--programs that are \nsort of on autopilot, if you will, in the Federal budget that today \nrepresent somewhere on the order of about three-fifths of all Federal \nspending. But according to the Congressional Budget Office, 10 years \nfrom now it will represent 91 percent of Federal spending if we \ncontinue on the path we are on today. That is completely unsustainable. \nThat means we have 9 percent of all Federal revenue available to fund \nnational security, fund nondefense discretionary spending, and to pay \ninterest on the debt. That is a future we cannot comprehend.\n  I think what it points out is we need to deal with these programs in \na way that reforms them, that saves them, that protects them not only \nfor generations of Americans today who depend upon them but also for \nfuture generations of Americans. On the current trajectory, on the \ncurrent path, we simply cannot do that, and we have to make changes and \nreform these programs.\n  So it would seem the President, in his budget, would contemplate what \nhe might do, proposals he might make to address that. Again, we will \nnot know for sure until we see it tomorrow, but my understanding is \nthere will be very little in terms of consequential, meaningful change, \nmeaningful reforms and restructuring of programs that will actually get \nus on a more sustainable fiscal path.\n  I have to say the connection when we talk about policies--and I could \ngo into a lot of different policy areas that I think drive up the cost \nof doing business in this country, one of which I already mentioned; \nthat is, the new health care entitlement program that imposes lots of \nnew requirements and mandates on employers as well as on individuals \nand is filled with $1 trillion in new taxes. But there are other areas \nof our economy as well.\n  If we look at the power of energy in this country and what it could \ndo to unleash jobs to help get our economy growing at a faster rate, we \nsee we have enormous opportunity out there in that sector of our \neconomy.\n  We obviously have enormous opportunity if we are willing to take on \nour Tax Code. Our Tax Code is enormously complicated, complex beyond \nthe comprehension of most Americans, which is why in many cases they \nhave to turn it over to a professional tax preparer. But I believe it \nis fair to say if we could reform our Tax Code in a way\n\n[[Page S2489]]\n\nthat broadens that base and does away with a lot of the loopholes and \nthe special interest provisions--the exclusions, deductions, et cetera, \nin the Tax Code today--broadens that tax base, lowers the rates--we \ncould unleash a period of economic growth unlike anything we have seen \nin a long period of time.\n  If we go back to the last time this was done in 1986, we know we saw \na long period of economic growth because people--there was a lot of \npent-up uncertainty and there is today, I might add, as well--and there \nis a lot of capital sitting on the sidelines that could be deployed and \na lot of jobs, frankly, and opportunities we are losing to global \ncompetitors because our tax rates are, frankly, just not competitive in \nthe global marketplace.\n  So I would argue that reforming our Tax Code would be enormously \nhelpful if we are serious about growing the economy and creating jobs. \nThat too is an area where I hope the President will engage. So far we \nhave not heard from him on that except to say in terms of the corporate \ntax rate he would be willing to work with us on tax reform that would \nbe deficit neutral. But if we look at what is coming out of his \nadministration, these proposals, and the budget we will see tomorrow, \nmost of it involves raising taxes--closing loopholes, perhaps, but \ndoing it to generate new revenue to fund new Federal spending, not to \nreduce rates and to generate economic growth. Economic growth ought to \nbe the goal in tax reform. It ought to be progrowth tax reform, and it \nwould take us a long way toward that goal of getting this economy back \non track and unleashing the economic growth we all want to see.\n  But I have to say it is also important, if we are going to get the \neconomy growing again, that we get Federal spending under control. \nThere is a lot of research out there, a lot of study that has been done \nthat has looked at the relationship between high levels of debt as a \npercentage of our economy, GDP, and high levels of spending as a \npercentage of our GDP and how that impacts or translates into economic \ngrowth and jobs. The studies suggest that when our debt to GDP reaches \na certain level--and ours exceeds that by 90 percent according to one \nof the studies--that it costs 1 point to 1.5 points of economic growth \nevery single year. In this country that is about 1 million jobs. So as \nlong as we continue to have a debt to GDP that exceeds 90 percent--ours \nis now about 104, 105 percent of GDP--we are in dangerous territory \nwhen it comes to the fragile nature of our economy and what it means to \nour ability to grow in the long term as we project out into the future.\n  If we look at many of the European nations that are strangled with \nhigh debtloads right now, a tremendous amount of leverage, we can see \nwhat is happening in their economies. How have they tried to cure that \nin most cases? They try to raise taxes, which makes the problem even \nworse because that slows economic growth.\n  So what we need to be looking at in terms of a budget is one that \ntakes on what is driving Federal spending over the long term--the \nmandatory part of the budget--reforms and restructures programs in a \nway that saves and protects them; that doesn't in any way impact people \nwho are drawing benefits today but makes those programs more \nsustainable for future generations of Americans. We need a budget that \nbrings the debt-to-GDP and the spending-to-GDP levels down to a more \nhistoric norm that are consistent with what we have seen over our \nNation's history as opposed to what we are looking at today, which are \nextraordinarily high levels of debt and extraordinarily high levels of \nspending as a percentage of GDP.\n  We ought to think about what we can be doing in terms of reforming \nthe Tax Code and streamlining regulations to lessen the burden and the \ntremendous weight we put on our small businesses and our job creators.\n  Those are the types of things we ought to be looking at in terms of \npolicy. That is what the budget ought to be focused on, getting \nspending under control, getting it back down to a more reasonable level \nand a more historic norm. But until we do that, my fear is we are going \nto continue to see chronic unemployment, a lot of people leaving the \nworkforce, and labor participation rates that are at historic lows. We \nare going to continue to see a sluggish economy that continues to \nstumble along at 1.5, 2 percent annual growth. We are going to continue \nto see take-home pay levels go down for ordinary, working-class, \nmiddle-class Americans who are out there trying to pay their bills, \ntrying to take care of their everyday expenses and perhaps put a little \nbit aside for their retirement or for their children's education. Those \nare hard decisions that Americans are making at their kitchen tables \nevery single day. These are kitchen table issues; they are pocketbook \nissues. They are the kinds of decisions that American families have to \ncontend with. They don't have the luxury the Federal Government has of \nbeing able to go out and borrow.\n\n  Of course, today, of every dollar we spend in Washington, DC, 40 \ncents is borrowed. So we continue to borrow like there is no tomorrow. \nWe continue to pile up massive amounts of debt, put it on the backs of \nour children and grandchildren, hand them the bill or the credit card \novercharges we are making today. That is wrong. It is inconsistent with \neverything that has made this Nation great. Part of our Nation's \nheritage is we have been a country that has understood the idea that \none generation sacrifices so the next generation can have a higher \nstandard of living and a better quality of life. That is something that \nis very true in my part of the country in the Midwest, in South Dakota.\n  My grandfather and great uncle are among those who came in 1906, \ndidn't speak English, learned the language, worked hard building a \nrailroad, and later were able to save enough money to buy a small \nmerchandising store and continued in their pursuit of the American \ndream.\n  That is what I think has characterized generations of Americans like \nthem since, up until today. Today we are at a point in American history \nwhere if we don't get our fiscal house in order, if we don't deal with \nthese imbalances that have gone on now for decades, we are going to \nrelegate, if you will, future generations of Americans--our kids and \ngrandkids--to a lower standard of living and a lower quality of life \nthan what we have enjoyed.\n  That is why the President's budget, as much as it is late, is so \nimportant, because it really does set that tone. It really does tell us \nwhat that vision for the future of this country is. If we don't have a \nleader in the White House who can lay out in a systematic way what he \nwants to do to address the economic data--the statistics I mentioned \nearlier, the high unemployment, the underemployment--we consistently \nsee these economic numbers come out from one month to the next. When \nthere is a little improvement, we get all excited about that, and the \nnext month it takes another tumble.\n  We find more and more people who are just leaving the workforce, and \nthe labor participation rate is at a historically low level since 1979, \nand we haven't seen it down 63.3 percent, which is what it was for the \nmonth of March. If we are going to do something about that, we are \ngoing to have to have people who are going to demonstrate the political \ncourage that is necessary to confront these big challenges and big \ndecisions, and that means people in the Senate and in the House of \nRepresentatives. But awfully important to all of this is the President \nof the United States.\n  There is only one person in this country, among 307 billion \nAmericans, who can sign a bill into law. There is only one person in \nthis country who has the bully pulpit and the capability to rally \npeople in the Congress and people around the country as well as around \ngreat causes. I can't think of a greater cause today than doing \nsomething to deal with runaway spending and a debt that is hurting our \neconomy, that is enslaving future generations of Americans to a lower \nstandard of living and a lower quality of life.\n  Those are issues that need to be addressed. The President's budget \ntomorrow could go a long way toward addressing that. I am afraid it is \ngoing to be a missed opportunity if what we hear about it is actually \ntrue. We hear it doesn't address the long-term drivers of spending and \ndebt, it raises taxes $1 trillion, and it does $600 billion of deficit \nreduction but all in the form of higher taxes. That is not going to \nsolve\n\n[[Page S2490]]\n\nour problem. We cannot raise taxes enough to deal with what plagues our \ncountry in terms of our fiscal imbalances. What plagues us is the fact \nthat we spend too much, not that we tax too little; that we have a slow \nrate of growth in our economy, so slow we are not generating the number \nof jobs and the amount of investment that will get the economy growing \nand taking off again, but also improve the fiscal picture for our \ncountry's future.\n  So I hope I am wrong about this. We will see tomorrow if everybody \nwill be pleasantly surprised and the President will take on the big \nissues and do away with more taxes and more spending and more \nregulations and more costs for businesses that are trying to create \njobs. But I think that would be the triumph of hope over experience. So \nfar what we have seen out of this administration is that very formula: \nmore spending, more taxes, more cost to small businesses to create \njobs, and higher cost from regulations. They have been consistent on \nthat. That is not the way to get the economy growing and expanding \nagain.\n  We believe we ought to be not growing the government but growing the \neconomy. Frankly, if all of us in the Senate looked at every bill that \ncomes before us in terms of what will it do to create jobs, what will \nit do to grow the economy, what will it do to increase the take-home \npay for middle-class Americans, we would probably get a lot higher \nquality legislation, legislation that produces solutions for the \nAmerican people, which is something we are not doing today.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, earlier today I met with families from \nNewtown, CT, to discuss the legislation we are currently debating. It \nis obviously very emotional and not an easy meeting to have, but it is \na very necessary meeting to have. When there are parents of children \nwho were murdered, or from the families of teachers who were murdered, \nit is difficult for everybody.\n  I wish to thank them for sharing their stories of loved ones and \ntheir concerns with me. I hope many of my colleagues would consider \nmeeting with these families as well. We are debating legislation they \nare supporting.\n  In my State of Iowa, there is a great difference of opinion on the \nparticular legislation we might be considering. I think it is something \nvery worthwhile to sense firsthand the emotion of these discussions. At \nthe meeting, they called for debate on the legislation. Currently we \nare in the process of debate.\n  We most likely will move forward on this legislation. Under new \nprocedures available under Senate Resolution 15, the majority leader \nmay move to proceed on a measure and to vote on some amendments.\n  A vote against the motion to proceed does not cut off debate or votes \non amendments under the new procedures in the United States Senate.\n  Nonetheless, we are in the unusual position of being asked to take a \nleap into the unknown.\n  We are being asked to vote to proceed to an uncertain bill.\n  That bill is not even the bill that we would likely consider if the \nmotion to proceed were successful. The language on background checks \nwould change. Remarkably, if the language changed, it would be replaced \nwith language that does not now exist.\n  The world's greatest deliberative body should not operate in this \nfashion.\n  In the Judiciary Committee, four bills were considered separately. \nThere was no consensus. Three of them have now been combined. But they \nare not ready for consideration. At the time, the sponsor of the \nbackground check bill said it was not ready. There are numerous \nproblems with that bill.\n  Movement of firearms from one law-abiding citizen to another would be \nlegal or illegal based on arbitrary distinctions that citizens could \nnot be expected to know. This is true even though when this language \nwas the subject of a hearing in a previous Congress, a witness pointed \nout the problems. But no changes have been made to address those \nissues.\n  Even an official with the ACLU says that criminal laws should give \nmore guidance to citizens.\n  The bill operates in a way that would make gun safety efforts more \ndifficult. That does not make any sense.\n  The bill requires recordkeeping for private sales. That is a step \ntoward gun registration. Indeed, we heard testimony in the Judiciary \nCommittee that ``universal'' background checks cannot be effective \nwithout gun registration. And the ACLU official is right to be \nconcerned about the threat to privacy that the background check \nlanguage presents. He notes that the government would possess \ninformation concerning gun owners that it would not be required to \ndestroy within 24 hours, as it must for current background checks.\n  He also points out that the bill contains none of the restrictions in \ncurrent law that prevent other parts of the government from using the \ndatabase for purposes beyond why the information was supposedly \nobtained.\n  The background check provision is also not ready for consideration \nbecause of the new Federal felony that it creates.\n  If a law-abiding gun owner's gun is lost or stolen, he or she would \nbe required to report that to both the attorney general and appropriate \nlocal officials within 24 hours.\n  At the markup, I asked a number of questions of the bill's sponsor \nabout how the offense would work. For instance, who would pay for the \nadditional law enforcement personnel who would take those calls? What \nwould a citizen's legal obligation be if the gun were misplaced rather \nthan lost? What would determine when the loss occurred that started the \n24-hour period?\n  The sponsor said that these issues would be clarified. So far, \nhowever, they have not been. So law-abiding citizens will not know \nwhether they are acting in compliance with the law or face a 5-year \njail sentence.\n  The issues have not been clarified, but we are being asked to proceed \nto the bill anyway.\n  This new offense criminalizes inaction. That is a grave threat to \nfreedom.\n  Except for filing tax returns or registering for the draft, we punish \nbad actions. We do not punish inaction. This new crime punishes failure \nto act. And it only applies to those who lawfully own their guns. A \ncriminal whose gun is stolen is not required to report that fact. With \nthis offense, law-abiding citizens can be turned into felons, but \nfelons cannot commit a crime.\n  Under this new offense, law-abiding citizens might be looking at 5 \nyears in jail for doing nothing. And all that is necessary for the gun \nto be subject to the reporting requirement is that the gun once moved \nin interstate commerce.\n  The Supreme Court has outlined three categories of situations in \nwhich Congress can rely on the Commerce Clause. This is not one of \nthem. If Congress can do this, it can make people take all sorts of \naction simply because they owned a product that once moved in \ninterstate commerce--Like bread or soap.\n  And they can face jail time if they do not do what Congress demands \nthat they do. Even the individual mandate from Obamacare only \nestablished a penalty, not a prison sentence. I do not think 90% of \nAmericans would support this universal background check bill if they \nread it.\n  The motion to proceed also goes to a bill that contains language on \nstraw purchasing and gun trafficking. I voted to report that bill to \nthe Senate floor.\n  Many changes were made to that bill at my behest. An amendment of \nmine was adopted. At the time I expressed concerns. I spoke of my \ndesire to have those concerns worked out before the bill went to the \nfloor. I said I would not necessarily support that bill on the floor if \nthose concerns were not responded to. They have not been addressed so \nfar. And those provisions were tied to the ever-changing background \ncheck provisions.\n  The whole process makes me wonder whether the efforts to pass a bill \non this subject really are serious. It seems that if a half-baked bill \nis brought up, the majority can be sure that they can force Republicans \nnot to agree to proceed to it. It seems like that may be\n\n[[Page S2491]]\n\njust what they want to happen. If so, that is a very cynical way to \ntreat a very serious issue.\n  How can we responsibly proceed to a bill that contains language that \neven its sponsor admits is not ready for consideration?\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I am back again to speak about \ncarbon and climate and to remind my colleagues that it is long past \ntime for us to wake up and to address the causes and consequences of \nglobal climate change. Carbon pollution is changing our world, and it \nis time that our national policies reflect the reality of that changing \nclimate. We cannot pretend the change is not going to happen when it is \nactually already happening all around us.\n  Air and ocean temperatures are increasing, the sea level is rising, \noceans are growing more acidic, seasons are shifting, and extreme \nevents such as heat waves or powerful storms are becoming both more \nfrequent and more intense. Well-established science tells us these \nchanges are caused by carbon pollution in our atmosphere, mostly from \nburning fossil fuels. These changes to our planet will continue and \nlikely accelerate, and the consequences will be dire. We had better be \naware and prepared. Sometimes even little changes can have big effects.\n\n  For example, take the winter flounder in the waters of Narragansett \nBay in my home State of Rhode Island. I am sure the Presiding Officer's \nhome State has winter flounder as well. Many of our colleagues will not \ngive a hoot about the winter flounder, but Congress always tends to \ncare a lot about money, and the winter flounder has historically been a \nvery popular and lucrative catch for Rhode Island fishermen.\n  In the 1980s, commercial landings of winter flounder averaged more \nthan 2,500 metric tons per year, and as recently as 1989 it was still \nover 1,000 metric tons. Trawlers were a common sight on the bay in the \nwinter and fishermen prospered. The most recent data from 2009 for the \ncommercial landing of winter flounder is down to about 150 metric tons. \nIt went from 2,500 metric tons down to 150, and today trawlers in the \nbay are a rare sight.\n  Narragansett Bay waters are getting warmer--4 degrees Fahrenheit \nwarmer in the winter since the 1960s. Spring is coming earlier, and \nthat is not good for the winter flounder. NOAA scientists working in \nRhode Island found that winter flounder that incubated in warmer water \nare smaller when they hatch than those that incubated in colder water. \nSmaller juveniles are easier prey when predators return with the warmer \nspring water.\n  The juvenile winter flounder used to have time to settle to the \nbottom of the bay and grow larger before the abundant bottom feeders, \nsuch as the sand shrimp, were present. Now warmer water brings the \nshrimp in earlier while the flounder is still small enough to eat. So \nwarmer waters load the dice against winter flounder in the Narragansett \nBay, and the fishermen who relied upon them pay the price. They pay a \nreal price.\n  These changes to Rhode Island are not unique to Rhode Island. We can \nfind examples all over the country. The Pacific Coast has ocean \nacidification--driven by the higher levels of carbon dioxide in the \nwater--which is killing off baby oysters as they try to form their \nshells in the acidified water. Again, I don't know how many colleagues \ncare about baby oysters, but oyster farming is a serious cash crop on \nthe Pacific Coast. An oyster hatchery in Oregon has seen 70- to 80-\npercent losses of its oyster larvae due to the acidic waters washing in \nfrom the sea.\n  It is not just the oceans and coasts that are affected. In our \nHeartland, rivers and forests are facing the changes coming with the \nwarming climate. The water hyacinth is an invasive species spreading \nrapidly across the Southern United States, blocking waterways and \nchoking native species.\n  The water hyacinth has been called the world's worst aquatic weed. \nThe pest renders a body of water unsuitable for most other plants and \nanimals, drains water from the drinking and irrigation supply, and can \nclog pumping stations and hydropower infrastructures, costing local \neconomies millions of dollars. Water hyacinths cannot survive a winter \nfreezing, but as the average temperature warms, this species spreads \nfurther and further.\n  In the Rockies, pine beetles are devastating native forests. The pine \nbeetle larvae are killed by hard frosts, and so this kept them in lower \nlatitudes and in lower altitudes where the temperature was warmer. With \nglobal warming and winters that are not so cold, the beetle is \nspreading northward and upward to higher elevations.\n  Fly over Idaho or Montana and look down. What was once miles and \nmiles of green pine forest is now standing dead on the mountainsides. \nThese forests provided timber, hunting, clear streams, and an entire \nforest environment for birds and animals. It doesn't look like they are \never coming back.\n  Winter flounder, baby oysters, water hyacinth, pine beetles, these \nspecies pinpoint just a few of the many changes scientists are \nobserving in nearly every corner of our country. Thankfully, we now \nhave the beginnings of a blueprint for adapting to these changes.\n  Last month, the Obama administration--in partnership with State and \ntribal industries--released its first National Fish, Wildlife and \nPlants Climate Adaptation Strategy. It is an attempt to understand and \nhead off--or at least prepare for--the changes carbon pollution is \nbeginning to wreak on our country's wildlife, plants, coasts, and \nrivers.\n  Jamie Rappaport Clark, president and CEO of Defenders of Wildlife, \ncalled the adaptation plan a ``science-based . . . commonsense, `look-\nbefore-you-leap' strategy [that] emphasizes long term planning and \nmanagement for climate change on a fundamental level.''\n  The adaptation strategy stresses that we need research to understand \nthe specific effects of climate change on local fish, wildlife, plants, \nand habitat. The faster you are driving, the better your headlights \nneed to be, and it is scientific research that provides the headlights \nfor us to see what is now coming at us.\n  We are past the point of avoiding what is coming at us. The big \npolluters have seen to that. With their lobbyists, their money, and \ntheir lies, they have prevented us from doing what we should have. Of \ncourse, Congress shares the blame. This institution prefers listening \nto self-interested polluters than listening to science or the signals \nof nature.\n  There is no avoiding it now. The National Wildlife Federation now \nrecommends ``managing for change, rather than maintaining status quo \nconditions,'' and urges that ``[f]ederal land and water management \nagencies should explicitly incorporate climate change projections into \ntheir resource management planning.''\n  A coalition of 21 groups--including American Rivers, National Audubon \nSociety, Physicians for Social Responsibility, the Wilderness Society, \nand the World Wildlife Fund--have urged the Federal Government to \naccount for climate change in all relevant programs and activities. \nThey called this adaptation strategy ``a landmark . . . strategy for \nmaking wildlife and ecosystems more resilient to climate impacts.'' \nClearly, they recognize that climate impacts are inevitable. Indeed, \nthey are happening. The question is: How bad are they going to be? How \nmuch damage will we let the polluters do before we bring them to heel \nand ourselves to our senses?\n  The Natural Resources Defense Council echoed a recent Government \nAccountability Office finding that our current adaptation planning is \ninadequate and that this--for those who only care about money--\nincreases the Federal Government's fiscal exposure to climate change.\n\n  A group of 10 outdoor enthusiasts and sportsmen's groups, led by the \nWildlife Management Institute, recently urged President Obama ``to \nstand firm on his commitment to develop and implement climate change \nadaptation strategies'' because they know we have to adapt.\n\n[[Page S2492]]\n\n  The alarm has long been sounded by the scientific community which \noverwhelmingly warns about the effects of our carbon dioxide emissions \non our atmosphere and oceans. Our defense and intelligence communities \nwarn of the threats posed by climate change to national security and \ninternational stability. Economists recognize the market distortion of \noverlooking the costs of carbon pollution.\n  Let me say a word of appreciation to former Secretary George Schultz, \nwho wrote an excellent piece in the Wall Street Journal pointing out \nthat this is, indeed, a market distortion that favors polluting fossil \nfuels and gives them an unfair advantage against other forms of energy \nthat would do less damage to our planet.\n  Of course, government accountants list climate change as a threat to \nour fiscal stability. Even faith leaders appeal to our moral \nresponsibility to shield communities--and particularly the poorest \ncommunities here at home and around the globe--from the devastating \neffects of carbon pollution on God's Earth.\n  Now the alarm is sounded by those dedicated to the conservation of \nAmerica's wild spaces and living creatures. They are warning that \nthanks to Congress's neglect, change is coming to our planet locality \nby locality. They are warning that we had better understand and prepare \nfor those changes and do what we can to minimize the eventual havoc.\n  The American people are not sitting idly by on this. They are \ndemanding action. Three-quarters of those recently surveyed by Stanford \nUniversity think the Federal Government should do something to reduce \nthe effects of rising sea levels.\n  My Newport tidal gauge in my home State in the famous sailing port of \nNewport is up 10 inches since the famous hurricane of 1938. When the \nnext big one comes, that 10 inches is going to mean a lot of additional \ndamage. Americans believe national preparations for the climate change \nthat is around us will more likely help the economy than hurt it, and \nthey are right. These changes will help the economy.\n  Sixty percent of Americans believe that taking steps now to adapt \nwould actually create more jobs while only 13 percent thought it would \ncreate fewer jobs. Sixty percent as opposed to 13 percent of Americans \nrecognize that the real economic strength we will get is by addressing \nthis problem, not by ducking it because of the pressure from the carbon \npolluters.\n  Americans clearly see the benefits of adapting for climate change. \nAgain, for those who only care about money, Americans see the economic \nbenefits of addressing climate change.\n  I will say once again it is time for us in Congress to wake up. We \nare sleepwalking through history. We are asleep to the urgent demands \nof our time. It is time to wake up and prepare our national strategy to \nprotect our Nation's precious resources, protect our coasts and forests \nand plains, protect our animal and plant life, protect our people and \nour communities against the inexorable change that looms.\n  I thank the President and yield the floor. I note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, 4 months after the horrific day in \nNewtown where 20 children and 6 educators were senselessly murdered, \nthe Senate is posed to make further progress toward the goal of \nreducing gun violence. It is a goal that all Americans, regardless of \npolitical party or philosophy, should share. I don't know how any \nparent, any grandparent, or any relative ever gets over the horrific \ndisaster of Newtown.\n  I thank our ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, Senator \nGrassley. He worked with us, and he favorably supported two of the \nmeasures reported by the Judiciary Committee last month. Senator \nGrassley helped make sure we had hearings that were substantive and \nthat we had a schedule so we could vote.\n  I commend Senator Collins, who has been my partner as we have moved \nforward with legislation to combat illegal gun trafficking and straw \npurchasers who obtain firearms legally but then provide them to \ncriminals and gangs. We have been joined in that bipartisan effort by \nSenators Durbin, Gillibrand, Kirk, Klobuchar, Franken, Blumenthal, \nShaheen, and King.\n  Our bill is intended to give law enforcement better and more \neffective tools. A bipartisan majority of the Judiciary Committee voted \nfor the Stop Illegal Trafficking in Firearms Act, S. 54. It has \nprovisions that are included in the Safe Communities, Safe Schools Act, \nS. 649, which Majority Leader Reid placed on the Senate calendar just \nbefore the last recess and on which he has now moved to proceed.\n  Straw purchasers get around the purpose of the background check \nsystem. Straw purchasing of firearms is undertaken for just one reason: \nto get a gun into the hands of someone who is legally prohibited from \nhaving one.\n  We know that many guns used in criminal activities are acquired \nthrough straw purchases. It was a straw purchaser who enabled the \nbrutal murders of two brave firefighters in Webster, NY, this past \nChristmas Eve, and it was a straw purchaser who provided firearms to an \nindividual who murdered a police officer in Plymouth Township, PA, last \nSeptember. Is it any wonder that law enforcement across this country \nsays: Stop the straw purchasing. We are losing too many brave men and \nwomen in law enforcement, to say nothing about all the others who have \nbeen killed by drug and criminal cartels.\n  We need a meaningful solution to this serious problem. We have \nincluded suggestions from Senator Gillibrand to go after those who \ntraffic in firearms by wrongfully obtaining two or more firearms. We \nworked hard to develop effective, targeted legislation to help combat a \nserious problem. We are doing it in a way that protects the second \namendment rights of law-abiding Americans.\n  It was an ATF whistleblower who testified in the last Congress that \nthe existing firearm laws are ``toothless.'' We can create better law \nenforcement tools, and that is what we are doing with the Stop Illegal \nTrafficking in Firearms Act. I urge all Senators to join with us and \nclose this dangerous loophole in the law that Mexican drug cartels, \ngangs, and other criminals throughout our country have exploited for \ntoo long.\n  I wish to recognize the dedication and leadership of Senator Collins \nof Maine to confront the issue of gun violence. She is not a member of \nthe Judiciary Committee, but she has been\n\n[[Page S2493]]\n\ncommitted to finding commonsense solutions to the problems of gun \nviolence. She has been dedicated in working with me to address the \nconcerns of other Senators. She and I share a deep respect for the \nsecond amendment. We also agree our laws can be improved to give law \nenforcement officials the tools they need, and she has been a steadfast \npartner.\n  Our bill protects second amendment rights of lawful gun owners, but \nat the same time it cracks down on criminals. It also cracks down on \nthe people who assist criminals. It doesn't create a national firearms \nregistry, it doesn't place additional burdens on law-abiding gun owners \nor purchasers, but it does send a very clear message that those who buy \na gun on behalf of a criminal or member of a drug cartel or domestic \nabuser will be held accountable. That is why law enforcement says: Pass \nthis bill. Give those of us in law enforcement who are on the \nfrontlines the tools we need.\n  Some have expressed frustration about the level of prosecution under \nexisting gun laws. Some have suggested that instead of making sensible \nchanges to our public safety laws to prevent gun violence, Federal law \nenforcement officials should focus exclusively on existing laws. I \nshare some of that frustration, but it is not a valid excuse to do \nnothing. Improvements in the enforcement of existing laws and efforts \nto give law enforcement officials better tools to do their jobs are not \nmutually exclusive. Those are efforts that complement each other.\n  A recent article in the Washington Times documented that gun \nprosecutions were in decline beginning in the Bush administration and \nsuggests that having a Senate-confirmed Director of the Bureau of \nAlcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives would significantly help law \nenforcement.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the article be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Apr. 4, 2013]\n\n            Drop-off in Gun Prosecutions Began Before Obama\n\n                         (By David Sherfinski)\n\n       Gun rights groups have singled out President Obama for \n     failing to prosecute gun crimes, but the drop in cases filed \n     actually began a decade ago under the Bush administration.\n       Analysts said the decade long drop underscores the key \n     ingredient in gun prosecutions--a willingness to make them a \n     priority.\n       Prosecutions dipped at the beginning of the Clinton \n     administration but by 1998 had begun to rise again, tripling \n     between then and 2004, when the federal government filed more \n     than 11,000 cases. Since then, however, prosecutions have \n     steadily fallen again, dipping below 8,000 prosecutions a \n     year over the last three years.\n       Now, in the wake of last year's shooting spree that claimed \n     the lives of 20 schoolchildren and six adults at Sandy Hook \n     Elementary, all sides in the gun debate say they want to see \n     the laws on the books enforced. But the experience of the \n     last 10 years suggests that's easier said than done.\n       ``Presidents and administrations--their priorities are \n     based partly in their ideology and their policy interests, \n     and to a certain extent by the issues of the day,'' said John \n     Hudak, a fellow at the Brookings Institution who studies gun \n     policy.\n       Looking at trends over the last quarter century, two \n     emerge: First, there were two annual peaks in gun \n     prosecutions, both of them under Republican presidents, in \n     1992 and 2004. Second, even though prosecutions have dropped \n     in recent years, the yearly number of gun cases is still much \n     higher now than in the pre-9/11 era, according to the \n     Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) at Syracuse \n     University, which tracks the numbers.\n       What's tougher to explain is exactly why prosecutions had a \n     several-year spike at the end of the Clinton administration \n     and the beginning of President George W. Bush's tenure.\n       Mr. Hudak said the 1999 Columbine school shooting may have \n     spurred an increase in prosecutions, and so could the spate \n     of terrorist attacks in 1998, 2000 and, finally, the Sept. 11 \n     attacks on New York and Washington.\n       And David Chipman, a former agent with the Bureau of \n     Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), said some of \n     the increase may have been due to a Justice Department \n     program that started in 2001 and targeted gun crimes in \n     localities across the country.\n       ``That kind of commitment put a lot of numbers on the \n     board,'' said Mr. Chipman, who works with the gun-control \n     group Mayors Against Illegal Guns. ``I think it worked as \n     designed, which is to create a deterrent.''\n       The ATF, perhaps unfairly, began to receive criticism after \n     the increase that some of their efforts were duplicative, and \n     officials had to re-prioritize, Mr. Chipman said.\n       ``You can't just prosecute 20,000 cases in one year--there \n     just isn't that infrastructure,'' he said.\n       ``Any kind of looking at the numbers and drawing some sort \n     of conclusion that people are doing more or less--you've got \n     to get beyond that. Because you could be comparing apples and \n     oranges.''\n       Gun prosecutions require both cases to be developed by \n     investigators, and charges to be filed by prosecutors.\n       The TRAC study's numbers said prosecutors turned down 38 \n     percent of referrals in 2002, while last year they declined \n     32 percent of referrals.\n       That puts much of the focus on ATF, the lead agency for \n     developing the cases.\n       Mr. Hudak said one factor in recent decline could be the \n     fact that ATF has been without a permanent director for six \n     years. In January, Mr. Obama nominated acting agency director \n     B. Todd Jones to become its permanent head, but Mr. Jones is \n     still awaiting Senate confirmation.\n       ``The lack of leadership has its effects on priorities,'' \n     Mr. Hudak said. ``And the ATF has such a diverse area of law \n     enforcement that they have to make choices about what they \n     prosecute.''\n       In the wake of last year's shooting rampage at Sandy Hook \n     Elementary School, gun-rights groups have argued the solution \n     is more prosecutions of gun crimes, not more restrictions on \n     law-abiding firearms owners.\n       ``Prosecuting criminals who misuse firearms works,'' NRA \n     CEO Wayne LaPierre testified to Congress earlier this year. \n     ``Unfortunately, we've seen a dramatic collapse in federal \n     gun prosecutions in recent years. That means violent felons, \n     gang members and the mentally ill who possess firearms are \n     not being prosecuted. And that's unacceptable.''\n       Attorney General Eric. H. Holder, Jr. told the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee earlier this year that prosecuting gun \n     crimes is part of the answer and can serve as a deterrent, \n     but that preventing people who acquire guns to commit crimes \n     from getting them in the first place is crucial as well.\n       ``We have limited resources and we have to try to figure \n     out where we want to use those limited resources, and one has \n     to look at why the gun was denied, and then make a \n     determination whether or not we should use those limited \n     resources to bring a prosecution against that person,'' Mr. \n     Holder said, referring to people who have been denied \n     firearms because of the FBI's National Instant Criminal Check \n     System (NICS).\n       Mr. Chipman acknowledged that with different \n     administrations, ideologies, result in different priorities, \n     which could affect the numbers, but he cautioned that drawing \n     conclusions about causes and effects can be risky.\n       ``You can't possibly know what those numbers mean until you \n     layer the political environments at the time and the cases \n     being pursued,'' he said.\n       Both Mr. Hudak and Mr. Chipman discounted one potential \n     reason for the spike in prosecutions--the 1994 enactment of a \n     ban on military-style semiautomatic rifles. That ban ran from \n     1994 until its expiration in 2004, and those latter years \n     coincide with the recent peak, which started in 1998.\n       But the analysts said that was likely unrelated.\n       ``The assault weapons ban was a shell of what the original \n     writers intended it to be,'' Mr. Hudak said. ``I can't \n     imagine there would be a four-year lag in the effect of the \n     assault weapons ban on prosecutions.''\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. As I said in January, America is looking to us for \nsolutions, for action, not sloganeering, demagoguery, or partisanship. \nThat is why it is disappointing to hear that some Senators pledge to \nprevent Senate consideration of these proposals by a filibuster. It is \nespecially disappointing that some who claim to support regular order \nand a transparent legislative process accord that process no deference.\n  Mr. President, there are only 100 of us who have the privilege to \nserve at any given time in this wonderful body. We represent 325 \nmillion Americans. How can we talk to those Americans and say: We won't \neven vote. We won't even let it come to a vote. We don't have the guts \nto stand up and vote yes or no.\n  Tell that to the families in Newtown, CT. Tell that to the families \nin Aurora, CO. Tell that to the people of the United States, that the \nSenate is not willing to stand up and vote either yes or no; they want \nto vote maybe.\n  I am a gun owner. I live in a State with a lot of gun owners. I have \nthe courage to stand here and vote. I want to vote. Some will agree \nwith my votes, some will disagree, but this Senator feels it is part of \nhis sworn duty to vote--vote yes, vote no, but vote.\n  In the Judiciary Committee, we held three public hearings and four \npublic markups on this legislation. We gave them full and fair \nconsideration. We debated and considered amendments--\n\n[[Page S2494]]\n\nDemocratic and Republican amendments. The distinguished Presiding \nOfficer is a member of that committee. He knows the debate we had and \nthe votes we held. What a filibuster would do now is obstruct the open \nprocess of the Senate consideration of gun violence prevention \nlegislation, and it is wrong. It is absolutely wrong. It demeans the \nSenate, and it turns our backs on 325 million Americans who expect \nbetter.\n  I have worked with Senator Collins and others to provide a real-world \nand commonsense solution to the problem of gun trafficking and straw \npurchasing. That is the course I urge the Senate to take. Let's go \nforward and vote. Vote yes, vote no, but vote. Have the courage to \nvote. Don't turn our backs on the families who have suffered so much.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my full statement be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to Colonel \nSteve Strobridge, USAF, Retired, in recognition of his distinguished \nservice to his country.\n  For nearly 44 years, first for 24 years in the Air Force, and \nconcluding with 19 years with the Military Officers Association of \nAmerica, Colonel Strobridge has worked tirelessly for the men and women \nof the military, their families, veterans and their survivors.\n  Raised in Vergennes, VT, Colonel Strobridge entered the United States \nAir Force in 1969 as a second lieutenant following graduation from ROTC \nat Syracuse University.\n  After several assignments as a personnel officer and commander in \nTexas, Thailand, and North Carolina, he was assigned to the Pentagon \nfrom 1977 to 1981 as a compensation and legislation analyst at \nHeadquarters USAF. Following assignments as Chief, Officer Assignments \nand Assistant for Senior Officer Management at HQ, U.S. Air Forces in \nEurope, he was selected to attend the National War College at Fort \nMcNair in 1985.\n  Colonel Strobridge served as Deputy Director and then as Director, \nOfficer and Enlisted Personnel Management in the Office of the \nSecretary of Defense from 1986-1989. In this position, he was \nresponsible for establishing Department of Defense policy on military \npersonnel promotions, utilization, retention, separation, and \nretirement. In June 1989, he returned to Headquarters USAF as Chief of \nthe Entitlements Division, assuming responsibility for Air Force policy \non all matters involving pay and entitlements, including military \nretirement system and survivor benefits, and all legislative matters \naffecting active and retired military members and their families.\n\n[[Page S2495]]\n\n  Following his retirement from the Air Force in January 1994, Colonel \nStrobridge joined the Retired Officers Association of America and \nserved as Deputy Director and since 2001 he has served as Director of \nGovernment Relations for the Military Officers Association of America, \nMOAA.\n  Under Colonel Strobridge's professional stewardship, MOAA has played \na vital role as a principal advocate of legislative initiatives to \nimprove readiness and the quality of life for all members of the \nuniformed service community--active, reserve, and retired, as well as \ntheir families.\n  Defense News noted recently that ``no major [military] personnel-\nrelated legislation has been enacted since 1994 without Colonel \nStrobridge's imprint.''\n  Colonel Strobridge has worked closely with, and has been a valuable \nresource for, the U.S. Senate and the Senate Armed Services Committee \nin particular as we enacted a wide range of benefit improvements for \nour military personnel. He provided input or support for legislative \nproposals on a wide range of issues, including TRICARE for Life; the \nelimination of VA disability pay offsets to military retired pay for \nmany retirees; restoration of full cost of living adjustments to \nretired pay; elimination of the offset to survivor annuities by Social \nSecurity payments; TRICARE benefits for reserve families; and many \nother initiatives that have been invaluable in improving the long-term \nretention in our Armed Forces.\n  Colonel Strobridge's long and distinguished career of leadership and \npersonal dedication to fostering readiness by protecting every \nservicemember's welfare is an inspiration and a continuing lesson to \nall who care about the men and women of our military. My best wishes go \nwith him and his family.\n  Colonel Strobridge, on the occasion of your retirement as Director of \nGovernment Relations for the Military Officers Association of America, \nI salute you on behalf of all the men and women, past and present, who \nwear the uniform.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/09/senate-section/article/S2495-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2495]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THANKING STAFF\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Madam President. I would like to address the current \nsituation in Ukraine, an important country in the heart of Europe, a \nbellweather for democratic development in the region, and the current \nChairman-in-Office of the OSCE.\n  Let me first welcome the release from prison Sunday of former \nUkrainian Minister of Internal Affairs and leading opposition figure \nYuri Lutsenko. Mr. Lutsenko had been convicted on politically motivated \ncharges and incarcerated since December 2010. President Yanukovych's \npardon of Mr. Lutsenko is an encouraging step in the right direction. I \nalso welcome the pardon of former Environment Minister Heorhiy \nFilipchuk, who also served as a member of Ms. Tymoshenko's Cabinet and \nhad been released last year after his sentence was suspended. By \npardoning Mr. Lutsenko and Mr. Filipchuk, President Yanukovych is \nindicating not only a willingness to resolve what has been a major \nirritant in Ukraine's relations with the United States and the EU, but \nalso a stain on Ukraine's democratic credentials.\n  At the same time, I remain deeply concerned about the politically \nmotivated imprisonment of Ukrainian opposition figure and former Prime \nMinister Yulia Tymoshenko, who has been incarcerated since August 2011.\n  Mrs. Tymoshenko's case stands out as a significant illustration of \nUkraine's backsliding with respect to human rights, democracy, and the \nrule of law since she was defeated by President Yanukovych in February \n2010. The United States, EU, and Canada have repeatedly expressed \nconcerns about the application of selective justice against political \nopponents, their flawed trials, conditions of detention, and the denial \nof their ability to participate in last October's parliamentary \nelections.\n  As Chairman of the Helsinki Commission, which has long been committed \nto Ukraine's independence and democratic development, I am especially \nmindful of Ukraine's 2013 OSCE chairmanship. Like any Chair-in-Office, \nUkraine faces formidable tasks in leading a multilateral organization \nthat operates on the basis of consensus, which includes 57 countries \nranging from mature democracies to oppressive dictatorships. The United \nStates wants Ukraine to succeed, but the reality is that the \npolitically motivated imprisonment of Ms. Tymoshenko casts a cloud over \nits chairmanship. A Chair-in-Office must itself have strong democratic \ncredentials if it is to succeed in encouraging reform in other \ncountries.\n  Furthermore, democratic regression in Ukraine has harmed U.S.-\nUkrainian bilateral relations, preventing a traditionally strong \npartnership from realizing its full potential. It has also slowed down \nthe process of Ukraine's drawing closer to the EU, which is that \ncountry's stated foreign policy priority, manifested in the still-\ndelayed signing of the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement. More than half \na year has gone by since the unanimous adoption of S. Res. 466, calling \nfor the release of Yulia Tymoshenko.\n  The Ukrainian authorities now need to follow up on the important step \nthey have taken in freeing Yuri Lutsenko. They need to free Ms. \nTymoshenko and restore her civil and political rights. By demonstrating \ncommitment to the rule of law and human rights principles embodied by \nthe OSCE, Ukraine will strengthen the credibility of its chairmanship \nand show it is serious about being a full-fledged member of the \ndemocratic community of nations.\n  I strongly urge the Ukrainian government to resolve the case of Ms. \nTymoshenko.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/09/senate-section/article/S2495-3", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2495-S2496]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HONOR FLIGHT 2013\n\n  Mr. BEGICH.

His vision is failing and it is his fervent wish to see \n`his' memorial while he still can with his own eyes. Mr. McBride joined \nthe Army in\n\n[[Page S2496]]\n\n1952 and served during the Korean conflict as a photographer for \nintelligence.

Madam President, today I offer \nmy heartfelt thanks to an educator who has been committed to the \nwellbeing of the children of my State.\n  At the close of this school year, Darrell Mueller will retire as \nsuperintendent of the Andes Central School District, concluding a \ncareer in education of over 30 years. After earning his bachelor's \ndegree in elementary school education in 1979, Darrell began teaching \nelementary school in Nebraska in 1980. In 1982 he moved to Yankton, SD \nwhere he served as a teacher and principal at Sacred Heart School. \nWhile serving as a principal and teacher, he completed a master's \ndegree in elementary administration at the University of South Dakota \nin 1984. From 1988 to 2006, Darrell was the principal of Platte \nElementary School. He was chosen as a 2004 Milken Educator for his \ndedication to teaching and his leadership in the field. In 2006, \nDarrell accepted the position of superintendent of the Andes Central \nSchool District.\n  As superintendent of the Andes Central School District, Darrell has \nbeen a strong advocate for the integration of technology in the \nclassroom. The use of technology has enriched and broadened the \neducational opportunities for students within the school district. \nUnder Darrell's leadership, the district now enjoys a child to laptop \nratio of 2 to 1 in grades kindergarten through 6 and 1 to 1 in grades 7 \nto 12. Darrell has also sought to expand access to quality early \nchildhood education during his tenure as superintendent. Through \nworking with the local Head Start, Andes Central was able to combine \nservices to create a more comprehensive preschool program for its \nstudents.\n  While serving as superintendent of Andes Central, Darrell implemented \na system to monitor student progress using curriculum-based \nmeasurement. When the South Dakota Department of Education began \ndeveloping a new statewide accountability model for measuring student \nachievement, it sought Darrell's expertise. He has made valuable \ncontributions to this effort as a member of the Next Generation \nAccountability Council.\n  Darrell is currently serving as the president of the Impacted Schools \nof South Dakota. As a leader within our State's Impact Aid community, \nDarrell and I have met on many occasions, and I have appreciated his \ninsights related to public policy and funding for the Impact Aid \nprogram.\n  Darrell's passion for his community extends far beyond the classroom. \nHe serves as the vice president of the Charles Mix County Lake \nRestoration Organization, a nonprofit group formed to restore the \ncondition of Lake Andes. Through the work of concerned local citizens \nlike Darrell, they hope to improve and preserve the beauty of Lake \nAndes for many generations to come. The local economy, the area's \nenvironment and wildlife, and the recreational opportunities for the \nsurrounding community have been improved by these efforts.\n  Darrell is regularly known to say, ``It's all about what's right for \nthe kids.'' This motto represents one of Darrell's guiding principles \nand has served as words of advice for the many educators, \nadministrators, and school personnel who Darrell has mentored over the \nyears. Darrell will leave a lasting legacy within the Andes Central \nSchool District and in the lives of countless young people. On the \noccasion of his retirement, I congratulate and thank Darrell for his \nservice to his community and selfless dedication to students in South \nDakota. I wish him, his wife Diane, and their family a happy and \nhealthy retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/09/senate-section/article/S2496-2", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2496]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/09/senate-section/article/S2496-3", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2496]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/09/senate-section/article/S2496-4", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2496]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME\n\n  The following bills were read the first time:\n\n       S. 680.

A bill to amend the Truth in Lending Act to establish a \nnational usury rate for consumer credit transactions; to the Committee \non Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, after the financial crisis of 2008 we \nlearned that predatory lending hurts more than just families who lost \nmoney. Predatory\n\n[[Page S2503]]\n\nlending can affect entire communities and often targets the most \nvulnerable in our society--low-income families and seniors.\n  Under Wall Street reform we addressed predatory mortgage practices \nand granted the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau the authority to \nsupervise nonbank lenders, including payday lenders. We know who these \npayday folks are. I know them because their businesses are located a \nfew blocks from where I live in Springfield, IL, on Macarthur \nBoulevard--title loans, payday loans. However, we failed to cap once \nand for all the annual interest rate that predatory payday lenders can \ncharge for a loan.\n  In 2012 payday loan volume reached an estimated $45 billion for \nstorefront and online loans. This does not include deposit advance \nloans that banks make to consumers every day.\n  If we look a bit deeper, we find that nearly 76 percent of payday \nloans are made to pay off a previous payday loan. It is a vicious \ncycle. Someone borrows some money, then they cannot pay it back with \nhigh interest rates, and they borrow more--deeper and deeper in debt. \nFifty percent of payday borrowers ultimately default on their loans.\n  With numbers like these, we can only assume payday lenders' profit \ndepends on families rolling their payday loan over eight to nine \ntimes--racking up new fees every single time.\n  Predatory lenders should not be allowed to pad their pockets with the \nhard-earned money of families that are barely getting by. These are \nfamilies who are not even able to survive paycheck to paycheck.\n  That is why I am introducing the Protecting Consumers from \nUnreasonable Credit Rates Act. I wish to thank my colleagues--Senators \nBlumenthal, Boxer, Merkley, and Whitehouse--for their cosponsorship of \nthis bill and their commitment to protect consumers from predatory \nlending practices.\n  This bill would establish a 36-percent annual interest rate cap for \nall types of consumer credit--a cap that is supported by 100 years of \nhistory according to a new report released by the National Consumer Law \nCenter.\n  That is the same Federal cap that is currently in place for loans \nmarketed to military servicemembers and their families.\n  Why would we protect military service families from predatory lending \nand no one else? I will tell you why. We found out that many of them in \nthe military ran into financial difficulties from time to time, and the \npayday lenders--the title loans and the rest of them--were camping out \noutside of military facilities anxious to loan members of the military \nthe money they needed to get by until the next payday. Many of our \nsoldiers got so deeply in debt to payday loans they had to leave \nmilitary service. They just could not keep up with it. So we passed a \nlaw that said we are going to protect military families from this \nexploitation. Our soldiers and sailors, airmen and marines are worth \nthat much more to us that we are going to protect them.\n  Well, there is an obvious question: Why are we not protecting \neverybody? If this kind of exploitation is wrong when it comes to \nmilitary families, why is it not wrong for the rest of America? It \nsurely is. We should expand the law that curbed payday, car title, and \ntax refund lending around military bases to include all types of credit \nfor all borrowers. If a lender cannot make money on a 36-percent APR, \nmaybe the loan should not have been made in the first place.\n  Fifteen States and the District of Columbia have already enacted laws \nthat protect homeowners from high-cost loans, and 34 States and the \nDistrict of Colombia have limited annual interest rates to 36 percent \nor less for one or more types of consumer credit. But there is a \nproblem with the State-by-State approach: Many of these State laws are \nriddled with loopholes. Out-of-State lenders evade these State caps. \nCash-strapped customers are then subjected to 400 percent annual \ninterest rates for payday loans, on average, and 300 percent for car \ntitle loans, on average--400 percent interest? Our bill would require \nall lending to conform to the 36-percent APR limit, thereby eliminating \nthe loopholes that have allowed predatory practices to flourish in many \nStates around the country.\n  Let me be clear. I understand that sometimes families fall on hard \ntimes. They need a loan to make ends meet. They are desperate. Most of \nus have been there at one time or another in our lives. That is why I \nhave included in this bill the flexibility for responsible lenders to \nreplace payday loans with reasonably priced, small-dollar loan \nalternatives. The bill allows lenders to exceed the 36-percent cap for \none-time application fees that cover the cost of setting up a new \ncustomer account and a processing cost, such as late charges and \ninsufficient funds fees. I urge more institutions to offer small-dollar \nloans with consumer protections, including rates below 36 percent.\n  We know it can be done because banks and credit unions--many of \nthem--are offering those loans.\n  I would also like to talk about a new type of payday lending--the \nonline payday loan. Senator Merkley of Oregon and Senator Tom Udall of \nNew Mexico are leading the effort to crack down on these types of \nlenders who use the Internet to evade State law. Their bill, called the \nSafe Lending Act, would address online payday lending, such as hiding \nbehind layers of anonymously registered Web sites and so-called lead \ngenerators. The bill would allow consumers to cancel a debit and \nprohibit payday lenders from circumventing State usury laws. We need \nmore effective enforcement on online payday lenders. The Safe Lending \nAct would do it.\n  Another type of payday lending that I am afraid is on the rise is \nbank payday lending. Several banks offer deposit advance loans, which \nclosely resemble the structure of payday loans, with up to 365 percent \ninterest rates and short-term balloon payments.\n  Earlier this year, Senators Blumenthal and I wrote a letter to the \nFederal Reserve, OCC, and the FDIC urging them to prohibit banks from \noffering predatory payday loans. Today, a petition signed by 157,000 \nAmericans will be delivered to the same regulators calling on then to \nban banks from offering payday loan products. I hope they do.\n  My first mentor in politics was the late Senator Paul Douglas of \nIllinois. He was a Ph.D. in economics who served here from 1948 to \n1966. I met him at the end of his career when I was a college student. \nHe wrote:\n\n       Compound the camouflaging of credit by loading on all sorts \n     of extraneous fees, such as exorbitant fees for credit life \n     insurance, excessive fees for credit investigation, and all \n     sorts of loan processing fees which rightfully should be \n     included in the percentage rate statement so that any \n     percentage rate quoted is meaningless and deceptive.\n\n  Senator Douglas said that 50 years ago. The name of the fees may have \nchanged over time, but the goal of nickel-and-diming families out of \ntheir hard-earned money, unfortunately, has not changed.\n  By instituting a 36-percent cap on annual interest rates, the \nProtecting Consumers from Unreasonable Credit Rates Act would eliminate \nproducts that are predatory by their nature. The bill is supported by \nmore than 40 consumer groups. They include Americans for Financial \nReform, the Center for Responsible Lending, the Consumer Federation of \nAmerica, and the National Consumer Law Center.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nthese organizations in support of this legislation.\n                                                    April 9, 2013.\n     Re Protecting Consumers from Unreasonable Credit Rates\n\n     Hon. Richard J. Durbin,\n     Hart Senate Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Durbin: Thank you for introducing the \n     ``Protecting Consumers from Unreasonable Credit Rates Act of \n     2013,'' which would extend the 36 percent usury APR cap for \n     military families enacted in the Military Lending Act of 2006 \n     to all consumers. A fair rate cap will protect consumers and \n     curb abuses in the high-cost small dollar loan market. The 36 \n     percent rate cap set by your legislation would permit \n     responsible lending to consumers with less-than-perfect \n     credit while restraining harmful terms.\n       Currently, consumers pay triple-digit rates for car title \n     and payday loans (including those offered at traditional \n     storefronts, online, and by banks). A large body of research \n     has demonstrated that these products are structured to create \n     a long-term debt trap that drains consumers' bank accounts. \n     Indeed, the lack of underwriting, high fees, short loan \n     terms, single balloon payment, and access to a borrower's \n     checking account\n\n[[Page S2504]]\n\n     as collateral ensure that most borrowers have no choice but \n     to take out additional loans to pay off the initial payday or \n     car title loan. A properly structured federal usury cap puts \n     all creditors on a level playing field without undermining \n     any additional consumer protections in the states.\n       Although many states cap rates for some forms of credit, \n     banks can undermine these protections by exporting their weak \n     home-state limits on credit costs to other states across the \n     country. It is vitally important for Congress to set the \n     outside limit on the cost-of-credit to curb abusive lending.\n       We enthusiastically support the Protecting Consumers from \n     Unreasonable Credit Rates Act of 2013.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Consumers from \n     Unreasonable Credit Rates Act of 2013''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) attempts have been made to prohibit usurious interest \n     rates in America since colonial times;\n       (2) at the Federal level, in 2006, Congress enacted a \n     Federal 36 percent annualized usury cap for service members \n     and their families for covered credit products, as defined by \n     the Department of Defense, which curbed payday, car title, \n     and tax refund lending around military bases;\n       (3) notwithstanding such attempts to curb predatory \n     lending, high-cost lending persists in all 50 States due to \n     loopholes in State laws, safe harbor laws for specific forms \n     of credit, and the exportation of unregulated interest rates \n     permitted by preemption;\n       (4) due to the lack of a comprehensive Federal usury cap, \n     consumers annually pay approximately $23,700,000,000 for \n     high-cost overdraft loans, as much as $8,100,000,000 for \n     storefront and online payday loans, and additional amounts in \n     unreported revenues from bank direct deposit advance loans \n     and high-cost online installment loans;\n       (5) cash-strapped consumers pay on average 400 percent \n     annual interest for payday loans, 300 percent annual interest \n     for car title loans, up to 3,500 percent for bank overdraft \n     loans, and triple-digit rates for online installment loans;\n       (6) a national maximum interest rate that includes all \n     forms of fees and closes all loopholes is necessary to \n     eliminate such predatory lending; and\n       (7) alternatives to predatory lending that encourage small \n     dollar loans with minimal or no fees, installment payment \n     schedules, and affordable repayment periods should be \n     encouraged.\n\n     SEC. 3. NATIONAL MAXIMUM INTEREST RATE.\n\n       Chapter 2 of the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1631 et \n     seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 140B.

A bill to amend the Federal Crop Insurance Act to extend and \nimprove the crop insurance program, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, today I have just introduced legislation \nin regards to our efforts to, once again, try to address a farm bill on \nbehalf of our Nation's farmers, ranchers, and dairy producers. We \npassed a farm bill in the last session. It was one of the first bills \nwhere we achieved regular order, i.e., where every Senator had an \nopportunity to have an amendment. Many did. We had over 300, as I \nrecall--``we'' meaning the distinguished chairperson of the committee, \nSenator Stabenow, and myself as the ranking member at that particular \ntime. Thank goodness not all 300 demanded a vote, but I think we voted \n73 times, and we passed the bill by a good bipartisan margin. I hope we \ncan get back to that. The chairperson, Senator Stabenow, is working \nvery diligently to produce another farm bill.\n  I see the distinguished majority leader coming to the floor. He was \nvery helpful in our pleas to bring a farm bill to the floor. Senator \nReid actually asked me whether we could do it in 3 days as I promised, \nand we did it in 2\\1/2\\, so with cooperation we got that done. It was, \nas I say, the first bill we took up in the last session where we did \nhave regular order. I hope we can keep that record. I thank the \nmajority leader for his efforts in that regard.\n  Why am I bringing this up now, even before we mark up in regards to \nthe bill I have introduced? Basically because farmers are now planting \ntheir crops despite 3 years of drought and all sorts of hardship and \nall sorts of uncertainty about a farm bill. We have extended the 2008 \nact. It is not what we wanted to do in the Senate, but that is what \nhappened. So we hope that does not happen again.\n  We hope we can work again in a bipartisan way to produce a product \nthat not only helps the farmer and rancher--we have, what, 6 billion \npeople in the world today? We are going to go to 9 billion people in \nthe next several decades. Everybody in the Senate should be aware of \nthat. It is an overriding issue. We are going to have to double our \nagricultural production if we are going to continue our efforts to feed \nthis country in a troubled and hungry world.\n  That even has national security implications. Show me a country that \ndoes not have a stable food supply, and I will show you a country that \nis in a lot of trouble. Just read about the Mideast and what is \nhappening there.\n  What do farmers want? I mean what was the No. 1 issue we heard--\n``we'' meaning, again, Senator Stabenow and I--when we held farm \nhearings both in Michigan, specialty crops, and Kansas, program crops: \nwheat, corn, beans et cetera? Over and over the No. 1 issue was crop \ninsurance.\n  We were trying to get out of the business or stay out of the business \nof farmers planting for the government. And ``farm subsidies,'' that \nalways makes the headlines in the Washington Post for people who for \nthe most part have never been west of the Missouri River.\n  Despite all the criticisms of the farm program, I think we \nconsolidated and reformed 100 different programs. We saved roughly $23 \nor $24 billion--the first authorizing committee to do so. We also \nstrengthened and improved crop insurance. That was the No. 1 issue for \nfarm lenders, the No. 1 issue for farmers and ranchers, and the No. 1 \nissue for everybody involved in the miracle of agriculture that allows \nus to do this so Americans have the safest, most abundant, and cheapest \nfood in the history of the world.\n  I hear time and time again from our producers and their lenders that \ncrop insurance is the cornerstone of the farm safety net. I hear it at \nhome in Kansas. We hear it in the Agriculture Committee. I hear it \nevery time I speak to producers in Washington. I know the chairperson \nof the committee, Senator Stabenow, has heard the same. All members of \nthe committee know the value of crop insurance. I mean all members of \nthe distinguished Committee on Agriculture.\n  As we head into another round of farm bill debates, and I know the \nchairperson would like to get it done, would like to mark up a bill in \nthe next 3 weeks--I don't know if that is possible; we will see. We did \nthat in 2\\1/2\\ days in the last session of Congress. Whether we can do \nthat again I am not sure--I am constantly asked for my priorities, and \nmy priorities reflect what I have heard from farmers and ranchers at \nhome and their bankers and their lenders and everybody who wants \nconsistency. The No. 1 priority for the farm bill is crop insurance. If \nyou doubt the importance of crop insurance, just look what it has \nprovided the past 2 years. It is rather unbelievable.\n  Since 2011 we have faced the worst drought since the Dust Bowl in \nKansas, Oklahoma, and Texas--and in Nebraska now. In so many cases \nNebraska is worse than any other place.\n  Then we had the massive flooding along the Mississippi and the \nMissouri Rivers, and hurricanes that simply devastated the Northeast as \nwell. I don't know what we have done to Mother Nature, but she sure has \nnot been very kind to us. In 2012 the drought worsened and spread \nacross the Midwest to States such as Missouri, Iowa, and Illinois. Now \nthat we are into the Midwest, now we have headlines about the drought. \nWhen we burn up almost every year out in our country, on the high \nplains, nobody gets any attention. But they get it in the Midwest, they \nget a lot of attention.\n  Just months after all of this, why are producers still now tuning up \ntheir equipment and preparing their fields to put seed in the ground \nonce again? A farmer never puts any seed in the ground without hope for \na crop. Hope springs eternal with regard to agriculture, and here we \nare, once again, having that capability. It is not because of some \nagriculture ad hoc disaster program that seems to appear every even-\nnumbered year in this body or any package for farmers, through a \ndisaster program, that would represent some kind of help. Farmers are \nback on their feet and producing the food that feeds a troubled and \nhungry world because of crop insurance. They are able to put the seed \nin the ground again because they managed their risk and protected their \noperations from Mother Nature's destruction through the purchase of \ncrop insurance.\n\n  This is the one component of the farm safety net that requires a \nproducer to have skin in the game. We could apply that to a lot of \nother things that we debate on the floor of the Senate. Don't forget, \ncrop insurance only provides coverage if a producer actually has a \nloss. So a Kansas farmer might pay into the crop insurance system for \nyears or a farmer or a producer from Wisconsin or, for that matter, \nanyplace that values agriculture. But if they never experience a severe \nloss or a natural disaster, they will never receive a penny. Simply, \ncrop insurance allows producers a way to manage risk so they can \ncontinue to provide a stable and secure food supply and pass their \noperations on to their children.\n  If that is not a success story in the partnership between government \nand private industry and America's farmers, I don't know what is. But \njust because a program is successful doesn't\n\n[[Page S2506]]\n\nmean there is not room for improvement. That is what the bill is that I \njust laid at the desk.\n  Crop insurance is a big tent with plenty of room under it. The \nprogram already protects more than 250 million acres of cropland in the \nUnited States, more than two-thirds of the eligible acres that we farm. \nBut there are still acres that are not protected and producers who \ncannot afford to purchase this kind of protection they need. The more \nproducers under that crop insurance tent, and the more that are \nprotected from disaster, the more stable our food supply and our rural \neconomies will be.\n  We made great progress, as I said, last year in the Agriculture \nCommittee and on the Senate floor improving crop insurance to bring \neven more people under the tent. Today, I am here again to continue our \nwork to preserve and protect and strengthen our crop insurance. My \nlegislation enhances the Crop Insurance Program by including something \ncalled a Supplemental Coverage Option. The acronym for that is SCO. It \nallows producers to purchase additional crop insurance coverage on an \narea yield and loss basis. It also amends the Federal Crop Insurance \nAct to make available separate enterprise units for irrigated and \nnonirrigated acreages of crops in counties. That is especially helpful \nin regard to what we are going through with another year of drought.\n  The bill also addresses the declining Actual Production History, that \nis a yield problem, by increasing the county transitional yield. So if \nsomeone did not have a yield in their farm, but they could then go to \nthe county yield average, they would be in a lot better shape. They \nwould be helped out in one area and not another area. This would help \nin that respect.\n  The legislation also sets budget limitations. Yes, we set budget \nlimitations on future renegotiation of what is called the Standard \nReinsurance Agreement by requiring any savings realized in the SRA \nrenegotiations to return to the Crop Insurance Program, to return to \nthe RMA programs. Let's not use the Crop Insurance Program where we \nhave savings and then use it as a bank for other programs. That has \nhappened far too often--in the Senate and in the House.\n  The legislation also continues the Stacked Income Protection Plan--\nthat is known as STAX--for the producers who plant upland cotton. That \nmeans all or most all of the products that we produce in the \norganizations that represent those commodities and represent those \nfarmers who grow the commodities are in agreement--and cotton was very \nhelpful in the last farm bill.\n  Meanwhile, in order to help pay down the debt and reduce the deficit, \nthe legislation is fully paid for by the elimination of direct payments \nwhich saves taxpayers $5 billion over 10 years. Overall, the \nlegislation will strengthen the farm safety net while at the same time \nsaving taxpayers billions of dollars and preventing costly ad hoc \nagriculture disaster programs.\n  There are those who don't believe in a good Crop Insurance Program. \nWhen Mother Nature doesn't behave and they get into these terribly \ndestructive forces of nature--and it always happens. As I have said, it \nusually happens on an even-numbered year. If they are going to get into \na disaster program and take part in it, they better darn well make sure \nto say: OK. I am going to help you out, but don't put your name on it. \nBecause when it comes out to the Farm Service Agency and all the people \nwho are supposed to implement it at the Department of Agriculture and \nin almost every county in the United States, it is a disaster to \nimplement and the farmer doesn't get the kind of help he or she needs. \nThat is not the way to do business. The cost annually is far greater \nthan the Crop Insurance Program.\n  Overall, the legislation will strengthen the farm safety net while at \nthe same time saving the taxpayers billions of dollars. It prevents ad \nhoc agriculture disaster programs. That is what the farmer wants. The \nfarmer wants certainty. If he takes part in a Crop Insurance Program, \nhe has certainty and he has protection.\n  There was a time in the not-so-distant past when the farm programs \ngreatly distorted planning decisions. As chairman of the House \nAgriculture Committee, back in the day, along with others in the \nSenate, we did everything we could to eliminate those distortions. Why? \nBecause with the World Trade Organization, we could get in a lot of \ntrouble.\n  I am confident this proposal is the responsible path forward for \nagriculture, and it will not drive planting decisions or leave farmers \nto plant for the government program rather than the marketplace. With \nthis crop insurance legislation, we have the opportunity to improve on \nan enormously successful program and continue good farm program \npolicies.\n  We have a lot of work ahead of us to pass and sign a farm bill into \nlaw. A lot of farmers and a lot of ranchers are depending on it, and \nthere are a lot of people who benefit from it. As I said, we have the \nlowest cost and safest food in the history of the world, and it allows \nus to use our wherewithal in a humanitarian way to be of help to those \nin need who undergo some very difficult circumstances. As I have \nindicated, agriculture involves our national security.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Agriculture \nCommittee, farmers across the country, and industry partners to enact \nthis legislation as part of the farm bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota:\n  S. 684. A bill to amend the Mni Wiconi Project Act of 1988 to \nfacilitate completion of the Mni Wiconi Rural Water Supply System, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, today I am introducing \nthe Mni Wiconi Project Act Amendments of 2013 to facilitate completion \nof a rural water supply system that was first authorized in the 100th \nCongress. As a freshman Member of the House of Representatives, I \nintroduced legislation authorizing construction of the Mni Wiconi \nProject to bring quality, treated Missouri River water to several \nIndian reservations and a large, rural area of my State. Prior to Mni \nWiconi, these areas faced insufficient and, too often, unsafe drinking \nwater.\n  In the authorizing statute, Congress found that the United States has \na trust responsibility to ensure that adequate and safe water supplies \nare available to meet the economic, environmental, water supply, and \npublic health needs of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, Rosebud \nIndian Reservation, and Lower Brule Indian Reservation. Treated \ndrinking water from the Missouri River now reaches most areas on these \nthree reservations, as well as the 7 county area of the West River/\nLyman-Jones Rural Water System.\n  Nearly 25 years after it was first authorized, this critically \nimportant project is very close to completion. Because appropriations \nfailed to keep pace with projected timelines, however, additional \nadministrative costs have cut into construction funding. As a result, \nthe project needs an increase in the cost ceiling and extension of its \nauthorization in order to be completed. Without these adjustments, some \nportions of the Oglala Sioux Rural Water Supply System and Rosebud \nSioux Rural Water System will remain incomplete. The legislation I have \nintroduced today addresses this shortfall and also directs other \nFederal agencies that support rural water development to assist the \nBureau of Reclamation in improving and repairing existing community \nwater systems that are important components of the project.\n  Our Federal responsibility to address the need for adequate and safe \ndrinking water supplies on the Pine Ridge, Rosebud and Lower Brule \nIndian Reservations remains as important as ever. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues to advance this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SCHATZ (for himself and Ms. Hirono):\n  S. 690.

Res. 94\n\n       Whereas U.S.S. Thresher was first launched at Portsmouth \n     Naval Shipyard on July 9, 1960;\n       Whereas U.S.S. Thresher departed Portsmouth Naval Shipyard \n     for her final voyage on April 9, 1963, with a crew of 16 \n     officers, 96 sailors, and 17 civilians;\n       Whereas the mix of that crew reflects the unity of the \n     naval submarine service, military and civilian, in the \n     protection of the United States;\n       Whereas at approximately 7:47 a.m. on April 10, 1963, while \n     in communication with the surface ship U.S.S. Skylark, and \n     approximately 220 miles off the coast of New England, U.S.S. \n     Thresher began her final descent;\n       Whereas U.S.S. Thresher was declared lost with all hands on \n     April 10, 1963;\n       Whereas in response to the loss of U.S.S. Thresher, the \n     United States Navy instituted new regulations to ensure the \n     health of the submariners and the safety of the submarines of \n     the United States;\n       Whereas those regulations led to the establishment of the \n     Submarine Safety and Quality Assurance program (SUBSAFE), now \n     1 of the most comprehensive military safety programs in the \n     world;\n       Whereas SUBSAFE has kept the submariners of the United \n     States safe at sea ever since as the strongest, safest \n     submarine force in history;\n       Whereas, since the establishment of SUBSAFE, no SUBSAFE-\n     certified submarine has been lost at sea, which is a legacy \n     owed to the brave individuals who perished aboard U.S.S. \n     Thresher;\n       Whereas from the loss of U.S.S.
