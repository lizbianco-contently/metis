Mr. President, I rise in support of the legislation we \nare about to vote on that will provide an additional $9.7 billion to \nthe National Flood Insurance Program. Without these funds, the program \nwould have run out of money next week, leaving over 100,000 victims of \nHurricane Sandy in the lurch.\n  I would like to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for \nallowing this vote to go forward. They have acted honorably. The good \nnews is the House passed this bill this morning and the Senate will \npass it in a few minutes.\n  With the passage of this bill, hurricane victims from Staten Island \nto east Long Island, as well as in New Jersey, can rest assured their \nflood insurance will have enough money to pay out claims. We had no \nchoice but to pass this provision because the Federal Government is \nobligated to reimburse when people have floods if they have paid in \ntheir flood insurance.\n  While this bill is important, it is something we were almost \nobligated to do, and we should not have parades down the street because \nthis bill has passed.\n  The major work of helping the victims of Sandy is still ahead of us. \nThe bad news is we even had to go through this dog-and-pony show in the \nfirst place.\n  Last month, the Senate passed a good, strong bill to help all victims \nof Hurricane Sandy, and the House simply could have taken it up and \npassed it. In fact, they promised to vote on a similar provision before \nthe last Congress ended.\n  Unfortunately, this changed at the last moment. We do not need to get \ninto the whys right now; we just want it to happen, and we are worried \nthe second major portion of this relief bill will not get through the \nHouse in the form it should.\n  We need the House to pass not only the $9 billion they passed this \nmorning but the $51 billion that contains the\n\n[[Page S20]]\n\nbulk of the aid people need, without which we will not be able to \nrecover. To be a bride and left at the altar once is bad enough. To be \nleft twice would be unconscionable.\n  As I said, this is a good step that we are going to pass this $9 \nbillion flood insurance bill. This is a good but small first step. It \nis a small downpayment on the much larger amount of aid we need to get \nthrough Congress.\n  Let me tell you what is not in this bill. What is not in this bill is \nhelp for every homeowner who does not have flood insurance and lost \ntheir home or suffered major damage.\n  Homeowners are waiting for Congress to pass relief the way we did for \nIrene and Katrina and so many other disasters so they can get a \ncontractor to sign a contract, get a bank to make a loan until they \nknow that the Federal Government will be there to reimburse, as it \nalways has in the past.\n  What is not in this bill is aid to small businesses, small \nbusinesspeople who are hanging by their fingernails, who might not be \nable to restart their businesses unless there is Federal aid, which was \nalready in the Senate bill. Unless it comes back from the House and we \nare able to pass it in the Senate, they will be hurt.\n  What is not in this bill is dollars to rebuild our highways and, most \nimportantly, our mass transit systems that were flood, damaged. The MTA \nalone has taken out a $5 billion loan, but it will be in real financial \njeopardy unless it is assured that it will be reimbursed for all the \ndamage that Sandy caused to our railroads and our tunnels and our mass \ntransit system--our amazing mass transit system that brings 3\\1/2\\ \nmillion people off and on Manhattan Island every single day.\n  What is not in this bill is help to bring the electricity system back \nup to snuff so there will not be major blackouts, so people can be \nassured of their electricity.\n  What is not in this bill is help for all of the communities that laid \nout hundreds of millions and billions of dollars for the cleanup. Their \ntaxpayers will foot the bill unless Congress does what it has always \ndone: step to the plate when a major disaster occurs and have the \nFederal Government help the locality. There has been a wisdom for 100 \nyears that when an area is afflicted by a disaster, we unite as a \nnation and come together and help that part of the country whether it \nis New Mexico or California or Louisiana or Florida or Missouri or \nNorth Dakota or New York or New Jersey.\n  This bill is a first step to deal with flood insurance. It is the \neasiest part. The hard stuff is still ahead of us. We await the House \nreturning in a week and a half, and we hope and expect, in fact, that \nthey will vote the full $51 billion remainder. We hope and expect, in \nfact, that they will not put in legislative language that prevents \nmoney from getting to homeowners and communities that need it \ndesperately right away.\n  The draft we have seen contains some major changes from the Senate \nbill that would make it very difficult for NIH, the Army Corps, and \nother parts of the government to spend the dollars that are needed \nefficiently and quickly and to place them where they go. We beseech the \nHouse to finish its business, to finish the major part of its business, \nand approve the $51 billion that will make up the rest of the $60.\n  We beseech them not to hamstring the local homeowners and businesses \nand governments with language that would prevent recovery. We beseech \nthem to move quickly. Of course, the ideal would be for them to pass \nthe same bill that the Senate passed in the waning hours of the last \nsession. If they cannot, we will have to get legislation through the \nbody again. But through the generosity of the majority leader, he has \nassured us it will be the first order of business when we return. So we \nhave to move forward.\n  As we have seen, this is not going to be easy. There are many bumps \nin the road and obstacles that we cannot yet see. For sure they will \narise and for sure we will have to grapple with them.\n  This vote needs to be the beginning of the process. It cannot \ncertainly be the end, and it certainly cannot be the middle. We cannot \njust pass the $9 billion bill and then say that is it. We cannot let \nthe House pass this and rest on its laurels. We in New York and New \nJersey cannot let our guard down. Not until the full $60 billion \narrives in New York and New Jersey can we stop working. So I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation and then alert them to keep the \nvictims of Sandy in New York, New Jersey, and elsewhere in their \nthoughts so that we can continue to support the region when we return.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schumer). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in the years I have served in legislative \nbodies, which is quite a long time now, it is interesting to see how \ndifferent people approach the legislative process. I have learned over \nthe years there is nothing more important than people working hard. You \nhave to be tenacious to get legislation passed.\n  The leader of passing Sandy over here--and I am confident when we get \nback in a couple of weeks after the House works on theirs, the same \ndynamic will be here--the senior Senator from New York has worked \ntirelessly to get legislation passed. He has led a team effort of \nSenators from New Jersey and his partner, Senator Gillibrand, but the \nleader, the quarterback, has been the Senator from New York.\n  The work he has done not only in the Senate, but having the many \nyears of experience he had in the House of Representatives, the \nPresiding Officer, the senior Senator from New York, worked day and \nnight making phone calls, personal contacts with people in New York and \nNew Jersey who could call House Members and have them pass this \nlegislation.\n  On the way back from the joint session dealing with the electoral \nvote count, he walked up and grabbed me--did not grab me, but we talked \nfor several minutes walking back to the Senate--the majority leader \nfrom the House of Representatives. He worked extremely hard on this. He \nworked hard on it. I indicated to him that I had received calls from \npeople in New York who appreciated very much his efforts to try to get \nthis thing passed.\n  I really do believe it is important that I have the record reflect \nthe reason we have gotten as far as we have on Sandy is because of the \nsenior Senator from New York. It is too bad that it has taken so long. \nWhen we had that devastation from Katrina, we were there within days \ntaking care of Mississippi, Alabama, and especially Louisiana--within \ndays. We are now past 2 months with the people of New York and New \nJersey.\n  The people of New Orleans and that area, they were hurt but nothing \nin comparison to what happened to the people in New York and New \nJersey. Almost 1 million people have lost their homes; 1 million people \nlost their homes. That is homes, that is not people in those homes. So \nI think it is just unfortunate that we do not have the relief for New \nYork and New Jersey and the rest already. It has to be done. We have to \nmeet the needs of the American people when an act of God occurs.\n  So I, on behalf of the entire Senate, and certainly my Democratic \ncaucus, express my appreciation to the legislative initiative and the \nlegislative expertise of my friend from New York, an experienced \nlegislator in the State of New York, the House of Representatives, and \nthe Senate. He has done a masterful job.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/04/senate-section/article/S20-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S20]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, today marks my 28th time here \non the Senate floor to talk about the Production Tax Credit for wind \nenergy. Twenty-seven other times I stood here--oftentimes joined by \nlike-minded colleagues from around the country--to urge Congress to \nextend this vital tax credit, which has helped the wind\n\n[[Page S21]]\n\nindustry create tens of thousands of jobs and spur tens of billions of \ndollars in investment. And Coloradans have been with me the whole way.\n  Well, Mr. President, 27 must be a lucky number--because today, I am \nthrilled to use my time to thank my colleagues for making the extension \nof the PTC a reality. Earlier this week, Congress came together across \nparty lines to do the right thing to assist our fragile economic \nrecovery.\n  Throughout my previous efforts here on the floor, I talked a lot \nabout jobs. From Colorado to Kansas, Oregon and Maine and the \nCarolinas, my remarks always came back to one simple but true \nstatement: the PTC equals jobs.\n  These are good-paying jobs for hardworking Americans. From gearboxes \nin Georgia to wind blades in Rhode Island to towers in Colorado, the \nconstruction of wind turbines has invigorated an entire supply chain. \nFactories in the Midwest have been retooled to make steel components \nthat are shipped to places like Iowa, where cutting edge composite \nmaterials are used to make state of the art blades for turbines that \nultimately create wind farms built with labor from local construction \nworkers. That's thousands of jobs across this country.\n  Wind generates clean, renewable energy, which helps move our country \ntoward a more secure energy future. This is clean, American energy that \ndoes not produce carbon dioxide pollution--and by making it here at \nhome, it helps us become less reliant on foreign nations for our energy \nsecurity.\n  These wind farms are also paying dividends to towns and counties \nacross America, benefitting the families who live there and the small \nbusinesses that operate there. The tax revenues from wind turbines have \nallowed communities to build new schools and roads, as well as provide \nother basic services. These additional sources of income have been \nespecially important during the recent economic downturn, where the \nbudgets of many states and rural communities have been stretched thin. \nQuite simply, wind energy jobs have a positive ripple effect wherever \nthey are.\n  I am relieved that after months of uncertainty as to whether or not \nthe PTC would be extended, Congress has finally done the commonsense \nthing, making sure we did not lose this vital tax credit. Although it \nwas my preference to have Congress act much sooner and prevent the \nthousands of layoffs that resulted from the uncertainty Congress \ncreated, I am pleased that we have finally acted for the good of our \nconstituents.\n  With the passage of the PTC, the wind industry can get back to doing \nthe important work of moving America toward a clean energy future, a \ndirection that will benefit middle-class American workers and ensure \nAmerica leads the world in clean energy manufacturing, even as foreign \ncompetitors like China work to surpass us.\n  And the final language passed by Congress will have an immediate and \npositive impact on the construction of new wind farms. This year, \nprojects will be eligible to take advantage of the PTC if construction \nbegins before the end of 2013, rather than racing to complete the \nproject by the end of the year. This commonsense change in the law will \nencourage larger, longer-term projects over the course of the next few \nyears as opposed to just in 2013, which is particularly important since \nCongress did not pass the extension until the very last minute.\n  I was not alone in this fight. Coloradans motivated me to keep up the \nbattle the entire time. And many of my colleagues--both Republicans and \nDemocrats--joined me. In particular, I would like to thank Senator \nGrassley of Iowa--the ``father of the wind PTC''--for his efforts to \nget this done.\n  Senator Baucus and Senator Bingaman have also been long-time \nchampions of the PTC on the Finance Committee, and were an integral \npart of the fight to extend it. My good friend and colleague from \nColorado Senator Bennet has also been a strong supporter of the PTC, \njoining me in speeches, letters, and legislation. Senator Moran of \nKansas has been right there with us as well.\n  And many more members from both sides of the aisle and both sides of \nthe Capitol supported these efforts. The broadly bipartisan and \nbicameral group was driven by a mutual commitment to creating jobs, \nsimultaneously improving our economy and economic competitiveness while \nmoving us toward a more secure energy future.\n  Despite the importance of the wind PTC extension, there is still much \nmore work to do. This extension only lasts until the end of 2013. So, \nalthough we might want to take a breather, we cannot. Instead, we must \nbegin work today on a path forward that will give the wind industry \nmuch-needed certainty over the long term. Without certainty, businesses \ncannot do the long-term planning that is necessary to robustly grow and \nadd good-paying American jobs. And, this time, we cannot wait until the \nlast minute to do it. We must work together to find a plan that allows \nthis industry to reach maturity and thrive while also being fiscally \nresponsible. Yes, that means a gradual phase-out of the wind PTC in the \ncoming years--but my goal is to get Congress to also work together on \ncomprehensive energy legislation that creates long-term certainty for \nall energy sources. I strongly believe that any national energy policy \nwe develop should reflect the success Colorado has had as an all-of-\nthe-above energy State.\n  Again, I want to thank my colleagues who worked alongside me to push \nthe wind PTC extension over the finish line. This is hugely important \nto maintaining American jobs, manufacturing prowess, and energy \nsecurity. It's a win for Colorado and it's a win for us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/04/senate-section/article/S21-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S21-S22]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       DYSFUNCTION OF THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the \ndysfunction of the Senate, the rules of this governing body, and what \nwe need to do to change them in order to take on the big challenges we \nface as a Nation.\n  These last 2 years have created an unprecedented sense among the \nAmerican people that Congress isn't measuring up to the needs of our \ntime.\n  This is especially troubling when we are up against tremendous \nchallenges: the most profound jobs crisis in a generation; skyrocketing \nincome inequality; and a tax system that unfairly rewards the wealthy \nand well-connected over working Americans who are struggling to make \nends meet.\n  But unfortunately, we can't tackle this jobs crisis or the problem of \ninequality until this body, our revered Senate, restores the ability to \ndebate, deliberate and decide on strategies to take our Nation forward.\n  I believe that reforming the filibuster is one of the most critical \nsteps we can take to repair the Senate and rebuild confidence in \nCongress's ability to govern.\n  When I first came to the Senate, it was 1976. What I saw then could \nhardly have been farther from the Senate of today. Routine use of the \n``filibuster''--or to put it differently, a routine use of an objection \nto a simple majority vote--has turned the U.S. Senate into a \nsupermajority body.\n  In short, the U.S. Senate, which once claimed to be ``the world's \ngreatest deliberative body,'' has possibly become ``the world's least \ndeliberative body.'' The institution of the Senate will not function \nagain until we end the abuse of the filibuster. We must put an end to \nthe silent, secret filibuster that is paralyzing the Senate.\n  The use of this objection has expanded dramatically in recent \ndecades. What was once used only to block legislation that conflicted \nwith deep, personal principles is now used as a routine political \nstrategy for deliberate paralysis. In the 6 years Lyndon Baines Johnson \nwas majority leader, he dealt with one filibuster. Leader Reid during \nhis 6 years as majority leader: 391.\n  One casualty of the partisan filibuster is executive branch and \njudicial nominations. The Senate's power to advise and consent, as \nprovided in the Constitution, was never intended to enable the \nlegislators to inflict deep harm on the other branches of government. \nYet that is exactly what has happened. Nearly one out of every eleven \njudgeships is vacant--triple the rate of 8 years ago. Our court systems \nare severely strained, with 27 vacancies rated as ``judicial \nemergencies'' at the end of 2012.\n  This is deeply damaging, for several reasons. It prevents the \nlegislature from responding to the Nation's pressing problems and \nseverely hampers the executive and judicial branches, which rely on the \nSenate to confirm their leaders. Because the Senate is unable\n\n[[Page S22]]\n\nto fulfill, on a timely basis, its constitutional responsibility to \n``advise and consent'' to nominations, judgeships and executive branch \nmanagement positions simply go unfilled.\n  Now, you may wonder, if this system is so dysfunctional, why did our \nFounding Fathers ever design the Senate like this? The answer is that \nthey didn't. The Founders envisioned the Senate and House passing \nlegislation and confirming nominations by a simple majority, reserving \nsupermajority for special purposes such as constitutional amendments \nand overriding a veto.\n  Alexander Hamilton, in fact, foresaw the current state of affairs in \nthe Federalist Papers, observing that a supermajority requirement would \nhave the ``tendency to embarrass the operations of government,'' and \nwould create ``tedious delays, continual negotiation and intrigue, \n[and] contemptible compromises of the public good.''\n  As a result of the Senate's silent filibuster, the Senate failed to \npass almost all of the appropriations bills in the last Congress. The \nnumber of bills the Senate passes has hit new lows, with fewer than 3 \npercent of bills introduced in the last Senate ever passing.\n  That is why yesterday, with my partner, Senator Tom Udall, I \nintroduced a resolution that will enhance debate and limit obstruction.\n  Core to these reforms is the ``talking filibuster.'' A Senator can \nstill object but she or he must be continuously on the floor \nmaintaining a debate on the subject. This still allows Senators to \nblock a simple majority vote on a bill of profound consequence, but \nthey have to spend a lot of time and energy to do so.\n  This reform would have two major consequences. By requiring time and \nenergy to filibuster, it would strip away filibusters on \nnoncontroversial issues that are currently used just to obstruct and \ndelay, allowing the Senate to debate and decide issues. Second, it puts \nthe filibuster on display before the American people, increasing \ntransparency and accountability. If you filibuster, you must make your \ncase before your colleagues and the public, so they know who is \nobstructing and what your arguments are, and allow the people to judge \nif you are a hero or a bum.\n  Senate dysfunction is compromising the Senate's ability to respond to \nmajor issues facing our Nation.

RUIZ\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, just a few weeks ago \nAmericans gathered all across the Nation to commemorate Veterans Day. \nIt is a day that we set aside to remember, and express our gratitude \nto, the men and women who have served in our Armed Forces. It is a day \nto honor the heroes among us, and those who, sadly, have left us.\n  Today I wish to pay tribute to an American hero, Army SGT Clinton K. \nRuiz. Sergeant Ruiz died on October 25 while on patrol in Uruzgan \nProvince, Afghanistan, from injuries sustained from small arms fire. He \nwas just 22 years old. He leaves behind a wife, Kira, and a baby son, \nCaleb.\n  As we face the tragedy of this brave young soldier's death, it is \nimportant too that we remember his life. Sergeant Ruiz's journey on \nthis Earth ended far too soon, but his memory among those whose lives \nhe touched, and in a nation's gratitude, will endure.\n  Clinton Ruiz was born on March 14, 1990. He graduated from Murrieta \nValley High School in Murrieta, CA, and enlisted with the Army in 2009. \nHe was assigned to A Company, 9th Military Information Support \nBattalion, 8th Military Information Support Group. Sergeant Ruiz was \ndeployed to Afghanistan in September.\n  In the decade that our military has been fighting in Afghanistan, \nthousands of our fellow citizens have volunteered to serve. These \ncourageous men and women risk their own safety to protect the safety of \nothers. They leave their homes and their loved ones to defend the \nfreedoms that we hold dear. Over 2,000 of these heroes have paid the \nultimate price, for our freedoms, in Afghanistan.\n  Words cannot lessen the sorrow of the loved ones who grieve for \nSergeant Ruiz now. Words cannot fully express the gratitude our Nation \nowes this valiant soldier. We can only remember, indeed we must never \nforget, the sacrifice that SGT Clinton Ruiz made in service to our \ncountry.\n  President Kennedy said that ``stories of past courage . . . can \nteach, they can offer hope, they can provide inspiration. But, they \ncannot supply courage itself. For this, each man must look into his own \nsoul.'' Sergeant Clinton Ruiz had such courage. In the face of great \ndanger, at great risk to himself, he went where his country sent him. \nHe was awarded the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart. He kept the \npromise he had made to serve. Our Nation is forever in his debt.\n  Sergeant Ruiz loved his family. He loved his country. He made the \nultimate sacrifice defending it. To Sergeant Ruiz's family, I offer my \ndeepest sympathies. We honor Sergeant Ruiz's courage. We remember his \nsacrifice. And we mourn your loss.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/04/senate-section/article/S22-2", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S22-S23]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      REMEMBERING BEN EISEMAN, MD\n\n Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, today I wish to pay \ntribute to Dr. Ben Eiseman, a world-renowned surgeon, a true American \nand a great friend of mine. Dr. Eiseman was an accomplished man in \nevery sense of the word and is survived by his wife of 67 years, his \nfour children and five grandchildren.\n  Dr. Eiseman was an incredibly intelligent individual and an avid \nself-learner. He graduated from Yale University in 1939 and went on to \nreceive his Medical Degree from Harvard University in 1943. Dr. Eiseman \npossessed extraordinary scientific ingenuity that led him to discover \nan astonishing number of medical complications and cures.\n  In addition to these discoveries, Dr. Eiseman also authored and \ncoauthored over 450 scientific papers, was principal editor of seven \nbooks on general surgery and was a retired Rear Admiral in the U.S. \nNavy Reserves--he was very proud of his service to his country. \nWhenever I mentioned Dr. Eiseman to other surgeons, whether they live \nin another State or another country, he or she would instantly know his \nname.\n  I worked with Dr. Eiseman during my time as Executive Director of the \nColorado Outward Bound School. At that time he was chairman of the \nBoard of Trustees, and he was a major influence in my life, an \nincredible friend, and a wise mentor. One of the reasons Dr. Eiseman \nand I were so close had much to do with our shared love for the great \noutdoors. He was one of the few people I knew who had climbed all of \nthe mountains in Colorado over 14,000 feet.\n  I recall a time almost three decades ago--while I was still with \nOutward Bound--when Dr. Eiseman accompanied me on a winter climbing \ntrip for advanced climbers. He was always asking us to think through \neach and every step. In asking the right questions and challenging us \nalong the way, he made me a stronger leader.\n  One reason we all respected Dr. Eiseman was because we all admired \nhis unassuming ruggedness. On this trip, where it was at least 10 \ndegrees below zero, none of us were surprised as Dr. Eiseman walked \naround comfortably in his Converse high-tops while the rest of us \nmuddled around, freezing in our high-tech, insulated boots. When it was \ntime to rest for the night, most of the team rolled out their latest \nand greatest sleeping bags, while Dr. Eiseman pulled out the equivalent \nof a lawn chair cushion to curl up on for the night. Always the task \nmaster, Dr. Eiseman was the first one up in the morning to make sure \nthat everyone, including myself, was thoroughly prepared to take on \nwhatever was in store for us each day. It was just the way he was \ntough, rugged and focused.\n  Dr. Eiseman inspired me by the way he commanded respect from all who \ninteracted with him. Sure, he was seen as intimidating by some, but for \nthose who knew him, they were treated to his wonderful sense of humor. \nHe was a dedicated community leader, outdoorsman, and patriot.\n  I am deeply saddened by the loss of my friend Ben Eiseman, but I know\n\n[[Page S23]]\n\nthat his work here on this Earth changed the lives of thousands and \nthat his legacy will not be forgotten.\n  May his memory live on for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/04/senate-section/article/S23-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S23]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING GEORGE SMITH\n\n Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, just a few weeks ago \nour Nation commemorated Veterans Day. It is above all a day of \nremembrance and gratitude. A time to remember the courage and sacrifice \nof the brave men and women who have served our Nation in the Armed \nForces. It is a day when we pay tribute to the heroes among us. And to \nthose who are no longer with us.\n  Today I wish to honor one of those heroes. On Tuesday, October 30, \nour Nation lost a great American, Navajo Code Talker George Smith. Mr. \nSmith was born on June 15, 1922, in Mariano Lake, NM, and was Salt \nPeople Clan, born for Black Streak Wood People Clan. In 1943, he \nenlisted with the Marines. He was trained as a Navajo Code Talker and \nachieved the rank of corporal while serving in the Pacific. Corporal \nSmith fought in battles in Saipan, Tinian, Ryukyu Islands. He also \nserved in Okinawa, Hawaii, and Japan. His brother, Albert Smith, also \ntrained as a Code Talker, and served with him.\n  The Marines who constituted the Navajo Code Talkers were small in \nnumber, but monumental in significance. Their skills were crucial to \nAmerican victory in the Pacific during World War II. They turned their \nlanguage into an unbreakable code. In battle after battle, in the thick \nof ferocious combat, they used that code as a powerful weapon in \nsecuring Allied victory. Our Nation will never forget what George \nSmith, and his brother, Albert Smith, and all of their fellow Code \nTalkers accomplished.\n  Their service is all the more poignant in that they fought for \nfreedom in a world that did not always accord freedom to them. When \nAmerica entered World War II, the U.S. government had only recognized \nNative Americans as citizens for 17 years. In some places, tribal \nmembers still did not have the right to vote. 45,000 of the 350,000 \nNative Americans in the U.S. at that time served in the war. This \ntradition of military service by Native Americans continues to this \nday. Native Americans have the highest rate of service of any ethnic \ngroup.\n  Mr. Smith was awarded the Congressional Silver Medal. After the war, \nCode Talker Smith returned home and dedicated himself to his family and \ncommunity. He worked at Fort Wingate in disposing of old ammunition, \nand then as a mechanic at Fort Wingate Trading Post. Eventually, he \nwent to Fort Defiance, where he served as a shop foreman. He later \nworked as a heavy equipment mechanic in Shiprock.\n  Code Talker George Smith was blessed with a long life. When he passed \naway last month, he was 90 years old. He will be missed by his family, \nhis friends, and his community, and he will always be remembered by a \ngrateful nation. I extend my deepest sympathies to his family. We are \nforever in his debt. I hope that those who mourn him now will find \ncomfort in all that he accomplished. His life made a difference. His \ninvaluable service during World War II saved lives. Our Nation is free \nbecause of heroes like Code Talker George Smith.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/04/senate-section/article/S23-2", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S23]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING VIRGIL WALLACE\n\n Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, in the annals of our \nNation's military history, the story of the defenders of Bataan will \nlong live in our collective memory. One of those great defenders, Mr. \nVirgil Wallace, recently passed away at the age of 99. Mr. Wallace \nsurvived the 4 month battle, the infamous Bataan Death March, and 3 \nyears of horrendous captivity. He was the State of New Mexico's oldest \nBataan veteran.\n  Our Nation is forever in debt to the extraordinary courage and \nsacrifice that Mr. Wallace and the ``Battling Bastards of Bataan'' \ndemonstrated in the early days of World War II. Their heroic resistance \nhelped slow the Japanese advance, allowing crucial time for the Allied \nforces to reorganize and eventually reverse Japan's progress. They \nplayed a crucial role in our Nation's history. I am proud to have \nsponsored legislation to award these valiant soldiers the Congressional \nGold Medal.\n  The Japanese attack on the Philippines in December, 1941, just hours \nafter the attack on Pearl Harbor, led to 4 months of intense combat. \nOutnumbered, outgunned, Mr. Wallace and his fellow soldiers put up a \ndesperate fight. For 4 months, they struggled, they valiantly fought, \nagainst impossible odds, and without hope of resupply, until they \nfinally surrendered.\n  Their suffering was only just beginning. The brutal Bataan Death \nMarch was followed by terrible conditions in Japanese prisons and work \ncamps. Starvation. Torture. Forced work. And, for so many of these \nbrave men, death. By the time they were rescued, toward the end of the \nwar, half of New Mexico's 1,800 soldiers serving in Bataan had died. \nAnother 300 would die from complications related to their captivity \nwithin a year of returning to the U.S. Mr. Wallace was held captive for \nmore than 3 horrific years.\n  Virgil Wallace was awarded the Bronze Star and numerous other \ncommendations for his heroic service. After the war, he returned to New \nMexico, where he worked for the Department of Transportation and later \nCarrie Tingley Hospital in Truth or Consequences.\n  Our Nation will long remember this courageous soldier, a man who gave \nso much in service to his country. Mr. Wallace is one of the last of a \nlegendary band of brothers, who represented the very best of who we \nare. In the dark days of the beginning of World War II, they showed \nAmerica's fighting spirit and inspired a nation.\n  I extend my deepest sympathies to Mr. Wallace's family and friends. I \nhope that you will find comfort in your memories of his long, and \ndistinguished, life. We honor his valor and his example, and we mourn \nyour loss.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/04/senate-section/article/S23-3", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S23]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/04/senate-section/article/S23-4", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S23]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/04/senate-section/article/S23-5", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S23]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:32 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 41.
