Mr. President, following my remarks and those of the \nRepublican leader, if any, the Senate will be in a period of morning \nbusiness until 5:30 p.m. this evening. At 5:30 there will be three \ncloture votes on nominations of U.S. district judges: Lauck of \nVirginia, Sorokin of Massachusetts, and Boulware of Nevada.\n  (Ms. Hirono assumed the Chair.)\n\n\n                           Las Vegas Tragedy\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, it is with a lot of sadness that I come to \nthe floor today following the tragic event that took place in Las Vegas \nyesterday.\n  I spoke with Sheriff Gillespie this morning.\n  Two police officers were having lunch in a pizza restaurant on Nellis \nBoulevard in Las Vegas, and two people walked in, shot them both and \nkilled them, took their guns and their badges, put some kind of a flag \nover them representing whomever they were representing, and walked \nacross the street to Wal-Mart and killed an innocent woman. Then they \nkilled themselves. All the details are not available, but there is no \nquestion they were murdered in cold blood--for no reason other than the \nweirdness or craziness of this couple.\n  So all of Nevada mourns the loss of our neighbors, our friends and, \nin the case of Officers Alyn Beck and Igor Soldo, our protectors. My \nsympathy goes to their family members and loved ones. This hits very \nclose to home.\n  Many years ago when I practiced law, I brought a fine young man into \nmy law firm named Claude Zobell. Claude has been with me for all these \nyears. He ran my Washington office. He went on to become dean of a law \nschool, and he is now an attorney for a hotel chain in Tennessee. But \nhe has helped me all these years fill out my financial disclosures. His \nnephew, his wife's mom's son, was one of the police officers killed. \nAnne, Claude Zobell's daughter, works for me here in Washington. I \ntalked to him this morning. The cousin was killed. The pain that people \ngo through in these unnecessary tragedies and senseless shootings is \nawful.\n  No words can undo the unspeakable act which claimed the lives of \nthese two men. They have families--wives, children. So that their \nfamilies know, not only is Nevada grieving but all of America is \ngrieving.\n  My thanks go to the law enforcement officers who were called in after \nthe killings to work at that scene and the scene across the street, \nputting their lives in peril every step of the way. It seems that our \nlaw enforcement officers respond to these scenes every day--in Santa \nBarbara, in Seattle, and on and on with the names of cities where \npeople are shot. I so appreciate these law officers every day putting \ntheir lives on the line.\n  We take for granted here in the Senate the people looking after us. \nThere are people out there who are so evil, who try every day to do \nharm to not only the Presiding Officer, not only me, but to people who \nwork in these buildings, the tourists that come to these buildings. So \nif there are any complaints about having too much security, come to me \nand I will try to explain why we need it.\n  So without elaborating, my deepest sympathies are with the families \nof those who died.\n  We in Congress have a duty to put in place legislation that helps \nprevent these deranged, weird, and evil people who carry out such \nsavage acts of violence. A step in the right direction would be \nbackground checks so that people who are criminals, who are deranged, \ncan't buy a gun. The American people are depending on us to pass \nlegislation to prevent gun violence to safeguard our communities, \nschools, and families.\n  There is not a single Senator I know of who says: Let's get rid of \nall the guns; let's make sure that people don't\n\n[[Page S3482]]\n\nhave guns. We are not saying that. Listen to what we are saying.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Madam President, we have a lot to do this week. We need to confirm \nsome people as we are still way behind.\n  Senator Sheldon Whitehouse--the junior Senator from Rhode Island has \nbeen a real trooper--has been so enthused and so invigorated; he has \ntraveled the country alerting the American people to the dangers of \nwhat is happening to our world regarding climate. It has been a one-man \nshow. Tonight he is going to work with a number of Senate Democrats in \nhighlighting the need for congressional action to fight climate change. \nI applaud him for his work on this issue. He has focused like no other \non our changing world.\n\n\n                          Veterans Health Care\n\n  The care of our Nations' veterans is another issue we need to talk \nabout, and we will talk about that today, also.\n  Last Thursday Senator Bernie Sanders, Chairman of the Senate \nVeterans' Affairs Committee, and Senator John McCain announced a \nbipartisan agreement on legislation to address patient wait times at VA \nhospitals. The details of the agreement are not in writing yet. At \nleast they weren't a few minutes ago. They are being drafted. The \nlegislation is a comprehensive approach to ensure that veterans are \ngetting the care they deserve. This agreement is very important to all \nNevadans, to all Americans, and of course it is extremely important to \ncountless veterans and their families.\n  Recently, along with America and this body, I was shocked to learn \nthat VA hospitals all over the country--and in Nevada in particular--\nwere affected by dangerous wait times for patients. That is \nunacceptable. This legislation worked on by Sanders and McCain is not \ngoing to solve all the problems that exist, but it is certainly putting \nthe VA on the right track.\n  This bipartisan agreement aims to improve accountability throughout \nthe entire Veterans Affairs Administration, holding VA officials \nresponsible for poor job performance. One of the things we learned is \nthat they covered up wait times. Why? Because by doing that they would \nget bonuses at the end of the year. So that will stop.\n  This legislation will also take big steps in addressing accessibility \nto health care at VA institutions nationwide. The agreement will allow \nveterans facing long delays to seek health care outside of the VA--in \nprivate doctors' offices, community health centers, military hospitals, \nand other places that Sanders and McCain are now working on.\n  Their legislation will expedite the hiring for VA doctors and nurses \nand authorize 26 new medical facilities nationwide.\n  In addition to improving access and accountability throughout the \nVeterans Administration, this bipartisan agreement addresses other \nimportant issues such as GI eligibility for surviving spouses and in-\nstate tuition to veterans enrolling in colleges and universities.\n  Much will depend on the details of the final bill, but Senators \nSanders and McCain have put together an agreement which is good for \nAmerican veterans and our country. I commend them. I commend especially \nSenator Sanders for his leadership in this issue since he has been \nworking on veterans care. It is a clear indication how much he values \nthis Nation's servicemembers. In John McCain we could not have a more \nexemplary person dealing with VA health care as a result of his having \nspent long periods of time in VA facilities around the country as he \nwas recovering from his ordeal in Vietnam. So I appreciate him in many \ndifferent ways, but today for his labors in bringing both sides to the \ntable to get something done on behalf of our veterans.\n  I look forward to this legislation coming before us, and I will be \nhappy to schedule a vote on it as quickly as possible. America's \nveterans are depending on us to complete this legislation to ensure \nthat our veterans get the care and resources they were promised by a \ngrateful Nation.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  It appears there is no one rushing to the floor to speak, so I would \nask unanimous consent that the Presiding Officer announce the business \nof the day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the leadership time \nis reserved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/09/senate-section/article/S3482-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3482-S3487]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Thank you, Madam President.\n\n\n                          Higher Education Act\n\n  Last year something happened in Washington, DC, that most of us in \nthe Senate and most Americans would like to see more of. The President \nand the Republican House of Representatives and a bipartisan group here \nin the Senate worked together to reform the student loan program. It is \na lot of money, and it affects a lot of students.\n  Every year the Federal Government loans about $100 billion to \nstudents who attend colleges and universities around this country. We \nhave 6,000 of those higher education institutions. In addition to those \nloans--which, of course, students pay back--the Federal Government \ngrants about $33 or $34 billion each year in Pell grants--up to \n$5,645--which students don't pay back.\n  Last year we were in this usual pattern that has developed around the \nCongress where student loans become a semi-annual political stunt. \nEvery 2 years, before an election, one party or the other would show up \nwith a student loan proposal to try to appeal to students, hoping that \nstudents and others in America would reward them with their votes.\n  Last year we changed that for new student loans. The President and \nthe Republican House of Representatives and the Democratic Senate in a \nbipartisan way worked together to reform the student loan program by \napplying a market-priced system to the $100 billion or so we loan every \nyear, and saying to the students: We will give you the benefit of that. \nYou don't have to wait for Congress to engage in its semi-annual \npolitical stunt to know what your loan is.\n  The result was that for loans for undergraduate students, which are \n85 percent of all the loans, we were able to cut in half the interest \nrate on student loans for undergraduate students in America without \nraising taxes and without raising the debt. That resulted from \noverwhelming bipartisan support in the Senate. It had strong support of \nthe chairman of the Senate education committee, the HELP Committee, \nSenator Harkin and I supported it, as did many others. It worked the \nway the Senate is supposed to work.\n  This body is for the purpose of taking an important issue, which \nstudent loans are, having an extended debate on it until we come to a \nconsensus, which we did, and then coming to a result the American \npeople could approve. We did that as well.\n  Now this week we are seeing something entirely different. Senate \nDemocrats would interrupt a serious discussion that is going on in the \nSenate education committee about reauthorizing the Higher Education \nAct, which was first enacted in 1965. Senator Harkin, the Senator from \nIowa, is our chairman. I am the ranking Republican on that committee. \nWe have had 10 hearings. We have been hard at work. We have had \nterrific testimony, some very good ideas about the student loan program \nand about a lot of issues affecting higher education. We are doing what \nwe are supposed to do in the Senate: We are trying to come to a \nconclusion so that we can recommend in a bipartisan way to this full \nbody what to do about higher education for the next several years, \nincluding student loans.\n  Yet, all of a sudden, we hear that Senate Democrats want to show up \non the floor with a partisan, political stunt that interrupts the work \nof the Senate education committee, and here is what they would do: They \nwould\n\n[[Page S3483]]\n\nraise individual income taxes, they would raise the debt, and, based \nupon data from the Congressional Research Service, they would give some \nformer students with old student loans a $1-a-day Federal subsidy to \npay off their loans.\n  Let me go back over the terms of this proposal just so everybody has \nit in mind. The main issue is $1 a day subsidy. That is the benefit. It \ndoesn't do anything for current or new students. For some former \nstudents--according to the Congressional Budget Office, maybe half the \nloans--the taxpayers will give them $1 a day to help pay off their \nstudent loans.\n  Along with that, we increase the Federal debt by up to $420 billion. \nThat debt is out of control to begin with. The Congressional Budget \nOffice has estimated that over the next 10 years we are going to go \nfrom $200 billion to $800 billion just to pay interest on the debt. In \n10 years we will be spending more on interest on our national debt than \nwe will on national defense. Yet for this political stunt we are going \nto run that up another $420 billion maybe or close to $\\1/2\\ trillion.\n  That is not all. To pay for all of this, we are going to raise \nindividual income taxes by $72 billion. This is a familiar proposal. \nThis is the class warfare tax increase the Senate has rejected eight \ntimes. There is nobody in this Senate who thinks this will pass the \nSenate the ninth time it is brought up. It is only being brought up and \ninterrupting what we are doing in our committee for a partisan \npolitical stunt.\n  We are going to raise the debt and increase taxes for what? Well, to \nhelp students pay off their loans. So they get $1 a day to pay off what \nloan? Well, 85 percent of the student loans--and there are a lot of \nthem. There is over $1 trillion worth of outstanding student loans \nbecause we have a lot of students and we are a big country. We have \n6,000 colleges and universities. But 85 percent of loans are for \nundergraduate students and they have $21,600 on average. That is right. \nWe are talking about 1 or 2 years for students who go to community \ncolleges. Some get a 4-year degree. But for 85 percent of the student \nloans that are undergraduate loans, $21,600 is the average debt. It is \nnot $300,000. It is not $200,000. It is not $100,000. It is $21,600. Of \nthose undergraduate loans, this is the average debt for a Federal \nstudent loan.\n  If you attend a 4-year college or university, such as the University \nof Tennessee or the University of California or Michigan or wherever \nyou are, and you borrowed money to go to school--the average debt is \n$27,300 for students who graduate with a 4-year college degree.\n  It is about the same for a new car loan. Sometimes students take out \na car loan before they take out a student loan. To get a sense of how \nbig a burden this loan is for the average graduate with a 4-year \ndegree, it is the same as a car loan. I suspect that if we are going to \nhave a $1-a-day taxpayer subsidy to pay off a $27,000 student loan, the \nnext thing you know the Democrats are going to show up during the \nelection year and say: Let's have $1 a day to help people pay off their \n$27,000 car loans. At least we know that the day you drive your car off \nthe lot, it starts depreciating.\n  What do we know about a college education? If you have a 4-year \ndegree, according to the College Board, it is worth $1 million in \nincreased earnings during your lifetime. That is according to the \nCollege Board. No one really contradicts that. I saw a very good \narticle by a New York Times economist a couple of weeks ago that had a \nlittle different number. They were using a net negative of $\\1/2\\ \nmillion after you deduct the cost of going to college. A person with a \ncollege education will have $\\1/2\\ million to $1 million in increased \nearnings. Can you think of a better investment than $27,000 to earn $1 \nmillion over your lifetime? Well, that is what a college degree does.\n  Our friends on the other side of the aisle are saying we need to \nraise the debt and taxes so we can help college graduates--who will be \nearning $1 million more over their lifetime--pay off a $27,000 loan. \nCollege students don't need a $1-a-day Federal taxpayer subsidy to pay \noff a $27,000 student loan, which is the average loan for a 4-year \ncollege degree. They need a job, and Republicans are prepared--if this \ncomes to the floor--to offer amendments to help create more new good \njobs. We tried several times to do that, but the majority leader \ndoesn't like us to bring up these issues.\n  For example, we would like to offer a bill to increase the hours of \nthe workweek from 30 to 40 hours under the health care law, which has \nbipartisan support, but it would change the health care law, so we \ncan't offer that amendment.\n  We would like to offer an amendment to build the Keystone Pipeline. \nWell, that has 60 or so Senators on both sides of the aisle--maybe more \nthan that--who voted for it and say they support it, but the majority \nleader doesn't want us to bring up that one.\n  We would like to have an amendment to give the President the trade \npromotion authority that President Obama has asked for. President Obama \nsees the world. He sees Asia. He is negotiating a treaty with Asia and \na trade treaty with Europe. He would like to see more American exports \ngo to Europe and Asia, which would increase jobs at home. He stood \nright here at the State of the Union and asked Congress to approve \nthat, but the majority leader said: No, we are not going to bring that \nup.\n  We have a Workforce Investment Act that we hope will come up this \nweek.\n  We would like to repeal the ObamaCare individual mandate.\n  There are a number of provisions we would like to bring up as far as \njobs go, but this $1-a-day subsidy is supposed to be the keystone of \nthe Democrats' jobs program. We are ready to talk about jobs, and we \nwill have amendments when this comes to the floor.\n  If the subject is education, we are ready to talk about education. It \nwould certainly be a lot better if we considered bills on the floor \nthat have actually gone through the education committee.\n  I complimented the Senator from Iowa earlier. I have enjoyed working \nwith him. I am the ranking member on the Republican side, and he is the \nranking member on the Democrat side. The Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions Committee has been the most productive committee in this \nSenate. It has a large jurisdiction. We passed 19 bills out in a \nbipartisan way, and 10 of them have become law. I don't think any other \ncommittee can say that. We take our work very seriously, just as we are \ndoing today on the Higher Education Act and just as we did when we \ntried to fix No Child Left Behind.\n  The HELP Committee spent a good deal of time on No Child Left Behind. \nWe reported a bill to the Senate floor. Republicans and Democrats \noffered competing proposals. Democrats effectively wanted to double \ndown on what I call a national school board and Republicans wanted to \nreverse the trend towards a national school board by sending most \ndecisions back to State and local communities.\n  We want to fix No Child Left Behind. We have competing visions of how \nto do this, but I committed to bring the Democratic bill to the floor \nso we could have a debate. The House is ready to fix No Child Left \nBehind, and the Senate education committee is ready to fix No Child \nLeft Behind. We want to have a debate about education this week. Let's \nbring up a bill that has been considered by the committee--where there \nare competing proposals--and fix No Child Left Behind. Better schools \nmeans higher college graduation rates, and that means better jobs.\n  We are ready to offer our amendments for better jobs. We are ready to \noffer our amendments for better schools.\n  In addition to our proposal for reversing the trend toward a national \nschool board, I have introduced a proposal to create scholarships for \nkids. Did you know that if you took 80 Federal education programs that \nspend about $24 billion a year and gave States authority to do this, \nthey could create $2,100 scholarships that follow 11 million low-income \nchildren in America to the public or accredited private school of the \nparents' choice? We would not impose a school choice plan on any State. \nWe don't believe in mandates. But if a State wanted to use the money to \nfollow the low-income student to their school so they can have an \nafterschool program or an extra teacher, a Governor could do that under \nthis proposal.\n\n  Senator Scott of South Carolina has offered a similar proposal for \nthe six\n\n[[Page S3484]]\n\nmillion children with disabilities. His proposal says: If you have a \nchild with Down syndrome and find a school that better fits that \nchild's needs, why not allow that Federal disability money to follow \nthe child to the school they attend? Let the parent make that choice. \nWe are ready to offer that amendment.\n  We have a quality charter schools proposal. Six percent of the public \nschools in America are charter schools. Charter schools are public \nschools that give parents more choices and teachers more freedom to \nserve the children who are in that school. They began more than 20 \nyears ago, and they have bipartisan support. President Clinton was in \nNashville not along ago announcing his support and raising money for a \ncharter school.\n  I have an amendment to stop the Education Secretary from becoming \nchairman of a national school board. States are struggling with the \nunworkable requirements of No Child Left Behind. There is a provision \nin the law that allows the Secretary of Education to grant waivers to \nstates from certain provisions of No Child Left Behind, but this \nSecretary, who is a fine man and a great friend, has said: If Oregon or \nHawaii or Washington or Tennessee wants a waiver, they must agree to do \nfour or five things that aren't otherwise required in the law. States \nhave to adopt certain standards, implement certain teacher evaluation \nsystems, and set performance targets as conditions for receiving a \nwaiver. I don't think the Secretary of Education has the authority to \nplace these conditions on states. The American people don't want a \nnational school board.\n  If they want to talk about education, we are ready with amendments on \neducation. If they want to introduce a class warfare tax, we are ready \nto talk about taxes as well. We would like to repeal the medical device \ntax, and we are looking for an opportunity to offer that. If they are \ngoing to put a tax provision on the floor, let's have a tax debate. \nLet's have a debate about permanent State and local tax deductions. \nLet's prohibit the individual tax mandate in ObamaCare. Let's make the \nexpensing of Section 179 permanent. Senator Thune has that proposal, \nand the House is acting on it this week. Let's make the research and \ndevelopment tax credit permanent, which has bipartisan support as well. \nIf the subject is just higher education, we have amendments about that \nas well.\n  The place for these amendments and this discussion is in our Senate \neducation committee where we are discussing those ideas today. The way \nto do it this year is the way we did it last year. When the President, \nto his great credit, saw an opportunity to work with the Republicans in \nthe House, he came over here to a bipartisan group, and we hammered out \nan agreement on a very big subject that, as I said, nearly cut the \ninterest rate in half on undergraduate student loans.\n  Why in the world do Senate Democrats want to waste a week on a \npolitical stunt? We thought we ended that with the student loan bill \nlast year. We have veterans standing in lines at clinics, we have \nappropriations bills waiting to be considered that deal with cancer \nresearch and national defense, and Democrats say: No, let's put that \naside. Let's have a political stunt on higher education even though we \nknow it is not going anywhere. We know it is not going anywhere.\n  I am very disappointed by this.\n  The $1-a-day taxpayer subsidy to help some former students with loans \npay off a $27,000 debt is an example of how Democrats hope to get some \nvotes. I thought we put that behind us. This is one reason the American \npeople lose confidence in the Senate.\n  This body is described in a book called ``The American Senate,'' \nwritten by the late Neil MacNeil and the former Historian of the \nSenate. It is described as the one piece of authentic genius in the \nAmerican constitutional system. Why is that? Because there are 100 of \nus. We operate by unanimous consent. It is a place for extended debate \non important issues until we reach consensus.\n  Our Founders were so wise because they thought they had a complicated \ncountry, but it was not nearly as complex as it is today. The only way \nto govern a complex country is through consensus, just as we did last \nyear on new student loans.\n  I would like to see the Senate move back to the place it was a few \nyears ago. It was not that long ago. Many of the Members of the Senate \ndon't know about it because so many Members are new. Did you know that \nhalf of the Members of the Senate have been here one term or less? They \nhave not really seen the Senate operate the way it is supposed to \noperate.\n  The Republican leader said that if Republicans were in charge of the \nSenate, he would like to operate it the way a former Democratic leader \ndid, Senator Mike Mansfield, which is, No. 1, let bills go through \ncommittee the way we do in our education committee, and No. 2, bring \nthem to the floor for a robust debate. Let people put up their ideas. \nThe idea is that the majority has the right to set the agenda and the \nminority has the right to offer amendments. In the Senate, the idea is \nto have an extended discussion until a consensus is reached, if you \ncan.\n  I remember Senator Byrd and Senator Baker--I was here as an aide \nthen, not as a Senator--would say to a chairman or a ranking member: \nBring me a bill. Today, they would say to Chairman Harkin: Bring me the \nfix No Child Left Behind bill, if you have the Ranking Members' \nsupport. I would say in this case: The bill doesn't have my support, \nbut I support taking it to the floor. I will stand there, he will stand \nthere and we will open it to debate and Republicans will try to amend \nit. We may win, we may lose, but then we will send it to the House. \nThen we have a conference and the bill comes back and we come to a \nconsensus. How could we get all that done? The majority leader could \nstand up on Monday and say: We are going to fix No Child Left Behind \nthis week, and we are going to finish by Saturday, or we are going to \nfinish by 1 week from Saturday. Members may offer all the amendments \nthey want, but they are going to be here Saturday and Sunday. So pretty \nsoon, by about Thursday, many Senators would say: I have a grandchild's \nsoccer game and I might want to go home and it regulates that way.\n\n  It is never perfect. This is a place where we debate big issues, but \nthe idea that Senators can't offer amendments on important issues is \nmaking this Senate into a trivial place instead of a place where it is \nan authentic piece of genius.\n  The Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Barrasso, did some interesting \nresearch. He pointed out that since July, there have only been nine \namendments offered by Republicans that received a rollcall vote--nine \namendments offered by Republicans since last July that received a \nrollcall vote. In Tennessee they would say that is akin to being in the \nGrand Ole Opry and not being allowed to sing. We are supposed to have a \nsay about student loans, about Iran, about Ukraine, and about all of \nthese issues. We might win or lose, but on behalf of our constituents, \nwe are supposed to have a say.\n  That is not nearly as bad as what the Senator from Wyoming discovered \nwhen he did a little more research, and this is what he found: While \nSenate Republicans have had nine amendments since last July, guess how \nmany amendments Senate Democrats have had--seven. According to the \nSenator from Wyoming, 676 amendments, and the majority leader has \nallowed 7 rollcall votes since last July. How do we explain that when \nwe go home?\n  How do we explain a political stunt on student loans that everybody \nknows is a political stunt that will not pass? How do we explain to \nveterans standing in lines at clinics and to Appropriations Committee \nmembers waiting to deal with bills to fund cancer research and national \ndefense that a political stunt is more important? This is not the way \nthe Senate is supposed to operate.\n  Let's go back to this $1-a-day stunt. It is unfair to students, it is \nunfair to taxpayers, and it is unfair to future generations.\n  It is unfair to students because it treats former students better \nthan it treats current students and new students. This proposal--the \nSenate Democrats' proposal that is being brought to the floor this \nweek--doesn't do a single thing for a student if he or she is a current \nstudent or if they are going to be a student next year or the following \nyear. It just helps some former students with old loans, and it treats \nthem better than it would treat a new student because it will freeze in \nplace an interest rate that 3 years from\n\n[[Page S3485]]\n\nnow will treat former students with old loans better than new students \nwhose rate will be determined by the market and that rate might be a \nlittle higher.\n  The Senate Democratic proposal is unfair to taxpayers for two \nreasons. First, it increases individual income taxes by $72 billion. \nThat is a big number. It has been rejected by the Senate eight times. \nIt is a class warfare tax focused on a few people.\n  Second, my colleagues may have heard that the government profits off \nof students under the student loan program. In fact, the reverse is \ntrue. When we use the accounting system the Congressional Budget Office \nsays we ought to use, the student loan program actually costs taxpayers \n$88 billion over the next 10 years. Let me repeat that. We will hear it \nsaid by the advocates of the $1-a-day subsidy to help students pay off \nstudent loans that the government is profiting from the students but \nnot if we use the accounting system the Congressional Budget Office has \nsaid we should use. What is the difference? The Congressional Budget \nOffice says the system we are using doesn't take into account the risk \nthat students might not pay back their loans. Today the Congressional \nBudget Office estimates that less than 10 percent of student loan \nvolume is in default.\n  This proper accounting system is not foreign to the Senate. It was \nused with the Troubled Asset Relief Program--the so-called bailout--\nbecause the idea of assessing the true cost of the program needed to \nfully account for risk.\n  The Congressional Budget Office recommends that we use fair value \naccounting. They consider that a better methodology. They say the \nstudent loan program, as it exists under that accounting system, will \ncost taxpayers $88 billion over the next 10 years. As I said, the main \nreason is that the fair value system takes into account risk--the risk \nthat students might not pay off some of their loans.\n  For those who might not know about the Congressional Budget Office, \nwe pay this group to tell us the truth. They are nonpartisan. They \ndon't always tell us what we want to hear, and we usually try to ignore \nit when they don't and say, well, we heard a different point of view. \nBut here is what they said `` . . . under the fair-value approach, \nestimates are based on market values--market prices when those prices \nare available or approximations of market prices when directly \ncomparable figures are unavailable--which more fully account for the \ncost of the risk the government takes on. In particular, the fair-value \napproach accounts for the cost of the market risk,'' which the other \naccounting method we currently use does not.\n  The Congressional Budget Office continues in a May 2014 report:\n\n       The government is exposed to market risk when the economy \n     is weak because borrowers default on their debt obligations \n     more frequently and recoveries from borrowers are lower.\n\n  That makes sense.\n\n       When the government extends credit, the associated market \n     risk of those obligations is effectively passed along to \n     taxpayers, who, as investors, would view that risk as having \n     a cost. Therefore, the fair-value approach offers a much more \n     comprehensive estimate of Federal costs.\n\n  Last year, when the President worked in a bipartisan way with \nSenators and with the Republican House, we came to a conclusion that \ndidn't raise taxes, that didn't raise the debt, and that still cut \nrates nearly in half for undergraduates.\n\n  Finally, the Senate Democratic proposal is unfair to future \ngenerations because it could add as much as $420 billion to an already \nout-of-control national debt. It does this by allowing private loans to \nbe turned into public loans--private debt becomes the government's \ndebt. Recently, as I said, the Congressional Budget Office warned that \ninterest on the debt in the next 10 years will rise from $227 billion \nto $876 billion, an amount greater than the entire cost of our Nation's \nnational defense.\n  So this $1-a-day subsidy does not justify this unfairness to other \nstudents, to taxpayers, and to future generations.\n  Let me conclude by talking about the real problem and the real \nsolutions with student loans. Today the President held a press \nconference in which he proposed issuing a regulation by Executive order \nthat would extend an income based repayment plan to millions more \nstudents. We have some questions about this. We don't know what it will \ncost and apparently neither does he. We know it doesn't take effect for \nanother year or so because it will take some time to figure it out. I \nhave had a hard time figuring out, reading the law, where the President \nhas the authority to do this. It is based upon the health care law in \n2010 which included provisions about student loans and included an \nincome based repayment plan that affects loans issued after July 1, \n2014. But the President, both with the Executive order today and his \n2011 Executive order on the same subject, includes loans issued before \nJuly 1, 2014. So we don't know the cost and it has questionable \nauthority.\n  So here we have a press conference at the White House and a political \nstunt on the Senate floor dealing with loans. We know better than that. \nThe President knows he could sit down with those of us in the Senate \nwho are working on student loans--and in the House--and say: Here, I \nhave some ideas about income based repayment. We would say: Mr. \nPresident, No. 1, we respect what you did last year and would like to \nwork with you again; and, No. 2, you are on the right subject.\n  There are two big problems--real problems--with student loans. One is \nthe complexity of the income based repayment plans. The truth is the \nObama administration itself is guilty of causing most of the complexity \nbecause the first income based repayment plan was created by law in \n2007 and then it was amended in 2010 and then the President issued a \nregulation expanding the program in 2011 and now there is another \nregulation to do the same. Basically, it started out that if a student \nhas a student loan to pay back but they are not making much money, then \nthey don't have to pay more than 15 percent of their discretionary \nincome. That is not even total income; it is just part of a person's \nincome. If they can't pay it off over 25 years, the government will \nforgive it. What the bill did in 2010 was lower the amount to 10 \npercent of income for borrowers, and if the loan isn't paid off in 20 \nyears, the government will forgive it. Income based repayment plans are \navailable today for students.\n  Let's talk about what is already on the books, even if the \nPresident's Order today doesn't go into effect for students. For \nstudents who want lower monthly payments on their student loans, there \nare already provisions in Federal law that allow the typical \nundergraduate borrower to lower his or her payment by $60 more per \nmonth than the $1-a-day plan from Senate Democrats. For the typical \ngraduate student, the existing repayment plans could lower monthly \npayments by $300 a month more than the Senate Democratic plan. Under \ncurrent law, as I said, if the loan isn't paid off in 20 or 25 years, \nthe government forgives it.\n  So here is what we have in America today. There are $100 billion in \nstudent loans every year, $33 billion in Federal grants, all going out \nto students at a very low rate. Most of the students don't have any \ncredit history, and they don't need it to get the money.\n  We hear a lot of talk about the expense of a college education, and \nat some colleges it is very expensive. When I went to school, I had two \nor three jobs and a couple of scholarships. That is how I was able to \ngo to Vanderbilt University. But for students today who want a less \nexpensive college education, it is important for them to know that the \naverage cost of tuition and fees at a 2-year public college--and there \nare some excellent ones all over our country--is $3,200. The average \ncost of tuition and fees at a public 4-year institution--and some of \nthe best 4-year institutions in America are public 4-year institutions, \nincluding California, Tennessee, Hawaii, and Washington State; these \nare very good universities--is $8,900. Three out of four college \nstudents go to 2-year public colleges where the tuition and fees is \n$3,200 or to a 4-year public college where tuition and fees is just \nunder $9,000.\n  In addition, 40 percent of those same students--the three out of four \nwho go to public colleges and universities--40 percent of them have a \ngrant which they don't have to pay back. It is called a Pell grant, and \nit may be as much as $5,645. So the truth is that for millions of \ncollege students going to\n\n[[Page S3486]]\n\ncollege today, it is free. Do the math. If a community college is \n$3,200 and a student gets a $5,645 Pell grant, that student has some \nextra money, and he or she can still get a loan if they want to and \nthen they have even more extra money.\n  That leads to the other real problem with student loans that we would \nlike to work with the President on; that is, over borrowing. The first \nreal problem is the complexity of the income based repayment plans, and \nwe can change that. Just as we did last year with many of the new \nloans, we could make the income based repayment plans, working \ntogether, much simpler and make it easier for students to take \nadvantage of.\n  But what about overborrowing? We read in the paper about huge student \nloan debt. It seems as though everybody we read about has a $300,000 \nloan or a $150,000 loan they will never be able to pay back. I guess a \nfew people do. But according to Mark Kantrowitz, who is a financial aid \nexpert and has studied student debt, more than 90 percent of students \nwho graduate with loans of more than $100,000 are graduate students. \nLet me say that again. If you read about a student loan that is more \nthan $100,000, more than 90 percent of those are for graduate students.\n  I said a moment ago that undergraduate students can earn more than $1 \nmillion more in their lifetime with their 4-year degree. Doctors, \nlawyers, and other graduate students can earn a lot more than that with \ntheir advanced degrees in many cases.\n  But those graduate students with more-than-$100,000 loans are only 6 \npercent of all graduate students, and that is only 2 percent of all \nstudent loans. So 2 percent of all federal student loans in the country \nare more than $100,000. The average undergraduate loan for a 4-year \ndegree is $27,000, and the average for all undergraduate loans, which \nare 85 percent of loans, is $21,000.\n  There is some overborrowing even among undergraduates. Young people \nare--and maybe they are not all young--borrowing more than they can \nafford to pay back. In our committee, we are considering a number of \nproposals to deal with this for both graduate and undergraduate loans.\n  For example, we would like to simplify the student loan program so \nmore students can take advantage of it and take advantage of the \nrepayment options that exist in the law today. But we need to know how \nmuch that costs the taxpayers.\n  No. 2, we have been talking about eliminating the graduate PLUS \nProgram that provides virtually unlimited loans to graduate students \nregardless of their credit history. That may be how they took out these \nloans we occasionally read about of $150,000, $200,000. We want to \nprohibit part-time students from taking out the same amount of loans \nthat full-time students can. Let's say you are taking a half-time load \nat a 4-year institution and you take out a full-time loan to pay for \nthat. That means you have some extra money for living expenses or for a \ncar. I am not sure as a matter of national policy that money for \nexpenses other than for education and costs associated with education \nshould be allowed.\n  We would like to give colleges and universities the ability to \nrequire additional counseling for students. Did you know that under \ncurrent law a college is prohibited from requiring additional \ncounseling to an entering student at Vanderbilt or the University of \nTennessee who says: Give me my loan. I am entitled to it? I am 18 or 19 \nyears old. I have no credit history, maybe not much experience with \nmoney, and the college that hands me the money is prohibited--by \nfederal law--from requiring additional counseling.\n  We may want to limit the amount a student can borrow. We may want to \nallow colleges to have a role in doing that. We may even--and this has \nbeen suggested--require higher education institutions in some instances \nto have skin in the game to ensure that graduate students and \nundergraduate students repay their loans. In other words, the higher \neducation institution would share the risk. These are some of the ideas \nthat are being considered today in the Senate education committee.\n  Every Senator has a right to bring on this floor whatever she or he \nwants. It is up to the majority leader to decide what we focus our \nprecious time on. I am here today to suggest that a $1-a-day subsidy \nfor college graduates to help them pay off a $27,000 loan--which is the \naverage loan for a 4-year college graduate, which is almost exactly the \nsame as the average car loan--is not a worthy subject for our \ndiscussion this week when we have veterans standing in lines at clinics \nand appropriations bills dealing with cancer, and national military \ndefense waiting to come to the floor.\n  That is especially true when we have a President of the United States \nwho has proved he can work with Congress on student debt. He did that \nlast year. He did a good job. He was very helpful with the final \nresult. The Republicans in the House said that, the Senate said that in \na bipartisan way, and I think most students who are enjoying the \nbenefit of that would agree with that.\n  So we thought last year we had stopped the political stunts on \nstudent loans. We put a market price system on all new loans, at no new \ncost to the taxpayers, no new debt, so this would not become an \nelection-year football; but apparently it has, at least for a week. So \nwe are going to have to endure going on to the floor and talking about \na proposal that every single Senator knows has no chance not only of \ngetting to the House, which will not touch it, but even passing the \nSenate--no chance whatsoever. Why? Because over in the Senate education \ncommittee we are discussing this subject in a bipartisan way and the \nway we are supposed to do it.\n  So if it comes to the floor we are ready to amend it. We have our \nproposals for more good jobs. College graduates do not need a $1-a-day \nsubsidy to help pay off a $27,000 loan. They need a good, decent job, \nand we are ready to help them get one. With the Keystone Pipeline, with \nthe trade authority the President wants, with lower taxes, with changes \nin ObamaCare, with going from a 30- to a 40-hour workweek, we have a \nlot of ideas about jobs. If we want to bring up taxes, which this \nproposal does, we have some taxes we would like to bring up as well; \nand that includes repealing the medical device tax, which ought to have \na good, bipartisan vote here in the Senate. It has before.\n  On education, we have our ideas too, and so do the Democrats, by the \nway. Some have been through the HELP committee. They have been hashed \nout. They are ready for the floor. There is a competing vision. \nDemocrats want a national school board. Republicans want to reverse the \ntrend towards a national school board. So on this bill, if we want to \ntalk about education, I would like to have a chance to offer my \namendment that says no national school board. Let's send those \ndecisions back to State and local communities. I think there are lots \nof Senators on both sides of the aisle who would like to vote for that.\n  But what I would really like to see is the President accept our \ninvitation to work with him. That is what we would like to do. We did \nthat last year. We produced a good result. He has put his focus in the \nright place. I might say respectfully, maybe he is in the right church \nbut the wrong pew. He is talking about income based repayment plans. We \nthink that is one of the big problems left to solve, and we will work \nwith him to simplify and reform the various plans. But we want to make \nsure the government has clear legislative authority to do it, and we \nwant to know what it costs. Then we would like to work with him on \nexcessive overborrowing. I would suspect he would like to do that too.\n  So why don't we do that? Why don't we send this $1-a-day proposal \nback to the Senate education committee--actually it never was there--\nbut let's send it to the Senate education committee and put it in with \nall the other ideas we are discussing. Let's continue our bipartisan \nwork in the committee to see if we can this year present to the Senate \na proposal for reauthorizing the Higher Education Act, and let's use \nthis time for the veterans standing in line or the appropriations \nbills, which deal with so many issues and which we have not had a \nchance to consider for the last few years.\n  I am disappointed with today's press conference at the White House \nand the political stunt that is headed toward the Senate floor. But I \nam hoping the President will take a look at what he did last year and \nfeel a good deal of satisfaction about it and say: Let me\n\n[[Page S3487]]\n\nsit down with those same men and women whom I worked with last year and \nsee if we cannot do something about simplifying income based repayment \nso more students can take advantage of it, and dealing with excessive \nborrowing and some of the other issues we are working on in higher \neducation.\n  I think we can do that 2 years in a row, and I think the American \npeople would appreciate it if we tried.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/09/senate-section/article/S3487-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3487]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING CHESTER NEZ\n\n  Mr. HEINRICH. Madam President, it is an honor to join my colleague \nfrom New Mexico, Senator Tom Udall, in celebrating the life and service \nof Chester Nez, the last of the original 29 Navajo code talkers, who \npassed away this last Wednesday, and to honor the historic role the \nNative American code talkers played in the allied victory in World War \nII.\n  Our Nation's liberties and patriotic spirit were personified by the \ncommitment and service and the legacy of Chester Nez. He was a true \nAmerican hero. Chester Nez helped to create an unbreakable code during \nWorld War II. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps to protect the Nation \nand also his people, language, and culture. He understood the \nsignificance and the importance of his language, and he used it as a \nshield to defend this Nation.\n  Chester Nez chose to enlist in the marines at a young age, not \nknowing he would become part of an elite group of indigenous code \ntalkers. Despite growing up in an era where speaking the Navajo \nlanguage was not only prohibited but often punished, his fluency in \nboth Navajo and English made him invaluable to the war effort. He was a \nmember of the all-Navajo 382nd Marine Platoon entrusted to create a \ncode that would prove impenetrable to the Japanese. The 382nd Marine \nPlatoon literally changed the course of history.\n  After Chester Nez's service, he continued to remain silent about his \ninstrumental role as a Navajo code talker, maintaining a quiet, modest, \nand humble lifestyle until the mission was declassified in 1968.\n  Later in life Mr. Nez shared his contributions and his experiences in \nWorld War II with younger generations. He advocated for keeping the \nNavajo language, its traditions, and culture alive so that future \ngenerations would know how influential the Navajo people and language \nwere during World War II.\n  Thanks to Mr. Nez and his fellow code talkers, our Nation's \nremarkable spirit continues to thrive and we are forever grateful for \ntheir service. I join all New Mexicans in keeping Chester Nez's family \nand friends in our thoughts and prayers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/09/senate-section/article/S3487-2", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3487-S3489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           KADZIK NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I come to the floor to speak about the \nnomination of Peter Kadzik to be an Assistant Attorney General for \nLegislative Affairs in the Justice Department. I happen to know that \nthe majority leader hasn't yet filed cloture on this nomination, but I \nexpect that he will in the near future. So now I take the opportunity \nto speak about that nomination.\n  It is no secret that I have concerns about Mr. Kadzik's nomination. I \nopposed his nomination in committee, and I will oppose it when it comes \nto a vote on the floor.\n  The reasons are pretty simple. Mr. Kadzik has been acting in that \nposition since April 2013--in other words, in the very same position \nfor which he has been nominated. His job is to respond to questions \nfrom Members of Congress. We have a clear track record to judge his \nperformance, and that record has been dismal. Letters go unanswered for \nmonths. Then, when answers come, they ignore or dodge the questions.\n  Even before coming to the Justice Department, Mr. Kadzik had shown a \nlack of respect for congressional oversight. While he was in private \npractice, he represented the billionaire tax fugitive Marc Rich. Rich \nwas infamously pardoned at the end of the Clinton administration \nfollowing a large donation by Mrs. Rich to the Clinton Presidential \nLibrary. No fugitive has ever been pardoned before--let alone a \nbillionaire fugitive who owed millions of unpaid taxes.\n  In the course of the congressional investigation into that \ncontroversy, Mr. Kadzik was subpoenaed to testify at the House hearing \nin 2001. He refused the committee's invitation to testify voluntarily. \nThen, he decided to fly to California the day before the hearing. The \nHouse committee had to send the U.S. marshals to serve him with a \nsubpoena in California ordering him to return for the hearing. He later \ndenied that his attorneys knew a subpoena was on the way when he got on \nthe plane. But his denial is contradicted by handwritten notes from \n2001 telephone conversations with his attorneys about the subpoena. \nThose notes are in the record of his confirmation hearings, and I \ninvite any Senator to review them.\n  Some people might say: Well, that was a long time ago, and maybe it \nwas just a misunderstanding.\n  But one thing is not in dispute even by Mr. Kadzik: He refused the \nHouse committee's request to testify voluntarily. He was unwilling to \ncooperate unless forced to do so by compulsory legal process. \nEverything in his record since then has reinforced the impression that \nMr. Kadzik is simply not interested in answering questions from \nCongress unless he has no other choice.\n  He was not forthcoming during his nomination hearing on several \nissues, not just the Marc Rich controversy. Getting him to answer \nsimple inquiries has required two or even three sets of questions. He \nwouldn't even promise to answer each individual question from members \nof our Judiciary Committee. Instead, he had a bad habit of grouping \ntogether a set of specific detailed questions, and then repeating one \nvague nonanswer over and over. In one set of responses he repeated word \nfor word the same answer to previous questions nine times. That simply \nis not a good-faith effort to be responsive to each question.\n  When his answer was one he thought I didn't want to hear, he glossed \nover it. Example: At his nomination hearing, I asked Mr. Kadzik whether \nhe intended to provide certain documents Chairman Issa and I had \nrequested relating to a briefing by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, \nFirearms and Explosives. After he failed to mention the documents in \nhis response, I prompted him about the documents once again and he \nevaded the question. Only after two subsequent sets of questions for \nthe record did Mr. Kadzik finally come clean and admit that the \nDepartment would refuse to provide those documents requested. Mr. \nKadzik should have been that candid initially, instead of avoiding the \nissue.\n  His seeming inability to give straightforward and accurate answers to \nsimple questions causes real concern for me about his ability to \nperform his job, of which a very important part is answering inquiries \nfrom Members of Congress. I think an Assistant Attorney General for \nLegislative Affairs needs to ensure that Congress receives accurate \ninformation from the Department. That is what checks and balances of \nour constitutional setup is all about.\n  This also became a problem for Mr. Kadzik's predecessor, whose false \ndenials about Operation Fast and Furious eventually had to be \nretracted. This office needs leadership that will restore its \ncredibility. Mr. Kadzik's track record in the acting position makes it \nclear he does not have what it takes to restore sorely needed \ncredibility. At Mr. Kadzik's confirmation hearing last October, Senator \nFeinstein told Mr. Kadzik that the Senate's Select Committee on \nIntelligence had recently received answers to questions for the record \nfrom the FBI that were over 1 year late. As she pointed out to Mr. \nKadzik, ``A year is really outside the pale of propriety.''\n\n  Mr. Kadzik said in response: ``One of my missions at the Department \nis to improve that record and to expedite the providing of information \nto this Committee and all Members of Congress.'' But from what I have \nseen so far, Mr. Kadzik's record has been even worse than his \npredecessor's.\n\n[[Page S3488]]\n\n  The Judiciary Committee still has not received answers to questions \nfor the record from Attorney General Holder from an oversight hearing \ndating back to March 6, 2013, 14 months ago. Recently, the Judiciary \nCommittee received answers to FBI questions for the record dated \n``current as of August 26, 2013.'' According to the FBI Congressional \nAffairs staff, that is when the answers were forwarded to Mr. Kadzik's \noffice. Although the FBI responses to Congress were then only 2 months \nold, apparently they sat in Mr. Kadzik's Office of Legislative Affairs \nfor another 9 months.\n  Mr. Kadzik is just as unresponsive to letters. His staff recently \nacknowledged they were aware of 13 pending letters from this Senator \nthat have gone completely unanswered. I don't mean he replied with an \nanswer I didn't think was good enough; I mean there was simply no reply \nwhatsoever. Some of those questions from this Senator dated back to \nOctober 2012, well over a year and a half ago. His office is completely \nignoring those letters.\n  He did send me a couple of very weak responses in just the last few \ndays. Each of those was essentially one paragraph long. One was a reply \nto a letter I sent almost 1 year ago. The other replied to a letter \nfrom January in which I asked four simple questions. They addressed \nAttorney General Holder's failure to issue a report on the need for \nreform of the FBI's whistleblower procedures.\n  The Attorney General was required to report to President Obama within \n180 days of the Presidential directive on whistleblowers, which was \nissued October 2012. A little history: The FBI was exempted from \nwhistleblower provisions in the Civil Service Act of 1978 and the \nWhistleblower Protection Act of 1989. That has resulted in the FBI \nbeing one of the worst retaliators against whistleblowers over the \nyears. Therefore, the FBI report President Obama requested was an \nimportant part of the Presidential directive. I had written to the \nJustice Department 3 weeks after the Presidential directive in 2012 to \nemphasize how important it was that the directive be followed and that \nthe FBI people have proper whistleblower protection. Then there was a \n180-day deadline. That deadline came and went.\n  I wrote the Justice Department earlier this year asking about the \nreport because at that time it was more than 10 months overdue. I asked \nthe current status of the report, why they had failed to issue it so \nfar, when it would be complete, and whether they would provide a copy \nto the Judiciary Committee.\n  So those are the simple questions I asked Mr. Kadzik. Once again, the \nnominee failed to send a prompt, good-faith response to my letter. Mr. \nKadzik could have written immediately to say the Justice Department \nknows this review is important and explain why it was taking longer \nthan they thought. Mr. Kadzik could have told me the review was \nexpected to take several more months. Instead he waited 4 long months \nuntil the report was complete, then simply sent me a one-paragraph \nresponse, stating the report was sent to the President of the United \nStates. He didn't try to explain why it took so long. He completely \nignored my question about providing a copy of the report to our \nJudiciary Committee. This is not the kind of good-faith, candid \nresponse the Justice Department owes Congress, especially in our \noversight capacity to see that the laws are faithfully executed by the \nPresident of the United States.\n  As a nominee who already works in that office, Mr. Kadzik had the \nopportunity to demonstrate a real commitment to the role of \ncongressional oversight in our constitutional system of checks and \nbalances. He could have answered the mail on time. He could have \ninsisted on candid, good-faith, substantive replies to Congress. Rather \nthan trying to raise the bar, he lowered it.\n  The attitude this nominee brings to dealing with congressional \noversight and the requests we make is a symptom of much larger \nproblems. The Justice Department has a lot of work to do to rebuild \ntrust and confidence after the false letter it sent me on Operation \nFast and Furious. It still is fighting in court to avoid turning over \ndocuments that explain its decision to ultimately withdraw the letter \nand admit that letter was false.\n  The Obama administration is arguing for a vastly expanded view of \nexecutive privilege. They want the ability to expand it far beyond \ndirect advice a counselor would give to the President. They want it to \ninclude internal emails between lower level bureaucrats and agencies \nand departments. These, the administration claims, are so-called \ndeliberative documents. They are created by people who may never even \nhave been to the White House, let alone advise the President on \nanything where lawyer-client relationship can be established. That kind \nof broad privilege would be a massive blow to government transparency \nand to our system of checks and balances.\n  The position the Obama administration is taking in the Operation Fast \nand Furious lawsuit is a direct breach of the promise the President \nmade in his first day in office. He pledged at that time to have the \nmost transparent administration in the history of this country, but now \nthe President's Justice Department is arguing for a massive expansion \nof executive privilege to include all of that so-called deliberative \nmaterial. This nominee, Mr. Kadzik, is aggressively implementing that \nnew policy even today, refusing to answer questions and withholding \ndocuments. His actions today are consistent with his history. Voluntary \ncooperation takes a backseat to legalism and forcing a legal \nconfrontation.\n  I wish I could say Mr. Kadzik had demonstrated the kind of serious \ncommitment to open, honest, and forthright cooperation with \ncongressional oversight that the office needs. Unfortunately, he has \nnot, but the failure to cooperate extends far beyond Mr. Kadzik's \ninvestigations.\n\n  We don't need to look any further than today's headlines to see the \nlatest instance of this administration's failure to abide by its \nobligations under the law to submit to congressional oversight. Of \ncourse I am referring to the recent release of five of the most \ndangerous detainees from Guantanamo. The President's decision to \nrelease what some have called the Taliban dream team without notifying \nCongress in advance exemplifies this administration's contempt for \ncongressional oversight. It is troubling for a host of reasons, \nespecially when the stakes are so high.\n  In December 2013, Congress passed and the President signed the 2014 \nNational Defense Authorization Act. Section 1035 of that law addresses \nthe procedure the executive branch is required to follow if the \nPresident decides to release a detainee being held at Guantanamo Bay. \nThis process isn't optional. It is not something that is a matter of \nPresidential discretion. It is actually required as a matter of federal \nlaw. It is required by a law this President signed.\n  The White House's failure to follow the law in this instance is just \nthe latest example of this administration's blatant disregard for \ncongressional authority. The law requires the President to notify \ncertain House and Senate committees, including the Senate Select \nCommittee on Intelligence and the House Permanent Select Committee on \nIntelligence, at least 30 days before Guantanamo Bay detainees are \ntransferred or released. Obviously that did not happen.\n  Not only that but the law requires the President to explain ``why the \ntransfer or release is in the national security interest of the United \nStates.'' That didn't happen either. The President also had a legal \nobligation to describe any actions his administration took ``to \nmitigate the risks of reengagement by the individuals to be transferred \nor released.'' Such mitigating actions are required by the law, but \nthat didn't happen either.\n  The reasons for these legal requirements are fairly obvious. The \nMembers of this body understand and respect the President's \nresponsibility to protect national security. That is in fact his \nparamount responsibility as Commander in Chief, but we too have a \nresponsibility in this Congress and all Congresses to ensure that the \nnational security is protected. Congress is a coequal branch of \ngovernment. Yet our ability to ensure that the actions this President \ntakes are designed to promote the national security have been thwarted \nbecause this White House kept us in the dark about the release of the \nfive Taliban kingpins every step of the way.\n\n[[Page S3489]]\n\n  The administration is fully aware it violated Federal law in failing \nto timely notify Congress of its intentions. We know this because the \nWhite House has contacted some of my colleagues on the Select Committee \non Intelligence and apologized--actually apologized--for failing to \nnotify them in advance; in other words, apologized for not following \nthe law.\n  According to press reports the White House said the failure to make \nnotification required by law was ``an oversight.'' An oversight? What \nhappened is not an oversight. An oversight is what happens when you \nforget to send a thank-you note for a birthday gift. This was not an \noversight. In other words, it is extremely difficult to view this as \nanything but a deliberate attempt to leave Senators in the dark. You \ndon't simply forget to meet your legal obligations to notify Congress, \nand it is not as if this was some obscure provision of the law nobody \nknew anything about. This has always been a very big deal. Not only did \nthe White House have an obligation to notify Congress, but the White \nHouse had previously promised that it would in fact comply with the \nlaw.\n  On June 21, 2013, at the White House press briefing, Press Secretary \nJay Carney promised that the administration ``would not make any \ndecision about the transfers of any detainees without consulting with \nCongress and without doing so in accordance with U.S. law.''\n  It is perfectly clear the administration was aware of its duties \nunder the law and made a calculated and deliberate decision to ignore \nthem. The President more or less admitted this when he recently \nexplained at a press conference in Poland that he saw an opportunity he \nhad to take immediately because ``we were concerned about Sgt. \nBergdahl's health.''\n  I am sick and tired of the approach this administration takes toward \nits legal obligations under the law, and that is why I wrote to the \nAttorney General in January of this year concerning some statements the \nPresident made in the State of the Union Address, hinting that he \nintended to take unilateral action using executive orders.\n  In the letter I wrote to the Attorney General, I asked him to direct \nthe Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel to publicly disclose \nits opinions and conclusions concerning the lawfulness of executive \norders issued by the President.\n  Here is where Mr. Kadzik comes in. In May he declined my request, \nciting again his overbroad and legally unsupportable claims of \nexecutive privilege.\n  It is not without good reason that the former executive editor of the \nNew York Times--by the way, an outlet that is not exactly an aggressive \ncritic of the President--called this White House the most secretive she \never covered.\n  So let me renew my request to the Attorney General regarding the \npublication of opinions from the Office of Legal Counsel. Frankly, I \nthink my request is all the more important now that we have seen the \nadministration's flagrant disregard for Federal law in the matter of \nthe Taliban prisoner deal. I am, therefore, asking the Attorney General \nto direct the Office of Legal Counsel to make public any opinions or \nlegal analysis concerning the lawfulness of the transfer of the Taliban \ncommanders without compliance with section 1035 of the National Defense \nAuthorization. But given this Department's track record, I am not going \nto hold my breath that that request will be honored.\n  I will sum up by saying this: Mr. Kadzik's nomination is a perfect \nexample of the contempt that this--the self-professed most transparent \nadministration in history--has for congressional oversight authority.\n  Let me be clear to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. One \nday you folks might be in the minority or the administration might be \ncontrolled by the Republican Party. If a Republican administration \nignores your oversight request, how can you complain, if you don't \nstand up today, when the shoe was on the other foot? If you support \nthis kind of stonewalling now by supporting this nominee, it will come \nback to bite you, and, of course, you will deserve it. I plan to be \naround here to remind you of that.\n  I will vote against this nominee and urge my colleagues to do the \nsame.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. King). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/09/senate-section/article/S3489-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3489-S3490]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, last week, the Senate confirmed Sylvia \nBurwell as our new Secretary of Health and Human Services. She is now \nthe administration's main implementer and representative of ObamaCare. \nShe is its new face and will be its primary salesperson to the American \npeople. I think the President made a competent choice, and I supported \nher confirmation. But I would be remiss if I did not mention or bring \nto light the difficult job she has ahead of her.\n  From its botched website to ever increasing premiums, to canceled \nhealth insurance plans, ObamaCare has been and remains a complicated \nmess of broken promises and confusing implementation. I was back home \nin Indiana last weekend and the weekend before that, and ObamaCare, \nalong with complaints about overregulation, remain the top two issues \non people's minds. On Friday, I was in DeKalb County and Noble County \nup in northeast Indiana meeting with representatives of those two \ncounties and communities and across the spectrum of people engaged in \nvarious business enterprises--housewives, small businesses, big \nbusinesses, elected officials, et cetera. In each of those discussions, \nas I went across those two counties, as I said, overregulation and \nObamaCare were No. 1 and No. 2, or vice versa, on everyone's mind. It \ncontinues to remain on their minds because they see this as a very \ncomplicated and messy intrusion into their individual lives in terms of \ntheir ability to run their businesses. For many, it is not a question \nof ObamaCare not hurting them, but how it has hurt them and their \nconcerns about how it is going to hurt them in the future.\n  The President promised us that this plan--quote ``will lower the cost \nof health care for our families, our businesses, and our government.'' \nLet me repeat that. The President said that ObamaCare would lower the \ncost of health care--which it hasn't--for our families, our businesses, \nand our government.\n  That is not what I have heard as I talk to people across the State of \nIndiana. What I hear from Hoosiers is their premiums have increased, \nthey have higher health care costs, their deductibles have risen \ndramatically, their copays have risen, and they have fewer provider \noptions. Remember what the President said: If like your doctor or your \nhealth plan, you can keep it, period. That is not the case, and I hear \nthat from hundreds of Hoosiers as I travel around the State.\n  Let me speak about a specific story from a constituent, Jeremy, from \nRandolph County, who said this:\n\n       My plan for my wife and two kids, ages 2 and 5, just \n     increased $150 to $615 per month. We cannot afford this \n     massive hike!\n\n  He went on to say: Something must be done to lower these plans \nbecause we are seriously going to think about not being able to have \ninsurance for the first time since college because I simply can't \nafford it. It is unaffordable.\n  The ACA, the so-called Affordable Care Act, has been called \nunaffordable by so many Hoosiers--and I suspect that is true all around \nthe country--that it ought to be the unaffordable care act and not the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  I don't know how many stories we have to bring to the floor of the \nSenate before my colleagues understand and realize this plan is faulty \nto the point that it needs to be replaced. It is deeply and fatally \nflawed at its very core.\n  I know the majority leader came to the floor and said none of these \nstories we have related are true. That is like telling Jeremy he \ndoesn't exist.\n  I don't think he made this up: My plan for my wife and kids has just \nincreased $150 a month to $615 a month. It is unaffordable. Americans \nacross the country are repeating these stories. They are not made up. \nIt is not something Republicans sits around and\n\n[[Page S3490]]\n\nwrite in the back room and sends out that says: Here, say this, so we \ncan repeat it on the floor of the House of Representatives or the \nSenate floor. These are concerned citizens sending by the thousands \nemails, phone calls, tweets, and any other means of communication. They \nare speaking to us directly when we go back home, whether I am in the \ngrocery store buying a quart of milk, picking up a newspaper at the gas \nstation, just speaking to people on the street, or when I sit down with \nbusiness people. We have invited them to various small towns in \nIndiana. As I said, these stories that are coming from real people I \nrepresent--and they sent me here to represent them--is the impact of \nthe health care plan that has been proposed by the President and now is \nbeing implemented. So all of the promises that were made early on--but \nit wasn't in force--have now been proven to be untrue.\n  Don't just take my word for it. Look at the headlines. Reuters, which \nI don't think is an arm of the Republican Senatorial Committee or the \nRepublican National Committee, and is an independent newspaper says: \n``U.S. says 2.2 million ObamaCare enrollees have data problems.''\n  CNBC--the last time I heard they weren't making contributions to the \nRepublican Party either: ``Seven in 10 people say ObamaCare had bad or \nzero impact on U.S.'' Either nothing--no impact or bad impact--that is \n70 percent.\n  Indianapolis Business Journal, to which I pay attention, and an \nindependent organization: ``Indiana's ObamaCare rates for 2015 all over \nthe map.''\n  People can't figure out how much they are going to have to pay next \nyear, but they have figured out one thing. It is going to be more than \nthey paid last year.\n  Remember the statement ``premiums won't go up?'' It won't go up a \npenny?\n  I think many of us think it is time to start over and replace \nObamaCare with real health care solutions. Republicans have offered a \nmultitude of possibilities of suggestions and proposals, every one of \nwhich has been turned down by the President or not allowed to be \nbrought to the floor by the Senate majority leader.\n  There are those who say: What would you do? Why don't you suggest \nsomething? We have tried our very best to bring forward packages of \nreforms, to reach across the aisle and say, if you will work with us, \nwe will try to fix some of these problems. We think we should repeal it \nand start over because we don't think it is the right model for health \ncare, to address the solution of providing people in this country with \nadequate health care at a reasonable cost.\n  So changing the face of ObamaCare by just putting in a new Secretary \nof Health and Human Services will not change this law's negative impact \non Hoosiers such as Jeremy. I wish it would, but, obviously, it won't. \nIt will not change this disaster of a law into what it should be: \nBetter health care for all Americans. We are all committed to that \ngoal, but we are simply saddled with a piece of legislation that was \nvery poorly drafted, that was rushed through without any support or \ncomments from those of us on the other side of the aisle.\n  I wasn't here at the time. One of the reasons I ran and came back was \nto try to address what I thought was legislation taking us down a road \nto a dysfunctional health care system, with less quality, less access, \nless choice, less competition.\n  Is there a need to reform this current health care system? Yes. Are \nthere solutions that are better than what has been put before us? Yes. \nI wish we could summon the support and the will of those in this body \nto begin addressing that very problem.\n  Mr. President, I see other colleagues on the floor, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/09/senate-section/article/S3490-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3490-S3491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        GUANTANAMO BAY DETAINEES\n\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I rise today to raise an issue that has been \nof growing concern to the American people: the exchange of the so-\ncalled Taliban five--five terrorist detainees from Guantanamo--in \nexchange for Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl.\n  Let me say from the outset, this is not about Sergeant Bergdahl. The \ncircumstances under which he became a prisoner of the Taliban is an \nissue for the Army. There was an investigation into this matter in \n2010, and hopefully the Army will be able to bring clarity to that \nsituation soon. What I wish to speak about today is keeping the \nAmerican people safe from the terrorists who attacked us on September \n11, 2001, resulting in the deaths of 2,977 innocent people.\n  The Taliban five are among the worst of the worst. They were all \nhigh-level officials in the Taliban regime who gave aid and support to \nAl Qaeda in Afghanistan in the period leading up to the 9/11 attacks. \nThese five were designated ``high'' risk by the Guantanamo Review Task \nForce convened in 2009 on the orders of President Obama, whose report \nwas published on January 22, 2010. Two of the five are wanted by the \nUnited Nations for war crimes against Afghan civilians.\n  Khairullah Khairkhwa, for example, was described in his GTMO case \nfile as ``a hard-liner in Taliban philosophy'' with ``close ties to \nOsama bin Laden.'' Mohammad Fazl was second in command of the Taliban \narmy in 2001. These were not junior-level players.\n  Capturing these five men was a priority when our troops participated \nin the liberation of Afghanistan from the Taliban in 2001, where our \nsons and daughters bled and died to free Afghanistan and to exact \npunishment on those who carried out a horrific terrorist attack on the \nUnited States of America. We cannot know for sure how many American \nsoldiers paid the ultimate price to capture these five senior \nterrorists.\n  Even as many other detainees at GTMO have been released, up until \nnow, these five have been considered too dangerous to let go. Given the \nlevel of threat they represent, any proposal to release them should be \nof the utmost seriousness. Unfortunately, by all indications the \nadministration's release treated their threat as anything but serious.\n  Americans need to know how the Obama administration thinks it has \nmade our Nation safer by negotiating with terrorists to release these \nfive dangerous terrorist leaders. Until President Obama can make his \ncase and convince the American public that this swap was in our \nnational interests, prudence dictates that all further transfers and \nreleases from Guantanamo Bay should be off the table.\n  Unfortunately, there have been no answers from this administration on \nhow this deal furthers the national security interests of the American \npeople or why the deal was so urgent that the administration refused to \ncomply with its legal obligation to inform Congress 30 days before the \ntransfer. Instead, the administration has vilified those who would \nraise questions about it as somehow not being concerned about securing \nthe return of our troops. That attack--that slur--shouldn't even be \ndignified by a response, particularly given what has been publicly \nadmitted.\n  President Obama has publicly admitted that there is ``absolutely'' a \nchance of the Taliban five returning to the battlefield and attacking \nAmericans.\n  Indeed, the current Taliban leadership has announced that from their \nperspective this deal is so good for them that they should now \nprioritize kidnapping other Americans. For example, last Thursday one \ntop Taliban commander told Time magazine--and this is a quote--``It's \nbetter to kidnap one person like Bergdahl than kidnapping hundreds of \nuseless people. It has encouraged our people. Now everybody will work \nhard to capture such an important bird.''\n  This deal puts every soldier, sailor, airman, and marine--every man \nand woman standing up to defend this Nation--in jeopardy.\n  The chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Senator Dianne \nFeinstein, has publicly said that she has seen ``no evidence'' that \nSergeant Bergdahl was under urgent threat in recent weeks or months.\n  All of these admissions together raise serious and legitimate \nconcerns about the circumstances of the release of the Taliban Five, \nand they also make clear that the administration should stop\n\n[[Page S3491]]\n\nvilifying any who raise these national concerns. Instead, the President \nshould stand up and honor his commitment to the American people, defend \nthis decision in terms of the national security interests of the United \nStates--what should be the highest priority for the Commander in Chief.\n  Instead, we have recently learned from news reports that there are at \nleast four other Gitmo detainees who are being considered for release. \nSo not only has there not been accountability as to why this happened, \nbut it appears the administration wants to go down the same road and I \ncan only assume is willing again to violate the law and not notify \nCongress the next time, just the way it violated the law by not \nnotifying Congress this time.\n  Before any further such action is considered, we need to take a pause \nand assess what happened with the Taliban five. We need to answer:\n  Who did the vetting that resulted in the assessment that the Taliban \nfive no longer posed a high level of threat to the United States?\n  Who participated in the decision to release them?\n  Was this the same deal the administration says they offered to brief \nCongress on previously or is it something different?\n  Was the President fully briefed on the background of the Taliban Five \nand the likelihood of recidivism?\n  How did the administration reach its apparently high level of \nconfidence that the Taliban five will be secure in Qatar?\n  How did they arrive upon the notion that that security should last \nonly 1 year, after which the American people will be safe if these \nterrorists are released altogether? On what basis did the \nadministration judge that only 1 year was sufficient?\n  How was the decision made to ignore the law and bypass Congress, \nincluding bypassing the chairs of the Senate and House Intelligence \nCommittees, Foreign Relations Committees, and Armed Services \nCommittees?\n  In what circumstances does the administration intend once again to \nopenly defy the law and refuse to provide notification to Congress?\n  These are questions, I might note, that should be bipartisan \nconcerns. This should not be a partisan affair--asking questions that \naffect the national security of every single American citizen and every \nsingle man and woman serving in the military.\n  In order to give the Obama administration the opportunity to satisfy \nthe many outstanding questions the American people have about their \nsafety--and I would note, having just returned from Texas, I found over \nand over again Texans, men and women, asking these very questions--I \nwill propose this week that before we consider any additional releases \nfrom Guantanamo, we answer these questions first.\n  The legislation I will be filing, No. 1, will immediately call for a \n6-month freeze on any Federal Government funding to transfer detainees \nfrom Guantanamo. No. 2, to enforce this requirement, the legislation \nwill provide that, should the President choose to disregard this law--\nas, sadly, has been his pattern so many other times--all funds expended \nin the transfer would be deducted directly from the budget of the \nExecutive Office of the President. No. 3, because we understand that \nconditions might possibly arise that would necessitate the release of \nan individual prisoner and out of respect for the President's special \nrole in international matters, this legislation explicitly provides a \nmeans for the President to ask Congress for a waiver of the 6-month bar \nin an individual case. But, finally, because we believe the release of \ndetainees from Guantanamo--which holds some of the most dangerous \npeople on the planet--is a matter of the gravest import, this \nlegislation would require that for every order for release of a \nGuantanamo detainee, it must be personally approved by the President. \nThis would ensure that the fullest consideration and deliberation goes \ninto the process.\n  This latest deal--which was announced to the American people as a \nfait accompli, with no opportunity for Congress to scrutinize it, no \nopportunity for the American people to assess it--this latest deal \nconstituted negotiating with terrorists to release five senior \nterrorist leaders, and it raises obvious questions.\n  First of all, how many Americans did these five terrorist leaders \ndirectly or indirectly murder? How many lives--American lives--are they \nresponsible for taking?\n  Second, how many American soldiers gave their lives to capture these \nfive senior terrorist leaders? How many graves do we have of sons and \ndaughters of Americans because they were sent in to capture these five \nwho have just been released?\n  Third, given their release--and the President's admission that there \nis ``absolutely'' a chance that they will return to actively waging war \nagainst the United States--how many Americans are at risk of being \nkilled directly or indirectly by these terrorist leaders we have just \nlet go?\n  Finally, if the Taliban five do return to actively trying to kill \nAmericans, how many American soldiers will once again have to risk \ntheir lives or, indeed, will give their lives trying to kill or capture \nthese terrorists once again?\n  These are questions of the utmost seriousness, and to date the \nadministration has not even attempted to answer them. Instead, it has \nsuggested that anyone raising these questions is simply failing to \nstand by the men and women of our military. I can tell you, the men and \nwomen of our military understand the value of protecting the national \nsecurity of the United States of America, and the men and women of our \nmilitary are not comforted by negotiations with terrorists to release \nsenior terrorist leaders who can once again begin actively waging war \non the United States.\n  Every American is naturally eager to end the long war in Afghanistan, \nbut that does not mean we disregard the threat that violent terrorist \ngroups such as the Taliban pose to our Nation. We know from the hard \nexperience of the last decade that at least one in three Guantanamo \ndetainees has returned to the battlefield. That has been what history \nhas taught us.\n  Until we have full confidence that this threat to American lives is \nbeing fully and properly assessed, that we are taking steps to protect \nthe lives of American civilians and American soldiers and sailors and \nairmen and marines, it is only prudent to take the steps in the \nlegislation I am introducing this week, and I hope the Senate will do \nso.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory \nquorum under rule XXII be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have filed, I am sorry to say, another \ncloture motion to get on a bill. We have more student loan debt in \nAmerica today than we have credit card debt. I just had a conference \ncall with some students from the State of Nevada.\n\n[[Page S3492]]\n\nWhat is going on is really very unfortunate. Some of these students \nlamented the fact: You know, I am not sure I should be in school. I am \nborrowing money. Maybe I should do something else.\n  I do not know how many times we have had to file cloture for the \nopportunity to get on a bill, but that is where we are. So we will have \na cloture vote to see if they will let us on the bill on Wednesday.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask the Senator, through the Chair, it is \nmy understanding that he just filed a procedural motion which will \nallow us to take up a bill and debate a bill which would give an \nopportunity to some of the 44 million Americans currently paying \ncollege student loans. This bill, authored by Senator Elizabeth Warren \nof Massachusetts, would allow students to refinance their college debt \ndown to today's interest levels--3.8 percent, if I am not mistaken, for \nundergraduate loans--which would make paying back their loans easier \nand sooner, and we have to go through a procedure of waiting 2 days in \nthe Senate to even start talking and debating on the bill. Is that what \nthe Senator is telling us?\n  Mr. REID. Through the Chair to my dear friend, that is what I am \nsaying.\n  What has happened around the country is not only in Nevada, it is all \nacross the country, with rare exception. State legislatures don't \nsupport higher education.\n  If you take an organization such as the Board of Regents of the State \nof Nevada, and they have a lump sum of money the legislature gives \nthem, they have to figure out a way to keep kids in school. So in \nNevada last Thursday they raised the tuition of our universities by 17 \npercent. What will happen? They will borrow more money.\n  I told those young people when I started the conversation today, I \nworked hard but with a little scholarship here or there, I could work \nhard and put myself through school. I put myself through college and \nlaw school, and they can't do it now. There aren't enough hours in the \nday to pay for this tuition.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for another question through the \nChair?\n  Mr. REID. I yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Procedurally, what the Senator had to do was file a \nmotion so the Senate could actually start debate on this issue. There \nwas a time in the Senate when you didn't have to have 60 votes to even \nstart debating an issue. But is it my understanding, now that we are \nbuilding up to a vote on Wednesday to see if five Republicans will \ncross the aisle and join us so we can have a debate the floor of the \nSenate on whether we can refinance college student loans, we have to \nwait 2 days?\n  Mr. REID. We, the Senate, and the American people have waited for \nmonths, because we have done this time and time again. We have had to \nfile cloture on just getting on a bill.\n  The sad part about it, on many occasions on nominations--they also do \nthe same on nominations; we have approximately 140 nominations held \nup--they vote for them. Bills they have supported, nominations they \nhave supported, they still make us file cloture and waste the time of \nthe American people. And I say months.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I could ask one last question through the Chair.\n  So we need five Republican Senators to join Democratic Senators if we \nare even going to debate the bill about refinancing college student \nloans; is that my understanding?\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is right.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAINE. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Lauck Nomination\n\n  Mr. KAINE. I rise in support of one of the judicial nominees whom we \nwill consider first by cloture vote in a few minutes and then a vote \nscheduled on confirmation tomorrow. It is the nomination of U.S. \nMagistrate Judge M. Hannah Lauck to the Federal bench in the Eastern \nDistrict of Virginia. Judge Lauck is somebody whom I know quite well, \nbecause she serves as a magistrate in the Richmond division of the \nEastern District where I live, and that is a court where I spent \nprobably the majority of my 17-year legal practice.\n  She has come full circle. She is a native Virginian, went to college \noutside of Virginia but came back to the Commonwealth after graduating \nfrom Yale Law School. She began her legal career as a law clerk for \nJudge James Spencer, whose retirement has opened this position on the \nFederal bench. It is fitting as she was one of his first law clerks, \nand now she has the opportunity with this nomination to fill his shoes \non the court.\n  Judge Lauck is very well prepared. She began, as I explained, as a \njudicial law clerk, which is a prestigious position, for a wonderful \nFederal judge, Judge James Spencer. She has included in her public \ncareer over the past 20-plus years both public service and private \npractice.\n  Before she joined the bench as a magistrate, Judge Lauck served as a \ncorporate counsel for Genworth Financial, a Fortune 500 company, in \nRichmond. For 10 years before that she was assistant U.S. attorney in \nthe Eastern District of Virginia, where she started in civil \nlitigation, handling the entire spectrum of civil cases involving the \nUnited States as a party, and finished as a criminal prosecutor. \nCoupled with her service as a magistrate, this extensive experience in \nboth private practice and work in the U.S. Attorney's Office makes her \nvery familiar with the docket of this court.\n  She became a U.S. magistrate judge in 2005. I know the Presiding \nOfficer practiced law and understands the important work Federal \nmagistrates do. Her work has involved all Federal misdemeanors.\n  Magistrates in the Richmond division try Federal misdemeanors, and \nthey also try complex civil matters fully with the consent of the \nparties. It is the practice in eastern Virginia for parties to often \nconsent to magistrate judges trying their cases. She has since 2005, 9 \nyears, acted as a judge in virtually the entire range of matters that \nthis court handles, this Federal court.\n  Along the way, Hannah has distinguished herself as an excellent \nattorney and earned awards for her work, including various \ncommendations from the U.S. Attorney's Office, U.S. Marshals Service, \nthe Virginia State Police, the Drug Enforcement Agency, and Genworth, \nher previous private sector employer. She was also named as a Virginia \nLeader in the Law for her work and service to the bench.\n  I am excited to be here on behalf of Judge Lauck. This is a vacancy \non which both Senator Warner and I have worked very hard. We first \nasked our local bar association, especially the Virginia State Bar, to \nconduct interviews and then make recommendations to us. We did that \nfirst, and then all the candidates were interviewed by us. We are proud \nto recommend her to the President and thankful that the President \nnominated her for the position.\n  In closing, I will say this is a court that I am very close to. My \nwife clerked for a Federal judge on this court when she started her \nlegal career, just as Judge Lauck started her legal career in the same \nway. I served as a civil litigator for 17 years with a Richmond firm \ndirectly across the street from the courthouse and spent a lot of time \nthere.\n  I know--the Presiding Officer reminded me; thank you for doing it--\nthat the Presiding Officer's father was the first Federal magistrate in \nVirginia in this same court, the Eastern District of Virginia, \nAlexandria division.\n  So the Presiding Officer knows well the work magistrates do. I have \nstayed very close to this court since I tried my last case in 2001. I \nknow the judges, I know the court personnel, I know the lawyers, and I \nknow many of the parties, and they speak with uniform plaudits in \nregard to the work Judge Lauck has done as a magistrate.\n  There is no better person for this seat being vacated than Judge \nLauck to have the full article III power that will come if she is \nconfirmed. I am very happy to recommend her to all my colleagues. She \nwill be an excellent judge to serve on that court.\n\n[[Page S3493]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/09/senate-section/article/S3493-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3493]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this vote the yeas are 53, the nays are 34. \nThe motion is agreed to.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                         Violence in Las Vegas\n\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, before I begin, I would like to take a \nmoment to address the unsettling events that occurred yesterday when \ntwo members of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department and an \ninnocent civilian were victims of a terrible act of violence. While \nwords offer little comfort at this difficult time, I would like to \nexpress my sincere condolences to the victims' families. The Las Vegas \ncommunity is grateful to these police officers for their service and \njoins their families in mourning their loss. I would also like to thank \nthe men and women of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department who \nsprung into action following the tragic events, even after losing \nmembers of the law enforcement community.\n\n\n                          Boulware Nomination\n\n  With that said, Mr. President, I wish to speak in favor of a fellow \nNevadan's nomination that is currently pending before this body; that \nis, the nomination of Richard Boulware to be a U.S. district judge for \nthe District of Nevada.\n  One of the most important and unique responsibilities we hold as \nMembers of the Senate is to provide for the advice and consent of the \nPresident's judicial nominations and subsequent confirmations.\n  I believe each judicial nominee who comes before this body must not \nonly be qualified but also must demonstrate fairness and commitment to \nupholding the Constitution and the laws of the United States.\n  In Nevada, it is critical for us to work together to find qualified \ncandidates who will uphold America's principles of impartiality under \nthe law.\n  Richard Boulware is an excellent example of an accomplished nominee \nwho should be confirmed on a bipartisan basis. I believe Mr. Boulware \nembodies the characteristics of a nominee who is prepared to serve and \nthat he will make an excellent district court judge for the State of \nNevada. After sitting down with him and discussing his nomination at \nlength, I found him to be an extremely impressive nominee. A graduate \nof Harvard University, Mr. Boulware went on to earn his law degree from \nColumbia University. He currently serves as assistant Federal public \ndefender for the District of Nevada in Las Vegas. He also has extensive \nexperience arguing before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. This \ntrial experience, coupled with his impressive academic accomplishments \nwhile clerking for the U.S. district courts, will serve him well on the \nbench. Outside of his professional duties, he currently serves his \nlocal school system as a member of the Superintendent's Educational \nOpportunities Advisory Committee.\n  I am glad to see the Senate moving forward with this nomination, and \nI look forward to voting tomorrow to confirm Mr. Boulware's nomination \nto the Federal bench in Nevada.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. MARKEY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. MARKEY. I will yield to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of the remarks of the Senator from Massachusetts, Senator \nWhitehouse, and two or three others at his choosing, that I be \nrecognized as in morning business for such time as I shall consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. It is not an objection at this point, but I think it \nis our understanding that the Senator from Oklahoma will speak for 20 \nto 30 minutes but that the time would revert to me at the conclusion of \nhis remarks after 20 to 30 minutes. If that is an acceptable amendment \nto the unanimous consent request, then I will agree to it.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Let's just amend the Senator's amendment that it be 20 to \n35 minutes.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Perfect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  We are at a very important historical juncture, where the science is \nnow conclusive that in fact the planet is dangerously warming.\n  Since we last met on this floor a lot has happened. The global \ntemperature\n\n[[Page S3495]]\n\nfor April 2014 tied with 2010 for the warmest April ever recorded in \nthe history of the planet. This goes back to 1880.\n  In May, the third National Climate Assessment presented the \nscientific evidence that climate change is already impacting the United \nStates.\n  The good news. The good news is that the President last week \npromulgated new rules to control greenhouse gases coming out of \npowerplants in the United States of America.\n  Here is the very good news--the Senator from Rhode Island, the \nSenator from Vermont, the States across the Northeast--nine States have \nalready had a regional greenhouse gas initiative over the last 9 years. \nIn Massachusetts, we are already 40 percent lower now in 2014 than we \nwere in 2005--40 percent lower. We know a flexible system such as this \ncan and will work across the country.\n  It is absolutely necessary for the United States to be the leader. We \ncannot preach temperance from a bar stool. The United States cannot \ntell the rest of the world they should reduce their greenhouse gases \nwhen we are still continuing on our historic path.\n  The good news is we are going to create a green energy revolution. We \ncan save creation while engaging in massive job creation in the United \nStates.\n  We can unleash this green energy revolution. We can reduce greenhouse \ngases. We can give the leadership to the rest of the world. We need to \nhave a big debate here on the Senate floor. This is the place where the \nUnited States of America expects us to have this debate and where the \nrest of the world is watching.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, the issue we are discussing tonight, \nfrankly, is perhaps the most important issue facing our entire planet. \nThe issue has everything to do with whether we are going to leave a \nhabitable planet for our kids and our grandchildren. I want to thank \nthe Senate Climate Action Task Force, led by Senator Boxer, Senator \nWhitehouse, Senator Heinrich, and others for helping to bring us down \nhere tonight to discuss this issue.\n  While it goes without saying that Senator Inhofe and many of us hold \nvery different points of view regarding global warming, I want to \ncongratulate him for having the courage to come down here and defend \nhis point of view. That is what democracy is about. I think he is \nwrong, but I am glad he is here.\n  Virtually the entire scientific community agrees that climate change \nis real, that it is already causing devastating problems in the United \nStates and around the world in terms of floods, droughts, wildfires, \nforest fires, and extreme weather disturbances. The scientific \ncommunity is also almost virtually unanimous in agreeing that climate \nchange is caused significantly by human activity.\n  According to a study published in the journal Environmental Research \nLetters in May of last year, more than 97 percent of peer-reviewed \nscientific literature on climate supports the view that human activity \nis a primary cause of global warming.\n  What disturbs me very much about this debate is the rejection of \nbasic science. We can have differences of opinion on health care, on \nthe funding of education, on whether we should have a jobs program, on \nmany other issues. But what the U.S. Senate should not be about is \nrejecting basic science. It saddens me very much that most of my \ncolleagues in the Republican Party are doing just that.\n  We do not hear great debates on the floor of the Senate regarding \nresearch in terms of cancer, in terms of heart disease, in terms of \nother scientific issues. But for whatever reason--and I happen to \nbelieve those reasons have a lot to do with the power of the coal \nindustry, of the oil industry, of the fossil fuel industry--we are \nsuddenly seeing a great debate on an issue the overwhelming majority of \nscientists agree on; that is, climate change is real; it is caused by \nhuman activity.\n  2012 was the second worst year on record in the United States for \nextreme weather. Across the globe, the 10 warmest years on record have \nall occurred since 1998. The global annual average temperature has \nincreased by more than 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit between 1880 and 2012. \nLast month the White House released the National Climate Assessment, \nemphasizing that global warming is already happening, and warning--and \npeople should hear this--that global warming could exceed 10 degrees \nFahrenheit in the United States by the end of this century--10 degrees \nFahrenheit.\n  That is extraordinary. If that in fact happens, if we do not summon \nup the courage to transform our energy system, the damage done by that \nseverity of increase in temperature will be huge.\n  Also last month scientists reported a large section of the West \nAntarctica ice sheet is falling apart, and that its continued melting \nis now unstoppable.\n  Bloomberg reported on the 1st of June that Australia hit new heat \nrecords in May. The 24-month period ending in April 2014 was the \nhottest on record for any 2-year period, and the 24-month period ending \nwith May of 2014 is expected to exceed that.\n  But it is not just Australia; it is my home State of Vermont. The \nAssociated Press reported last week that the average temperature in \nboth Vermont and Maine rose by 2.5 degrees over the past 30 years. This \nis the second highest of any State in the lower 48, after Maine. Maine \nand Vermont are at the top.\n  Lake Champlain provides one telling illustration of these changes. It \nfreezes over less often and later in the winter than it used to. \nBetween 1800 and 1900, Lake Champlain froze over 97 out of 100 winters, \n97 percent of the time. That number began dropping after 1900. In the \npast 40 years, Lake Champlain has only frozen over 17 times. These \nchanges impact the ski industry. They weaken our maple industry. They \nallow pests to survive the winter unharmed and to become more damaging \nto trees and crops as a result.\n  These impacts are expected to worsen. According to the 2014 National \nClimate Assessment, temperatures in the northeast could increase an \nadditional 10 degrees Fahrenheit by 2080 if emissions continue at their \ncurrent rate. By the end of the century, summers in Vermont--our \nbeautiful summers--could feel like summers in Georgia right now. I love \nthe State of Georgia. It is a great State. But the State of Vermont \nwould prefer to have our summers the way they have been, not Georgia's.\n  The thing is these new proposed carbon pollution standards are \nactually quite modest. It is clear to me that if we listen to the \nscientific community, what they are telling us is there is a small \nwindow of opportunity, and it would be rather extraordinary--\nextraordinary--for us to look our kids and our grandchildren in the eye \nand to say: You know what. We rejected the science and we let this \nplanet become less and less habitable for you and your kids.\n  We have a moral responsibility not to do that. It seems clear to me \nwhat we should be doing--and I think the scientific community is in \nagreement--first, we need to aggressively expand energy efficiency all \nover this country in terms of older homes and buildings. We can save an \nenormous amount of fuel, cut carbon emissions, lower fuel bills, and \ncreate jobs if we do that.\n  Furthermore, we must move aggressively to such sustainable energies \nas wind, solar, biomass, geothermal, and other technologies. We must \ninvest in research and development to make those technologies even more \nefficient. In my view, it is a no-brainer to say we must reject the \nproposed Keystone XL Pipeline once and for all. We need to end tax \nbreaks and subsidies for oil and coal companies, which amount to well \nover $10 billion a year. We should not be subsidizing those companies \nthat are helping to destroy our planet.\n  Finally, we need to price carbon through a carbon tax or some other \napproach so the real cost of burning carbon is reflected in the price. \nI am very proud Senator Barbara Boxer, the chairperson of the \nenvironmental committee, and I introduced such legislation last year.\n  The bottom line is we are in a pivotal moment in history. This \nCongress has got to act. It has to act boldly. When we do that, when we \ncut greenhouse gas emissions, when we transform our energy system, we \ncan save many people money on their fuel bills, we can cut pollution in \ngeneral, we can cut\n\n[[Page S3496]]\n\ngreenhouse gas emissions significantly, and we can create good-paying \njobs all over this country.\n  The bottom line here is we cannot afford to reject basic science. We \nhave to listen to what the scientific community is saying. We have got \nto act aggressively, and let's do it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, as an engineer one of the things I \nlearned early in my education was that science does not care if you \nbelieve in it or not; you can deny science as much as you want, but the \ndata suggests that the scientific method works pretty darn well.\n  The corollary to that fact is whether you believe in climate change \nhas no bearing on whether it is actually occurring. Unfortunately, the \ndata shows a warmer and warmer planet, characterized by weather \nfluctuations that are more extreme and oftentimes more destructive. In \nmy home State of New Mexico, too often we find ourselves dealing with \nthe impacts of climate change today, not at some theoretical future \ndate.\n  For example, we are already seeing the effects of climate change and \nhow it manifests itself in more extreme drought conditions, larger and \nmore intense wildfires, shrinking forests, and increased flooding when \nit finally does rain. The longer we wait to act, the more difficult and \nexpensive the solutions will be, and the more unpredictable our weather \nwill become.\n  2012, as the Senator from Vermont mentioned, was our Nation's second \nmost extreme year for weather on record. In my home State of New \nMexico, we experienced the hottest year in our entire historical \nrecord. With humidity levels lower and temperatures higher, we are \ndealing with fire behavior in our forests that is markedly more intense \nthan in the past.\n  We also see climate change take a toll directly on our economy, \nespecially in my State. That is an important point, because inaction \nhas its costs too. The costs already being borne in New Mexico are \nsubstantial. With less snowpack, communities that rely on winter sports \ntourism take an economic hit. Fewer people lodge in hotels, shop in \nstores, eat in restaurants.\n  Climate change is also having a devastating impact on New Mexico's \nagricultural industry, where farmers and ranchers are often the very \nfirst to see the direct impact of extreme weather. The agricultural \nsector is highly vulnerable due in large part to the sustained threat \nto the water supply, the soil and vegetation from continuous drought.\n  Things are only going to get worse if we do nothing. If we take our \nmoral responsibility as stewards of this Earth seriously, it is \nimperative that we face the challenge of reversing the effects of \nclimate change head on and have a sober discussion about what actions \nwe will need to take now and in the future. America clearly has the \ncapacity to become energy independent. But we also need to transition \nfrom our current energy portfolio to one that produces as much or more \npower with substantially less carbon pollution per kilowatt hour.\n  That will require innovation, something that historically our country \nhas done better than any country in the world. But additionally, we \nwill need political will, something we have grown short of as climate \ndenial and pseudoscience have made their way into the halls of \nCongress.\n  If history is our guide, we should know that investing in cleaner \nenergy will not be without cost, but little of value is ever free. The \nquestion is, are we willing to make the modest investments now \nnecessary to create the quality jobs of tomorrow and to protect our \nNation from the serious economic and strategic risks associated with \nour carbon reliance, our reliance on both foreign and carbon pollution-\nintensive energy sources?\n  Since we are looking at history, let's take a moment and look at the \nClean Air Act of 1990, and compare the rhetoric of debate with the \nreality of its implementation. In 1989, the Edison Electric Institute \npredicted a significant rise in energy costs due to the Clean Air Act. \nYet the reality, according to a recent study by the Center for American \nProgress, actually showed a decrease of 16 percent over those years. In \n1990, the U.S. Business Roundtable claimed that passage of the Clean \nAir Act would cost a minimum--a minimum--of 200,000 jobs. But a recent \nstudy released by the EPA revealed the reality. The Clean Air Act \nresulted in a net creation of jobs and new industries created to reduce \npollution, good-paying jobs in industries such as engineering, \nmanufacturing, construction, and maintenance.\n  By 2008 the environmental technology sector supported 1.7 million \njobs in this country.\n  The time has come to address climate change rather than embracing the \npseudoscience and denial that is embraced by far too many in Washington \ntoday. The Nation has never solved a single problem by denying the \nfacts. Let me be clear. Inaction is not a solution to this very real \ncrisis. Denial is not a strategy.\n  Consequently, if my Republican colleagues have a better way to \naddress carbon pollution than what the President has proposed, I would \nask them to join the debate. If they have a pollution solution that is \nmore efficient or more effective, now is the time to have that \ndiscussion.\n  Through American ingenuity we can slow the impact of climate change \nand unleash the full potential of cleaner energy. We can create a \nhealthier, more stable environment for future generations, but we must \nhave the will to recognize the facts as they are. We will need to make \nthe investments that are necessary, and we will have to find the \npolitical will to act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from Rhode Island withhold for just a \nmoment.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I would gladly withhold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I express my appreciation to my friend from \nRhode Island, who is so courteous to everyone, and I appreciate it.\n\n\n            Unanimous Consent Agreement-- Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that on Tuesday, June 10, following \ndisposition of Executive Calendar No. 734, the Lauck nomination, the \ntime until 12 noon be equally divided between the two leaders or their \ndesignees and the Senate proceed to vote as under the previous order; \nfurther, that following disposition of Calendar No. 736, the Sorokin \nnomination, and Calendar No. 739, the Boulware nomination, the Senate \nstand in recess until 2:15 p.m.; that at 2:15 p.m. the time until 2:30 \np.m. be equally divided between the two leaders or their designees and \nat 2:30 p.m. the Senate proceed to vote on cloture on Calendar No. 769, \nthe Brainard nomination, Calendar No. 771, the Powell nomination, and \nCalendar No. 767, the Fischer nomination; further, that if cloture is \ninvoked on any of these nominations, all postcloture time be expired \nand the Senate proceed to vote on confirmation of the nominations on \nThursday, June 12, 2014, at 1:45 p.m.; further, that any rollcall vote \nafter the first in each sequence be 10 minutes in length; further, that \nif any nomination is confirmed, the motions to reconsider be considered \nmade and laid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate; \nthat no further motions be in order to the nominations; that any \nstatements related to the nominations be printed in the Record; and \nthat the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. With this agreement, there will be one rollcall vote at \napproximately 10 a.m. tomorrow, two rollcall votes at 12 noon, and \nthree additional rollcall votes beginning at 2:30 p.m. We had to move \nthese votes around for a lot of reasons. One is there that is a bill \nsigning, another is that there is a funeral, and another is that one of \nour Senators wants to attend his son's graduation. So we will wind up \nat the same place--even though it won't be as orderly--at the end of \nthe week.\n  Thank you again, my friend from Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n[[Page S3497]]\n\n  First, I thank Senator Sanders of Vermont, Senator Markey of \nMassachusetts, and Senator Heinrich of New Mexico for their remarks. I \nlook forward to the remarks of Senator Inhofe of Oklahoma.\n  Viewers may wonder what we are doing here. As some will recall, \nseveral weeks ago a number of Democratic Senators--I think we ended up \nbeing 31 in total--participated in an all-night event to raise the \nawareness of and the discussion of climate change in this body. At that \ntime only one of our Republican colleagues appeared to join the \ndiscussion, and that was the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma, who \nis here again this evening.\n  We heard some rumblings that some of our colleagues didn't feel they \nwere included or wished they would have had the opportunity to \nparticipate. So taking them up on that offer, a number of us sent a \nletter on May 30 that says, in part:\n\n       Dear Colleague . . . We would welcome an opportunity to \n     engage with our Republican colleagues in a discussion of how \n     to address the problems of climate change. Indeed, we think \n     our Republican colleagues could have a lot to offer if they \n     wished to join us in exploring solutions.\n       Republican colleagues have co-authored bipartisan climate \n     legislation, voted for the comprehensive Waxman/Markey \n     climate legislation in the House, spoken out in favor of a \n     carbon fee, and campaigned for national office on climate \n     action. Republican senators represent states with great \n     coastal cities inundated by rising tides, states with \n     farmlands swept by unprecedented floods and droughts, states \n     with forests lost to encroaching pine beetles and wildfires \n     unprecedented in season and intensity, states with \n     disappearing glaciers and reduced snowpack, and states with \n     dying coral reefs and shifting habitats and fisheries. \n     Republican senators represent home-state corporations with \n     international brand names, corporations that urge action on \n     climate. Republican senators represent great universities \n     that contribute to the scientific understanding of climate \n     change and how human activities are changing it. We look \n     forward to the opportunity to discuss climate change and how \n     to respond to it with Republican senators.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 30, 2014.\n       Dear Colleague,  As you may know, thirty-one of us recently \n     took to the floor of the Senate for a ``climate all-nighter'' \n     to express our concern over Congress's inaction on carbon \n     pollution. We have heard some feedback expressing concerns \n     that Republican colleagues were not invited to join in. We \n     would welcome an opportunity to engage with our Republican \n     colleagues in a discussion of how to address the problems of \n     climate change. Indeed, we think our Republican colleagues \n     could have a lot to offer if they wish to join us in \n     exploring solutions.\n       Republican colleagues have co-authored bipartisan climate \n     legislation, voted for the comprehensive Waxman/Markey \n     climate legislation in the House, spoken out in favor of a \n     carbon fee, and campaigned for national office on climate \n     action.

We look \n     forward to the opportunity to discuss climate change and how \n     to respond to it with Republican senators.\n       For any colleague who felt left out of our climate all-\n     nighter we invite you to come to the floor. We've requested \n     from leadership that time after votes on June 9th be reserved \n     to engage in a robust exchange of views.\n       We earnestly believe that the stakes of failing to exercise \n     American leadership and solve this problem are very high, \n     with ramifications for our health and safety, our economic \n     well-being, our food and water supplies, and our national \n     security and standing. We hope you will join us in a sincere \n     discussion.\n           Sincerely,\n     Sheldon Whitehouse,\n     Barbara Boxer,\n     Bernard Sanders,\n     Jeff Merkley,\n     Edward J. Markey,\n       U.S. Senators.\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. That sets the frame for what we are doing. We have \nhad four Democratic Senators speak. We will be joined, I believe, by \nChairman Boxer and perhaps others later on in the evening.\n  Pursuant to the unanimous consent we have agreed to, I yield to the \nSenator from Oklahoma for his remarks and will seek recognition \npursuant to the unanimous consent at the conclusion of his remarks.\n  Pursuant to that understanding, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. First, I thank my good friend for yielding. I think we \nwill have several people coming down and talking about this tonight.\n  I want to say something about Senator Sanders from Vermont. I \nappreciate very much his comments. I think they were very appropriate.\n  I remember one time when he and I had a difference of opinion on an \namendment. It had to do with the amount of money one of the large oil \ncompanies made. He and I debated on floor for something like 3 hours. A \nvote was taken, and I did win the vote. Afterward, he came up to me and \nhe said: I want you to know that since I have been here from the House, \nthat was probably the most enlightened debate we have ever had, and you \nwon and I lost, and I really do appreciate it.\n  We have been very good friends since then.\n  Well, the comments he made are real because I don't have any doubt in \nmy mind that Senator Sanders and the rest of you have strong feelings \nabout this.\n  What I want to do is something a little bit different. I have heard \nseveral people talk, and they talk about what is the hottest year and \nthe coldest year and all of that. I am very careful to document \nanything I say, and I will continue to do that tonight.\n  Last Monday, the EPA released the long-awaited global warming \nregulations for the Nation's existing fleet of powerplants. We had \nalready talked about the new powerplants and what we are going to do. \nWe have seen the evidence of the increased pricing of energy in this \ncountry as a result of that. Now, of course, we are going to be talking \nabout the existing program.\n  The interesting thing about this--this is what they are talking about \ndoing through regulation after they have lost every single issue on the \nfloor of this Senate--and so trying to do it now by regulations.\n  The EPA's proposed rule requires powerplants to reduce their \nCO2 emissions by 25 percent by 2020 and by 30 percent by \n2030. I do believe there will be major legal challenges facing this \nrule if it goes final, and I will talk about that in just a minute.\n  Over the past decade the Senate has debated a number of cap-and-trade \nbills. The first one was the McCain-Lieberman bill of 2003--I am going \nfrom memory now. I think Republicans had a majority at that time. I \nthink I chaired either the subcommittee or the committee of \njurisdiction. We defeated the McCain-Lieberman bill. It came up again \nslightly changed in 2005. We defeated it at that time too. Then the \nWarner-Lieberman bill came up in 2008, and we defeated that even by a \nlarger margin. The Waxman-Markey bill--and keep in mind that this was \nwhen the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts was in the House--\ncame up in 2009, but it never did reach the floor.\n  All of these bills would have established greenhouse gas regulations \nfor the Nation's largest manufacturing power-generation facilities, but \nonce the American people learned how much these cost, Congress ran away \nfrom these bills and they were defeated.\n  Each and every one of these bills would have cost the economy between \n$300 and $400 billion in lost GDP every year. These figures are not \ndisputed. The first time they were calculated was back when the first \nbill came up. At that time everyone assumed that global warming was \nreal, they assumed that the end of the world was coming and that \nmanmade gases were responsible for it, and that was something which was \nkind of accepted.\n  At that time, though--and I remember hearing the first speculation as \nto the cost--the Wharton Econometrics Forecasting Associates came out \nwith the range of between $300 and $400 billion a year. Then the \nMassachusetts Institute of Technology, MIT, and Charles River \nAssociates and others came out with the same range--between $300 and \n$400 billion a year.\n  When you break this down to each household--every time there is some \nbig regulation that comes along, I take\n\n[[Page S3498]]\n\nthe number of people from my State of Oklahoma who filed a Federal tax \nreturn, number of families, and then I will calculate, do the math, and \nit turns out about $3,000 a family. That would make cap and trade the \nlargest tax increase in American history.\n  It is not surprising that these bills did not become law. They were \ndefeated. The McCain-Lieberman bill of 2003 fell 43 to 55; then the \nMcCain-Lieberman bill in 2005--an even wider margin--38 to 60; and the \nWaxman-Markey fell because they didn't have the votes to do it.\n  What I am saying is that the trend is not going the way my good \nfriend from Rhode Island would like to have it go. Instead, more and \nmore people are opposing this.\n  Part of what is motivating the EPA's rule is that they want to say \nthey leveled the playing field between parts of the country that don't \nhave cap-and-trade programs. I think one of the previous speakers \ntalked about the fact that many places like--I see the Senator from \nCalifornia is here now--California and the Northeastern States have cap \nand trade. These regions are hurting economically in part because of \nthe onerous environmental regulations, including cap-and-trade programs \nthey have been working to implement for so many years.\n  But the real result of this has been higher electricity prices. In \nfact, the average price of retail electricity in New England, according \nto the Energy Information Administration, is 17.67 cents per kilowatt \nhour. That is almost 18 cents a kilowatt hour. Compare that to \nOklahoma. We are at 9 cents per kilowatt hour. We are one-half the cost \nin my State of Oklahoma for electricity. You see we have a real \ncompetitive advantage. There is nothing that keeps the Northeast from \nbringing their electricity costs down, but they are unwilling to do it. \nThey are unwilling to do what we did; that is, utilize a diverse, \ninexpensive fuel supply we can source from right at home in Oklahoma.\n  California implemented its own cap-and-trade program just over a year \nago, and it applies to both heavy industry and power generation. The \nState boasts that its program is second in size only to the European \ncap-and-trade program. Today, however, California's electricity prices \nare 15.94 cents--in other words, 16 cents per kilowatt hour--a stunning \n70 percent more than they are in my State of Oklahoma.\n  Knowing this, it isn't surprising we constantly hear about all the \njobs and companies and manufacturing facilities that are moving from \nplaces such as California and New England to States such as Oklahoma \nand to the South where we don't have these same kinds of regulations. \nWhat we want to do in Oklahoma is develop a nurturing environment for \nbusiness to thrive, and a big part of it is having inexpensive, \nreliable energy. That is what we have in Oklahoma. EPA's rule threatens \nall we have worked so hard to accomplish, and it is all because so many \npoliticians are beholden to the radical environmentalists.\n  What is interesting to me is the more and more the other side talks \nabout global warming and all of the purported solutions here in \nWashington, the less and less people care.\n  In March, when Senate Democrats hosted their first global warming \nslumber party, Gallup released the results of the poll I believe the \nsame day, showing Americans rank global warming as the 14th most \nimportant issue out of 15. I believe this was on March 9 or 10 when \nthey had their last slumber party. It used to be No. 1 or No. 2, and \nnow it is nearly last. We can see on this chart Gallup's poll numbers \nover time showing Americans care less about environmental issues than \nthey ever did before. We can see the changes that have taken place. \nWhat people really care about are the economy and government spending. \nThose are the top two issues across party lines.\n  If enacted, this rule is going to cause serious damage to the \neconomy. The Chamber of Commerce last week put out a study on \nregulations similar to the EPA's new greenhouse gas rules and found \nthey will cost the economy $51 billion in lost GDP and 224,000 lost \njobs each year--not just once but each year.\n  The Heritage Foundation put out separate analysis calculating that \nthe rule would enact a cumulative hit of $2.23 trillion in lost GDP and \ndestroy 600,000 jobs. By their measure, the average income for a family \nof four would decrease by $1,200 a year. I believe it is actually \ncloser to $3,000 a year. Nonetheless, there is the consistency.\n  If we want to see where these regulations will ultimately lead, we \nneed look no farther than the modeling President Obama uses. We need to \nbe, as he says, more like Germany. Starting a few years ago, Germany \nbegan implementing an aggressive alternative energy agenda where they \nhiked subsidies and set a goal of generating 35 percent of their \nelectricity from renewables by 2020. By 2050, this goal would increase \nto 80 percent. In doing this, the price of German retail electricity \nhas doubled from where it was before. It is now 3 times--300 percent--\nhigher than ours.\n  The next chart is Der Spiegel, a major publication in Germany. They \nrecently had this on the cover of the magazine with the heading \n``Luxury Electricity: Why energy has become more expensive and what \npoliticians must do about it.''\n  In this, they talk about the politicians and others who are wishing \nGermany had not done what it was doing. And while industry, utilities, \nconsumers, and some politicians are calling for reforms to the laws, it \nmay be too late because everything is already on the books. This is \nwhat they are finding in Germany--and we all know how hard it is to \nrepeal a law once it becomes implemented. So the Germans started this, \nand we are now emulating Germany, and their cost of electricity has \ndoubled. When we talk about doubling, to a lot of people--maybe a lot \nof us who serve in this Chamber--that is not a big deal. But take a \npoor family that is spending 50 percent of their income on energy. It \nis something they can't handle.\n  EPA's rules will push us in the same direction as Germany--which \nmakes sense, when we consider the EPA's recent rules such as utility \nMACT and the 316(b) rule, and the NRC's incessant overregulation of the \nnuclear power industry. We have perfectly good powerplants being forced \nto shut down all over the country. Now we have this rule coming out of \nEPA that will force even more shutdowns and push the Nation to more \naggressively adopt renewables, and over a very short period of time. \nThis is going to cause reliability and affordability issues.\n  We have been talking about affordability. Reliability is another \nthing too, because we have to have a reliable source that doesn't stop. \nThere is no way around it. It is not just me saying this. FERC \nCommissioner Phil Moeller recently predicted that because of EPA's \noverregulation, the Nation could face rolling blackouts by next summer. \nRenewables will only make this risk more severe. If a substantial \namount of electricity is being provided by renewables, then we will \nbecome vulnerable to reliability risks.\n  What I mean by that is we don't always know when the Sun is going to \nbe shining or when the wind is going to be blowing, but there is always \na demand for power. The demand is always there, but the wind stops. I \nunderstand this. I am from Oklahoma. We can have a very windy day and \nall of a sudden it stops, and the Sun maybe stops shining. If the wind \nis blowing really hard one day and then stops the next, significant \nstrains are put on the electricity grid.\n  To compensate for that, we have to have backup power ready to come \nonline at a moment's notice--where it is turned off 1 minute and then \non the next. Having that kind of capacity sitting around waiting for \nthe Sun to stop shining is incredibly expensive, which is one of the \nreasons Germany's power is so much more expensive than others.\n  So when I hear the President and EPA saying this rule could actually \nlower electricity bills, it makes me wonder if they ever sit down in \nthe same room with FERC and NERC and NRC to tell it like it is. \nHonestly, they are not telling the truth.\n  The President and Administrator McCarthy have also been touting the \nhuman health benefits this rule will deliver. To help announce the new \nrule, President Obama did a conference call with the American Lung \nAssociation and said it would help reduce instances of childhood \nasthma. Gina McCarthy made the same point in her remarks about the \nrule. But this completely contradicts what EPA previously said.\n\n[[Page S3499]]\n\n  In this chart which the Agency has published, in official \ndocumentation, it says greenhouse gases ``do not cause direct adverse \nhealth effects such as respiratory or toxic effects.'' I know others \nwill stand up to refute this, but this is what the EPA said.\n  What is even worse is this rule will not have any impact on global \nCO2 emissions. We know this because of the President's first \nEPA Administrator, Lisa Jackson. This is kind of interesting. I asked \nher the question during the committee hearing, on live TV: If we were \nto do away, either pass cap-and-trade or by regulation, would this \nreduce the overall CO2 emissions worldwide?\n  And she said: No, it wouldn't. Her quote is: ``U.S. action alone will \nnot impact world CO2 levels.'' This is because the largest \ntax increase in history, without any benefits--because once you \nimplement these regulations, our manufacturing base would go someplace \nwhere they can find it; maybe China, maybe India, maybe Mexico. But \nthey will go places where they don't have the stringent emission \nrequirements we have in this country. So in that case, emissions would \nactually go up instead of down.\n\n  Add to all of this the fact that there has been no increase in global \nsurface temperature between 1998 and 2013. This is according to the \njournal Nature, the Economist, and even the Intergovernmental Panel on \nClimate Change that is the United Nations. They are the ones who \nstarted this, and even they say there has not been any increase in \nglobal surface temperature between the years of 1998 and 2013.\n  This pause was totally unexpected by the scientific community. After \nall, CO2 concentrations went up by 8 percent over the same \nperiod of time--which, according to the models, should have led to \nsignificant temperature increases. This chart shows the difference \nbetween actual temperatures--the blue and the green lines down here--\nand the temperatures that were predicted by ``consensus'' scientific \ncommunity--the red line. They said this is where the heat was coming, \nand it didn't happen. It is clear the scientific community, which \neveryone puts so much trust in, did not predict a pause would actually \nhappen.\n  Add to this the fact that the U.S. Historical Climatology Network is \nreporting that this is the coldest year so far on record for the United \nStates. Others will say, no, that is not true. So I quoted this source, \nthe U.S. Historical Climatology Network, that if things continue as \nthey are so far, this will be the coldest year on record in the United \nStates.\n  Normally, putting all this together would make me wonder why the \nPresident is pushing these regulations. But then I remember Tom Steyer. \nLet me introduce him.\n  This man, who made billions in the traditional energy industry, is \nthe new poster child of the environmental left. He is the one who \npromised to direct $100 million to resurrect the dead issue of global \nwarming. He has the President and others on board with his plan, and \nthey are following through. Tonight's slumber party is proof enough.\n  I can hear it now. A severe case of righteous indignation is going to \nshow up, and they are going to say: Are you saying Tom Steyer is \nputting 100 million in these races?\n  No, I am not saying that. That is what Tom Steyer is saying.\n  I have a quote here from him: It is true that we expect to be heavily \ninvolved in the midterm elections. We are looking at a bunch of races. \nMy guess is we will end up being involved in eight or more races. And \nthat is with $100 million.\n  But that is what this all comes down to--a key constituency of the \nDemocratic Party wanting to see the Nation completely change the way we \ngenerate and consume energy--for no environmental benefit. The only \nbenefit here is a political one.\n  In closing, I wish to highlight a few of the legal issues I mentioned \na minute ago that will likely come up once the rule is finalized. There \nare three main reasons why I do not believe this rule, from a legal \nperspective, is an appropriate construct of the Clean Air Act. I always \nsupported the Clean Air Act amendments, and good things happened from \nthem.\n  The first is the Clean Air Act was never designed to handle \ngreenhouse gas emissions. We know that. This is a bipartisan \nperspective. Congressman John Dingell, one of the principal architects \nof the Clean Air Act over in the House, said last week:\n\n       I do not believe the Clean Air Act is intended, or is the \n     most effective way, to regulate greenhouse gases.\n\n  The second legal reason is this rule relies on an outside-the-fence \napproach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Section 111 of the Clean \nAir Act should only allow the EPA to establish a process where the \nStates determine the most appropriate emission reductions on a \nfacility-by-facility basis. Instead, the EPA has set statewide emission \nreduction mandates, without regard to the technical feasibility of \nactually accomplishing the goal.\n  Cap-and-trade proposals will emerge under this, which will ultimately \npit industries against one another. So the real impact of this rule \ncould far exceed its advertised intent of targeting only powerplants.\n  Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt has effectively made this case \nand will lead the charge challenging the legal authority of this rule, \nshould it become final. I am very proud of the attorney general, \nbecause he has been very effective in leading other attorneys general \naround the country to join in this effort.\n  The third reason this rule is inappropriate is because the Clean Air \nAct states that section 111(b) regulations cannot be pursued in the \nevent the facilities are already regulated under section 112, which \ngoverns air toxins. Powerplants are already regulated under this \nsection. So the fact they are trying to regulate them under 111(b) is \ninconsistent with the law, and that of course will be on our side on \nthis.\n  There are a number of major reasons why this rule may not stand up in \nthe courts. But it is my expectation that it will not come to that \npoint. The largest tax increase in history. The Earth's surface has not \ngotten warmer in 14 years. Polling shows Americans don't believe it is \na huge problem. It is huge for job losses. Stopping CO2 in \nthe United States won't affect world CO2 emissions. That is \nwhat we have from the Administrator of the EPA. So we will be hearing a \nlot of things tonight, all about what is going on, and they will be \ndiscreet with me. That is the reason I always document things.\n\n  Let me predict what I think is going to happen. A lot of people are \nnot aware that there is something called the CRA, the Congressional \nReview Act. The Congressional Review Act is something where people say: \nYes, there is a crisis in this country. Don't blame me. I am a Member \nof Congress. I didn't vote for it, but the regulators did this. This \nputs them where they should be in having to take a position.\n  The CRA is something introduced with 30 cosponsors. I already have 30 \ncosponsors to file a CRA on every one of these regulations, if they do \nbecome final. You cannot do it until they become final. Then it is a \nsimple majority. So people are going to have to get on record, and to \nme that is really all we really need to get people on record on this.\n  I think you are probably going to hear some issues and people will \nassume that these are really happening. You will hear that extreme \nweather is increasing. The reinsurance company and global-related \ndisaster losses have declined by 25 percent as a proportion of GDP. \nThey will say that hurricanes are happening. Yet the Washington Post \nsays the United States has not been witness to a category 3 or higher \nmajor hurricane landfall since October of 2005 when Wilma hit Southwest \nFlorida as a Category 3 storm.\n  They will be talking about drought, in spite of the fact that even \nthe IPCC has stated that in the United States droughts have become less \nfrequent, less continuous, or shorter in central North America. Nature, \nthe well-respected publication, says drought for the most part has \nbecome shorter, less frequent, and covered a smaller portion of the \nUnited States over the last century.\n  Flooding--the IPCC comes in again talking about this. The USGS says \nfloods have not increased in the United States in frequency or \nintensity since at least 1950. NOAA says flood losses as a percentage \nof GDP have dropped by 75 percent since 1940. You are going to hear \nabout flooding. That is why it is necessary to document these things.\n\n[[Page S3500]]\n\n  NOAA, talking about tornadoes, says: Tornadoes have not increased in \nfrequency, intensity or normalized damage since 1950. Some data shows \nthat there has been a decline. So we have all these issues that I am \nsure we will be discussing sooner or later.\n  Polar bears--the chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee gave me a polar bear coffee cup, which I use frequently, and \nwe display that very prominently. But they say in the 1950s and 1960s \nthere were between 5,000 and 10,000 polar bears. Today there are \nbetween 15,000 and 25,000.\n  So we have all these issues that are a reality on the glaciers. You \ncan record the hurricanes and all these other items, and, yes, they are \ngoing to be talking about them, I am sure, during the course of the \nevening.\n  Let me just mention one other item from memory on this, but I know it \nis right because the I have said it so many times and it has recently \nbeen documented. We go through these 30-year cycles all the time. We \nhave been going through them for a long time. If you take in 1895, all \nof a sudden everything started getting cooler, and that is when the \nterm ice age first came along. They said another ice age is coming. \nThat lasted until 1918. In 1918, all of a sudden it started getting \nwarmer, and that was the first time you heard about global warming. \nThat was 1918 to 1945. In 1945 it turned again--you see, every 30 \nyears--and all of a sudden it got cold. They talked about another ice \nage coming. I remember Time magazine had a cover talking about the ice \nage. Then in 1970 another warm period came along. That is the one that \npeople have been talking about.\n  Here is the thing. In 1945 we had the largest amount of increase in \nCO2 emissions of any time in the recorded history of this \ncountry, and that precipitated not a warming period but a cooling \nperiod. Now as they have said, we haven't been warming for the last 15 \nyears. So this is always a difficult issue to deal with. I know the \neffort is there. I know it is renewed now and people are excited about \nit, and I could assure you the trend is in the wrong direction, and it \nis not going to happen.\n  With that, Mr. President, my time has expired, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Under the unanimous consent request, the floor \nreverts to me, but the distinguished Member from California, my \nchairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, has joined us, \nand I will yield for the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Presiding Officer, and I also want to thank \nmy friend Senator Whitehouse, such a great leader on this issue.\n  I am really glad that Senator Inhofe, my good friend, came down to \nthe floor. He deserves a thank you because he has laid out why he \ndenies the obvious, and that is that this planet is warming and it is \ndue to human activity. Frankly, it is his right to turn his back on 97 \npercent of the scientists just like the deniers did when we learned \nthat it was, in fact, smoking that was causing an epidemic of lung \ncancer. I respect Senator Inhofe. I am glad he came. But I have to say, \nI am sad that we haven't seen any Republicans come here except for \nSenator Inhofe who has written a whole book on this--and we know his \nviews--but we don't see anybody else.\n  Let me tell you what we know from our other colleagues. Let's just \ntake the Speaker--the Republican Speaker of the House, who said when \nasked about climate change--he kind of has a different view than \nSenator Inhofe, as does Senator Rubio. This is what they said when \nasked what they think about climate change. Their answer is: Well, I am \nnot a scientist. What do I know?\n  Well, right. They are not. Why don't you listen, then, to 97 percent \nof the scientists, if you admit that you are not a scientist?\n  What are Speaker Boehner or Senator Rubio or the others who are these \ndeniers saying? They are now saying they are not a scientist. Let's say \nthey went to the doctor and the doctor said: Look, you have a serious \nliver condition, and I have a new drug that has been created to cure \nyour disease. I don't think we should wait, and let's go.\n  And you didn't say: Well, I want a second opinion; I want to go to \nanother doctor. You said: You know what. I am not a doctor. I don't \nthink so.\n  Does that make sense?\n  What if you went to a dentist and the dentist said: Senator, you have \nan abscess. It is pretty straightforward. I can fix it. If you let it \ngo, you are going to get an infection. I don't know what can happen.\n  Now, if I said to the dentist that I am going to check with a couple \nother people, then that is fine. But no, if I said: Oh, I am not a \ndentist, but I don't think so. As my friend told me before, you take \nyour car in for repair, and they say: You know, there is something \nwrong with the brakes here, and we have to tighten those brakes. Can \nyou leave the car here?\n  Well, I am not a repairman.\n  Ninety-seven percent of the scientists--they are all peer reviewed \nand are telling us what is happening to our planet.\n  Here is the thing about these deniers. If they want to jump off the \nclimate change cliff and just go by themselves, that is their choice, \nbut they are going to take everybody with them; OK? My grandkids, your \ngrandkids, and their kids--and we are not going to let it happen. \nSenator Whitehouse isn't going to let it happen. I am not going to let \nit happen. The President isn't going to let it happen.\n  Climate change is all around us. We must take action to reduce \nharmful carbon pollution, which 97 percent of scientists agree is \nleading to dangerous climate change that threatens our families. We \ncannot be bullied by those who have their heads in the sand, and whose \nobstruction is leading us off the climate change cliff.\n  One week ago the President released his new proposal to control \ndangerous carbon pollution from existing power plants, and it is a win-\nwin-win for the American people. Power plants are the largest source of \nthe Nation's harmful carbon pollution accounting for nearly 40 percent \nof all carbon released into the air. Unlike other pollutants, right now \nthere are no limits to the amount of carbon pollution that can be \nreleased into the air for power plants. The President's carbon \npollution reduction plan will protect public health and save thousands \nof lives. It will avoid up to 6,600 premature deaths, 150,000 asthma \nattacks, 3,300 heart attacks, 2,800 hospital admissions, and 490,000 \nmissed days at school and work.\n  The President's plan to reduce harmful carbon pollution will also \ncreate thousands of jobs. By reducing carbon pollution we can avert the \nmost calamitous impacts of climate change--such as rising sea levels, \ndangerous heat waves, and economic disruption.\n  As the recent Congressionally-required National Climate Assessment \nreport tells us, we could see a 10 degree Fahrenheit rise in \ntemperature if we do not act to limit dangerous carbon pollution now.\n  The President's proposal is respectful of the States' roles and \nallows major flexibility, while ensuring that big polluters reduce \ntheir significant contributions to climate change. The plan will allow \nthe States to work with the EPA to analyze costs, and ensure carbon \npollution standards continue to promote innovation and continue \nAmerica's leadership in pollution control technology.\n  By cutting carbon emissions from power plants by 30 percent \nnationwide from 2005 levels, the President's plan will also help \nAmerican families and businesses. The President's plan is projected to \nshrink electricity bills roughly 8 percent by increasing energy \nefficiency and reducing demand in the electricity system.\n  The American public wants action. According to a Washington Post-ABC \npoll released today, a bipartisan majority of the American people want \nFederal limits on carbon pollution. Approximately 70 percent say the \nFederal Government should require limits to carbon pollution from \nexisting power plans, and 70 percent--57 percent of Republicans, 76 \npercent of Independents, and 79 percent of Democrats--support requiring \nStates to limit the amount of carbon pollution within their borders.\n  The President's proposed carbon pollution standards for existing \npower plants is supported by the Clean Air Act. Congress gave the \nPresident the ability to control air pollution in the Clean Air Act. In \n1990, revisions to the\n\n[[Page S3501]]\n\nAct overwhelming passed by a vote of 89-11 in the Senate and 401-21 in \nthe House. In 2007, the Supreme Court confirmed in Massachusetts v. EPA \nthat as passed by Congress, the Clean Air Act in no uncertain terms \ngave the Environmental Protection Agency authority to control carbon \npollution. Four years later, the Supreme Court in American Electric \nPower v. Connecticut, specifically found that the Clean Air Act has \nprovisions in place to limit carbon pollution from power plants--the \nvery provisions the President is using in his proposed power plant \ncarbon standards.\n  We have long known that air pollution contributes to climate change. \nDuring the debate on the 1970 Clean Air Act Amendments, Senator Boggs \nintroduced into the record a White House Report stating that: ``Air \npollution alters climate and may produce global changes in temperature. \n. . . [T]he addition of particulates and carbon dioxide in the \natmosphere could have dramatic and long-term effects on world \nclimate.'' And the Clean Air Act has a proven track record.\n  The U.S. has shown we can continue to protect the environment and \ngrow the economy. Over the last 40 years since the passage of the Clean \nAir Act, air pollution has dropped 68 percent and America's GDP has \ngrown 212 percent. Total private sector jobs increased by 88 percent. \nBetween 1980 and 2012, gross domestic product increased 133 percent, \nvehicle miles traveled increased 92 percent, energy consumption \nincreased 27 percent, and U.S. population grew by 38 percent. During \nthe same time period, total emissions of the six principal air \npollutants dropped by 67 percent.\n  It is in America's DNA to turn a problem into an opportunity, and \nthat is what we have done by being a pioneer in the green technology \nindustry. These new carbon pollution standards are no different. \nLandmark environmental laws have bolstered an environmental technology \nand services sector that employs an estimated 3.4 million people, \naccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And many of these jobs, \nlike installing solar roofs and wind turbines cannot be outsourced.\n  We must take action to protect families and communities from the \nmounting impacts of climate change. Just look at China, which has \nhazardous levels of air pollution and toxic emissions. According to a \nscientific study from the Health Effect Institute on leading causes of \ndeath worldwide, outdoor air pollution contributed to 1.2 million \npremature deaths in China in 2010, which is nearly 40 percent of the \nglobal total. Officials in China have recently suggested that they plan \nto take steps to address their carbon pollution, but the U.S. cannot \nwait for China to act. The President's new power plant standards are a \nmajor step forward. They show that America will finally lead on a path \nto averting the most dangerous impacts of climate change.\n  On Friday the White House released a report on the harmful health \nimpacts of climate change, especially on our most vulnerable \npopulations like children, the elderly and low-income Americans. The \nreport cited impacts like increased ground level ozone which could \nworsen respiratory illnesses like asthma, increased air pollutants from \nwildfires, and more heat-related and flood-related deaths. The first \nline in this new report sums up why we must take action to reduce \ncarbon pollution:\n\n       We have a moral obligation to leave our children a planet \n     that's not irrevocably polluted or damaged.\n\n  The American people want us to protect their children and families \nfrom dangerous climate change. We must safeguard our children, our \ngrandchildren, and generations to come.\n  The people of my home State of California and the American people \ndeserve these new protections, and the President should be lauded for \nmoving forward and tackling one of our Nation's greatest challenges.\n  I am going to spend the rest of my time summing it up by refuting \nsome of the things Senator Inhofe said.\n  I have to say the President deserves a lot of credit for his plan. \nWhat is really interesting is it is supported by 70 percent of the \nAmerican people, who ``think the Federal Government should limit the \nrelease of greenhouse gasses from existing power plants in an effort to \nreduce global warming.''\n  That includes amazingly 57 percent of Republicans, 79 percent of \nDemocrats, and 76 percent of Independents who support the President's \nplan. They are not stupid. They are smart.\n  Look what happens when you throw the environment under the bus. \nPeople walk around in air that you can see. You don't want to see the \nair. You don't want to wear a mask when you go outside. The American \npeople get it.\n  Then my colleague says: They are going to scare you. They are going \nto scare you. There is no problem with carbon in the air. There is no \nproblem at all.\n  Well, let me tell you who disagrees with Senator Inhofe, who \ndisagrees with the Republicans: the American Medical Association, the \nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics, the American Thoracic Society, the \nAmerican Public Health Association, the American Lung Association, the \nNational Nurses Union. They all have statements that say climate change \nis a threat to public health.\n  Who are the people going to listen to? Us politicians or people who \nspend every day of their life waking up in the morning and thinking of \nways to protect our health? Yes, if the deniers want to jump off the \ncliff and they only hurt themselves, I suppose that is their option. \nBut they are taking my kids, and they are taking all the kids of our \nAmerican families, and we are not going to let that happen.\n  I will close with this. The Senator from Oklahoma started to say: \nThis is going to kill you. It is going to raise your prices of \nelectricity. Jobs are going to be lost. He cited a U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce study that has been so rebuffed that the Washington Post gave \nit their most Pinocchios--in other words, four Pinocchios for the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce because they were responding to something that \nnever came about.\n  This plan of the President's makes a whole lot of sense. He has \ncourage to do it. We are going to stand behind it. And, yes, the \nRepublicans are going to try to repeal it. Let me give them the bad \nnews from their perspective. They have sent over dozens and dozens of \nenvironmental riders. I want to say over 90--over 90--and we have \nbeaten back every single one of them. For colleagues to stand there and \nsay Senator Sheldon Whitehouse and I are doing this because it is an \nelection year is a joke. We have been doing this for years.\n  I daresay Senator Sheldon Whitehouse has made more speeches on the \nfloor than anyone on this subject. When I had the gavel for the first \ntime in 2007, I had to fight to keep it in my hand because, guess what. \nWe had Al Gore before the committee. Remember? Senator Inhofe was so \nstressed he tried to grab the gavel. We have kind of a funny picture in \nour office in which I said: ``Elections have consequences.'' And they \ndo. But to say that we are doing this because there is some donor is \nthe most absurd thing I have ever heard.\n  I will put in the record a statement by Lyndon Johnson. This shows \nhow far back Democrats have warned about this. This is amazing. My \nstaff discovered this. He said this in 1965.\n  In his ``Special Message to the Congress on Conservation and \nRestoration of Natural Beauty'' President Lyndon B. Johnson stated \nthat, ``The Clean Air Act should be improved to permit [EPA] to \ninvestigate potential air pollution problems before pollution happens, \nrather than having to wait until the damage occurs, as is now the case, \nand to make recommendations leading to the prevention of such \npollution.''\n  ``Air pollution is no longer confined to isolated places. This \ngeneration has altered the composition of the atmosphere on a global \nscale through radioactive materials and a steady increase in carbon \ndioxide from the burning of fossil fuels.''\n  So don't come on this floor and say suddenly the Democrats care about \nthis because it is an election year. It is ridiculous. We have known \nabout this for years. We have been trying to get the attention of our \ncolleagues.\n  I thank Senator Whitehouse. He and I signed a letter with several \nothers inviting our colleagues to the floor. All we got was Senator \nInhofe--not that we don't love him, and we appreciate he came over \nhere, but we have to now assume he speaks for everybody on that side, \nwhich is scary, because they have turned their backs on the doctors.\n\n[[Page S3502]]\n\nThey have turned their backs on the scientists, and they have turned \ntheir backs on the American people.\n  Thank you, Senator Whitehouse, and I would yield back to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, the hope for this evening was that by \nextending a formal invitation to our colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle, somebody would come to the floor who was not just outright \ndenying that climate change is happening.\n  For a while Senator Inhofe's was focused on the economics of various \ntypes of regulation during his remarks. At that point I thought maybe \nwe could have a conversation about the best way to solve the climate \nchange problem, but toward the end of his remarks, he got back to \ndenying that it is happening at all, which makes a tough place to begin \nnegotiations.\n  There are plenty of other Republican Senators in this body, many of \nwhom have worked on this issue in the past. I don't know whether it is \na coincidence, but the level of activity by Republican Senators on \nclimate change collapsed shortly after the U.S. Supreme Court's \ndecision in Citizens United. As many of my Republican friends have \npointed out to me on the floor, there have been times when the big, \ndark, anonymous election money that has been thrown around since that \ndecision has been made has been spent against Republicans more than \nagainst Democrats.\n  We hope that as we resolve that issue, some of our friends find a way \nback to the positions they have held in the past, back to campaigning \nnationally on climate issues, supporting bipartisan climate \nlegislation, supporting a carbon fee, and voting for a cap-and-trade \nbill. That is where they had been before Citizens United, and we had \nhoped to bring them back. But the champion sent by the Republican side \nto represent their point of view tonight was Senator Inhofe, who has \nwritten a book that said this is all just a big hoax. In that sense it \nwas disappointing.\n  I have heard these arguments before, and as we go down the list, I \nthink it is worth taking a moment to knock them aside. One of my \npersonal favorites is that the EPA is doing this after the issue was \nrepeatedly blocked in Congress. Well, yes, it has been blocked in \nCongress by coal and oil and polluter interests. So the interests that \nhave blocked a highway don't get to complain when traffic has to take a \ndetour.\n  We would be delighted to work on serious climate legislation in this \nbody. We would be delighted to have it here. For a lot of reasons, we \nwould get a better result if we addressed climate change legislation \nhere rather than through the EPA rule. This is where the conversation \nshould take place, but when oil and coal and polluting industries take \nthe position that this is not real and force the Republican Party into \nthat position--that climate change is not real--then we are obviously \nnot going to have a very meaningful discussion about solving a problem, \nand that is what forces it go to the EPA. It is a little rich for those \nwho have shut down this forum for solving this problem to complain when \nit gets solved in another and less efficient way. They don't very well \nget to do that.\n  The high cost of the solution is--I think Senator Inhofe said--$300 \nto $400 billion and that it is not disputed. Well, yes, it is totally \ndisputed. It is absolutely disputed. In fact, it is not even true.\n  The best way to solve this problem is with a revenue-neutral carbon \nfee. What does revenue neutral mean? Revenue neutral means that for \nevery dollar that comes in from the carbon pollution fee that the \npolluters have to pay, it goes right back out to the American people \nand straight back into the economy; 100 cents on the dollar goes back \nto the American people. That is what I would like to see. It can be \ndone through tax deductions.\n  A conservative organization, the American Enterprise Institute, has \ncoauthored a report with the Brookings Institution on what they call a \ncarbon tax. I call it a carbon pollution fee, because when we are \ngiving all the money straight back to the American people, it is not \ntruly a tax. It is not general revenue to the government. The money \ngoes straight back out. When we do that, I think there is a case to be \nmade that that actually propels the economy.\n  Investing in innovation, supporting and creating different types of \nenergy that we can build in America is inevitably going to be better \nfor our economy than having to use fossil fuels, clean up after the \npollution, and deal with the foreign countries that traffic in fossil \nfuels. It would all lead to a better circumstance for our country.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma also said this is the product of what he \ncalled the radical environmental movement. One group that speaks very \nstrongly on climate change is NASA. Right now NASA is driving around a \nRover on the surface of Mars. They built a Rover that is about the size \nof an SUV, launched it into space, landed it successfully on the planet \nMars, and they are now driving it around. Do you think these people \nknow what they are talking about? Do you think NASA is a radical \nenvironmentalist movement? Really? That is a conspiracy theory that has \nrun amok if you think NASA is part of a radical environmentalist \nmovement.\n  How about our military? ``National Security and the Accelerating \nRisks of Climate Change'' by the CNA Military Advisory Board. The CNA \nCorporation is a corporation largely comprised of retired military who \nare kept on in that role to advise the military on emerging issues. It \nis sort of a think tank for the U.S. military that has been there \nthrough Republican and Democratic administrations alike. This report, \n``National Security and the Accelerating Risks of Climate Change,'' was \ndone by this military advisory board with some very interesting people.\n  How about BG Gerald E. Galloway, Jr., the former dean at the U.S. \nMilitary Academy. Do you think the dean from West Point is part of a \nradical environmental movement?\n  How about Lee Gunn, a former inspector general of the Department of \nthe Navy. He doesn't seem like a very radical environmentalist to me.\n  ADM Skip Bowman, former Director of the Naval Nuclear Propulsion \nProgram; Gen. James Conway, former Commandant of the Marine Corps--now \nthere are some radical leftwing environmentalists for you, the U.S. \nMarines.\n  This is so far beyond that. Organizations such as Walmart, Coke and \nPepsi, Ford and GM, UPS and FedEx, Target, Nike, VF Corporation, one of \nthe biggest apparel manufacturers in the country located in North \nCarolina--all are totally on board with this.\n  The military is totally on board with this. NASA is totally on board \nwith this, as is the National Science Foundation and every major \nscientific organization in the country--every single one. So let's not \npretend this is a fringe group of radical environmentalists trying to \nfoist an idea on the country. This is a fringe residue of oil and coal \nand polluting interests trying to prevent the end of a long holiday \nthey have had from any responsibility for all the harm their carbon \npollution has caused.\n  Let me tell you firsthand there is harm happening in my home State of \nRhode Island, and it is not deniable. The deniers will never talk about \nthe oceans. They will never talk about the oceans. They will talk about \ndistant climate theory all day long, but when we go to the sea, the sea \ndoes not bear false witness.\n  The sea level is rising, and we measure that with essentially a \nyardstick nailed to the end of a pier. A tide gauge is not a complex \ninstrument, and off the Naval War College in Newport, RI, the seas are \nup 10 inches since the 1930s. Why is that? We have known since \nPresident Lincoln was President that when we add carbon dioxide into \nthe atmosphere, it warms the planet. That is not a hypothesis. That \nscience has been established since Abraham Lincoln in his stovepipe hat \ndrove around Washington in a carriage.\n  We know billions of tons of carbon dioxide have gone up there. We \nknow further that virtually all the heat has gone into the oceans. \nUnless somebody wants to deny the law of thermal expansion--and I have \nnot heard anybody willing to deny that yet--when we warm up the ocean, \nguess what. It expands and rises. We in Rhode Island have seen seas 10 \ninches higher thrown at our shores by a big storm or hurricane. It \nmakes a big difference.\n\n[[Page S3503]]\n\n  I challenge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to give me \njust 5 minutes of their time and go to Google and look up the images of \nthe hurricane of 1938. Look at the pictures of what happened in my \nState when the sea level was 10 inches lower.\n  Senator Inhofe mentioned the U.S. Chamber of Commerce study. I am a \nlittle surprised he did that because he is not the first Republican to \nmention the U.S. Chamber of Commerce study. Speaker Boehner mentioned \nthe U.S. Chamber of Commerce study too. He earned a false from \nPolitiFact for referencing that study. The Washington Post gave it four \nPinocchios. You know Pinocchio, his nose would grow longer when he \nwould not tell the truth. So that was a strange place to go.\n  He said there has been no temperature increase. He said: ``It didn't \nhappen.'' It did happen. It absolutely did happen. It happened in the \noceans where more than 90 percent of the heat goes. It happened in the \noceans, and it can be measured with thermometers. It is not \ncomplicated.\n  If you go to Narragansett Bay in Rhode Island, you will see that the \nmean winter water temperature is 3 to 4 degrees warmer, and it has a \nreal effect on Rhode Islanders. Men used to go out on boats with trawls \nand catch winter flounder in Narragansett Bay, and it was a cash crop. \nIt was a fishery that fed their families. It has crashed 90 percent, \nand a significant part of that is because the bay is no longer \nhospitable to winter flounder when it is 3 to 4 degrees warmer. It \nsimply doesn't work.\n  The public is with us, and we will get this done. Tonight we have \nseen what we are up against. Not one Republican in this building would \ncome tonight at our invitation and say one word about climate change \nbeing real--not one Republican, not one word. So that is what we are up \nagainst. But they have lost the American public, and so the fall of the \ndenial castle is inevitable. It is built on sand, and the sand is \neroding. It is eroding.\n  Even among young Republican voters--self-identified Republican voters \nunder the age of 35--the hypothesis offered by the deniers that climate \nchange is not real is viewed as--and these are the words from the poll, \nnot my words--``ignorant, out of touch, or crazy.''\n  I submit that a party whose own voters under the age of 35 view that \nparty's position of denying climate change as ``ignorant, out of touch, \nor crazy'' is a party that needs a new position on climate change. They \nare not even selling their own young voters, and they are certainly not \nselling the general public, which wants the President to do something \nabout this in enormous numbers--70 and 80 percent, depending on whether \none is looking at Democrats, Independents or the full population.\n  I will close with two specifics because we often have these debates \nsort of at the IPCC versus the Sierra Club level.\n  I have been going around to different States, and I have been looking \nat what is going on State by State. I have been to seven States \nalready. I wish to mention two tonight. I just got back from New \nHampshire, the most recent trip. What is going on in New Hampshire? New \nHampshire, as many people know, has a big ski industry. It is a winter \nholiday destination, a winter vacation and tourism destination, and \nskiing is a big part of that. I met with the guy who runs the Cranmore \nski mountain. They have, I want to say, tripled, or thereabouts, the \nnumber of snowmaking guns they have on their slopes. They have gotten \nbetter at it. They have made it more efficient so they make more snow. \nSo as there is less snowpack in the mountains, they are able to get \naround it by making more snow. But the reality of this is proven by the \nfact that they have to go out there and make more snow. As a New \nHampshire official said, that is fine for the slopes. They can get out \nthere, and they can roar those guns all night long and make snow on \nthose mountain slopes. But if a person is a Nordic skier, they have to \ngo out on trails, and there is no economic way to blow snow onto \ntrails. If a person is a snowmobile enthusiast, they go out on snow \ntrails, and there is no economic way to blow snow onto snowmobile \ntrails. They are seeing a dramatic falling off in Nordic and snowmobile \ntourism as a result and of the availability of that important market \nfor them.\n  They talked about two animals. I will start with the moose. It is a \npretty iconic species for New Hampshire, I was told. There are moose \ntours. Who knew? People go up to New Hampshire to look at moose. Moose \ntouring is a multimillion-dollar industry. I learned something new on \nthat trip. That industry is suffering from a couple of things. First of \nall, sometimes they do the moose tours on snowmobiles--no snow, no \nsnowmobile moose tours. But worse--indeed, eerily, horrifyingly, \ncreepily--the moose are dying off because they are being overwhelmed by \nticks. Now, picking a tick off my dog is enough to give me the heebie-\njeebies, and if I find one myself, it is a little creepy. We are not \ntalking about one tick on these moose. We are not talking about 100 \nticks. We are not even talking about 1,000 ticks on these moose. We are \ntalking about 50,000 to 100,000 ticks per moose--so much that they \ncan't keep themselves healthy. The blood is being sucked out of them by \ntens of thousands of ticks.\n  So the expert in that area who spoke to me said the reaction from the \nmothers is to just have one calf instead of two. That keeps the \npopulation from growing, and the calves basically starve. They die of \nanemia. They can't feed themselves.\n  They can't keep a blood system running that feeds themselves and the \nthousands of ticks. These things grow to be the size of a blueberry or \na grape. It is really appalling. This is an emblematic mammal of New \nHampshire, and this is what is befalling it.\n  What do the New Hampshire folks say is causing it? The retreat of the \nsnow. The ticks, when they are falling and breeding and laying their \neggs--whatever the heck they do to reproduce; I am no tick expert. But \nthey do it on Earth now, whereas when they fell on snow, boom, that was \nit. So the explosion in the tick population and the disgusting \ninfestation on those poor animals is directly related to the retreat of \nthe snow.\n  The last point on New Hampshire, the State bird is evidently the \npurple finch. The purple finch has a very particular kind of habitat. \nBecause of the way the climate is changing, that habitat is shrinking, \nand one of the bird experts I spoke to said they are looking at the \nprospect of the purple finch being a species that New Hampshire folks \nhave to go to Canada to find. It is their State bird, but they have to \ngo to Canada to find it.\n  The other State I will close with is Florida. Florida is ground zero \nfor climate change. In Florida, great cities are flooding at high tide. \nThe systems that used to drain water out of the cities in a rain storm \nare now flooding salt water into the cities because of sea level rise \nat high tides. I have met with former mayors and county commissioners \nwho have shown me pictures of people riding their bicycle hub deep \nthrough water, on a bright sunny day. It is not raining; it is salt \nwater. It has come up. One picture was of a yard where the homeowner \nhad hammered a sign into the yard, ``No wake zone,'' so that cars \ndriving by on the flooded road wouldn't create a wake and wash more \nsalt water into their yard. Some weren't so lucky, and the water was \nright through the front door and into the house.\n  The Republican mayor of Monroe County has made climate change a \npriority. She has instructed her county government to do a climate \nchange report, looking particularly at sea level rise--the Republican \nmayor of Monroe County. Yet, what do we hear from the Republican side \nhere? Not a peep. Not a peep.\n  She said something else that is interesting. I will close with this. \nI asked her how the coral reefs were doing. A lot of people go to \nFlorida to snorkel and to scuba dive and to see the wonders of the \nworld under the sea. I said: Mayor, how are your reefs doing? I have \nheard a lot about what acidification and warming temperatures are doing \nto reefs. She said: They are still beautiful. Then she paused and said: \nUnless you were here 10 or 20 years ago. Ten or 20 years, and we see \nthat change.\n  What is happening to the reefs is really catastrophic.\n  My friends on the other side never want to talk about this. They want \nto talk about climate modeling. We don't need a model to go to the end \nof the dock at Fort Pulaski and see how much\n\n[[Page S3504]]\n\nthe sea level has risen. We measure it. It is simple. It is the same \nthing at the Naval War College. We measure it. It is simple. We don't \nneed complex computer models to go to Narragansett Bay and see it is \nnearly four degrees warmer mean water temperature and all the changes \nthat happen as a result. We use a thermometer. It is not complicated. \nAnd the acidification of the oceans that is affecting the coral reefs \nand so many other creatures--it wiped out the northwest oyster spat. \nPeople grow oysters in the Pacific Northwest, and the sea water that \ncame in was so acidic, it dissolved the shells of the baby oysters and \nwiped out a huge percentage of their crop. That we measure with the \nsame kind of litmus tests kids do with their aquariums. It is not \ncomplicated. But they always want to talk about where it can be \nconfusing. They never want to confront the problem.\n  We are going to find ways to continue to insist on confronting this \nproblem. They may not be here tonight, but as the old saying goes, you \ncan run, but you can't hide. There are too many of my colleagues who \nhave been helpful and good on this issue before--as I said, before \nCitizens United. If we look at the Republican Senate activity on \nclimate change before Citizens United and after, it is like looking at \na heart attack. We see steady activity until Citizens United, and then \nit is a flat line. Citizens United, dark money, polluter money has done \nas much damage polluting our democracy as they have done polluting our \nplanet. But we are going to continue to do something about it, and the \nAmerican public not only is with us, they are going to insist on it.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Gaspee Days\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I am so glad to have you here \nbecause a recurring tradition on the Senate floor is about to take \nplace, and it is always particularly good for a Senator from Rhode \nIsland to have a Senator from Massachusetts presiding while I talk \nabout this.\n  Today I am here to recognize and celebrate one of the earliest acts \nof defiance against the British Crown in our great American struggle \nfor independence. Most Americans remember the Boston Tea Party as one \nof the major events building up to the American Revolution. We learned \nthe story of spirited Bostonians--and when I say ``spirited,'' I mean \nthat in several senses; I gather that spirits had been served to those \nBostonians before they embarked on this adventure--clambering onto the \ndecks of the East India Company's ships and dumping bales of tea into \nBoston Harbor as a protest of British ``taxation without \nrepresentation,'' which was a fine and worthy stunt, and I am certainly \nnot here to defend taxation without representation.\n  However, there is a milestone on the path to revolution that is \nfrequently overlooked, and it is the story of 60 brave Rhode Islanders \nwho challenged British rule more than a year before that Tea Party in \nBoston, and they did a little bit more than throw tea bags overboard. \nSo every year I honor those little known Rhode Island heroes who risked \ntheir lives in defiance of oppression 1 dark night more than 240 years \nago.\n  In the years before the Revolutionary War, as tensions with the \nAmerican Colonies grew, King George III stationed revenue cutters, \narmed customs patrol vessels, along the American coast. They were there \nto prevent smuggling, to enforce the payment of taxes, and to impose \nthe authority of the Crown.\n  One of the most notorious of these ships was the HMS Gaspee. Its \ncaptain, Lieutenant William Duddingston, was known for destroying \nfishing vessels, seizing cargo, and flagging down ships only to harass, \nhumiliate, and interrogate the colonials.\n  Outraged by this egregious abuse of power, the merchants and \nshipmasters of Rhode Island flooded civil and military officials with \ncomplaints about the Gaspee, exhausting every diplomatic and legal \nmeans to stir the British Crown to regulate Duddingston's conduct.\n  Not only did British officials ignore the Rhode Islanders' concerns; \nthey responded with open hostility. The commander of the local British \nfleet, ADM John Montagu, warned that anyone who dared attempt acts of \nresistance or retaliation against the Gaspee would be taken into \ncustody and hanged as a pirate, which brings us to June 9, 1772, 242 \nyears ago.\n  Rhode Island ship captain Benjamin Lindsey was en route to Providence \nfrom Newport, in his ship the Hannah, when he was accosted and ordered \nto yield for inspection by the Gaspee. Captain Lindsey ignored the \nGaspee's command and raced away up Narragansett Bay--despite warning \nshots fired by the Gaspee. As the Gaspee gave chase, Captain Lindsey \nknew a little something about Narragansett Bay and he knew a little \nsomething about the Hannah. He knew that she was lighter and drew less \nwater than the Gaspee. So he sped north toward Pawtuxet Cove, toward \nthe shallow waters off Namquid Point. His Hannah shot over the shallows \nthere, but the heavier Gaspee grounded and stuck firm. The British ship \nand her crew were caught stranded in a falling tide, and it would be \nmany hours before a rising tide could free the hulking Gaspee.\n  Presented with that irresistible opportunity, Captain Lindsey \ncontinued on his course to Providence and there enlisted the help of \nJohn Brown, a respected merchant from one of the most prominent \nProvidence families. The two men rallied a group of Rhode Island \npatriots at Sabin's Tavern, in what is now the east side of Providence. \nSo perhaps something the Bostonians at the Tea Party and the Rhode \nIslanders at the Gaspee had in common was spirits. Together, the group \nresolved to put an end to the Gaspee's threat to Rhode Island waters.\n  That night, the men, led by Captain Lindsey and Abraham Whipple--\nlater to become a commander in the Revolutionary navy--embarked in \neight longboats quietly down Narragansett Bay. They encircled the \nGaspee, and they called on Lieutenant Duddingston to surrender his \nship. Duddingston refused and ordered his men to fire upon anyone who \ntried to board.\n  Undeterred, the Rhode Islanders forced their way onto the Gaspee's \ndeck--in a hail of oaths and sword clashes and musketfire--and \nLieutenant Duddingston fell with a musket ball in the midst of the \nstruggle. Right there in the waters of Warwick, RI, the very first \nblood in the conflict that was to become the American Revolution was \ndrawn.\n  As the patriots commandeered the ship, Brown ordered one of his Rhode \nIslanders, a physician named John Mawney, to head to the ship's \ncaptain's cabin and tend to Duddingston's wound--a humane gesture in \ntheir moment of victory to help a man who had threatened to open fire \non them only moments before.\n\n  Brown and Whipple took the captive English crew back to shore and \nthen returned to the Gaspee to rid Narragansett Bay of her despised \npresence once and for all. They set her afire. The blaze spread through \nthe ship, and ultimately to the ship's powder magazine, which went off \nwith an explosion like fireworks, the blast echoing through the night \nacross the bay, the flash lighting the sea up like daylight, and \nfragments of the ship splashing down into the water all around.\n  The site of this audacious act is now named Gaspee Point in honor of \nthese brave Rhode Islanders. So I come again here to share this story \nand to commemorate this night so many years ago--June 9, 1772--and the \nnames of Benjamin Lindsey, John Brown, and Abraham Whipple, and those \nmen not known to history who fought beside them that night.\n  The Gaspee Affair, as it was called, generated furor in the British \nGovernment, which appointed a royal commission of inquiry based in \nNewport to gather evidence for indictment. The indicted men were then \nto be sent to England for trial.\n  Well, not so fast. Rhode Island's colonial charter guaranteed its \ncitizens the right to a trial in the vicinity in which the crime was \nalleged to have occurred. And beyond that, these Rhode Islanders \npresumed they were entitled to the\n\n[[Page S3505]]\n\nsame rights as Englishmen in their mother country. Some went so far to \nsay that this proposal to try them overseas violated ancient rights \noutlined in the Magna Carta.\n  This breach of the rights that colonists believed were enshrined in \nthe British Constitution created continent-wide uproar. Young members \nof Virginia's House of Burgesses, such as Thomas Jefferson and Patrick \nHenry, yearning to protest, pushed the body to create a committee of \ncorrespondence to gather information from around the Colonies \nconcerning the British Parliament's actions, while also urging other \nColonies to do the same. By December 1773, 11 Colonies had set up \ncommittees of correspondence. These committees played a vital role in \nenflaming discontent. They were the first permanent modes of \ncommunication among the Thirteen Colonies and allowed abuses by \nParliament to be quickly known throughout the Colonies.\n  John Allen, a little-known visiting minister in the Second Baptist \nChurch in Boston, gave a sermon on the Gaspee Affair. It went the \nrevolutionary equivalent of viral--widely published. In this sermon, \nAllen rejected the proposition that Parliament had a right to tax and \nenforce laws like the ones implicated in the Gaspee Affair on Americans \nwithout the consent of their colonial representatives--a position that \nwould come to define colonial discontent and reverberates to this day \nthrough the slogan ``no taxation without representation.''\n  Allen concluded his sermon with the provoking and revolutionary \nquestion whether the British King had a right to rule over America in \nthe first place. Reverend Allen asserted there was no parliamentary \nright to reign as in Britain, nor a right by conquest, as the American \ncolonists had only signed compacts with the Crown for protection of \ntheir religious and civil rights. Allen espoused Enlightenment ideals \nof social compacts and political rights, stating that if the British \nGovernment enacted laws that were oppressive to the rights of American \ncolonists, as it had with the creation of a commission of inquiry \nintending to send the Gaspee raiders to England for trial, then it lost \nits right to rule over them.\n  The sermon was published eight separate times in three different \ncolonial cities and spread widely through the Colonies. Through that, \nthe Gaspee Affair sparked in the minds of Americans ideas about \nparliamentary abuses and the King's right to rule that would seed a \nspirit of discontent and eventually boil over into revolution. The \nsermon, along with fiery editorials published in the wake of the \naffair, inspired colonial leaders to speak openly about the British \nGovernment's abuses, instigating conflict that would culminate in the \nbattles of Lexington and Concord.\n  The Gaspee Affair galvanized colonial discontent and led to greater \nunity among the Thirteen Colonies. After Rhode Islanders defiantly set \nfire to the Gaspee, the American Colonies came together for a common \ncause for the first time in their history, a formative step in the \nbirth of our new Nation.\n  I know these events, and the patriots whose efforts allowed for their \nsuccess, are not forgotten in my home State. Over the years, I have \nenjoyed marching in the annual Gaspee Days Parade through Warwick, RI, \nas every year we recall the courage and zeal of these men who fired the \nfirst shots that drew the first blood in that great contest for the \nfreedoms we enjoy today.\n  They set a precedent for future patriots to follow, including those \nin Boston who more than 1 year later would have their tea party. But do \nnot forget, as my home State prepares once again to celebrate the \nanniversary of the Gaspee incident, Massachusetts colonists threw tea \nbags off the deck of their British ship. We blew ours up and shot its \ncaptain more than 1 year earlier. We are little in Rhode Island, but as \nLieutenant Duddingston discovered, we pack a punch.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/09/senate-section/article/S3505-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3505]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE.

I have \nto acknowledge, I watched a little bit but not a lot of each. But I \nwatched them all. I am disappointed that I caved in and watched the \nfinal of the Miss USA contest, because Miss Nevada won, and I would \nhave liked to have seen that. I placed a call to her, and I will talk \nto her as soon as she gets out of the clouds, where I am sure she is \nnow. But I congratulate the newly crowned Miss USA, Nevada's own Nia \nSanchez.\n  What a story she has. This woman was homeless and spent a good part \nof her young days in a shelter. She is an exceptional Nevadan. She is \ngifted beyond her physical beauty. She holds a fourth-degree black belt \nin tae kwon do and is a certified instructor in the martial arts. When \nshe is not practicing tae kwon do in her own studio, she is fighting on \nbehalf of abused women. She volunteers at Shade Tree, a shelter for \nabused women. We are proud of Shade Tree.\n  So I, along with all Nevadans, congratulate Miss USA Nia Sanchez on \nher well-deserved victory. I wish her the very best as she pursues the \ncrown of Miss Universe and undertakes her duties as a global \nambassador.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/09/senate-section/article/S3505-3", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3505]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n          BISHOP McGUINNESS CATHOLIC HIGH SCHOOL CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n Mr. BURR.

VINCENT HARDING\n\n Mr. UDALL of Colorado, Madam President, I wish to commemorate \nthe life of Dr. Vincent Harding, a prominent civil rights leader, \nbeloved professor and proud Coloradan, who passed away on May 19, 2014. \nAlthough Dr. Harding is no longer with us, his presence lives on \nthrough the lasting influence of his life's work. Thanks to Dr. Harding \nand the countless others who took part in the civil rights movement, we \nhave made great strides in the pursuit of equality for all through \nlandmark legislation and advocacy. His passing also reminds us of the \nongoing struggle for equal rights in America and moves us to continue \nthis fight in his honor.\n  A devout believer in the power of social activism, Dr. Harding moved \nfrom Harlem, NY to Georgia in the early 1960s to join the American \ncivil rights movement. He traveled the South to assist with anti-\nsegregation campaigns, and he and his wife, Rosemarie Freeney Harding, \nfounded the Mennonite House, an interracial service center and \ngathering place for individuals active in the movement. Through this \nwork, Dr. Harding met friend and co-activist, Rev. Dr. Martin Luther \nKing, Jr., for whom he became an aide and speechwriter. Following Dr. \nKing's death, Dr. Harding went on to serve as the first director of the \nMartin Luther King, Jr. Center.\n\n[[Page S3506]]\n\n  In addition to his life-long commitment to promoting and protecting \ncivil rights through writings and advocacy, Dr. Harding served as a \nbeloved professor to thousands of students at universities around the \ncountry, including spending over three decades with the Iliff School of \nTheology in Denver, CO. It was there that he founded the Veterans of \nHope Project to document the stories of other social justice leaders \naround the world and inspire future generations of committed activists.\n  In commemoration, we recognize the great work and sacrifices of Dr. \nHarding and the many Americans who stand up for what is right every \nday--even when doing so brings its share of risks and challenges. \nAppropriately, this coming July we will proudly celebrate the 50th \nanniversary of the signing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964--a victory \nfor all Americans and one that would not have been possible without the \nresolve of Dr. Harding, Dr. King and other advocates who devoted their \nlives to ending discrimination. While we continue our fight against \npersistent oppression in America, we can look to the legacy of Dr. \nHarding for inspiration and acknowledge the strength and struggles of \nall those involved in the civil rights movement.\n  On behalf of a grateful nation and State, I take this time to express \nmy deepest gratitude for Dr. Harding's contributions and my heartfelt \ncondolences to all those who were touched by his life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/09/senate-section/article/S3506-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3506]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/09/senate-section/article/S3506-2", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3506]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/09/senate-section/article/S3506-3", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3506]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME\n\n  The following bill was read the first time:\n\n       S. 2450.

A resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     Rockland County, New York, urging Congress to fund \n     mesothelioma research at the highest levels in the Fiscal \n     Year 2015 Appropriations Bill by including $5.26 billion for \n     the National Cancer Institute and $25 million for the Peer \n     Reviewed Research Program as part of the Congressionally \n     Mandated Research Program; to the Committee on \n     Appropriations.\n       POM-246. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of\n\n[[Page S3507]]\n\n     Michigan memorializing Congress of the United States to \n     oppose the U.S. Department of Defense's budget proposal that \n     would potentially close commissaries at U.S. military bases \n     and to ensure that replacement aircraft are assigned to \n     Selfridge Air National Guard Base to compensate for the \n     proposed elimination of the A-10 fleet; to the Committee on \n     Armed Services.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 319\n\n       Whereas, The proposed U.S. Department of Defense budget \n     would dramatically cut commissary services throughout the \n     nation and eliminate the nation's A-10 fleet, including \n     aircraft at Michigan's Selfridge Air National Guard Base. \n     Selfridge currently is home to 18 A-10 Thunderbolt II \n     aircraft and the more than 400 personnel related to that \n     mission; and\n       Whereas, Our brave men and women in uniform benefit greatly \n     from commissaries, and we should continue to provide them as \n     part of their service. Slashing the commissary budget would \n     likely lead to the closing of commissary stores at military \n     installations throughout the nation. Commissary stores \n     currently provide military families an affordable and \n     convenient location to shop for groceries and other \n     necessities. The U.S. Defense Commissary Agency found that \n     commissaries save shoppers an average of 30.5 percent \n     annually compared to off-base options; and\n       Whereas, The proposed cuts would have a dramatic effect on \n     the lives and morale of the dedicated men and women who \n     choose to serve our country at Selfridge Air National Guard \n     Base and other U.S. military bases. The elimination of the A-\n     10 fleet would place in jeopardy more than 400 jobs at \n     Selfridge alone. Closing commissaries would increase living \n     expenses for military families, essentially helping to \n     balance the defense budget at the expense of the men and \n     women who serve; and\n       Whereas, In Michigan, these proposed cuts would have \n     immeasurable impacts on Macomb County and the local \n     communities surrounding the Selfridge Air National Guard \n     Base. For nearly a century, the base has been a source of \n     community pride, local jobs, and local revenue as well as a \n     key component of disaster response for the entire state and a \n     vital base for our nation's homeland security; and\n       Whereas, The A-10 fleet should not be eliminated until \n     replacement aircraft can be assigned to Selfridge Air \n     National Guard Base. The proposed cuts would compound past, \n     short-sighted decisions to transfer the A-10 aircraft to \n     Selfridge despite the knowledge that these aircraft would be \n     phased out. These decisions have made Selfridge vulnerable to \n     closure in future Base Realignment and Closure Commission \n     recommendations. Assigning replacement aircraft would not \n     only maintain the viability of this important base for \n     homeland security, but would also be cost-effective: the Air \n     National Guard can operate aircraft at about half the cost of \n     an active duty unit: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to oppose the \n     U.S. Department of Defense's budget proposal that would \n     potentially close commissaries at U.S. military bases and to \n     ensure that replacement aircraft are assigned to Selfridge \n     Air National Guard Base to compensate for the proposed \n     elimination of the A-10 fleet; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-247. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana memorializing the United States \n     Congress to take such actions as are necessary to oppose the \n     elimination of the 307th Red Horse Squadron based at \n     Barksdale Air Force Base in Bossier City, Louisiana; to the \n     Committee on Armed Services.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 41\n\n       Whereas, established in the year 1932, the Barksdale Air \n     Force Base, a United States Air Force Base located \n     approximately 4.72 miles east-southeast of Bossier City, \n     Louisiana, is named in honor of World War I aviator and test \n     pilot 2nd Lieutenant Eugene Hoy Barksdale (1896-1926); and\n       Whereas, Barksdale Air Force Base has proudly served \n     Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas and is home to the Air Force's \n     newest command, Air Force Global Strike Command, the 2nd Bomb \n     Wing, 2nd Mission Support Group, 2nd Operations Group, 2nd \n     Maintenance Group, the 2nd Medical Group, 8th Air Force \n     Museum, and the Air Force Reserve's 917th Wing; and\n       Whereas, the Red Horse unit, officially known as the 307th \n     Rapid Engineer Deployable Heavy Operational Repair Squadron \n     Engineers, is a construction unit staffed with civil \n     engineers, many of whom deployed to southwest Asia during the \n     fall; and\n       Whereas, Barksdale Air Force Base has grown into a major \n     source of revenue and employment for the region by providing \n     jobs for nearly ten thousand military and civilian employees; \n     and\n       Whereas, under the Defense Department's 2015 proposed \n     spending plan, the 307th Red Horse Squadron would be \n     deactivated as the Air Force Reserve's authorized strength \n     would nationally decrease by almost five percent, to 61,700 \n     airmen; and\n       Whereas, under the 2015 defense spending plan, the Air \n     Force Reserve would lose the rest of the Air Force Reserve's \n     venerable fleet of A-10s, which are Cold War-era aircraft \n     known as Warthogs; and\n       Whereas, Barksdale Air Force Base continues to be a huge \n     priority for national security and for communities in the \n     state of Louisiana; and\n       Whereas, the deactivation of the 307th Red Horse Squadron \n     at Barksdale Air Force Base will have an adverse effect on \n     not only the economy, but the community as well: Now, \n     Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to take such actions \n     as are necessary to oppose the elimination of 307th Red Horse \n     Squadron based at Barksdale Air Force Base in Bossier City, \n     Louisiana; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-248. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Hawaii urging the United \n     States Congress to support the Veterans Health and Benefits \n     Improvement Act of 2013, particularly the section providing \n     those serving in the National Guard with veteran status; to \n     the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 23\n\n       Whereas, the National Guard's roots date back to 1636, when \n     colonial militias made up of ordinary citizens would put down \n     their plows and pick up weapons to protect families and towns \n     from hostile attacks; and\n       Whereas, commonly known as citizen-soldiers, members of \n     today's National Guard hold civilian jobs or attend college \n     while maintaining their military training part-time, always \n     ready to defend the American way of life in the event of an \n     emergency; and\n       Whereas, while the National Guard originally focused on \n     protecting local communities, it eventually grew into a force \n     that complements the active-duty military when help is needed \n     anywhere in the world, including serving overseas in combat-\n     deployment roles; and\n       Whereas, although the National Guard's primary area of \n     operation is the National Guard unit's home state, National \n     Guard members are often called on by the President of the \n     United States to respond to, among other things, homeland \n     security missions, domestic emergencies, counterdrug efforts, \n     and reconstruction missions in addition to overseas combat \n     missions; and\n       Whereas, while many National Guard members have similar \n     duties and perform similar functions to their counterparts in \n     the active-duty military, Title 38, United States Code, \n     excludes from the definition of veteran, career reserve-\n     component members who have not served on active duty under \n     Title 10, United States Code, for other than training \n     purposes; and\n       Whereas, a portion of the Veterans Health and Benefits \n     Improvement Act of 2013, or S. 944, would honor as veterans \n     any person who is entitled under chapter 1223 of Title 10, \n     United States Code, to retired pay for nonregular service or, \n     but for age, would be entitled under such chapter to retired \n     pay for nonregular service''; and\n       Whereas, this cost-neutral provision would not bestow any \n     benefits other than the honor of claiming veteran status for \n     nearly 300,000 men and women who honorably served and \n     sacrificed as career reserve-component members, giving these \n     individuals the respect they deserve for their uniformed \n     service to the United States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-\n     seventh Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session \n     of 2014, that Congress, including Hawaii's Congressional \n     delegation, is urged to support the Veterans Health and \n     Benefits Improvement Act of 2013, particularly the section \n     providing those, serving in the National Guard with veteran \n     status; and be it further\n       Resolved, That certified copies of this resolution be \n     transmitted to the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, President Pro Tempore of the United States \n     Senate, and Hawaii's Congressional delegation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/09/senate-section/article/S3507-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3507-S3508]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself and Mr. Enzi):\n       S. 2449.
