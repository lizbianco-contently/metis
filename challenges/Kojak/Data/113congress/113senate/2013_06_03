LAUTENBERG\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, when I learned early this morning that Frank \nLautenberg had died, of course, I immediately became very sad. I served \nwith him for 2\\1/2\\ decades or more in the Senate.\n  I see there are flowers on his desk. It seems the flowers have barely \nwilted on the desk--which is right behind me--of Senator Inouye. So I \nhave a heavy heart.\n  As we all know, the senior Senator from New Jersey and my friend \nFrank Lautenberg died this morning. My thoughts are with his lovely \nwife Bonnie, his children, and 13 grandchildren.\n  Few people in the history of this institution contributed as much to \nthis Nation and to the Senate as Frank Lautenberg. His success story is \nwhat the American dream is all about.\n  He came from a family of working-class immigrants from Eastern \nEurope--Russia and Poland. His parents struggled. I heard Frank talk \nabout how they struggled. They worked so hard. They moved around New \nJersey often.\n  When Frank was 18, during the middle of World War II he enlisted in \nthe U.S. Army. During World War II he served with distinction in the \nArmy Signal Corps. I can remember Frank talking about his experiences \nin the European theater. While he was in the Army Signal Corps, he said \nhe could\n\n[[Page S3888]]\n\nsee the war going on in his sight while he was up on a wooden power \npole.\n  He talked about the many experiences he had during World War II, as \nhe said, making him a better American. He was very proud of his \nmilitary service. He is the last World War II veteran having served in \nthe Senate. We don't have any World War II veterans anymore. His death \nis a great loss to this institution in many different ways.\n  When Frank came home from the war--he was obviously very smart--he \nwas permitted to attend the very prestigious Columbia University. He \ndid it, of course, on the GI bill--just as so many of the other \nreturning Americans did.\n  He quickly founded his own company. He started the company with two \nboyhood friends. All three kids were from New Jersey. Under his \nleadership, his firm, Automatic Data Processing, known as ADP, grew \ninto the largest computing company of its kind in the world.\n  He was so very proud of that company, and he never hesitated to tell \neveryone that he made money. He became rich. He was a poor boy who \nbecame wealthy as a result of being able to fulfill his dreams, as \npeople can do, in America.\n  Frank wasn't content with his personal success alone. He was proud of \nthe civic and charitable things he did, but nothing made him more proud \nof what he did outside government than when he served as the top lay \nleader of the United Jewish Appeal, known as the Jewish Federations of \nNorth America. He was very proud of that.\n  Frank Lautenberg was known for many things before he came to the \nSenate. He ran an impossible race for the Senate and was elected. He \ncame to the Congress in 1982, the same year I did. Over the course of \nthree decades he worked tirelessly on behalf of his State and the \ncountry.\n  He retired once. He could not stand retirement. He hated retirement. \nHe could not stay away from public service, and he returned to the \nSenate in 2002.\n  He had a remarkable career. I just touched upon a few of his \naccomplishments. He had determination that made him successful in the \nprivate sector and also served him well in the Senate. Motivated by his \nown experience, Senator Lautenberg, a World War II veteran, cowrote the \n21st century GI bill of rights. Recognizing how much this meant to him, \nhe wanted to ensure that the vets returning from Iraq and Afghanistan \nenjoyed the same opportunities for education that helped him become so \nsuccessful.\n  My youngest boy just hated cigarette smoke, and it really made him \nill. There was a time when people could smoke everyplace in the \nairplane and then finally in a different part of the airplane; however, \nit didn't matter. Everybody sucked in the secondhand smoke.\n  Frank Lautenberg took care of my boy and millions of other people who \nwould no longer have to suck in that smoke in an airplane. He is the \none, more than anyone else, whom we have to thank for protecting us \nfrom deadly secondhand smoke in an airplane because his legislation \nbanned smoking on airplanes.\n  He was also a long-time member of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee. Had he not retired in that very short period of time that he \ndid, he would have been chairman of that committee. However, because he \nwasn't there, I had the opportunity to be chair of that committee on \ntwo separate occasions.\n  He focused on this Nation's infrastructure, such as roads and \nhighways. One of the ideas he thought would make this country a much \nsafer place was to pass a drinking limit so a person could not drink \nalcohol anyplace in the country until they were 21 years of age. It was \ncalled a national drunk driving standard.\n  He believed in helping the State of New Jersey as well as helping the \ncountry, but I am not sure in which order. It was hard to understand \nthe difference because he was focused on the country and New Jersey at \nthe same time.\n  Frank wanted to make sure that women and children were protected from \ngun violence. Thanks to him, we passed legislation that convicted \ndomestic abusers so they could not own firearms.\n  Those are just a few examples of his work in the Senate that \nliterally saved lives. He came from his sick bed--in a wheelchair--to \nvote on gun legislation. He agreed with 90 percent of the American \npeople--that people who had severe mental problems or were felons \nshould not be able to buy guns. He agreed with 90 percent of the \nAmerican people.\n  He came from his bed to be here and vote with us. He was so happy to \nbe here. After that, he came once--just a few days ago--to vote when we \nneeded him again. He tried so hard.\n  When I talked to Bonnie today, she said he was confident he would \nlive to be 100. He was a very strong man physically.\n  A couple years ago, I took a big delegation to China. It was a \nbipartisan group. It was a wonderful trip. For Frank Lautenberg, that \nwas his last foreign travel. I can remember indicating what a strong \nman he was physically. I had never been to the Great Wall of China. I \ndon't know how many of the other 10 Senators had been there, but I had \nnot. It is pretty steep, and there are big rocks that have been there \nfor centuries and centuries. Because Frank was 88 years old at the \ntime, somebody grabbed his arm to help him go up. He pushed them away. \nHe wanted no help from anybody. He was on his own, and that is the way \nhe wanted to be.\n  I and our Nation owe a great debt of gratitude to Frank for his \noutstanding service. He had always been so kind to me. He was someone \nwho appreciated serving. He appreciated being here. He loved being in \nthe Senate, and the Nation is going to miss his strength and his \nprogressive leadership.\n  The other attribute that probably a lot of people didn't know about \nFrank Lautenberg was his sense of humor. I always had him tell stories \nbecause no one could tell a story like him. Another reason I liked \nFrank is he laughed at his own jokes. He thought they were funny, as \ndid most everyone who listened to them.\n  One of our favorite jokes was about two wrestlers. It would take 5 \nminutes or more to tell the story, but it was hilarious. No one could \ntell it like Frank. He had a sense of humor, and we certainly \nappreciated that. Even though the Senate has Al Franken, there was room \nfor two funny people prior to Frank's death this morning. Frank \nLautenberg--and Al Franken--always made us smile and often made us \nlaugh. Now I guess it is going to be up to Senator Franken to do this \nalone, because they were both funny, together and apart.\n\n  It is with deep sadness that his Senate family is going to say \ngoodbye. We are going to do that Wednesday morning. We will say goodbye \nto an exemplary public servant and a faithful friend, Senator Frank \nLautenberg.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/03/senate-section/article/S3888-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3888]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, 5 years ago I spoke at the Oak Ridge \nNational Laboratory. I began with a story from our past about our \nfuture. It is a familiar story to those of us in Tennessee.\n  President Franklin Roosevelt called the chairman of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee into his office in 1942 and said: Mr. \nChairman, I would like to ask you to hide a couple billion dollars in \nthe budget for a secret project to win the war.\n  Senator McKellar replied: Mr. President. I just have one question: \nWhere in Tennessee would you like me to hide it?\n  That place turned out to be Oak Ridge. That was how Tennessee became \none of the sites where scientists worked to build the atomic bomb \nbefore the Germans.\n  I suggested 5 years ago that we have a new Manhattan Project--really \nmini-Manhattan Projects for clean energy independence.\n  Last week at Oak Ridge, 5 years after that first speech, I suggested \nfour grand principles to help us chart a competitive energy future for \nthe next 5 years to end our obsession with taxpayer subsidies and \nstrategies for expensive energy and instead focus on doubling \ngovernment-sponsored research and allowing marketplace solutions to \ncreate an abundance of cheap, clean, reliable energy. I would like to \nrenew those comments today on the floor of the Senate. The four grand \nprinciples I mentioned were, No. 1, cheaper, not more expensive, \nenergy; No. 2, clean, not just renewable, energy; No. 3, research and \ndevelopment, not government mandates; and No. 4, the free market, not \nthe government, picking winners and losers.\n  The seven grand challenges I suggested 5 years ago were grounded in \nchallenges from the U.S. National Academy of Engineering. My challenges \nincluded making plug-in electric vehicles more commonplace, finding \nways to capture and use carbon, helping solar become cost-competitive, \nsafely managing nuclear waste, encouraging cellulosic biofuels, making \nnew buildings green buildings, and creating energy from fusion.\n  My goal in laying out those seven challenges was clean energy \nindependence. At the time, some took issue with the idea of a grand \ngoal underlying these challenges, but I thought independence was a good \ngoal then, and it is a good goal now because the United States should \nnot be held hostage by any other country because of our energy needs.\n  Since I spoke 5 years ago, the Department of Energy has established \nthe energy innovation hubs that are producing fuels from sunlight and \nadvancing nuclear reactor and battery technologies. That, paired with \nthe work of the new energy research agency--which we call ARPA-E--and \nothers, has moved us forward on my seven grand challenges in a number \nof ways. Let me summarize that briefly.\n  Electric vehicles sales are approaching 100,000 in the United States, \nand ARPA-E has helped a company that has doubled the energy density of \nlithium-ion batteries.\n  Carbon capture. We are developing commercial uses for carbon dioxide, \nsuch as liquid fuels produced from microbes.\n  Solar power. Though the goal is around $1 per watt installed by 2020, \nthe cost has fallen from $8 to $4 per watt in the past five years. It \nstill has a long way to go, but it is promising.\n  Nuclear waste. Four of us in the Senate have drafted comprehensive \nnuclear waste legislation. For the first time in 30 years, we are \nbuilding new large reactors, and we are moving forward on small modular \nnuclear reactors.\n  Advanced biofuels. There are three new bioenergy research centers \nthat are developing next-generation bioenergy crops for industrial-\nscale production.\n  Green buildings. Research and development has meant 20 new commercial \nproducts in energy efficiency.\n  Fusion. We have already demonstrated human-engineered fusion on a \nsmall scale, and now we are trying to scale it up for commercial energy \nproduction.\n  The United States has made gains, but we still have challenges. Even \nas other parts of the world grow rapidly, the U.S. still uses about 20 \npercent of the world's energy, and the Energy Information \nAdministration estimates that our country's energy demand will increase \nmore than 10 percent by 2040.\n  Second, we have record oil and gas production at home, but we need to \nbe as independent as possible from those who might want to use our \ndemand for oil to hold us hostage. Former Secretary Condoleezza Rice \nonce said she had ``never seen anything warp diplomacy like high oil \nprices.'' And affording a tank of gasoline remains a struggle for many \nfamilies.\n  Another challenge is failing to keep up with energy research and \ndevelopment, which is one of the major points I want to make today--\nfailing to keep up with energy R That energy research has given us \nabundant, reliable, clean, cheap energy from unconventional gas to \nnuclear power. The amount we spend on energy research and development--\nnearly $5 billion a year at the Department of Energy in nondefense and \nnoncleanup research; or nearly $9 billion if you count other agencies \nand their energy-related research, such as the National Science \nFoundation, the Department of the Interior, and the National Institute \nof Standards and Technology--still, those dollars are lower as a \npercentage of our gross product than major competitors such as France \nor Japan or Korea or China.\n  Another challenge is that while the United States has made more gains \nin reducing the use of carbon than any other industrial country, the \nNational Academies of the United States and 12 other countries have \nwarned that human activity has contributed significantly to climate \nchange and global warming.\n  So thinking about the progress we have made from 5 years ago and \ntaking into account the challenges we still have, let me suggest four \ngrand principles that could guide our energy future. First, cheaper, \nnot more expensive energy. Five years ago all the talk was about a cap-\nand-trade program for the United States and deliberately raising the \nprice of energy as a way of achieving clean energy independence.\n  Last year I was in Germany, a country that adopted exactly that \npolicy. In addition, Germany is closing its nuclear powerplants and \nbecoming more dependent on natural gas but buying both forms of energy \nfrom other countries rather than producing it on its own. The Germans \nare subsidizing wind and solar but are building new coal plants in \norder to have enough reliable electricity.\n  In short, what I found in Germany was an energy policy mess that \ndiscourages job growth. The end result is that Germany has the second \nhighest household electricity prices in the European Union. When I \nasked an Economic Minister what he would say to a manufacturer about \nenergy costs in Germany, he said: I would suggest he go somewhere else. \nWell, that somewhere else is turning out to be the United States: \nVirginia, Tennessee, other States.\n  In the United States, we pursued a different track, the most \nconspicuous example of which is finding unconventional gas and oil. \nThis has created for our country a remarkable phenomenon, a large \namount of cheap, clean energy with our own domestic price for natural \ngas.\n\n[[Page S3890]]\n\n  This has been the result of a peculiar combination of factors that, \nin my opinion, amount to a better energy policy than most people give \nus credit for. The first element is the entrepreneurial spirit of \nAmerica and the large amount of private property ownership and our huge \nprivate market. Another is access to capital. A third and indispensable \nelement is government-sponsored research.\n  Take our Nation's natural gas boom as an example. In the past it was \nuneconomical to develop so-called unconventional gas. Government-\nsponsored research enabled it and demonstrated how it could be done. A \ntemporary Federal tax credit that expired for new shale projects at the \nend of 1992 encouraged new sources of private capital. Natural gas will \nbe a big part of where we get our clean energy, which leads me to my \nsecond principle: clean, not just renewable, energy. Too often we \ndefine our energy goals in terms of renewable energy when we should \nmean clean energy. There are a number of States that have renewable \nenergy mandates defined mainly to include wind and solar power. The \nCongress is regularly asked to pass a narrowly defined renewable energy \nmandate for the same purpose.\n  It is true these energy sources emit no air pollution. These mandates \nsay a certain amount of electricity generated within a State must come \nfrom these specific sources. But focusing on this narrow definition for \nclean energy misses the point, and at a high cost to our electric \nbills.\n  Such narrow definitions also discount hydropower and nuclear power, \nsome of our country's cheapest and most available sources of air \npollution-free electricity. In the Tennessee Valley Authority region \nwhere I live, for example, more than 95 percent of our pollution-free \nelectricity comes from TVA's dams and three nuclear plants, which \ninclude six reactors.\n  Second, mandating renewable energy runs the risk of creating too much \nreliance on sources that generate power only intermittently. There is \ncertainly a place for these renewable technologies, and solar power \nespecially seems to me to have great promise. But renewable energy \nconsumes great amounts of space, whether it is solar or wind or \nbiomass.\n  For example, it would take a row of giant wind turbines all the way \nfrom Georgia to Maine on the Appalachian Trail to generate the same \namount of electricity that we would get from four nuclear power plants. \nYou would still need the nuclear plants because the wind only blows \nwhen it wants to.\n  Fortunately, we have plenty of rooftops on which to put solar panels. \nWhen they become cheap enough and aesthetically pleasing enough, they \nwill probably become an increasingly important supplement to our \ncountry's huge appetite for electricity, especially because the Sun \nshines during the peak-use hours.\n  Battery technology will help make all forms of renewable energy more \nuseful, which brings me to my next principle: research and development, \nnot government mandates. It is hard to think of an important \ntechnological advance in our country that has not involved at least \nsome government-sponsored research, especially in the area of energy.\n  The most recent example is the development of unconventional gas that \nwas enabled by 3D mapping invented at Sandia National Laboratory in New \nMexico and the Department of Energy's large-scale demonstration \nproject.\n  There is an argument that by imposing government mandates, just as by \nimposing higher prices, government could force some innovation that \ncould move us toward clean energy independence. But I believe the surer \npath would be to double the federal funding we spend annually on non-\ndefense and non-cleanup energy research and development and trust the \nmarketplace to produce better results.\n  In 2005 the ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm'' report, written by a \ncommission led by former Lockheed Martin CEO Norman Augustine, \nrecommended doubling energy research and development. In 2007 Congress \nresponded by passing the America COMPETES Act with overwhelming \nbipartisan support. Senator Coons and I are working together to \nreintroduce the America COMPETES Act for a second reauthorization after \nits original passage.\n  One small agency that is the result of the America COMPETES Act is \nwhat we call ARPA-E. It is already showing signs of the wisdom of this \napproach. ARPA-E has helped improve battery technology and worked to \nproduce liquid fuel from microbes, among other accomplishments. Seeing \nhow our free enterprise can capitalize on this brings me to my fourth \nand last principle: free market, not government picking winners and \nlosers.\n  We are more likely to have abundant supplies of cheap, clean, \nreliable energy in the United States if we trust the marketplace. The \nmost appropriate role for government is in research. I believe a second \nrole is limited jump-starting of new technologies; for example, \nunconventional gas, about which I just spoke, involves government \nresearch and a limited tax credit.\n  The full tax credit for electric cars is capped at 200,000 vehicles \nper manufacturer. To encourage innovation in nuclear energy, the \ngovernment provided research and licensing support for small modular \nreactors, but that is limited to 5 years.\n  Even for nuclear power plants there is a production tax credit, but \nit is limited to 6,000 megawatts. On the other hand, President Reagan \nused to say the nearest thing to eternal life we will ever see on this \nEarth is a government program. That is too often the case with energy \nsubsidies. The most glaring example of that is the more than 20-year-\nold subsidy for wind power, a technology that former Energy Secretary \nChu said was a technology that had ``matured.''\n  This was supposed to help jump-start wind. But we have already lost \n$16 billion in Federal revenue from 2009 through the end of 2012 alone. \nCongress just added a 1-year extension of the wind production tax \ncredit, costing $12 billion. Remember, the Department of Energy spends \njust $5 billion on energy research.\n  We are spending $12 billion in a 1-year extension of the wind tax \ncredit. The wind industry's idea of a phaseout would cost tens of \nbillions more. People talk about Big Oil, but the big, unnecessary \nsubsidy is big wind, and a much better place to spend our money would \nbe energy research.\n  I have been fascinated with the progress we have made on the seven \ngrand challenges I suggested 5 years ago. Perhaps by focusing on these \nfour grand principles, the ones I have suggested in this speech, we can \ncapitalize on the last 5 years of progress and move toward cheap, \nclean, reliable energy.\n  Oak Ridge's evolution since the Manhattan Project days provides a \ngood model. About 70 years ago the astonishing collection of physicists \nthat produced the two atomic bombs also enabled nuclear power, nuclear \nmedicine, and other technological advances.\n  What can we expect 5 years from now? To get a glimpse of the future \nwe might look at what fits within the guiding principles I have \nsuggested today. For example, small modular reactors and virtual \nreactors that scientists are developing will revolutionize the safety \nand effectiveness of our nuclear technology.\n  Game-changing manufacturing is also on the horizon with 3D printing. \nARPA-E, a small agency of the Department of Energy that came from \nAmerica COMPETES, and other groups are increasing the reliability of \nour electricity supply.\n  This United States of America is a remarkable place. With the \npotential I have described and the principles I have suggested, a \ncompetitive energy future is well within our grasp.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I just returned from my home State of Kansas to return to \nthe work we are about to do in the Senate. This week away from \nWashington, DC,\n\n[[Page S3891]]\n\ngave me the opportunity to travel all corners of our State. I went from \nsoutheast Kansas in Galena to northwest Kansas in Goodland, and almost \nevery night while I was home weather was the topic of conversation.\n  Certainly, as Kansans who have experienced tornadoes in our own State \nover the last week and, certainly, over the life of our State, we \nextend our deepest sympathies and concerns to the people of Oklahoma. \nIt is weather that I wanted to talk about on the Senate floor today in \npreparation for an amendment I will offer, which is being offered to \nthe farm bill, and continued discussion of that farm bill throughout \nthis week.\n  As I listened to Kansas farmers, the most prevalent request when it \ncomes to farm policy, to a request for what ought to be in a farm bill \nis the request by Kansans that the Crop Insurance Program remain solid \nand viable. We live in a State in which weather is not always a friend \nto agriculture. Yet agriculture is our most significant creator of \neconomic activity and generator of jobs and economic growth in our \nState.\n  We have the pleasure, in fact we are very proud, to feed, clothe, and \nprovide energy to much of the world. At the moment the challenges are \ngreat because of the significant effect the drought has had on Kansas \nand much of the Midwest. That drought has been ongoing for more than 2 \nyears, and it has had a significant impact on agricultural production. \nIt is that point I want to make as we debate the farm bill, the \nimportance of the Crop Insurance Program in response to those difficult \ntimes.\n  Despite the drought, our Nation remains the land of plenty, and \nAmericans continue to enjoy the safest and most abundant food supply in \nthe world. The reason we have so much is because of many factors: \nPrayers, the work ethic of American farmers and ranchers, the courage \nto persevere in spite of enormous challenges, and, among those things, \nfinally, is the ability to manage risk.\n  Farming and ranching is a high-risk occupation. Producers can't \nmanage the one thing that matters most to them, Mother Nature. Mother \nNature is the one variable that can't be controlled. Mother Nature \nbrings drought, rain, wind, and hail, the things a producer must face \nhead on each year and each year to follow.\n  With the inability to control the weather, we must control what we \ncan--the great risks associated with agriculture. This is required for \nthe United States to remain that land of plenty.\n  The risk management tool of choice is crop insurance. Crop insurance \ngives producers a safety net so when there is a drought, a flood, a \nhailstorm, or windstorm, they can pick up the pieces and try again. \nThis is what sets us apart from the rest of the world. We have the \nability to manage our risks so when Mother Nature gives us something \nbad, our Nation's farmers and ranchers can live to start again.\n  Crop insurance is a public-private partnership. The government helps \nthe producers cover some of the costs of the policy, and the producer \ncovers the rest. Consumers help the producer, and the producer helps \nthe consumer.\n  To be clear, producers pay a significant part of the premium out of \ntheir own pocket. In 2012 they paid $4.1 billion to buy insurance to \nmanage their risks. When farmers take out a crop insurance policy, they \nget a bill, not a check.\n  Crop insurance has virtually replaced the need for ad hoc disaster \nmeasures for crops. During my time in the House of Representatives and \nnow in the Senate, going back to 1989, 42 such pieces of legislation \nhave cost the taxpayer more than $70 billion. During my time in the \nHouse, and now the Senate, many times we have asked for ad hoc disaster \nassistance, a bill to pass the legislature to provide assistance at the \nmoment. Crop insurance is the tool by which we can avoid those \nrequests. When you manage risks with crop insurance, you save the \ntaxpayers money and give the producers a better program.\n  Today, as we have scheduled votes, I have an amendment on the Senate \nfloor dealing with a crop called alfalfa. Alfalfa is the Nation's \nfourth most valuable crop, and it plays a significant role in our daily \nlives.\n  Alfalfa is a building block for milk and meat. The hay that is grown \nin the fields of California, Idaho, South Dakota, Colorado, Oregon, \nWashington, Texas, Wisconsin, Kansas, and the rest of the 50 States is \na driver of the cost of products on grocery store shelves. The Nation's \nfourth most valuable crop is vitally important.\n  The reality is producers are faced with risks, and there is no good \nway to manage them when it comes to this crop, alfalfa. The current \nCrop Insurance Program, Forage Production APH, is severely inadequate, \nas demonstrated by the fact that less than 10 percent of the acres are \nenrolled in the program--compared to corn, soybeans, and wheat, which \nare all more than 80 percent.\n  Producers are going back to the bank to borrow operating money and \nbeing told not to plant alfalfa because there is no good way to manage \nthe risk. This is very troubling because of the impact that alfalfa has \non the economy and our Nation's food supply.\n  The crop is important, and we need to figure out a way to manage its \nrisks. Producers are being told to grow crops that have a safety net, \ncrops that have some kind of guarantee when weather is bad. My \namendment, No. 987, requires the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation to \nconduct research and development regarding the policy to insure alfalfa \nand a report describing the results of that study. There are no \nadditional costs to the taxpayer with my amendment.\n  We need to take a good hard look at alfalfa and recognize its value \nto the Nation. We need to study and develop something that will work, \nsave taxpayer money, and make certain the land of plenty remains the \nland of plenty. Alfalfa is a building block of milk and meat. With a \nrisk management tool for alfalfa production, producers will enjoy lower \ninput cost and consumers will enjoy less expensive products on the \ngrocery store shelves.\n  I know you understand the value of agriculture in Kansas, and I \nappreciate the opportunity to be on the Senate floor today to describe \nthe value of crop insurance and particularly to highlight the amendment \nwe will vote on later today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/03/senate-section/article/S3891-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3891-S3892]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ALASKA FLOODING\n\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I rise today to describe the devastating \nspring breakup flooding affecting my home State of Alaska. As we just \nheard about Kansas, weather patterns are affecting long-term droughts \nin farmlands, while in Alaska it is warm weather that is actually going \nin the opposite direction.\n  Over the last several weeks our country has witnessed devastating \ntornadoes in Oklahoma. Our hearts go out to the families of Moore, \nOklahoma City, and many others that have been affected, as they rebuild \ntheir lives.\n  Disasters such as these remind us of the importance of family and \ncommunity, and it should make us again examine the work being done by \nFEMA and other agencies to help communities prepare for natural \ndisasters. While it didn't make national news, Alaska's families along \nthe Yukon River are putting their lives back together after record \nflooding last week.\n  Thick river ice, high temperatures, and fast melting combined to \nflood the community of Galena during what we call ``breakup'' in \nAlaska. For those who have never witnessed it, breakup on Alaska's \nbiggest and mightiest river is a spectacle almost beyond description. \nAs the ice begins to move, buckle, and crack, you can sometimes hear it \nfrom miles away. The trouble is, in the wrong conditions, the moving \nice can get caught where the rivers make their natural bends. It piles \nup into mountains of jumbled ice, creating a natural dam that floods \neverything behind it, or when it suddenly breaks loose, torrents of \nraging water and ice rush downstream. This year breakup has, \nunfortunately, caused some extreme conditions in interior Alaska.\n  Last week, quickly rising waters from a 30-mile ice jam along the \nYukon River had the village of Galena underwater for 3 days. This is an \nexample of what you can see. The woods, the trees are there, but all \nalong there is water burying the buildings.\n\n[[Page S3892]]\n\n  Galena is a village of fewer than 500 people located in the interior \nof Alaska. At least 300 of these residents had to be evacuated to keep \nthem from danger. Others moved to buildings on higher ground to keep \nsafe from the rising water.\n  We are grateful to be able to say no deaths or serious injuries have \nbeen reported. It is a miracle when you look at the photos of the \ndamage. As I said, this photo, the aerial photo of Galena, shows the \nextent of the damage. As mentioned, this was a severe flood. It came on \nvery fast, and we had to try to deal with this very quickly because the \npower of the Yukon, when it is moving, is fast and furious. These ice \njams move fast once they break. It is the worst flooding they have seen \nin 70 years.\n  When this happens in very remote communities such as Galena, they \ndon't have communications, river-monitoring technology, and \ntransportation infrastructure to react quickly. Let me remind people \nthat you cannot drive out of this community. You have to fly out of \nthis community. So when the river is breaking, it is all hands on deck \nfor everybody.\n\n  We are thankful for the response by the Tanana Chiefs Conference, \nwhich safely evacuated many residents. The American Red Cross, the \nSalvation Army, and many volunteers provided invaluable help. I am \nproud of the community for coming together to support each other and \nevacuating the elders and those most in need first. Alaskans are the \ntype of people who are always willing to lend a hand to their neighbor.\n  This flood hit the community hard. Nearly every structure in Galena \nand the surrounding 25-mile-wide valley basin was under water. You can \nsee here in this photo how that water moved and flooded out the whole \narea. The ice jam on the Yukon causing this flooding isn't gone yet. \nVillages down river from Galena, such as St. Mary's or Holy Cross, \nremain on alert and are bracing for their possible evacuation.\n  Once again I remind folks, you cannot drive out of these communities, \nyou have to fly out or take the river. The people who live along the \nYukon River respect it as a resource but know that living along the \nbanks can also bring dangerous conditions which we must prepare for.\n  Although the waters in Galena are subsiding, we know the real work is \njust beginning. This community must rebuild stronger, more prepared for \nfuture disasters. And they must do so within the short summer \nconstruction season, an added complication for Alaska. Again, our \nspring is here now, summer will soon be here, and within 3\\1/2\\ months \nwinter will be back.\n  As chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Subcommittee on Emergency \nManagement, I take this flooding event very seriously. I have been in \ntouch with local leaders, State disaster response agencies, and FEMA. I \nwill remain engaged throughout the cleanup and rebuilding process.\n  I am working with the State on this emergency, and I will make sure \nwe have all the resources possible as Galena repairs and rebuilds. The \nemergency response priorities right now are restoring essential \nservices and getting people back in their homes. I am pleased Alaska's \nGovernor Parnell declared a State disaster for Galena last week, and I \nurge the President to act quickly to declare a Federal disaster to free \nup vital resources to help our State and its people recover.\n  Responding to natural disasters in Alaska is very different than in \nthe lower 48. We have very unique challenges. It is important to have \nsome perspective on the size and scope of Alaska. Alaska's land is two-\nand-a-half times the size of the State of Texas. Our road system is \nsmaller than that of Rhode Island, and 82 percent of Alaskan \ncommunities are only accessible by air. Flying from Galena to \nFairbanks, or back and forth, is equivalent to flying from Washington, \nDC, to New York. Actually, it is a little longer. It is an amazing \ndistance when you have to go from place to place.\n  I remind folks, as you can see the great Yukon, in order to bring \nsupplies and necessities in, it is an hour-long flight from the \nFairbanks region. This makes the traditional lower 48 disaster response \nunrealistic for Alaska. In most communities we don't have the road \nsystem to truck in critical supplies. We frequently rely on skilled \nbush pilots and boat captains to bring relief to communities in need. \nOur pilots are often forced to land on gravel runways or river sandbars \nand our barge captains must navigate dangerous waters to access rural \nvillages.\n  Most residents of the lower 48 couldn't even begin to imagine these \nexperiences. This disaster in Galena is a stark reminder of why we must \ncontinue to invest in the aviation and maritime lifelines Alaskans rely \non for survival.\n  Another issue unique to my State is the absence of broadband access \nin rural areas. When I say that, most people say: What is the big deal? \nEveryone is hooked up. Not in Alaska. This is something most people \nwould consider critical infrastructure in order to respond to \ndisasters.\n  Increased broadband deployment throughout rural Alaska would help \ncommunities such as Galena by providing vital information, such as \ntelehealth access to help injured residents, up-to-date information on \nchanging weather conditions, better communication between responders \nand the disaster response center, and information on incident response \nteams and cleanup strategies.\n  I might relate a personal example here. When I called the individual \nin charge of the situation on the ground, we were waiting for another \nradio call-in--let me repeat that: a radio call-in--to get an update \nfrom someone on the site because the technology doesn't exist at the \nlevel necessary to monitor a disaster of this magnitude.\n  This disaster is a reminder of the inequities that still exist in \nserving rural America. I will continue to look for ways to work with my \nSenate colleagues to act to provide rural communities with better \nbroadband access, not only for emergency disasters, such as we are \nhaving here, but also for basic communication.\n  All these factors mean Alaskans must work and respond differently \nwhen disasters occur in our State. As our State emergency response \nchief often tells me, ``You can't do `big city' response in most of \nAlaska.'' FEMA rules don't always work for rural Alaska. One key \nconcern is making sure FEMA programs for individual assistance are \nfully employed and complement State assistance.\n  I am hopeful that between the Federal, State, local, and tribal \ngovernments we can get some much-needed assistance to the residents of \nGalena who are living through this nightmare. I know how strong the \npeople of Galena are, and we know they will continue to stick together \nthrough this trying time. But they couldn't do it without the ongoing \nsupport of the National Guard and the Alaska Department of Homeland \nSecurity Emergency Management Office. We will all continue to work with \nthem as we help the residents of Galena get back on their feet.\n  Looking forward, as chairman of the Emergency Management \nSubcommittee, I will be holding listening sessions in Alaska to discuss \npreparedness and mitigation solutions to natural disasters. Because it \nis not just the interior that faces serious threats from natural \ndisasters, we must also consider North Slope communities that are often \nconfronting changes from the warming Arctic. It is important for us to \ntackle these issues head on, to create public-private partnerships, \nstrong communication lines, and disaster response plans so our \ncommunities are protected and our residents are safe.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

LAUTENBERG\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I just flew in from Chicago. Early this \nmorning, I was given the news that I had lost a great friend and one of \nmy dearest colleagues; Senator Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey passed \naway.\n  Most of us saw Frank a few weeks ago. He was here on the floor of the\n\n[[Page S3893]]\n\nSenate. He had to come down; it was one of those moments where his vote \nwas crucial. We knew he was struggling, but we also knew he would be \nhere. He said he would, and he was. He sat right over here in a \nwheelchair, with that trademark Frank Lautenberg smile. I don't think I \nhave ever run into a person in my life as happy as Frank Lautenberg. He \nwas a great joke-teller. The best thing about Frank's joke--even if he \nwas telling it for the 254th time--is he would start laughing before \nthe end of the joke and pretty soon the whole room was laughing.\n  You always wanted to be out for dinner with Frank and Bonnie because \nyou knew there was going to be a good time. You would hear a lot of \njokes you had heard before, but you encouraged him to tell them. He had \nso many stories to tell.\n  Here he was, a member of the ``greatest generation,'' having served \nin World War II, and served here in the Senate. Two different \napproaches. He retired once and came back, and served here to the age \nof 89.\n  He astonished us all when he came here on the floor of the Senate, \nthat he was wheeled in in a wheelchair to vote on some important \namendments related to gun safety and gun control. Frank, if he were \nalive, would not have missed those votes; it meant so much to him. It \nwas an issue that he led on, he was respected for. When it came to \nclosing the loopholes where convicted felons and people who had no \nbusiness owning guns were buying them anyway, Frank Lautenberg led the \neffort to stop the proliferation of guns and the distribution of them \nto people who would misuse them. It was a cause he felt passionately \nabout, and one he cast many tough votes on as he served in the Senate.\n  His return that day for those votes was an act of courage in a long \nlife that was filled with courage, starting with his service in the \nU.S. Army in World War II, and continuing throughout his life--physical \ncourage, political courage, and moral courage.\n  When Frank Lautenberg spoke to some law students at Rutgers \nUniversity about 10 years ago, he said he had considered briefly \nstudying law himself after he had served in the Army in World War II \nbut decided he was too old to start law school. He told the law \nstudents: It was too late; I missed my opportunity.\n  Frank Lautenberg may not have earned a law degree, but make no \nmistake, Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey left an important mark on the \nlaws of America.\n  Here is how I first came to know him. In 1986, I was a Congressman \nfrom Springfield, IL, and had been here 4 years. I had never met Frank \nLautenberg of New Jersey, who was a Senator at the time. I got this \ncrazy notion to introduce a bill to ban smoking on airplanes. I didn't \nhave a chance, not a chance. The entire leadership of the House of \nRepresentatives opposed me--all the Democratic leaders of my party and \nall the Republican leaders too. Yet I put the amendment on a \ntransportation appropriations bill, and through some good luck and \nbreaks it made it through the Rules Committee. That wasn't supposed to \nhappen.\n  It turned out that when the chairman of the Rules Committee--Claude \nPepper of Florida--was a Senator years before, he had been instrumental \nin starting the National Cancer Institute. As a southerner, he didn't \ntalk much about tobacco--nobody did from the South in those days--but \nin his heart he knew tobacco smoking was killing people. He let me get \nthat amendment to the floor, which shocked everybody. I remember the \nday--and this goes back 27 years--I was in the House of \nRepresentatives, brand new, calling this amendment to ban smoking on \nflights of 2 hours or less. That is how we started. I looked up in the \ngallery, and the gallery was filled with flight attendants in their \nuniforms from all different airlines. They were victims too of \nsecondhand smoke.\n  We called that measure for a vote, and it passed. It shocked \neverybody. It turned out the House of Representatives was the biggest \nfrequent flier club in America. They were sick and tired of sitting on \nairplanes and breathing in somebody else's secondhand smoke.\n  Well, there were a few moments of jubilation and celebration. Then \nsomebody said, Well, what are you going to do in the Senate? I thought, \nOh, my goodness; that is an important part of this. So I decided to \ncall the chairman of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee--a \nfellow named Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey. I didn't know him, but I \nsaid to him, Frank, I would like to ask you a favor. Would you consider \noffering this bill as an amendment to the Senate transportation \nappropriations bill. He said, I will get back to you. And he did--in a \nhurry. He said, I am on board. Let's do it together.\n  It was the best phone call I ever made. And for the people of this \ncountry and those who fly on airplanes, that team of Lautenberg and \nDurbin managed to pass a bill, signed into law, which did much more \nthan we ever dreamed of. We thought this little idea of taking smoking \noff airplanes would make flight a little more comfortable and safer \nfrom a health point of view. What neither Frank nor I realized at the \ntime was it was a tipping point. Americans looked around and said, If \nwe are going to take smoking off airplanes, why stop there? Trains, \nbuses, offices, hospitals, restaurants--look across the board at what \nhas happened in America. Neither Frank nor I saw this coming, but it \nworked. It has changed this country. It has changed the Senate, the \nHouse--it has changed this country. I wouldn't be standing here today \ntelling you the story were it not for Frank Lautenberg. He was the very \nbest partner I ever could have had. The day came when I was elected to \nthe Senate. He and I used to go around and tell the story from time to \ntime, reminiscing about that battle back in 1986.\n  Frank told us he was once a two-pack-a-day cigarette smoker himself, \nbut when it came to this bill, he knew the right thing to do. I was \nlucky to have him by my side. I couldn't have done it without him.\n  He was the driving force behind a lot of other laws that were \nimportant to America: setting the national drinking age at 21; setting \nthe national blood level definition of 0.08 for drunk driving. These \nlaws on smoking and drunk driving have saved millions of lives thanks \nto the leadership of Frank Lautenberg.\n  He was the last remaining World War II veteran in the Senate. A few \nweeks ago we lost Danny Inouye, who used to sit right here. He, of \ncourse, served in World War II as well.\n  Frank passed away early this morning in New York. He is survived by \nhis wife Bonnie Englebardt Lautenberg. What an extraordinarily good \nperson she is. I left a message for her on her voicemail and said, \nStanding by Frank's side made a big difference in his life, in the \nyears they were together. They were a great partnership. In addition, \nhe is survived by 6 children and 13 grandchildren.\n  He was a leader on environmental protection, transportation, and \nprotecting public health. He authored the law that prevented domestic \nabusers from possessing guns. It wasn't easy to do. It looks pretty \nobvious, doesn't it? It turned out police organizations were opposing \nhim, because some policemen had been accused of domestic abuse and they \ncouldn't carry a gun under the Lautenberg amendment. Frank stood his \nground.\n  He cowrote the new GI bill for the 21st century. A man who was a \nbeneficiary of the original GI bill in World War II teamed up with Jim \nWebb of the State of Virginia, and the two of them put together a GI \nbill that our men and women who serve richly deserve.\n  He authored the toxic right to know law. It was another great law he \nand I cosponsored. It came down to the question of the chemicals that \nare put in fabric in our furniture--which, sadly, leach out and get \ninto the environment of our homes, many times affecting small children. \nFrank was quick to be the leader on that issue. Even though his State \nof New Jersey is one with a lot of chemical manufacturers and \nproducers, he led in this effort to protect families and children.\n  He wrote the law to create the Paterson Great Falls National Historic \nPark. After he cast his 9,000th vote in December of 2011, Senator Harry \nReid proclaimed on the Senate floor, ``Frank Lautenberg has been one of \nthe most productive Senators in the history of this country.''\n  It was February 15 that Frank announced he wasn't going to seek \nanother term in the Senate. At the time\n\n[[Page S3894]]\n\nof his announcement in his hometown of Paterson, he set out an agenda \nfor the remaining 2 years of what he wanted to get done before he left \nthe Senate: reforming the U.S. chemical safety laws, improving gun \nsafety, and providing Federal resources for New Jersey to rebuild from \nSuperstorm Sandy.\n  We owe it to Frank and his memory to make sure those things are done. \nI know that Bob Menendez, his friend and close colleague from New \nJersey, will pick up that gauntlet and proceed to carry on in Frank's \nname.\n  He used to say with some pride that he was a success in business--and \nhe was--and that he understood the mind of businessmen. But he never \never lost touch with the common man and the people who counted on him \nin New Jersey and around the United States.\n  The Senate is going to miss Frank Lautenberg. I am going to miss a \ngreat pal. I am going to miss one of the best dinner companions you \ncould ever dream of here in Washington, DC. We are going to join \ntogether on Wednesday up in New York for a memorial service. I am sure \nit is going to be widely attended, because Frank did a lot of good for \na lot of people over the course of his years in public service. I am \ngoing to miss him.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I was going to speak on a different \nsubject, but I will speak further about our dear colleague Senator \nLautenberg. I look at the flowers on his desk--it seems in the years I \nhave been here I have seen too many colleagues' flowers there. Of \ncourse, every day Frank Lautenberg was here, I had the privilege of \nserving with him, a dear friend. I missed him when he left the Senate \nand was overjoyed when he came back to the Senate. He was a man who \ncared about his country, cared about the Senate, cared about the \npeople.\n  He was a man who came from humble beginnings and became extremely \nwealthy. He spent a lot of time giving that wealth away. He was the \nlast combat veteran--in fact, the last veteran from World War II \nserving in this body. Those of us who got to know him and spent time \nhearing of those horrendous times in Europe during World War II are \nbetter for it. We realized a person who had served the country during \nthat time did more than any of the rest of us.\n  I will speak further about my friend Frank Lautenberg. I know \nMarcelle and I extend our love to Bonnie and his children, his family.\n  I ask consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/03/senate-section/article/S3894-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3894-S3895]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, before the Senate went into recess, I was \ndisappointed with the statements made to the Senate that misstated the \nhistory of Judge Srinivasan's confirmation process. The Senator who \nsaid the chairman of the Judiciary Committee made ``no effort, no \neffort'' to have a hearing on Judge Srinivasan until late last year was \nmisinformed, and in stating what he did, he misinformed the Senate.\n  We made efforts in the fall before the election to schedule such a \nhearing, and I renewed our push to have a hearing on the nomination \nbefore the end of the session. I was accommodating Republican \nobjections by not scheduling a hearing before the end of last year.\n  These erroneous Record statements--these erroneous statements to the \nrest of the Senate--have me wondering whether I should be so \naccommodating to Republican scheduling demands if they then forget \ntheir demands in their efforts to avoid responsibility and to blame \nothers. In other words, they request a delay and then say, well, of \ncourse it is somebody else's fault that we had the delay.\n  Judge Srinivasan was nominated June 11, 2012, during a summer when \nSenate Republicans were in the process of constricting the confirmation \nprocess and intent on their misapplication of the so-called Thurmond \nrule to stall judicial nominees before the Presidential election. It \nwas only in May, 2012, that the Senate completed action on the 19 \nnominees held over on the Senate Executive Calendar in 2011. \nRepublicans were in the process of filibustering a nominee to the Ninth \nCircuit from Arizona. Interestingly enough, the person they were \nfilibustering had been recommended by Jon Kyl of Arizona, the deputy \nRepublican leader, of course a Republican Senator. Republicans were \ndragging out confirmations of judicial nominees who had been nominated \nin the fall of 2011 and the early months of 2012. They even \nfilibustered a Tenth Circuit nominee from Oklahoma who had been \nsupported by the two Republican Senators from Oklahoma in what was the \nfirst filibuster of a circuit court nominee reported with bipartisan \nsupport by the Judiciary Committee. Throw out all the precedents, throw \nout all the rule books, throw out everything Democrats and Republicans \nhave done in the past--it is going to be our way or the highway. Even \nwhen the President of the United States, in trying to reach out, \nnominates a judge supported by the two Republican Senators of that \nState, a judge reported out by a bipartisan vote by the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, they say: Oh, what the heck, President Obama \nnominated him, let's filibuster him. This is wrong. It is a pity. It is \nbeneath the United States Senate.\n  They filibustered a First Circuit nominee from Maine who was \nsupported by the two Republican Senators from Maine. In addition, \nRepublicans had filibustered the earlier nomination of Caitlin Halligan \nto the DC Circuit. Anybody who needs to refresh their recollections of \nthose months should reread my statements on judicial nominations from \nJune 6, June 11, June 12, June 18, June 26, July 10, July 16, July 23, \nJuly 30, August 2, September 10, September 20, November 30, December 3, \nDecember 6, December 11, December 13, and December 17. Unlike the \nrecent misstatements made to the Senate, the facts are in those \nstatements of mine.\n  By July 19, 2012, I had determined that the paperwork on the \nSrinivasan nomination was complete and the nominee could be included in \na hearing. It has been my practice as chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, in an effort to be fair, to do something that was not always \ndone by others, to give the minority notice and allow consultation \nbefore scheduling a nomination for a hearing. At that time, the next \nJuly hearing had been discussed as one devoted to the nominee to head \nthe Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, a nomination that \nitself had been delayed and to which there was Republican opposition. \nDuring the August recess, my staff asked Senator Grassley's about \nholding a hearing on the Srinivasan nomination in September. They \nraised objections and concerns about proceeding with the DC Circuit \nnomination at that time but agreed to proceed with four district \nnominees and a Court of International Trade nominee.\n\n  In November 2012, after the American people had solidly reelected \nPresident Obama, we raised the need for the hearing on the DC Circuit \nnomination anew. Republicans objected, again, in spite of the precedent \nof holding a hearing on one of President Bush's DC Circuit nominees \nduring a similar lameduck session.\n  Instead, they said: No, no, no. It is all right to do it for a \nRepublican President but not for this Democratic President, Barack \nObama. We can't do it for him. I know you allowed it for President \nGeorge W. Bush, but after all, he is different. He was a Republican \nPresident. We cannot do it for this Democratic President. Instead they \nwanted to proceed only with district court nominees during the \nlameduck. Republicans insisted the Srinivasan hearing be put off until \nthe next Congress and the new year. In deference to the Republican \nminority, I held off. They agreed that he would be included in the \nfirst nominations hearing of the 113th Congress.\n  Then, in early January this year, when called upon to hold up what \nthey said they would agree to, their end of the bargain, Republicans \nwanted to change the rules again and they\n\n[[Page S3895]]\n\nbalked. They insisted the nominee and others be interviewed and scores \nof documents be produced in their effort to stall other nominations. In \nother words, having made an agreement, they backed out of it. The \nnominee was not, and could not have been, the ``lawyer . . . who \nhandled'' the Magner case. In fact, the United States was not a party \nin the Magner case. As was readily apparent from the one email that \nnamed Srinivasan, his alleged ``involvement'' was merely being asked by \nTom Perez, now the President's nominee to be Labor Secretary, a \ntechnical legal question about U.S. Supreme Court procedure. It was the \nnominee's job as the Principal Deputy Solicitor General to answer such \nquestions for administration officials--and he did answer it \nappropriately. Republicans could have asked him about it at his \nconfirmation hearing in January and fulfilled their agreement, but they \ninsisted on using his nomination as leverage against the \nadministration. They insisted, instead, on first interviewing three \nU.S. Department of Justice officials, including Tom Perez, before they \nwould go forward with his hearing.\n  After months of attempts to get the committee Republicans to focus on \nthe nominee at hand while they insisted on their wide-ranging \ninvestigation of Tom Perez, a nominee not pending before the Judiciary \nCommittee, Republicans finally agreed to include Srinivasan at the \nJudiciary Committee on April 10, 2013. That was more than 7 months \nafter the hearing I had first been proposed and more than three months \nafter the hearing to which they had previously agreed.\n  As I noted in my December 12 hearing statement, as Chairman I had not \njammed the minority with judicial confirmation hearings the way my \nRepublican predecessor did. I was trying to bring the Senate back to \nthe way it should be, the same way I did during the immigration \nhearings and markup. I did not want to go back to the games played that \nwe had to face when they were in charge. I think no good deed goes \nunpunished.\n  We held only 11 judicial nomination hearings in 2012. In light of the \nSenate's recess schedule for the election cycle, we held only two after \nthe August recess. The nominations included at those hearings were the \nresult of consultation with the ranking minority member and were \nessentially by agreement.\n  I now see that when we try to work it out, and we keep our word and \nwe have conciliation and accommodation and keep our word and our part \nof the bargain, all we get is recrimination from the other side as they \ntry to break the bargain. That is not the Senate I have been proud to \nserve in for 38 years.\n  This nominee was praised at the hearing and proceeded to answer \nscores of written questions after the hearing. When he had provided his \nwritten responses, I listed his nomination for action by the Judiciary \nCommittee on May 9, 2013. In what has become standard practice for the \nRepublicans on the Judiciary Committee, they still insisted on holding \nhim over for another week for no good reason. I protected their right \non that, even though it has been abused in a way I have never seen in \n38 years.\n  Presaging the unanimous Senate vote, the vote in the Judiciary \nCommittee was 18 to zero when it was finally allowed to proceed on May \n16. Republicans then insisted that the Senate vote on his confirmation \nbe delayed two weeks until after the Memorial Day recess. I would not \nbe surprised if Senate Republicans now took credit for expediting that \nvote despite the fact that it took the Majority Leader filing a cloture \npetition to get that vote in May.\n  I make significant efforts to ensure that the minority is prepared to \nmove forward on a nomination before we schedule a hearing. My staff \nroutinely gives them our plan weeks in advance. Even with this advance \nnotice, I routinely have to notice a hearing without listing nominees \nbecause the minority has not yet taken the time to read the basic \nmaterial on the nominations despite its being available for weeks, and \nsometimes months, with something a law clerk could have done in 20 \nminutes, but this highly paid professional staff can't get around to \ndoing it.\n  I am disappointed that despite the fact that I have bent over \nbackwards to accommodate them, Senate Republicans contend that I made \n``no effort, no effort'' to hold Judge Srinivasan's hearing last fall. \nOne Republican Senator said during the debate on the Srinivasan \nnomination that the delay must have been my choice since that decision \nwas ``solely within the control of the Democratic majority.'' For \nSenate Republicans to pretend that they had no role in delaying this \nnomination was wrong. Do they really think the American people are that \ngullible? I think not.\n  We had the Policeman of the Year award early this morning in the \nMansfield Room. When I looked up at that painting of Mike Mansfield, I \nthought of how wonderful it was to come here when he was the majority \nleader. I remember him saying one thing: Senators, no matter what their \nparty, should always keep their word; and when on the floor of the \nSenate, they should always tell the truth. That is good advice. I wish \npeople would start following it.\n\n\n                      Commending Senator Stabenow\n\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Michigan, the chair of the \nSenate Agriculture Committee, on the floor. If I could take 30 seconds \nlonger so I can say with her here what I said about her in Vermont to a \ngroup of farmers this past week: The Senate is blessed to have her as \nchair. Nobody has done it better, and I can speak with some experience. \nShe brought through a wonderful bipartisan farm bill last year. The \nother body did not take it up. She is going to bring through a \nwonderful one this year. I hope they will take it up.\n  While she is on the Senate floor, I want to say the same thing I said \nabout her in the State of Vermont: Every one of us is so proud of the \nSenator. Whether it was a Republican or Democrat, they all agreed.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/03/senate-section/article/S3895-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3895]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, before the distinguished chair of the \nJudiciary Committee--and former chair of the Agriculture Committee--\nleaves the floor, I just want to thank him not only for being a \nwonderful role model for me in chairing the Agriculture Committee, but \nalso for the way in which he conducts the Judiciary Committee. He is \nevenhanded, fair, and gives every member the opportunity to make their \ncase, whether it is legislation coming through on gun violence, \nimmigration, or judicial nominations. I just want to thank the Senator \nfor being the model of a statesman in all he does.\n  I agree that we need to move forward in a fair and open bipartisan \nway in filling the nominations of our judiciary. I just wanted to thank \nthe Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. President, we are resuming the consideration of the farm bill, \nthe agriculture reform, food, and jobs bill. Before I address that, I \nwant to take a moment--as many colleagues have already done, and many \nmore will do--to pay a very special tribute to a dear friend and \ncolleague, Senator Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey.\n\n\n                    Remembering Frank R. Lautenberg\n\n  I was deeply saddened, as we all were today, to learn Senator \nLautenberg had passed away during the night. My thoughts and prayers \nare with Bonnie and the whole family, as I know they are grieving \nbecause of the special loss they feel and we will all feel.\n  He was the kind of Senator we will not see again--a World War II \nveteran. We have lost our World War II veterans. He defended freedom \nagainst\n\n[[Page S3896]]\n\nsome of the most evil forces of the 20th century, and he was truly a \nmember of the ``greatest generation'' of Americans.\n  We saw him battle cancer and survive. We have seen him come to the \nfloor time after time on behalf of the people of New Jersey and our \ncountry to fight with tremendous courage for what he believed was \nright.\n  I daresay he was one of the lions of the Senate. He served for nearly \n30 years, casting over 9,000 votes on behalf of the State and the \npeople he loved.\n  What makes Congress special is that we all come from all walks of \nlife, and as we know that is what makes a great democracy. That is what \ngives us our strength, not weakness.\n  Senator Lautenberg was the son of Jewish immigrants. He went to \nschool on the GI bill--as my dad did--after defending our country. He \nwent on to become a successful businessman by developing one of the \nmost successful payroll companies in the world.\n  We were proud to have Senator Lautenberg speak on what it meant to be \na success in creating jobs. He has been a wonderful voice in that \nregard.\n  He found his true calling in public service, and we all know that. \nDuring his five terms in the Senate he was one of the most fearless \nfighters on a whole range of issues. He has made a permanent mark on \nthe quality of life of Americans. Among other things, he helped to \nstrengthen drunk driving laws, pass the ban on smoking, prevent those \nconvicted of domestic violence from possessing guns, to author \nlegislation to help the public discover what pollutants were being \nreleased into neighborhoods, and to cowrite the new GI bill for the \n21st century. I could go on and on with so many other examples.\n  I am proud to have worked with him to champion cleaning our beaches \nall along our coasts and Great Lakes, working to increase the awareness \nand treatment of autism, and fighting to make sure women have access to \nthe health care we need and deserve.\n  He was a true fighter for the rights of all Americans, and he will be \ngreatly missed.\n  Once again, I send my thoughts and prayers to his wife Bonnie, who is \nan amazing woman in her own right, his children, and his grandchildren \nduring this very difficult time.\n  Mr. President, as we return to the debate on the farm bill today, it \nis important to note that what we do this week will reflect just how \ncommitted we are to 16 million Americans who depend on agriculture for \ntheir livelihood. All Americans depend on its success for the safest, \nmost affordable, and abundant food supply in the world.\n  We have to lead by example. We cannot kick the can down the road. We, \nin the Senate, have already worked hard together on this farm bill \nwhich passed out of the Agriculture Committee with broad bipartisan \nsupport. We have had a good debate on the Senate floor and a number of \nvotes. We are close to finishing the bill, and we need to get it done \nthis week.\n  I will note that it was just a year ago when we were also working on \nthis bill. At that time, after coming out of committee on a strong \nbipartisan vote as well, we had 73 record rollcall votes. Every one of \nthe substantive amendments that passed on the floor is already in this \nbill.\n  So we started with the work we did a year ago and the amendments of \ncolleagues that were passed on the floor of the Senate, and now we are \nbuilding on that with additional ideas. We know it is time to bring \nthis work to a close and get it done.\n  We need to move forward in order to take care of the people who rely \non agricultural policy, conservation policy, nutrition, energy policy, \nand rural development. Every community outside of our major cities \ndepends on rural development funds in order to be able to provide \neconomic development, build the water and sewer project, build the \nroad, and provide a loan for a small business. They are all counting on \nus to get this bill done so they have some long-term certainty.\n  This is a jobs bill, and the 5-year bill in front of us needs to get \npassed so they have certainty about how to plan for the future and how \nto continue to create jobs.\n  We also need to pass this bill because we need to stop unnecessary \nspending, and we do that in this bill. We need to also ensure that \nconsumers will continue to have a safe, healthy, and affordable food \nsupply. We need to come together to show that, once again, we can work \ntogether across party lines as we have done on this legislation. It is \nimportant to get this bill done this week.\n  I am very proud of the fact that last year we were the only committee \nthat produced a voluntary deficit reduction plan. We went through every \nsingle page of the policy under the farm bill, and I asked: Does it \nduplicate something else? Does it work? Is it needed anymore? Is it \nworthy of taxpayer dollars?\n  At the end we had eliminated 100 different programs or \nauthorizations. Some programs were consolidated or strengthened, such \nas conservation. Others were eliminated because they did not make \nsense. Things such as direct payment subsidies did not make sense. Last \nyear we were able to produce $23 billion in savings.\n  This year we were back at it again and looked at a couple of other \nideas, and it is $24 billion in savings to reduce the deficit. To put \nthat in some kind of context, under the across-the-board cuts we have \nall known to be called the sequester--the across-the-board cuts over \nthe next 10 years for every agency--agriculture's across-the-board cut \nis $6 billion.\n  We could have said: Well, the sequester is $6 billion, so we will \nfind $6 billion in savings. We didn't do that. We found four times as \nmuch in savings. We wanted to come to the floor of the Senate to tell \nevery colleague that there is integrity in every program; that we have \ndone everything we could to cut duplication, create accountability, and \nprovide policies that make sense for the American taxpayer.\n  We don't do subsidies anymore, we do insurance. We partnered with \nfarmers to buy insurance so they have skin in the game. They don't \nreceive a check, they get a bill for the insurance. But just like any \nother insurance, there is no payout unless there is a loss. So that is \nthe basic structure.\n  We have done a tremendous amount to also hone in on areas of, \nfrankly, misuse or abuse in policy as it relates to the commodity title \nas well. For instance, this bill caps payments in the commodity program \nto half of what they currently are. So we cut in half the current limit \non what may be received by an individual farmer.\n  Senator Grassley and Senator Tim Johnson deserve tremendous credit. \nSenator Grassley, as a member of our committee, has championed these \nreforms in payments for years, and this is the first farm bill that has \nthat in the base bill. We are cutting the payments in half.\n  We closed something called the manager's loophole to ensure that so-\ncalled farm managers actually have to be farming. They have to actually \nbe farming to get a farm payment.\n  Today the Washington Post has an article that I would encourage folks \nto read. It talks about folks who are in Manhattan and Georgetown, \nliving in multimillion-dollar homes, receiving these payments, and they \nare not farmers. Because of the current structure and lack of \naccountability and focus, they are actually getting paid. They do not \nget that anymore under this bill. We have important reforms.\n  This bill saves money by tightening rules to prevent fraud and misuse \nin our nutrition programs. Our nutrition programs are critical and \nessential. Just as crop insurance is there when a farmer has a \ndisaster, food programs are there when a family has a disaster.\n  We know, as in anything else, there are areas where there can be \nabuse or waste. In my own home State, much to my chagrin, we have seen \nlottery winners continue to receive food assistance. We stop that. We \ncrack down on retailers engaged in trafficking of benefits, and we \nprevent States from allowing some individuals to claim expenses they \ndon't really have in order to increase their benefits.\n\n  By ending the misuse but making sure we keep the standard benefit for \nevery man, woman, and child who deserves some temporary help, we are \nputting more integrity into the food program. I would argue we need to \nmake sure we stand strong against the cuts coming from the House of \nRepresentatives when we talk about food assistance for folks who have \npaid taxes all of their lives, who never\n\n[[Page S3897]]\n\nthought in their wildest dreams they would ever need help, who are \nmortified and who suddenly find themselves out of work and need to know \nsomebody will be there to help them put food on the table, help them \nget back on their feet. Our bill does that while creating \naccountability. I am very proud of the work our committee has done.\n  We also have streamlined programs not only to save dollars but to \ncreate more flexibility.\n  We have done a tremendous amount of work in the area of conservation. \nWe have over 650 conservation and environmental groups across the \ncountry endorsing our work in conservation. We took 23 conservation \nprograms and cut them down to 14 and then put them in 4 very different \nand flexible areas. These conservation groups see that as an \nimprovement because we are cutting down the paperwork and making it \nmore flexible for farmers and community groups to be able to access \nconservation programs, and we are actually saving money as we are doing \nthat.\n  In this bill, as the Presiding Officer knows, we have also codified a \nvery important agreement that environmentalists, conservation groups, \nand farm commodity group leaders have come to in supporting crop \ninsurance and making sure those who receive crop insurance are \ncompliant with conservation. It is a very important policy, and I \ncommend everybody who worked so hard on it.\n  Once again, as we go into this week, I wish to remind colleagues this \nis a jobs bill. Agriculture is a bright spot in our economy. It is the \nonly area in which we actually have a trade surplus. The farm bill \ninvests in a number of areas to boost exports and to help family \nfarmers sell more goods locally. We make some changes. While we are \ncutting in certain areas, we actually increase in others. That is what \nwe ought to do when we make good policy decisions. So we have increased \nfunding for farmers markets, local food hubs, the ability for schools \nto be able to purchase more fresh foods and vegetables locally--things \nthat create jobs locally.\n  We have spurred innovations in new biobased manufacturing--not just \nbioenergy, but we can replace chemicals and petroleum with things such \nas soybean oil and other agricultural byproducts that are actually \ncleaner, biodegradable, create jobs, and get us off foreign oil. So \nthere are new initiatives in the farm bill that allow us to do that as \nwell.\n  It really is a time for reform of the policies that fall under what \nwe dub the ``farm bill.'' This bill, I believe and I think it is safe \nto say, is the most reform we have seen in decades. We have done it on \na bipartisan basis. We have had tough votes and made tough decisions, \nbut I believe they are the right decisions in terms of reform. This is \na bipartisan effort, coming out of committee 15 to 5, and I hope for \nand expect a strong bipartisan vote as we had a year ago.\n  This really is a jobs bill. It really is a jobs bill, and in order to \nkeep it a set of jobs policies, our farmers and ranchers need to have \nthe economic certainty of getting this work done and having a 5-year \npolicy that will allow them to plan and to continue to create the \nsafest, most affordable food supply for Americans of anyone in the \nworld. So it is time to get it done. We are anxious to work with \ncolleagues this week to do that.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business \nfor such time as I may consume.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                             Sexual Assault\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, tomorrow the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee is going to hold a hearing on the pending legislation \nregarding sexual assault in the military.\n  Lately, we have been bombarded, we have been inundated with news \nreports about sexual assault in the military in our Nation. We can't \nlose sight of the fact that we have the finest military in the world. \nThe presence of sexual predators in our force does not take away from \nthe overwhelming good that is done around the world by our members in \nuniform, but the presence of these sexual predators in the ranks needs \nto be addressed, and that is what the military is doing now with or \nwithout our interference.\n  Last year's NDAA--the National Defense Authorization Act--signed into \nlaw in January of this year, included 10 new provisions dealing with \nsexual assault that commanders have barely had time to begin \nimplementing, let alone to assess the effectiveness of them. Yet some \nwant to provide still more changes in the law this year. These \ncommanders need time to act. We can't keep piling new demands on our \ncommanders until they have had time to meet the previous demands. That \nis what the hearing tomorrow is really all about. We are going to be \ntalking about more demands along these lines.\n  Today, sexual assault has not been eliminated, but we are working on \nit. The battle is not lost. More needs to be done. We understand that, \nand more is going to be done. But we have to preserve the leadership \ntools that make our forces the finest in the world. One such tool has \nbeen to give commanders authority to identify and correct problems \nfirmly and fairly and dispose of disciplinary offenses that destroy \nmorale and readiness. That is why I oppose the proposals to eliminate \nthe role of the commander in this process.\n  To take the commander out of the process would invite failure. These \ncommanders have to make decisions to send our brave troops into battle. \nHow ludicrous is it that we would say to our commanders: You have to \nmake a decision to send one of our kids into battle where they may end \nup losing their lives; however, you can't participate in the justice \nsystem of the troops. It doesn't make any sense at all.\n  As we consider the many proposals to combat sexual assault in the \nmilitary, we can't lose sight of the importance to do three things. The \nthree things are protect, prevent, and preserve. We have to protect the \ncritical role of the commander in driving cultural changes and \naccountability. We have to prevent case disposition authority from \nbeing transferred outside the chain of command. Those of us who have \nbeen in the service know what that is. Thirdly, we have to preserve the \nintegrity of the Uniform Code of Military Justice as an integrated, \nfunctional system of justice.\n  First, we have to protect the critical role of the commander. The \nmilitary is a hierarchy. The most junior recruit quickly learns there \nis always someone above him in the military organization. I have been \nthere. I understand that. The need to follow the chain of command has \nbeen instilled in our troops. That is what they do. It is not a social \nsystem; this is a chain of command. Our military is both an \norganization of leaders and of followers who are in training to become \nleaders. In peacetime or in war, leaders establish clear expectations \nand insist on meeting objectives. Every job in the military is \nimportant, and every job needs to be done correctly because lives \ndepend on it. The security of our Nation also depends on it. To ensure \nthat the tough jobs get done, the military has a justice system that \nsets the expectation that decisions have consequences and, I might add, \nbad decisions have consequences also.\n  Today there are four major bills that have been introduced to address \nperceived deficiencies in how the armed services address sexual \nassault. I think these will very likely be discussed--maybe not all \nfour of them, but some of them are going to be discussed in tomorrow's \nhearing. I believe that before we make significant, substantive, and \nprocedural changes to the law, including the UCMJ, we need the benefit \nof adequate review. We need to think before we act.\n  We have to prevent case disposition authority from being transferred \noutside the chain of command. It is a terrible idea to remove the \nauthority of commanders to dispose of the military justice offenses. If \ncommanders will be held responsible for abolishing sexual\n\n[[Page S3898]]\n\nassault, then they must have the tools they need.\n  Some propose establishing colonel-level JAGs--judge advocate \ngenerals--instead of commanders as disposition authorities who would \ndecide what cases should go to courts-martial. The awesome authority of \na commander is the foundation for discipline within the organization. \nThe most junior servicemember in the organization knows, under the \ncurrent law, their commander has the ability to decide if misconduct \nshould be disposed of through administrative measures, by nonjudicial \npunishment, or by a court-martial. Others within the command watch how \nthe commander deals with misconduct. All of this stuff doesn't happen \nin a vacuum. People are watching. Those individuals who are going to be \nunder the control and command and jurisdiction of a commander have to \nknow how they are doing it. If the commander is not allowed to exercise \nthat authority, it will destroy discipline within the command. When \ndiscipline declines, the military's ability to deflect threats declines \nwith it.\n  Another proposal would create two separate disciplinary systems: one \nin which commanders retain limited ability to dispose of minor, \nuniquely military offenses; another where a judge advocate, far removed \nfrom the commander, decides what offenses go to trial by court-martial. \nNow, how can two systems possibly be more efficient and effective than \none system in the hands of commanders who are fully vested in the \nwellness and the readiness of their commands?\n  Another proposal would revoke designation of certain senior officers \nwho are currently authorized by Federal law to convene general courts-\nmartial. This has broad implications beyond military justice. This \nwould require the services to revise literally hundreds of service \nregulations.\n  Another proposal that I think is worthy of careful review would \nestablish a special victims counsel. The proposal would assign an \nattorney to the victim of sexual assault to provide advice throughout \nthe process, from initial complaint of sexual assault through final \ndisposition. The Air Force has already developed a pilot program. We \nare doing it now. So I think the suggestion is good, but it is simply \nwhat we are currently doing. Wouldn't it be better to wait and get the \nresults of what the Air Force is doing in their program to determine \nwhether this is something we want to continue?\n  I am willing to consider appropriate changes to the UCMJ in a \nthoughtful bipartisan approach that is consistent with the longstanding \ntraditions of the Senate Committee on Armed Services. In the fiscal \nyear 2013 NDAA--the National Defense Authorization Act--we created an \nindependent panel to review the UCMJ and judicial proceedings of sexual \nassault cases. The panel is tasked with assessing the response systems \nused to investigate, prosecute, and adjudicate sexual assault and \nrelated offenses and to recommend how to improve effectiveness. The \ncommission has only just begun, and we must allow it the opportunity to \ndo what it was created to do. So we established this. It was just last \nJanuary when we established this, and they are busy doing what we have \nasked them to do.\n  Sexual assault cannot be abolished by legislation alone. While we \nshould not wait to provide additional tools that could make a \ndifference immediately, we have to be deliberate in making fundamental \nchanges that could undermine the UCMJ. I said we should do three \nthings, and this is the third thing.\n\n  The third thing is to preserve the integrity of the UCMJ as an \nintegrated, functional system of justice. Since 1951, the UCMJ has \nbacked up commanders' authority and their best leadership skills with \nthe force of law. The UCMJ is a deployable justice system that has \nproved to be effective throughout our Nation's conflicts.\n  Some believe military justice under the UCMJ and the Manual for \nCourts-Martial is an informal, undisciplined system. Nothing could be \nfurther from the truth. The UCMJ is a highly developed and codified \nlegal system. The Rules of Court Martial are the military counterpart \nto the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and provide detailed and \nstructured procedural rules. The Military Rules of Evidence are based \non the Federal Rules of Evidence.\n  The UCMJ has been at the forefront of changes in the civil criminal \njustice system. In fact, it has been ahead of the civil system. They \nare doing things in advance of what the civil system actually does.\n  A rights warning statement similar to the now-familiar Miranda \nwarnings was required by article 31 of the UCMJ a decade and a half \nbefore the Supreme Court decision of Miranda v. Arizona. The UCMJ was \noffering these protections long before the civil courts did--the same \nthing with article 38(b). It continued the 1948 Articles of War \nguarantee of qualified defense counsel--in other words, you get a \ndefense counsel--to be provided to all accused and at earlier stages \nthan required in civilian jurisdictions. So the military was providing \ncounsel long before the civil system was. Yet the U.S. Supreme Court \nonly guaranteed counsel to the poorest criminal defendants in 1963. \nAgain, UCMJ was way ahead of the game.\n  Our Nation has 238 years of investment in our military justice \nsystem, a system of Federal law, rules of procedure and evidence, and \ncase history interpreting those rules that form the foundation for one \nof the most comprehensive and sophisticated justice systems the world \nhas ever known.\n  The UCMJ is not static and unchanging. It has continuously been \nupdated. Article 146 of the UCMJ requires an annual comprehensive \nupdate. The Joint Service Committee reviews recommendations to modify \nthe UCMJ on a regular basis.\n  Some remain committed to yet another round of changes to the law and, \nin fact, the recently passed fiscal year 2013 NDAA included some 10 \nlegislative changes addressing sexual assault in the military.\n  The services need adequate time to implement recent legal changes \nthat give them the tools to fight these assaults. Stop and think about \nit. Just last January we gave 10 new rules for them to absorb and put \ninto play. They have not had time to do that yet. Yet we are talking \nabout having a meeting and putting together something that would be \nmaybe even contradicting what we have already told them to do.\n  Some would criticize our commanders and the entire military justice \nsystem because of a recent case in which a court-martial conviction was \nset aside. If we take time to look at the statistics, we will see \ncommanders have only set aside findings of guilty in about 1 percent of \nthe cases.\n  The Marine commanders only set aside findings in 7 out of 1,768 cases \nfrom 2010 to 2012. That is 0.4 percent of the cases--less than 1 \npercent.\n  The Air Force commanders only set aside findings in 40 of 3,713 cases \nover 5 years. That is 1 percent.\n  The Army commanders set aside findings in only 68 of 4,603 cases \nsince 2008.\n  The Navy says its commanders only set aside findings in 4 of the \n16,056 cases they have tried from 2002 to 2012. That is 0.0001 percent \nin a 10-year period.\n  Clearly, the commanders have been doing a good job. The Defense Legal \nPolicy Board released a subcommittee report on military justice in \ncombat zones just last week. This Defense Legal Policy Board was put \ntogether and they have experts to study this matter. We all agreed this \nwas a good move. They came out with their report last week. This is not \nsomething that might have happened 2 or 3 years ago. It happened just \nlast week.\n  The subcommittee began its work on July 30, 2012, to assess the \napplication of military justice in combat zones in Afghanistan and \nIraq. This report states, since the beginning of 2001, the Army \nconducted over 800 courts-martial in deployed environments, the Navy \nand Marine Corps conducted 8 courts-martial in Afghanistan and 34 in \nIraq, and the Air Force conducted 3 courts-martial in Iraq and 3 in \nAfghanistan.\n  The main theme of the Defense Legal Policy Board's subcommittee \nhearings and their 208-page report is the need for the joint commander \nto have a central role in the administration of justice in deployed \ntheaters of operations. This is the opposite of what some people are \nsaying now. They are saying take the commander out of it.\n  I am going to read this quote. This report came out just 1 week ago.\n\n       While good order and discipline is important and essential \n     in any military environment, it is especially vital in the \n     deployed\n\n[[Page S3899]]\n\n     environment. The military justice system is the definitive \n     commanders' tool to preserve good order and discipline, and \n     nowhere--I repeat--nowhere is this more important than in a \n     combat zone. A breakdown of good order and discipline while \n     deployed can have a devastating effect on mission \n     effectiveness.\n\n  Continuing to quote the report that came out last week:\n\n       The Joint Commander is ultimately responsible for the \n     conduct of his forces. As such the Subcommittee has \n     determined that the Joint Commander MUST have the authority \n     and apparatus necessary to preserve good order and discipline \n     through the military justice system.\n\n  Let me repeat the last line.\n\n       As such the Subcommittee--\n\n  The experts who were looking at this and came out with the report \nlast week--\n\n     has determined that the Joint Commander MUST have the \n     authority and apparatus necessary to preserve good order and \n     discipline through the military justice system.\n\n  The services can do better, and they will. But the record clearly \ndemonstrates these commanders take their responsibility very seriously, \nand we should continue to let them lead the men and women of our Armed \nForces into battle, bring them home safely, and to use all the tools in \nthe military justice system to enforce their authority.\n  At the very least, let's give the commanders a chance to implement \nthe changes we ordered them to make as recently as last January before \nwe go imposing more systems on them.\n  I know it is popular to do this and say we have all these sexual \nharassments and all that, but these figures speak for themselves. These \nare facts, and I think we cannot expect our people--our commanders in \nthe field, the ones who are responsible for the lives and deaths of the \ntroops they send into harm's way--to continue to spend all of their \ntime making these changes and not even have time to make the changes we \nordered them to do last January.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. King). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                         Tribute to Max Baucus\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in a few minutes Senators will cast votes on \ntwo amendments to the farm bill that is now pending before this body. \nBefore we do, I wish to take a minute to acknowledge that the senior \nSenator from Montana, Max Baucus, has cast more than 12,000 votes over \nthe past three decades in this institution, the Senate. This is a \nremarkable accomplishment, and it speaks to his dedication to the \nSenate and to the people of Montana.\n  He is a hard-working Senator. He learned the value of hard work on a \nranch outside of Helena, the capital, in the State of Montana. From the \ntime he was a boy, he was noted as being extremely smart. That is why \nhe was able to obtain both his bachelor's degree and his law degree \nfrom one of the most prestigious universities in the world, Stanford \nUniversity.\n  I have worked with him the many years I have been here in the Senate. \nI worked with him when he was chairman of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee during a massive highway bill. He has been a member of \nthe Agriculture Committee for many years.\n  His mark in this body, though, has been as a member of the Finance \nCommittee. He has done many things. He was involved over the course of \nthe 1982 bill that reformed the Tax Code significantly, called Bradley-\nGephardt. Max Baucus was in there working on what he thought was \nimportant to Montana and the country.\n  He became chairman of this very important committee, and he has been \ninstrumental in developing many massive pieces of legislation but \nnothing more significant than the months and months and months he spent \nmanaging the health reform bill, the ObamaCare bill. He has long been \nan advocate for children's health. He was an advocate for the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program and has fought to strengthen \nMedicare for seniors all over America and, of course, in his State of \nMontana.\n  As I mentioned, he served on the Agriculture Committee, the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, and the Joint Committee on \nTaxation. His legislative record is open for everyone to see. It is \nmassive, it is important, and he has done a remarkably good job.\n  The one thing Senator Baucus and I have spent a lot of time talking \nabout is running--not running for office but running with your feet. He \nis an avid runner. I used to feel and always felt pretty cocky that I \nhave run quite a few marathons, but they pale in comparison to the \nrunning Max Baucus has done. No. 1, he is faster than I am, and, No. 2, \nhe can run longer than I can. He has completed a 50-mile race in less \nthan 12 hours. That is remarkable, and he did that less than 10 years \nago. This is just one way Max has gone the distance. Anyone willing to \nspend half a day running must love the outdoors. I am speaking about \nhalf a day. That is 12 hours. This is especially true for Max, who \nenjoys hunting and fishing and has been an important advocate for \npublic lands in Montana and the Nation. He was the author of one the \nlargest conservation bills I know of in American history, except for \nperhaps some Alaska lands bills, which preserved more than 310,000 \nacres of forest land in northwestern Montana.\n  I congratulate Senator Baucus on reaching this impressive milestone \nof 12,000 votes and recognize the contributions he has made to this \ncountry are significant.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                    Remembering Frank r. Lautenberg\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, today I come to the floor shaken and \ndeeply saddened, as we all are, by the loss of our colleague, my good \nfriend and ally, the senior Senator from New Jersey, Senator Frank \nLautenberg. When I think of Senator Lautenberg, I think of the word \n``tenacity.'' Frank Lautenberg was tenacious. When he had a setback, he \nalways got right back into the game. He was as tenacious in life as he \nwas here in the Senate, where that tenacity paid off for the people of \nNew Jersey and for the Nation.\n  When he had a setback with cancer, he did not let himself take 1 \nminute more than he had to before he got back up and went right back at \nit. I will always remember his tenacity, a strength of will, and an \nunshakable resolve that helped him in his own life and in making life \nbetter for others.\n  Frank Lautenberg loved the Senate. He loved his job and the people \nwho elected him time and time again--five times, in fact; the longest \nserving Senator for the State of New Jersey--people he cared deeply \nabout: working families, seniors, single moms, and the hard-working \nfolks who trusted him always to be on their side, and he was. He was a \nman for New Jersey, a man for his time--one of the ``greatest \ngeneration,'' the last in the Senate to have served in World War II.\n\n  His story was a quintessential American story. His father Sam worked \nin the silk mills of Paterson, NJ. He sold coal, he farmed, and he once \nran a tavern. Frank lost his father to cancer when he was 19 and he \nlearned the lesson of hard work, having to take on a job nights and \nweekends until he graduated from Nutley High School, when he joined the \nArmy and went to Europe. When he came back, he went to Columbia \nUniversity on the GI bill, and he got a degree in economics. He \nunderstood the value of that opportunity given to him as a veteran and \nhe extended that forward when he later coauthored the new 21st century \nGI bill.\n  Anyone who knew Frank Lautenberg knew he was destined to make \nsomething of himself, and he did. He joined two of his boyhood friends \nto found a very successful business, ADP, and he did it well. But if \nlosing his father, working his way through high school, going to war, \nstarting a business and making a success of himself wasn't enough, \nFrank wanted to give something back. He was very comfortable in life \nand he could have said: I am going to enjoy this hard work and \nsacrifice that has brought me to this comfortable stage in life, but he \nconsidered himself lucky and he wanted to help others. That is why he \nran for office. It is why he served and it is why the people of New \nJersey kept electing him.\n  New Jerseyans loved and admired Frank for what he did for the Nation\n\n[[Page S3900]]\n\nand what he did to help them and every American build a better life for \nthemselves and their families. In death, those accomplishments and the \nlove and admiration New Jerseyans have always had for Frank Lautenberg \nwill not diminish, whether it was his landmark drunk driving law, \ncoauthoring the 21st century GI bill, or introducing the toxic right to \nknow law that empowered the public to know what pollutants were being \nreleased into their neighborhood, Frank gave something back to all of \nus.\n  We can talk about how hard he fought for the victims of Superstorm \nSandy this year. Even in illness he came back to the Senate to try to \nmake sure New Jerseyans and all those who suffered from Superstorm \nSandy were taken care of. Or we can talk about how he worked to make \nthe Paterson Great Falls--his hometown he loved so dearly--a national \npark. But above all, he was Mr. Transportation here in the Senate. \nWhether it was roads or bridges, airlines or the rail system, he \nbelieved in having the best and safest transportation system in the \nworld. And when it comes to air travel, he was way ahead of his time \nwhen it came to safety. Let's not forget it was Frank Lautenberg who \nended the dangers of smoking on airlines so none of us would be \nsubjected to sitting in a smoke-filled aircraft and with the dangers of \nsmoking on a plane. Today, when I took the Amtrak from Newark to Union \nStation, I thought through most of that ride of Frank. I remembered how \nmany times he came to this floor to fight for America's railways, how \nmuch he believed in the importance of rail travel and what it meant to \nkeeping this Nation's transportation system competitive.\n  Given all those accomplishments, it still would not adequately \nreflect the gift of governing he gave this Nation in the 9,000 votes he \ncast in this Chamber. Maybe not all of them made the headlines, but \nthey made a difference for every American family. With each of those \nvotes, Frank Lautenberg helped shape the history of America, and not \njust for his time but for all generations to come.\n  When I think of Frank I also certainly not only look back to the fact \nhe was part of that ``greatest generation'' of World War II veterans, \nbut I also think Frank may have left us too soon at the age of 89 \nbecause he never missed a beat. He lived in the moment. I remember \nabout 3 years ago, in January, he and his wife Bonnie celebrated his \n86th birthday in what some might say was an unusual way. Frank wanted \nto spend his birthday with his favorite singer. He was a fan of Lady \nGaga, and so to celebrate his birthday, he and Bonnie went to Radio \nCity Music Hall for Lady Gaga's Monster Ball Tour.\n  No, Frank was not yesterday's news. He was always about today's news, \nand he lived in the moment. But that moment is gone now. We remember \nwell, and we were lucky to share that moment with him. Time goes by all \ntoo quickly, but the memories last forever. His accomplishments will \nlast forever. They will touch the lives of people well beyond his \ndeath, and our image of what it means to learn to live, to learn, to \nearn, and then give something back will never be forgotten because it \nlives in Frank Lautenberg's legacy to this Chamber, this Nation, and to \nthe people of my home State.\n  There is a quote from the Old Testament, from Daniel, chapter 12, and \nit says:\n\n       Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall \n     awake . . . and the wise shall shine brightly like the \n     splendor of the firmament . . . And those who lead the many \n     to justice shall be like the stars forever.\n\n  Frank Lautenberg stood for justice in all of its forms for every \nAmerican every day he served in this Chamber, and his memory shall be \nlike a constellation showing us the way.\n  Today we say: Thank you, Senator Lautenberg, for a life well lived \nand a job well done. Thank you, on behalf of a grateful State and \nNation.\n  Our deepest thoughts and prayers are with his wife Bonnie and his \nentire family. I know we will miss him as they will miss him, as the \nNation will miss his incredible work.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT OFFICER (Mr. Cowan). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 987\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to temporarily set \naside the pending amendment so that I may call up my amendment No. 987, \nwhich is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Moran] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 987.\n\n  Mr. MORAN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To require the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation to carry \n  out research and development regarding a crop insurance program for \n                                alfalfa)\n\n       After section 11024, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 110__. ALFALFA CROP INSURANCE POLICY.\n\n       Section 522(c) of the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. \n     1522(c)) (as amended by section 11024) is amended by adding \n     at the end the following:\n       ``(25) Alfalfa crop insurance policy.--\n       ``(A) In general.--The Corporation shall offer to enter \n     into 1 or more contracts with qualified entities to carry out \n     research and development regarding a policy to insure \n     alfalfa.\n       ``(B) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this paragraph, the Corporation shall submit to \n     the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives \n     and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of \n     the Senate a report that describes the results of the study \n     conducted under subparagraph (A).''.\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I was on the floor earlier today describing \nthis amendment, and I will do so very briefly.\n  This is an amendment to the farm bill that deals with a crop called \nalfalfa, one that is grown and produced in most States but often not \nknown a lot about, as we discovered in this farm bill discussion. What \nwe know about this crop is that it is very important and used in many \nways--to feed cattle and produce milk by feeding dairy cattle--and so \nit is a very important component in the livestock industry and valuable \nas feed for both cattle for meat consumption and cattle for dairy \nconsumption.\n  There is a real challenge in getting crop insurance available for \nthis crop. So this amendment would require the Federal Crop Insurance \nCorporation to conduct research and development regarding an insurance \npolicy to insure alfalfa and then provide us with a report from the \nresults of that study. There is no cost to the taxpayer. As I \nunderstand, this is a noncontroversial amendment.\n  I see the chairperson of the committee is on the Senate floor, and I \nwould be happy to yield to her.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment. The \nMoran amendment follows the philosophy of this farm bill of moving from \ndirect subsidies to crop insurance. It is an important crop, and it is \nimportant to make sure that we do have crop insurance tailored to \nalfalfa growers.\n  I urge colleagues to support the amendment, and I ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I was unable to attend this roll \ncall vote. Had I been present, I would have voted yea on the Moran \namendment No. 974 to require the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation to \ncarry out research and development regarding a crop insurance program \nfor alfalfa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1079\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Coons and Senator \nJohanns--I am not sure if Senator Johanns is here--I wish to call up \namendment No. 1079 on their behalf. We intend to take this by voice \nvote this evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Ms. Stabenow], for Mr. Coons and \n     Mr. Johanns, proposes an amendment numbered 1079.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To modify a provision relating to funding of local and \n                regional food aid procurement projects)\n\n       On page 339, line 13, strike ``$40,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$60,000,000''.\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, this simply increases the authorization \nfor the local and regional procurement program from $40 million per \nyear to $60 million per year. It is based on a pilot project from the \nlast farm bill to test various options on food aid for hungry \npopulations, how to do it faster and more efficiently.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 1079 offered by the Senator from Delaware, Mr. Coons.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I would simply say that this is an \namendment we are happy to accept on behalf of Senator Coons, Senator \nJohanns, Senator Durbin, Senator Isakson, and Senator Leahy. It would \nmodestly increase the authorization for the local and regional food \nprocurement program. I ask that we accept it on a voice vote.\n  I yield back the remaining time on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. The question is on \nagreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1079) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask that I be recorded as voting no on \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Have we completed the vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I see colleagues who wish to speak. I \nwish to thank colleagues for their diligence as we work through \namendments on the farm bill. Our goal is to complete this by the end of \nthe week. It is important that we complete this jobs bill. Sixteen \nmillion people work in agriculture and are depending on it, and they \nare depending on us to get it right, as we did a year ago. So I look \nforward to working with colleagues as we continue to work through the \namendment process. I appreciate everybody's hard work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                Honoring Joel Campora and Cody Carpenter\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, Members of the Senate often come to the \nfloor and talk about our men and women in uniform and their incredible \nbravery and the sacrifice they make for our country, and that is true. \nWe certainly honor them and appreciate them for all they do for our \ncountry as they serve us overseas. However, there are other men and \nwomen in uniform who also serve our country by serving our citizens in \nour communities, and those are our policemen and policewomen and others \nin law enforcement as well as first responders and others who wear a \nuniform as well.\n  I rise today to honor two heroes from Arkansas. Last week we lost a \nsheriff and a game warden who were trying to help victims of a flood in \nour State. These two first responders answered the call when there was \nan emergency, a dire situation. They jumped in their vehicles and \nheaded to the danger. They got into a boat, and they went to a home of \nsome victims who were stranded and very much in danger by the \nfloodwaters. Unfortunately, all four lost their lives in this terrible \nincident in Arkansas.\n  Arkansas game and fish wildlife officer Joel Campora and sheriff Cody \nCarpenter of Scott County both drowned while assisting victims in this \novernight flash flood near Y City, AR. In times of distress such as \nthese, we should come together to help others, which is exactly what \nthey were doing as they sacrificed their lives for others. They put \nothers' needs ahead of their own because of their sense of duty and \nhonor and their belief in helping their fellow man.\n  In closing, I wish to commend these men and offer condolences to \ntheir families for their sacrifice.\n  I yield to my colleague from Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I also wish to take a pause. It seems as \nthough for the last several weeks on a very regular basis storms have \nbeen ravaging the country and different events have been occurring \nwhere we have had cause to pause, and certainly this tragedy that \nstruck Arkansas is one. So we would like for our colleagues to keep in \ntheir thoughts and prayers those in western Arkansas who have suffered \nthis flood.\n  As the Senator from Arkansas said, six people lost their lives to the \nterrible storm that brought significant flooding to western Arkansas \nlate last week. Scott County sheriff Cody Carpenter and wildlife \nofficer Joel Campora, two dedicated public servants, were among them. \nThey gave their lives while responding to a 9-1-1 call at a home in Y \nCity. The two arrived at a home to help two female victims trapped by \nthe flooding. While they were there, the house exploded, killing all \nfour of them. Additionally, a Grant County man was killed when a tree \nfell on him as a result of the storm.\n  These are people who are true heroes not because of the way they died \nbut because of the way they lived their lives.\n  Sheriff Carpenter was a leader who was never content to sit behind \nthe desk. He bravely put the safety of others before his own to protect \nthose in harm's way. He rose from a dispatcher to deputy, chief deputy, \nand then finally sheriff. He was a man of faith who loved life, loved \nhis family, loved his job, and loved the Lord.\n  Officer Campora began his law enforcement career in Mena, AR. In 2007 \nhe became a wildlife officer for the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission. \nHis desire to serve led him down this career path, but it also led him \nto serve\n\n[[Page S3902]]\n\nas a volunteer youth minister for the Salem Baptist Church and Pencil \nBluff First Baptist Church.\n  Again, these were ordinary people doing extraordinary deeds.\n  Sheriff Carpenter left behind his wife Aime Beth and four children: \nGarren, Christian, Douglas, and Irelynn. Officer Campora left behind \nhis wife Rebecca and two daughters: Dacie and Bethany.\n  Again, we would very much like everyone to remember these families \nand keep them in their thoughts and prayers as time goes on.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING FRANK R. LAUTENBERG\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the floor this evening with a \nvery sad heart to speak about one of our colleagues here in the Senate \nwho gave tremendous service to his country and sadly passed away last \nnight.\n  Senator Frank Lautenberg was a true American. He earned a lot \nthroughout his lifetime, but he came here to the Senate floor to fight \nfor all of those people who didn't have the ability to fight for \nthemselves. He was here in the Senate with us just a few weeks ago even \nthough he himself was battling an extremely difficult illness.\n  I think of Frank Lautenberg as a man of tremendous determination, an \nawful lot of grit, and someone who really embodies the term ``happy \nwarrior.'' He wanted to be here to fight for those who didn't have what \nhe did. Throughout his career, that is exactly what he did.\n  Frank lived the American dream. He was the son of poor immigrants, \nand he rose to become a chief executive of a business that employed \nthousands of people around the world. He personally did very well, but \nhe was never satisfied with just his own personal success. He \nunderstood, as so many other great Americans, that his success was \nbased on the opportunities this country afforded him. So he chose over \nthree decades to give back and to fight for people to make sure they \nhad the opportunities he had.\n  He started his career in the Senate back in 1982. As many of us who \nserved with him know, he decided to retire, but he was not happy in \nretirement. He wanted to be here doing what he loved--being a Senator \nand fighting for the people of his home State of New Jersey and \nfighting for Americans all over to have the opportunities I just spoke \nabout. He made it his mission to make sure the ladders that were there \nfor him were there for the generations that came behind him.\n  He was a proud World War II veteran--in fact, the last this body will \nknow. He fought for the post-9/11 GI bill because, as did my dad, who \nwas also a World War II veteran, he had used the GI bill after World \nWar II. He knew it was the key to unlocking the knowledge that powered \nthe ``greatest generation.'' He wanted that for those who came behind \nhim.\n  His desire to stand for the powerless is also why he championed \nlegislation to protect families from gun violence, why he stood to \nsafeguard families against dangerous chemicals time and time again, and \nwhy he took on the powerful to ban smoking on airplanes and to bring \nabout tougher drunk driving protections.\n  I personally will always remember Frank's passion for transportation. \nHe chaired the Transportation and Housing and Urban Development \nAppropriations Subcommittee before I did, and I spent many years \nworking with him to make sure we funded the infrastructure of this \ncountry--rail, highway, airline safety issues.\n  Frank's legacy really is that his direct work saved lives. He saved \nlives. He helped to build transportation networks that brought \nfamilies, businesses, and communities together. He wanted a better life \nfor families in America. He was a champion for the underserved and \nunderrepresented.\n  How many times have I been on the floor feeling like a lonely voice--\nfighting for women's health care issues or fighting for the protection \nof families against hazardous chemicals or fighting for victims of \ndomestic violence--and time and time again Frank Lautenberg would come \nover here to stand beside and fight with me, no matter what the time of \nday or the late hour of the night, because that was his passion and his \ncause.\n  He was a passionate public servant. He was not afraid to fight and \nvote for what he believed. He could never understand anyone who came \nhere and tried to figure out which way the winds were blowing in order \nto take a vote. Frank came and was passionate about whom he cared for, \nand he did not care about the political consequences. He wanted to \nfight for the underserved.\n  He loved the Senate. In fact, he loved it so much that one tour of \nduty was not enough and service called him back, as I said. Up until \njust a few days ago, nothing could stop Frank from taking Amtrak down \nhere to fight for the issues he believed in and the people of New \nJersey whom he represented so well.\n  Frank Lautenberg gave everything he had to public service, and those \nwho served with him, as I was so fortunate to do, know it gave him all \nthe satisfaction in the world.\n  He is going to be missed by all of us. He will be missed for his \ndetermination, for his passion, for always caring, and for fighting for \nwhat was right for all the people in this country.\n  I just wish to say tonight that my thoughts and prayers are with \nBonnie and all of his family as they struggle with this loss but to \nknow that his legacy lives on in the safety and caring of so many \nfamilies in this country for whom he worked so passionately and hard.\n  Thank you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/03/senate-section/article/S3902-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3902]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Ms. STABENOW.

Mr. President. I rise today to commemorate the 300th \nanniversary of the town of Berwick, ME. As the ninth incorporated town \nin Maine, Berwick holds a very special place in our State's history, \nand one that exemplifies the determination and resiliency of Maine \npeople.\n  While this landmark anniversary marks Berwick's incorporation, the \nyear 1713 was but one milestone in a long journey of progress. It is a \njourney that began thousands of years earlier with Native American \nvillages on the banks of the Piscataqua and Salmon Falls Rivers. In \n1631, barely a decade after the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock, \nAmbrose Gibbens established a settlement at Quampeagan Falls and built \nthe first sawmill in North America. That manufacturing heritage has \nremained strong in the three communities known today as The Berwicks, \nfrom the textile and iron works of the 18th century to the cutting-edge \nbiotechnology and aerospace industries of today.\n  Industry is only part of Berwick's story. During the Revolutionary \nWar, the town provided two full companies to fight for America's \nindependence, more than many towns of greater size. The courage and \ncharacter demonstrated by the townspeople in standing for liberty echo \nthroughout Berwick's history. In the years before the Civil War, the \nmany churches in town were powerful voices for the abolition of \nslavery. During that terrible conflict, more than 200 of Berwick's \nyoung men fought, and many died, so that all might live in freedom. The \ntown's honor roll of current military personnel demonstrates an ongoing \ncommitment to our Nation's founding principles.\n  This anniversary is not just about something that is measured in \ncalendar years. It is about human accomplishment. We celebrate the \npeople who, for more than three centuries, have pulled together, cared \nfor one another, and built a great community that is a wonderful place \nto live, work, and raise families. Thanks to those who came before, \nBerwick has a wonderful history.\n\n[[Page S3903]]\n\nThanks to those who are here today, it has a bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/03/senate-section/article/S3903-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3903]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO TERRY SCHOW\n\n Mr. LEE. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Terry Schow \nfor his exemplary work in behalf of Veterans in the State of Utah.\n  Mr. Schow has provided a strong voice and steady hand in fighting for \nthe critical services our veterans need and deserve. Three Utah \nGovernors recognized and tapped into his tremendous talent and \nunchallenged commitment to our veterans. He was appointed as Director \nof the Utah Division of Veterans Affairs in October 2001 by Governor \nMichael O. Leavitt. Governor Jon M. Huntsman Jr. then appointed Mr. \nSchow as Executive Director of the Utah Department of Veterans Affairs \nand Governor W. Herbert named him to the same post.\n  Terry Schow is a U.S. Army Veteran who served in the 5th and 10th \nSpecial Forces Groups and the 25th Infantry Division. He also served a \ntour of duty in Southeast Asia.\n  Mr. Schow has demonstrated through his long years of service what it \nmeans to honor the promises we make as a country to those who stand in \nharms way defending our freedom. He paid special attention to our \nveterans who suffer from mental and emotional challenges and the \ntroubling trend of suicide among veterans. Terry Schow worked \ntirelessly to ensure we never lose a member of the military whether on \nthe battlefield or long after they have left active duty.\n  Terry Schow's efforts have improved the quality of life for countless \nUtah veterans through increased access to critical care and specialized \nservices. I thank Mr. Terry Schow for his extraordinary impact on our \nveterans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/03/senate-section/article/S3903-2", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3903]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DAVID McCULLEN\n\n Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, today I wish to honor David \nMcCullen, a veteran of the war in Vietnam. David, on behalf of all \nMontanans and all Americans, I stand to say thank you for your service \nto this Nation. It is my honor to share the story of David's service \nbecause no story of heroism should ever go unrecognized.\n  David was born in Miles City, MT, in February of 1949. Soon after, \nhis family moved to California, where he attended Asuza High School \nnear Los Angeles. While in high school, David was a wrestler, lettering \nin the sport his senior year. After graduating from high school, David \njoined the famed 101st Airborne Division--known as the Screaming \nEagles--and began training at Fort Ord.\n  David then attended advanced individual training at Fort Gordon and \njump school at Fort Benning--both in Georgia.\n  On May 8, 1969, David left for Vietnam. Just 2 days later, David's \nregiment was assigned to Operation Apache Snow and took part in the \nmission that became known as the Battle of Hamburger Hill. This hard-\nfought offensive became the basis for several movies and books about \nthe Vietnam war. For over a week, American forces attempted to take \nHill 937. Seventy-two American soldiers were killed in the battle, and \nmore than 300 were wounded. For its heroism, David's battalion was \nawarded the Presidential Unit Citation.\n  After a 2-year tour in the military, David returned to California, \nliving there and in Iowa for many years. David moved back home to Miles \nCity in 2000.\n  Today, in our presence, it is my honor to present David with his \nPresidential Unit Citation; Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross Unit \nCitation with Palm Device and Republic of Vietnam Civil Actions Honor \nMedal Unit Citation, First Class. These decorations are small tokens, \nbut they are powerful symbols of true heroism, sacrifice, and \ndedication to service. These medals are presented on behalf of a \ngrateful nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/03/senate-section/article/S3903-3", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3903]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/03/senate-section/article/S3903-4", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3903]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/03/senate-section/article/S3903-5", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3903-S3905]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     REPORT RELATIVE TO THE ISSUANCE OF AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO TAKE \n  ADDITIONAL STEPS WITH RESPECT TO THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY ORIGINALLY \n  DECLARED ON MARCH 15, 1995 IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 12957 WITH RESPECT TO \n                              IRAN--PM 11\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 \nU.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), I hereby report that I have issued an \nExecutive Order (the ``order'') that takes additional steps with \nrespect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12957 of \nMarch 15, 1995, and implements certain statutory requirements of the \nIran Freedom and Counter-Proliferation Act of 2012 (subtitle D of title \nXII of Public Law 112-239) (22 U.S.C. 8801 et seq.) (IFCA), which \namends the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment \nAct of 2010 (Public Law 111-195) (22 U.S.C. 8501 et seq.) (CISADA).\n  In Executive Order 12957, the President found that the actions and \npolicies of the Government of Iran threaten the national security, \nforeign policy, and economy of the United States. To deal with that \nthreat, the President declared a national emergency and imposed \nprohibitions on certain transactions with respect to the development of \nIranian petroleum resources. To further respond to that threat, \nExecutive Order 12959 of May 6, 1995, imposed comprehensive trade and \nfinancial sanctions on Iran. Executive Order 13059 of August 19, 1997, \nconsolidated and clarified the previous orders. To take additional \nsteps with respect to the national emergency declared in Executive \nOrder 12957 and to implement section 105(a) of CISADA, I issued \nExecutive Order 13553 on September 28, 2010, to impose sanction on \nofficials of the Government of Iran and other persons acting on behalf \nof the Government of Iran determined to be responsible for or complicit \nin certain serious human rights abuses.\n  To take additional steps with respect to the threat posed by Iran and \nto provide implementing authority for a number of the sanctions set \nforth in the Iran Sanctions Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-172) (50 U.S.C. \n1701 note) (ISA) as amended by CISADA, I issued Executive Order 13574 \non May 23, 2011, to authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to \nimplement certain sanctions imposed by the Secretary of State pursuant \nto ISA, as amended by CISADA. I also issued Executive Order 13590 on \nNovember 20, 2011, to take additional steps with respect to this \nemergency by authorizing the Secretary of State to impose sanctions on \npersons providing certain goods, services, technology, or support that \ncontribute either to Iran's development of petroleum resources or to \nIran's production of petrochemicals, and to authorize the Secretary of \nthe Treasury to implement some of those sanctions. On February 5, 2012, \nin order to take further steps pursuant to this emergency, and to \nimplement section 1245(c) of the National Defense Authorization Act for \nFiscal Year 2012 (Public Law 112-81) (22 U.S.C. 8513a), I issued \nExecutive Order 13599 blocking the property of the Government of Iran, \nall Iranian financial institutions, and persons determined to be owned \nor controlled by, or acting for or on behalf of, such parties. On April \n22, 2012, and May 1, 2012, I issued Executive Orders 13606 and 13608, \nrespectively. Executive Orders 13606 and 13608 each take additional \nsteps with respect to various emergencies, including the emergency \ndeclared in Executive Order 12957 concerning Iran, to address the\n\n[[Page S3904]]\n\nuse of computer and information technology to commit serious human \nrights abuses and efforts by foreign persons to evade sanctions.\n  To take additional steps with respect to the national emergency \ndeclared in Executive Order 12957, I issued Executive Order 13622 of \nJuly 30, 2012, imposing further sanctions in light of the Government of \nIran's use of revenues from petroleum, petroleum products, and \npetrochemicals for illicit purposes; Iran's continued attempts to evade \ninternational sanctions through deceptive practices; and the \nunacceptable risk posed to the international financial system by Iran's \nactivities.\n  Most recently, I issued Executive Order 13628 of October 9, 2012, to \ntake additional steps with respect to the national emergency declared \nin Executive Order 12957 and to implement certain statutory \nrequirements of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of \n2012 (Public Law 112-158) (22 U.S.C. 8701 et seq.) (TRA), including its \namendments to the statutory requirements of ISA and CISADA.\n  With respect to the order that I have just issued, section 1 of the \norder authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with \nthe Secretary of State, to impose financial sanctions on or to block \nall property and interests in property that are in the United States, \nthat come within the United States, or that are or come within the \npossession or control of any United States person (including any \nforeign branch) of a foreign financial institution determined to have, \non or after the effective date of the order:\n\n       knowingly conducted or facilitated any significant \n     transaction related to the purchase or sale of Iranian rials \n     or a derivative, swap, future, forward, or other similar \n     contract whose value is based on the exchange rate of the \n     Iranian rial; or\n       maintained significant funds or accounts outside the \n     territory of Iran denominated in the Iranian rial.\n\n  Section 2 of the order authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, in \nconsultation with the Secretary of State, to block all property and \ninterests in property that are in the United States, that come within \nthe United States, or that are or come within the possession or contro1 \nof any United States person (including any foreign branch) of any \nperson upon determining:\n\n       that the person has materially assisted, sponsored, or \n     provided financial, material, or technological support for, \n     or goods or services to or in support of, any Iranian person \n     included on the list of Specially Designated Nationals and \n     Blocked Persons maintained by the Office of Foreign Assets \n     Control (SDN List) (other than an Iranian depository \n     institution whose property and interests in property are \n     blocked solely pursuant to Executive Order 13599) or any \n     other person included on the SDN List whose property and \n     interests in property are blocked pursuant to this paragraph \n     or Executive Order 13599 (other than an Iranian depository \n     institution whose property and interests in property are \n     blocked solely pursuant to Executive Order l3599); or\n       pursuant to authority delegated by the President and in \n     accordance with the terms of such delegation, that sanctions \n     shall be imposed on such person pursuant to section \n     1244(c)(1)(A) of IFCA.\n\n  Section 3 of the order authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, in \nconsultation with the Secretary of State, to impose financial sanctions \non a foreign financial institution determined to have knowingly \nconducted or facilitated any significant financial transaction:\n\n       on behalf of any Iranian person included on the SDN List \n     (other than an Iranian depository institution whose property \n     and interests in property are blocked solely pursuant to \n     Executive Order 13599) or any other person included on the \n     SDN List whose property and interests in property are blocked \n     pursuant to subsection 2(a)(i) of the order or Executive \n     Order 13599 (other than an Iranian depository institution \n     whose property and interests in property are blocked solely \n     pursuant to Executive Order 13599); or\n       on or after the effective date of the order, for the sale, \n     supply, or transfer to Iran of significant goods or services \n     used in connection with the automotive sector of Iran.\n\n  Section 5 of the order authorizes the Secretary of State, in \nconsultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of \nCommerce, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the United States \nTrade Representative, and with the President of the Export-Import Bank, \nthe Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, \nand other agencies and officials as appropriate, to impose sanctions on \na person upon determining that the person:\n\n       on or after the effective date of the order, knowingly \n     engaged in a significant transaction for the sale, supply, or \n     transfer to Iran of significant goods or services used in \n     connection with the automotive sector of Iran;\n       is a successor entity to a person determined to meet that \n     criterion;\n       owns or controls a person determined to meet that \n     criterion, and had knowledge that the person engaged in the \n     activities referred to therein; or\n       is owned or controlled by, or under common ownership or \n     control with, a person determined to meet that criterion, and \n     knowingly participated in the activities therein.\n\n  Sections 6 and 7 of the order provide that, for persons determined to \nmeet any of these criteria, the heads of the relevant agencies, in \nconsultation with the Secretary of State, shall implement the sanctions \nimposed by the Secretary of State. Those sanctions may include the \nfollowing actions:\n\n       the Board of Directors of the Export-Import Bank shall deny \n     approval of the issuance of any guarantee, insurance, \n     extension of credit, or participation in an extension of \n     credit in connection with the export of any goods or services \n     to the sanctioned person;\n       agencies shall not issue any specific license or grant any \n     other specific permission or authority under any statute that \n     requires the prior review and approval of the United State \n     Government as a condition for the export or reexport of goods \n     or technology to the sanctioned person;\n       for a sanctioned person that is a financial institution: \n     the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve \n     System and the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New \n     York shall take such actions as they deem appropriate, \n     including denying designation, or terminating the \n     continuation of any prior designation of, the sanctioned \n     person as a primary dealer in United States Government debt \n     instruments; or agencies shall prevent the sanctioned person \n     from serving as an agent of the United States Government or \n     serving as a repository for United States Government funds;\n       agencies shall not procure, or enter into a contract for \n     the procurement of, any goods or services from the sanctioned \n     person;\n       the Secretary of State shall deny a visa to, and the \n     Secretary of Homeland Security shall exclude from the United \n     States, any alien that the Secretary of State determines is a \n     corporate officer or principal of, or a shareholder with a \n     controlling interest in, a sanctioned person;\n       the heads of the relevant agencies, as appropriate, shall \n     impose on the principal executive officer or officers, or \n     persons performing similar functions and with similar \n     authorities, of a sanctioned person any of the sanctions \n     described above, as selected by the Secretary of State;\n       the Secretary of the Treasury shall take actions where \n     necessary to:\n       prohibit any United States financial institution from \n     making loans or providing credits to the sanctioned person \n     totaling more than $10,000,000 in any 12-month period, unless \n     such person is engaged in activities to relieve human \n     suffering and the loans or credits are provided for such \n     activities;\n       prohibit any transactions in foreign exchange that are \n     subject to the jurisdiction of the United States and in which \n     the sanctioned person has any interest;\n       prohibit any transfers of credit or payments between \n     financial institutions or by, through, or to any financial \n     institution, to the extent that such transfers or payments \n     are subject to the jurisdiction of the United States and \n     involve any interest of the sanctioned person;\n       block all property and interests in property that are the \n     in the United States, that come within the United States, or \n     that are or come within the possession or control of any \n     United States person, (including any foreign branch) of the \n     sanctioned person, and provide that such property and \n     interests in property may not be transferred, paid, exported, \n     withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in;\n       prohibit any United States person from investing in or \n     purchasing significant amounts of equity or debt instruments \n     of a sanctioned person;\n       restrict or prohibit imports of goods, technology, or \n     services, directly or indirectly, into the United States from \n     the sanctioned person; or\n       impose on the principal executive officer or officers, or \n     persons performing similar functions and with similar \n     authorities, of a sanctioned person any of the sanctions \n     described above, as appropriate.\n\n  Section 7 of the order also provides that, when the Secretary of \nState or the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to authority delegated \nby the President and in accordance with the terms of such delegation, \nhas determined that sanctions shall be imposed on a person pursuant to \nsection 1244(d)(1)(A), 1245(a)(1), or 1246(a)(1) of IFCA (including in \neach case as informed by section 1253(c)(2) of IFCA), such Secretary \nmay select one or more of the sanctions described above for which the \nSecretary of the Treasury shall take such action, and the Secretary of \nthe Treasury shall take actions where necessary to implement those \nsanctions.\n  Sections 8 and 11 of the order implement the statutory requirements \nof\n\n[[Page S3905]]\n\nCISADA, as amended by sanction 1249 of IFCA.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \ntax incentives for small businesses; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to speak about legislation, the \nSmall Business Tax Certainty and Growth Act of 2013, which I introduced \ntoday along with my friend and colleague, Senator Casey.\n  Small businesses are our Nation's job creators. Firms with fewer than \n500 employees generate about 50 percent of our Nation's GDP, account \nfor more than 99 percent of employers and employ nearly half of all \nworkers. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, firms with fewer \nthan 500 employees accounted for 65 percent of the new jobs created \nfrom 1993 to 2009.\n  Even the smallest firms have a huge effect on our economy. Small \nBusiness Administration data indicate that businesses with fewer than \n20 employees accounted for 18 percent of all private sector jobs in \n2010.\n  The Small Business Tax Certainty and Growth Act of 2013 allows small \nbusinesses to plan for capital investments that are vital to expansion \nand job creation. Our bill eases complex accounting rules for the \nsmallest businesses, and it reduces the tax burden on newly formed \nventures.\n  Recent studies by the National Federation of Independent Business, \nNFIB, indicate that taxes are the number one concern of small business \nowners, and that constant change in the tax code is among their chief \nconcerns. A key feature of this bill is that it provides the certainty \nsmall businesses need to create and implement long-term capital \ninvestment plans, which are vital to growth. For example, section 179 \nof the Internal Revenue Code allows small businesses to deduct the cost \nof acquired assets more rapidly. The amount of the maximum allowable \ndeduction has changed three times in the past 6 years, and is usually \naddressed as a year-end ``extender,'' making this tax benefit \nunpredictable from year to year, and therefore difficult for small \nbusinesses to take full advantage of in their long-range planning. Our \nbill permanently sets the maximum allowable deduction under section 179 \nat $250,000, indexed for inflation, and ensures that only small \nbusinesses can take advantage of the benefit because it phases out as \nacquisitions exceed $800,000.\n  The Small Business Tax Certainty and Growth Act of 2013 also allows \nmore companies to use the intuitive cash method of accounting by \npermanently doubling the threshold at which the more complex accrual \nmethod is required, from $5 million in gross receipts to $10 million. \nThis includes an expansion in the ability of small businesses to use \nsimplified methods of accounting for inventories.\n  The bill also eases the tax burden on new businesses by permanently \ndoubling the deduction for start-up expenses from $5,000 to $10,000. \nLike section 179, this benefit is limited to small businesses, and the \ndeduction phases out for expenses exceeding $60,000.\n  The Small Business Tax Certainty and Growth Act of 2013 extends for \none year provisions which provide benefits to businesses large and \nsmall--so-called ``bonus depreciation'' and 15- year depreciation for \nimprovements with respect to restaurants, retail facilities, and \nleaseholds. Although permanence is important, I believe that tax \nprovisions that affect businesses of all sizes should be debated and \naddressed in the context of comprehensive, pro-growth tax reform, which \nI urge the Senate to undertake.\n  The provisions in the Small Business Tax Certainty and Growth Act of \n2013 would make a real difference in our Nation's small businesses' \nability to survive and thrive. I recently spoke with Rob Tod, the \nfounder of Allagash Brewing Company, which is based in Portland, ME. \nAllagash makes some of the best craft beer in the country. It started \nas a one-man operation in 1995. In the 18 years since, it has grown \ninto a firm that employs approximately 65 people and distributes craft \nbeer throughout the United States. Rob noted that his company's \nexpansion was fueled in part by bonus depreciation and section 179 \nexpensing. New to the craft beer business, Rob had difficulty obtaining \nfinancing on favorable terms. But these cost recovery provisions \nallowed Rob to pay less in taxes in the years he acquired the equipment \nneeded to expand his business. Those tax savings were then reinvested \nin his business, thus creating jobs. This economic benefit is \nmultiplied when you consider the effect of Allagash's investment on the \nequipment manufacturers, the transportation companies needed to haul \nnew equipment to his brewery, the increased inventory in his brewery, \nand the suppliers of the materials needed to brew additional beer.\n  In light of the positive effects this bill would have on small \nbusinesses and our economy, I urge my colleagues to support the Small \nBusiness Tax Certainty and Growth Act of 2013. This bill has been \nendorsed by the NFIB, an important voice for small business.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            National Federation of\n\n\n                                         Independent Business,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 3, 2013.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the National Federation \n     of Independent Business (NFIB), the nation's leading small \n     business advocacy organization, I am writing in support of \n     the Small Business Tax Certainty and Growth Act of 2013, \n     which provides permanency and certainty to small businesses \n     regarding several tax provisions including Section 179, cash \n     accounting, and deductions for startup and organizational \n     expenses.\n       The most important source of financing for small business \n     is their earnings, i.e. cash flow, which is closely tied to a \n     small business' overall tax burden. In NFIB Research \n     Foundation's Problems and Priorities, five of the top ten \n     small business concerns are tax related. The preservation of \n     cash flow is a key element for small businesses as Congress \n     considers comprehensive tax reform.\n       Cost recovery for capital investments is closely tied to a \n     small business' effective tax rate and its ability to manage \n     cash flow. Section 179 expensing--especially with the \n     inclusion of real property--provides small businesses with an \n     immediate source of capital recovery and improved cash flow. \n     We appreciate you including this in your legislation. \n     Additionally, small businesses would benefit from an expanded \n     ability to use cash accounting for tax purposes. Permitting \n     more business entities with higher gross receipts to use cash \n     accounting helps small businesses to manage cash flow because \n     it better reflects the business owner's ability to pay taxes. \n     We appreciate you including both of these provisions in your \n     bill.\n       Thank you for introducing this important legislation, and \n     we look forward to working with you to provide for permanent \n     small business tax incentives as the 113th Congress moves \n     forward.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Susan Eckerly,\n\n                                            Senior Vice President,\n                                                    Public Policy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MIKULSKI (for herself, Mr. Burr, Mr. Harkin, and Mr. \n        Alexander):\n  S. 1086. A bill to reauthorize and improve the Child Care and \nDevelopment Block Grant Act of 1990, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Child Care \nand Development Block Grant Act of 2013, along with Senators Burr, \nHarkin, and Alexander.\n  For the past year, our offices have worked on a bipartisan basis to \ndraft a comprehensive reauthorization of the Child Care Development \nBlock Grant, CCDBG, a program that helps low- and moderate-income \nworking families access and afford child care. This program helps \nworking parents keep working, it helps parents who are in school stay \nin school, and it is supposed to ensure that children are in safe \nenvironments that support their physical,\n\n[[Page S3909]]\n\nemotional, and cognitive development. It is a vital program and its \nreauthorization is of the utmost importance.\n  We did not draft this reauthorization in a vacuum. We held three \npublic hearings in the Subcommittee on Children and Families, and we \nworked closely with all members, Democrat and Republican, of the Senate \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. We also asked for \ninput and recommendations from folks on the ground since we know that \nparents, child care providers, and early learning and developmental \nexperts, know best how this program works and how it can be improved. \nIt is my hope that the bill we're introducing today represents all of \nthe good ideas that have been brought to us throughout this process.\n  It is noteworthy that the CCDBG program has not been reauthorized \nsince 1996. The last time we reauthorized CCDBG was during welfare \nreform. At that time, the program was envisioned solely as a workforce \naid--something to help moms and dads get back to work or school. This \nwas, and remains, an important goal, but we have learned a lot since \n1996. We know that child care can, and should, be constructed in such a \nway that benefits both the parent and the child: it should allow \nparents to go to work or school, but it should also give kids the \nbuilding blocks to be successful in their lives.\n  What we know today, that we didn't 17 years ago, is that the most \nrapid period of development for the brain happens in the first 5 years \nof life. That is why it is so imperative that we ensure our children \nare in high-quality child care programs. While important, it is not \nenough to simply ensure that kids have someplace to go. We must also \nensure that they go someplace that is safe, that nurtures their \ndevelopment, that challenges their mind, and that prepares them for \nschool.\n  The current program is outdated. It does not go far enough in \npromoting and supporting high-quality child care programs. It does not \ndo enough to safeguard the health and safety of children. It does not \nalways ensure that children have continuity of care, nor does it \nprovide sufficient protections for working families when their \nemployment situations change. It does not focus enough on infant and \ntoddler care. It does not require mandatory background checks for child \ncare providers in this program.\n  So, today we are introducing a bill that makes needed changes to \naddress shortcomings in current law.\n  Our bill requires States to devote more of their funding to quality \ninitiatives, such as: training, professional development, and \nprofessional advancement of the child care workforce, supporting early \nlearning guidelines, developing and implementing quality rating systems \nfor providers, and improving the supply and quality of child care \nprograms and services for infants and toddlers.\n  Our bill says that CCDBG providers must meet certain health and \nsafety requirements related to prevention and control of infectious \ndiseases, first aid and CPR, child abuse prevention, administration of \nmedication, prevention of and response to emergencies due to food \nallergies, prevention of sudden infant death syndrome and shaken baby \nsyndrome, building and physical premises safety, and emergency response \nplanning.\n  Our bill gives families more stability in the CCDBG program. It \nensures that children in the program can get care for at least a year, \neven if their parent sees a change in their working status or income.\n  Our bill works to improve early childhood care by requiring States to \nspend a certain portion of their funding on infant and toddler quality \ninitiatives. The bill requires States to develop and implement plans to \nincrease the supply and quality of care for infants and toddlers, as \nwell as children with disabilities and children receiving care during \nnon-traditional work hours.\n  And our bill requires mandatory background checks for child care \nproviders in the CCDBG program.\n  At the outset, I would like to say that most child care providers I \nhave met and spoken with are wonderful, caring people committed to \nensuring that the children in their care are safe and happy. This \nproposal is not meant to insinuate anything negative about our child \ncare workforce.\n  Instead, it is simply meant to ensure that we are doing our due \ndiligence to ensure that the adults entrusted with our children's day-\nto-day care are not murderers, child molesters, kidnappers, arsonists, \ndrug dealers, or rapists. Background checks are required for many jobs \nand I believe they should be required for child care providers.\n  Every working parent with children, no matter their income level, \nworries about child care. What's affordable? What's accessible? Will my \nchild be safe? Where can I get the very best care for my kid? The CCDBG \nprogram is supposed to give parents peace of mind. And for many \nfamilies over many years, it has. But we can and should be doing more \nto improve child care for children, parents, and providers alike. It is \nlong past time to revitalize, refresh, and reform this vitally \nimportant program.\n  Again, I would like to thank Senator Burr, Chairman Harkin, Ranking \nMember Alexander, and all members of the Senate HELP Committee for \ntheir hard work on this bipartisan proposal. It is my hope that we can \nmove swiftly to get this bill passed out of House and Senate and onto \nthe President's desk.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/03/senate-section/article/S3909-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3909]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1144.
