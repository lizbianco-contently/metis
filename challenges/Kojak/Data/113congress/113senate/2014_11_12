Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 467, S. \n2609, the Marketplace Fairness Act.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 467, S. 2609, a bill to \n     restore States' sovereign rights to enforce State and local \n     sales and use tax laws, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, following my remarks and those of the \nRepublican leader, the Senate will be in a period of morning business \nuntil 5:30 this evening. During that time, Senators will be permitted \nto speak for up to 10 minutes each, with the time equally divided and \ncontrolled between the two leaders or their designees.\n  At 5:30 p.m. the Senate will proceed to cloture votes on the \nnominations of Randolph Moss and Leigh Martin May; one is from the \nDistrict of Columbia and the other is from the State of Georgia.\n\n\n                            Working Together\n\n  Mr. President, I have always believed it wise to follow Will Rogers' \nadmonition: ``Don't let yesterday use up too much of today.''\n  We have a lot of work to do and no time to dwell on the past. With \njust a few weeks left in this Congress--the 113th--there are a number \nof important legislative matters before this body that must be \nfinished.\n  I congratulate the Republican leader who will soon become the new \nmajority leader. The senior Senator from Kentucky and I have known one \nanother for a very long period of time. We have been whips together. He \nwas minority leader. I was minority leader and majority leader. We have \nbeen back and forth, so we understand these jobs. I appreciate his \ndevotion to the State of Kentucky, to our country, and to the Senate. \nHe knows I hold him in the highest regard. I am ready to work with him \nin good faith to make this institution function again for the American \npeople.\n  I saw firsthand how a strategy of obstruction was debilitating to our \nsystem. I have no desire to engage in that manner. I have been, as I \nmentioned before, and I mention again, the minority leader. I have been \nable to strike compromises with my Republican colleagues, and I am \nready to do it again.\n  Regardless of how one may interpret last week's election results, it \nis clear the American people want us to join together to get things \ndone for the middle class and all Americans, and we should be able to \ndo that. After all, helping working families is not a partisan issue. \nJust last week we saw four very red States--Alaska, Arkansas, Nebraska, \nand South Dakota--vote to increase their minimum wages. Clearly, \nRepublicans outside this building don't object to giving American \nworkers a livable wage.\n  The minimum wage is just one example. There are other issues such as \nstudent debt relief for borrowers, pay equity for women, and a number \nof other issues that need to be addressed as well. There is absolutely \nno reason we can't work together on these issues and all issues so \nDemocrats and Republicans can lend Americans the helping hand they so \ndesperately need.\n  Although the desks in this great Chamber may move around and change, \nour duty to help working American families never will. Senate Democrats \nare ready to work in good faith with their Republican counterparts--\nwhether it is today, tomorrow, January, no matter when it is--to help \nthe middle class, and when we do that, we help all of our citizenry.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is recognized.\n\n\n                     Listen To The American People\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, last week the American people sent a\n\n[[Page S5886]]\n\nstrong message to Washington. They voted for a new direction. They \ncalled for a change in the way we do things in the Senate, and they \nsent a new team to Washington to carry their wishes forward, and we \nplan to do just that.\n  But several items remain for the outgoing Congress to consider and \nthat is our immediate focus.\n  In the weeks that remain in this Congress, we should work to \naccomplish the essential task of funding the Congress and preventing \nretroactive tax increases. We must address the expiring authority \npassed earlier this session for the Department of Defense to train and \nequip a moderate, vetted Syrian opposition, and we must continue to \nsupport the efforts to address the Ebola crisis.\n  All of this will require cooperation from both sides of the aisle, \nfrom both sides of the rotunda, and from both ends of Pennsylvania \nAvenue. The actions of the next few weeks can help set a positive tone \nfor the work of the next Congress. It is a tone that will depend \nlargely on the administration's willingness to respect the message sent \nlast Tuesday.\n  That is one of the things we discussed at the White House on Friday. \nIt was a productive meeting. There is a lot both parties can accomplish \ntogether over the next couple of years. I hope that happens. In fact, I \nam optimistic. But working together requires trust.\n  I think President Obama has the duty to help build the trust we all \nneed to move forward together--not to double down in the old ways of \ndoing business. That is why I think moving forward with the unilateral \naction on immigration he has planned would be a big mistake, as was \nlast night's announcement to essentially give China a free pass on \nemissions while hurting middle-class families and struggling miners \nhere in our country.\n  Last Friday, the President said the American people would like to see \nmore cooperation in Washington. He said he thinks all of us have a \nresponsibility--himself in particular--to try and make that happen. \nThat is the kind of tone the American people are looking for. Now it is \non folks in Washington to calibrate their actions accordingly. So let's \nnot do things to hurt the possibility of a cooperative partnership. \nLet's step back and focus on what can be accomplished together. Let's \nlisten to the American people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Murphy). The assistant minority leader.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, what happened on November 4 was the \nbeginning of an opportunity--an opportunity we have to work together to \nrestore faith in our Democratic institutions, to restore strong growth \nto our economy, and to restore a sense of purpose and principle to U.S. \nforeign policy.\n  Starting with the incoming majority leader, my good friend, the \nsenior Senator from Kentucky, Republicans have been entrusted by our \nfellow citizens to lead this Chamber next year. We understand the \nAmerican people sent a strong message on November 4 that they were \nenormously frustrated by what they saw as dysfunction and the state of \naffairs in Washington, DC. We understand why they are eager for new \nleadership and a new direction. My party, the Republican Party, \napproaches this opportunity with humility and, above all, a clear-eyed \ncommitment to address the top priorities of the American people. Of \ncourse, those priorities start with jobs and the economy.\n  I know the unemployment rate has continued to tick down little by \nlittle, but it is fairly misleading when we consider the fact that we \nare stuck with a 36-year low in the labor participation rate--the \npercentage of people who are actually looking for work. Indeed, there \nare still more than 7 million people looking for full-time work and \nworking currently in part-time jobs. We know many people have become so \ndiscouraged that they have simply given up and they have quit looking, \nand that is a tragedy.\n  Then there is this problem: America's median household income is no \nhigher in 2013 than it was nearly a quarter of a century ago, in 1989. \nThat has been a silent tragedy--one that has been sustained by the \nmiddle class in America, who have seen no growth in their median \nhousehold income for about a quarter of a century.\n  The median income was lower last year than it was the year President \nReagan left the White House. That is simply astonishing. It has crushed \nthe middle class. Addressing that should be one of our highest \npriorities in the new Congress starting in January.\n  Since 2011, our colleagues in the House of Representatives have been \npassing legislation they feel would boost job creation and increase \nwages. In the 113th Congress alone, they passed dozens of jobs bills. \nUnfortunately, as we know, those have not been taken up by the majority \nleader in the Senate, and they have been effectively declared dead on \narrival.\n  Then we also know this strategy of blocking amendments on pending \nlegislation to prevent vulnerable incumbents from being forced to cast \ntough votes has backfired, because many of our colleagues in the \nmajority have not been able to point to a legislative record of \neffectiveness for their own constituents because of this flawed \nstrategy of blocking the Senate from considering amendments and voting \non them. It is one thing to be in the minority and have the amendments \nor suggestions I am offering added, but it is harder to explain to your \nown constituents if you are in the majority and you are being blocked \nout too. So I hope we are done with that.\n  I know the incoming majority leader, Senator McConnell, believes \nstrongly in returning the Senate to its traditions as the world's \ngreatest deliberative body, where anyone, regardless of who they are or \nwhich political party they are affiliated with, can come to the Senate \nfloor and offer constructive suggestions and get a vote. That is what \nwe do--at least that is what we used to do, and that is what we can do \nagain, and that doesn't mean just the majority party gets votes on \ntheir amendments; that means the minority party will get votes on their \namendments. Hopefully, slowly but surely, we can begin to rebuild not \nonly trust and confidence within ourselves and this institution, but \nregain the lost trust of the American people by showing that we can \neffectively solve problems on a bipartisan basis to the challenges they \nface as members of the hard-working middle class.\n  Then there is the basic job of governing. We will pass a budget next \nyear--something our friends across the aisle have failed to do since \n2009. Now, here is something I do not think anybody will excuse or \ndefend: How in the world can it be that when every small and large \nbusiness in America has to have a budget, when families have to have a \nbudget so they can determine their priorities and how they can most \neffectively utilize their income, that they have to pass a budget but \nthe U.S. Congress does not? That is, frankly, malpractice, in my view, \nand it has to end, and it will end next year.\n  I know Republicans and Democrats will continue to have policy \ndisagreements. Nobody is suggesting that is not going to happen. But \nthis is the place where those get debated, where they get voted on, and \nwhere majorities will actually pass legislation and send it to \nPresident Obama. And those will be largely, if not almost entirely \nbipartisan majorities, of course, by definition.\n  We know Democrats by and large continue to support the Affordable \nCare Act and Republicans continue to believe it was a mistake and \nshould be replaced with patient-centered alternatives. But we do not \nhave to choose between complete paralysis and actually functioning. \nDysfunction is not the only choice we have, and now that that has been \nrejected by the voters resoundingly, we know a change is in order. The \nAmerican people have demanded it, they deserve it, and they will get \nit.\n  So last week's election will not change some of the fundamental \npolicy differences we have between political parties on ObamaCare, on \nwhat we need to do to preserve and protect Social Security and Medicare \nand the like, and it will not change people's points of view on other \nhot-button issues, but it will give us a chance to make some steady \nincremental progress on issues where we do agree.\n  When I came to the Senate, Teddy Kennedy, the liberal lion from \nMassachusetts, had been here about 40 years, and he was working on the \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee with Mike Enzi, a \nconservative Republican from Wyoming.\n\n[[Page S5887]]\n\n  One day I went up to Mike Enzi and I said: Well, how is it that you \nand Senator Kennedy, with such diametrically opposing views on what the \nCongress ought to do and how to solve these problems, can actually work \nproductively together?\n  Senator Enzi said: That is easy. It is the 80-20 rule. The 80 percent \nwe can agree on, we do. The 20 percent we cannot, we don't; we put off \nfor another day.\n  That strikes me as eminently practical and a way for us to begin to \nget back to work again.\n  When I talk about the easy stuff we can do, I am referring to the \nbipartisan majority that supports things such as the Keystone XL \nPipeline authorization, increasing our natural gas exports not only for \nthe job creation and economic boost it gives us here in America but \nalso because it changes the geopolitics of the world, where people such \nas Vladimir Putin cannot put a bootheel on the gas supply to Europe or \nUkraine and use that for their own purposes.\n  I am confident we can find commonsense safeguards from an \noverreaching Federal bureaucracy. We can agree on things such as \nimproving workforce training programs and do things that make it much \neasier to launch new infrastructure and construction projects. We can \ndo things we should have done last year or this year, such as reforming \nour broken patent system to discourage abusive and costly litigation. \nWe actually had a bipartisan bill in the Judiciary Committee, but it \ndid not come to the floor because the majority leader would not bring \nit up because one of his constituencies simply objected to it. Well, no \none should have a trump card when it comes to good, bipartisan \nlegislation, and they will not next year. We will vote on patent \nreform.\n  Then there are things such as mitigating some of the burdens of \nObamaCare, restoring the 40-hour workweek, and repealing the medical \ndevice tax, and there is strong bipartisan support for repealing that \ntax which has driven medical device manufacturers and their jobs \noverseas. I have constituents, for example, in Dallas in that business, \nand they say they are building their business in Costa Rica because of \nthe impact of this medical device tax and its negative impact on \nmedical innovation and job creation here.\n  I do know there is bipartisan support for abolishing the Independent \nPayment Advisory Board under Medicare. This is 15 bureaucrats who \nbasically get to decide who gets medical care and who does not, with no \nreal appeal or recourse. In the Judiciary Committee, on which I serve, \nwe have had very impressive bipartisan support for things such as \nprison reform and even sentencing reform.\n  Those are important issues of substance the Senate ought to be \ndiscussing, debating, voting on, and trying to find ways we can work \ntogether to achieve solutions. Each of the things I have mentioned has \nbipartisan support. If we can pass these measures with strong support \non both sides of the aisle and send them to the President for his \nsignature, it will be much easier to establish the trust and \ncooperation necessary to do the harder stuff. So starting with the easy \nstuff we have already identified that has bipartisan support--\ndemonstrating we can actually do that--then I think we will have \nconfidence in ourselves, and the American people will have confidence \nin us and their government to begin to tackle some of the more \nchallenging issues.\n  Senator McConnell, the Republican leader, mentioned this, but it \nbears repeating: that the President is still threatening to go around \nCongress and use an Executive order to implement a new, radical change \nin our Federal Government's immigration policy, and I think it is a \nterrible mistake.\n  At this same luncheon that the Senator from Kentucky mentioned, a \nnumber of us went down the line and said: Mr. President, please don't \ndo this because if you do, it will make it even harder for us to take a \nstep-by-step approach to immigration reform that enjoys bipartisan \nsupport. It will poison the well--not to mention the fact that what the \nPresident is proposing to do is unlawful and it will also make it \nharder for us to do the other things I have mentioned already that have \nbipartisan support. It will poison the well.\n  Why in the world would the President want to do that at the start of \na new Congress in the last 2 years of his term in office? Don't you \nthink he would want to have some legacy that he could point to in those \nlast 2 years, saying: Well, I might have been dealt a tough political \nhand with Republican majorities in the House and the Senate, but we \nwere actually able to be productive.\n  I think that is why most Senators have come here--to be productive.\n  So I would urge the President, as others have done, in the very \nstrongest of terms to abandon his plan for this Executive amnesty and \nto heed the message--the very clear message--voters sent last Tuesday. \nAfter a 6-year experiment in unfettered liberalism and big-government \npolicies, the American people are asking for a new direction. I am not \nunder any illusion that all of a sudden they have fallen in love with \nmy side of the aisle. That is not true. But what they are willing to do \nis put us on probation and give us all a chance to demonstrate that we \ncan change our course, we can listen to the American people, and we can \ndo things together that they want to see us do.\n  My constituents--6.5 million Texans--are sick and tired of watching \nthe Federal Government waste their money, selectively enforce the law, \nand try to micromanage their lives as if the Federal Government knows \nbetter than they do what is good for them and their families. It is not \ntrue, and they know it, but that has not stopped the efforts over the \nlast 6 years.\n  What my constituents want, I believe--and I believe it because they \nhave told me this--they want leaders who will respond to their \npractical day-to-day concerns, leaders who appreciate and will address \nthe biggest threats to the American dream, leaders who will uphold the \ntimeless principles of our Constitution.\n  I believe there is a nascent, bipartisan, emerging consensus here \nthat we can actually do this. This is not too hard for us to do. Yes, I \nhave read what some of the pundits have said. They said it is going to \nbe even worse with Republicans in charge. Well, it better not be worse \nor there will be a heavy price to pay, and most of that will be paid by \nthe American people, who will not be well-served if we simply refuse to \nchange and if we refuse to listen. And that goes for the President, \nthat goes for Republicans, and that goes for Democrats.\n  So for my part and I believe for our part on this side of the aisle, \nwe are eager to work together to solve our country's problems, to help \nunleash this great American job-creating engine known as our economy, \nand to restore the rule of law and constitutional government. As for \nPresident Obama, we can only hope he decides to work with us rather \nthan against us and against the best intentions and desires of the \nAmerican people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Reservation Of Leader Time\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I was hoping to catch the Senator before \nhe left the floor because I wanted to ask him--and I am not sure he is \ngoing to slip back in here, but I was going to ask him if he thought \nmaybe--because I agree with him that that new approach to \nbipartisanship could start today. I do not think we have to necessarily \nwait until January. There are some of us who have been ready, who have \nworked in a bipartisan way, literally for years, getting very important \nthings done for our Nation. I am\n\n[[Page S5888]]\n\nsorry the Senator slipped away. I am sure he has some other pressing \nbusiness. I wanted to ask him--and I absolutely agree with him on the \npriorities he just laid out. I think he just said the American people \nwant us to act and to act together in their interests.\n  I think I heard him say that on the top of his list, what he is \nparticularly anxious to work on is the Keystone XL Pipeline, the \nexpedited export of natural gas. I think he said it was important for \njobs in America, helping to strengthen the middle class, sending a very \npositive signal to them that we heard them in this election; that he \nwas troubled about the falling median household income and wants to do \nsomething to raise it. And I think I heard him say he was concerned or \nthat he was--how shall I say it?--he was thinking that some of these \nthings would really push Putin back on his heels. I have been one of \nthe ones sanctioned by President Putin, and there are a few others who \nare on that list, so I have been of that mind for a while.\n  I think he also referred to Ted Kennedy, one of our dear friends who \nmentored many of us--not just Democrats but Republicans as well--with \nhis straightforwardness, his honesty, his passion, his capacity for \nextraordinary work, and his willingness to work across party lines. As \nthe Senator from Texas pointed out, there was a great partnership \nbetween Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi, and he talked about the 80-20 \nrule; let's agree on 80 percent. ``We might not agree on everything, \nbut let's move forward'' I think were his words on the 80 percent on \nwhich we do agree.\n  So I want to come to the floor today to ask Senator Cornyn from Texas \nparticularly and Senator McConnell and Senator Reid and others if they \nwill join me in moving forward on the Keystone XL Pipeline.\n  This has been a project that has lingered far too long. It is clearly \nsupported by 60 or more Members of this body. It is a piece of \nlegislation that has been endorsed by the new to-be majority leader, as \na cosponsor and a leading cosponsor of the legislation.\n  There are a significant number of Democrats on that legislation. I \nbelieve with a significant push in the next few hours we could actually \nget the votes we need to pass the Keystone Pipeline. In an hour or so, \nat the request of the minority, I am going to wait for about an hour \nand then I am going to propose a unanimous consent to do exactly that--\nto set up 2 hours of debate tonight after the vote and then have a vote \non the Keystone Pipeline tomorrow. I believe it is the time to act.\n  I believe we should take the new majority leader at his word and stop \nblocking legislation that is broadly supported by the American public \nand has been for quite some time. I want to say yes to the new majority \nleader Mitch McConnell. The time to start is now. The public has \nclearly spoken. I believe we can move forward on several important \npieces of legislation.\n  Senator Reid mentioned the Marketplace Fairness Act. That is another \nvery important piece of legislation that I believe needs to be moved \nthrough. With a little push right now, it could get done. It would be a \nsignificant boost to businesses and retail that are being hurt every \nday by our inaction. My comments are going to be about the Keystone \nPipeline because I am chair of the energy committee for the Senate. I \nam going to do everything in my power, here and at home on the campaign \ntrail where I am still in a runoff, as you know, to get this project \nmoving forward.\n  One of the extraordinary facts about the Keystone Pipeline is not \nwhat it is. I am going to talk about that in a minute and what it does. \nOne of the most extraordinary pieces of argument for why we should pass \nit is the unprecedented coalition that supports it. There are other \nbills that have a longer list of supporters. There are bills that have \npages and pages of lists. This particular bill has a relatively short \nlist of organizations, but they are extremely powerful and diverse, \nwhich makes it compelling and I think it makes us--or should make us--\nwant to understand and respond to this coalition.\n  I am going to read their names. I have some time to do this before I \ncall for unanimous consent to pass the original Hoeven-Landrieu \nKeystone bill, which is a stand-alone Keystone bill as originally \nintroduced with 45 Republican cosponsors. Every Member of the \nRepublican caucus is already a cosponsor of this bill, and we have on \nthat bill about 12 Democratic cosponsors. I am confident we have the \nadditional votes necessary to pass it.\n  The American Chemistry Council, the American Concrete Pipe \nAssociation, the American Exploration and Production Council, the \nAmerican Highway Users Alliance, the American Petroleum Institute, the \nAmerican Road & Transportation Builders, American Truckers Association, \nAssociated General Contractors of America, Association of Oil \nPipelines, Concrete Reinforcing Steel Institute, Distribution \nContractors Association, Independent Petroleum Association of America, \nIndustrial Minerals Association of North America, Institute for 21st \nCentury Energy, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, \nLaborers International Union of North America.\n  Let me stop there and make a point. Many bills passed here or \nattempted to pass here either have a list of all business organizations \nor all labor organizations or all environmental organizations or all \nhighway contractors.\n  This bill has such an extraordinary, diverse group of some of the \nstrongest business leaders in the country. I want to underscore to my \nDemocratic colleagues who are supporting this piece of legislation, \ntremendous support from labor unions because labor unions, like \nbusiness leaders, want jobs. They want profits. They want success. They \nwant more investment in business, creating good middle-class jobs. The \ndifference between the oil and gas industry, which I have been pleased \nto be a strong advocate for in many different facets, is that industry \ndoes produce the kinds of jobs Americans truly want, not minimum wage \njobs, not just slightly above minimum wage but jobs that in my State--\nthe Senator knows this because he is well aware of this--start at \n$60,000, $70,000, $85,000 for a young man or a young woman coming out \nof high school or trade school, let alone college.\n  These are very important jobs. That is why labor unions are \nrepresented here. Along with Portland Cement Association, the plastics \nindustry, the United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the \nPlumbing and Pipe Fitting Industry, the Business Roundtable, American \nSupply Association, American Iron and Steel Institute, National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, National Electrical Contractors \nAssociation, National Roofing Contractors.\n  Why would roofing contractors be supporting the Keystone Pipeline? \nThere are no roofs on a pipelines, but there are thousands of roofs \nover workers needed to build a pipeline. All along the route of this \npipeline will be increases in populations of housing, industrial sites, \nretail, residential, supporting over 40,000 workers to build this \npipeline. The North American Die Casting Association, the National \nUtility Contractors--again, associated businesses--the U.S. Oil & Gas \nAssociation and, finally, Steel Manufacturers Association and Western \nAlliance.\n  This is an extraordinary coalition that has come together to support \nthe Hoeven-Landrieu bill. The bill I am going to call up in a few \nminutes for unanimous consent to pass because I believe what the new \nmajority leader has said. I believe what Senator Cornyn has just said. \nI believe what the current majority leader said, soon to be minority \nleader in the next Congress, that we need to work together and that we \ncan work together, and we need to begin to do that today--not tomorrow, \nnot in January, not in February, not in March, not around the corner, \nnot next week but today. That would send the most positive signal. I am \nnot asking to have unanimous consent on 10 bills that are \ncontroversial. I am not asking us to do the impossible. I am not asking \nus to do something that just came up last week. I am asking us to move \nforward on a bill that has labor support, business support, general \ncontractor support, and most importantly the American people. The \nlatest polls on the Keystone Pipeline, not just in my state--I see my \ncolleague from West Virginia--and not just in West Virginia but polls \nin this country from California to New York, to Michigan, to \nPennsylvania, to Ohio,\n\n[[Page S5889]]\n\nto Florida, and to Texas. Overwhelmingly Democrats, Republicans--not \neveryone--but there is overwhelming support to build the Keystone \nPipeline because Americans want jobs. American families deserve good-\npaying jobs. In addition, Americans are tired of bowing to Mideast \npowers or to Russian dictators about what our future is going to be. \nAmericans are proud. We want to stand proud. We believe the Keystone \nPipeline is an important first step. It is a signal. It is a symbol \nthat represents American energy power. It is a symbol moving past \ngridlock. It is a deliverable on promises we have all made. Yes, we \nwill work together. Yes, but that will start later. Yes, we will work \ntogether, but it will be next year. Yes, we will work together, but it \nwill be in the spring. Yes, we will work together, but we can't pass \nKeystone unless we pass these 10 other things.\n\n  There is always going to be tomorrow. There is always going to be 10 \nother things. Let's act today, tomorrow. We can do this. We can pass \nthe Keystone Pipeline and answer the frustrations of the American \npeople so they can rest next week and say: Oh, my gosh. The Senators of \nthe United States of America have ears. They have brains. They have \nhearts. They heard what we said and we can do this. We have a bill that \nis on the calendar.\n  I have also passed a similar bill through my committee, but I am not \neven asking you to pass the bill I passed through my committee, which I \nthink is slightly better than the one on the calendar, but we can all \ncompromise here. I am also the cosponsor of the bill, lead sponsor of \nthe bill, that is on the Senate calendar. It doesn't have to go through \na committee. It basically technically already has. It is ready for a \nvote. We have the 60 votes to pass it.\n  I am going to recognize in just a minute the Senator from West \nVirginia. I will ask the Senator a question because only the Chair can \nrecognize, but I would like to ask the Senator from West Virginia, does \nany of this make sense to him. I don't know if he was down here. \nAlthough I am sure he was in his office listening to the comments of \nthe majority leader, the soon-to-be majority leader, and the good \nSenator from Texas saying now is the time to work together. I don't \nknow if the Senator heard that. Does the Senator think that maybe this \nbill would be the bill to start moving us from gridlock to doing the \njob for the American people?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator of West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I thank the Chair.\n  My good friend, the Senator from Louisiana, has been working on this \nfor many years--I think even before I came up. I have been here 4 years \nnow. When I first came, I talked to Senator Landrieu, my friend from \nLouisiana, and asked her about this and basically I think she explained \nto me at the time that first of all the sovereign nation of Canada, the \ncountry, was going to produce it so we had no say in the production of \nthis product. It is going to be produced. Next of all, it is going to \ngo somewhere because there is demand for the product in the \nmarketplace. There is a demand for it.\n  With all that being said, it didn't take me too long to reply to the \nSenator, she will recall, 4 years ago, that in West Virginia we have \ncommon sense and we have good people like Louisiana and we felt if this \nproduct is going to be sold and we are buying this type of a product \naround the world, then why wouldn't we buy from our friends versus the \nenemies we have supplied resources to, to be used against us? That is \nthe one that resonates with West Virginians. I know it resonates with \nLouisianians. The other thing is I understand there are 1,000 American \ncompanies in West Virginia--not to say what you have been able to do \nand help the people in Louisiana, all the jobs they have gotten from \nthis, it would be a tremendous windfall for all of us if it is \nsomething we can count on.\n  I can't for the life of me understand why we haven't to date been \nable to move this piece of legislation forward. I did hear both the \nminority leader and the majority leader and the minority whip and \nmajority whip talk about it is time for us to start working together.\n  There is not a better piece of legislation to show that we heard the \nresults of Tuesday's election. We heard. If we heard nothing more from \nthat roar of Americans, whether they voted or didn't vote, they \nbasically told us do something. Start doing what we are supposed to do. \nStart governing. Do something. We may not agree with you, but we would \nlike to see this open dialogue, this transparency, this beautiful body, \nthe Senate, that the whole world watches. But when they see us doing \nnothing--it is not something we are very good at or look very good \ndoing. That day is gone.\n  I would ask my Senate colleagues that if they would be so kind as to \ngive us a chance to show me we are starting anew.\n  We are going to have a piece of legislation that is going to help us \nbe more secure as a nation, and that is why I am here. I wish to hear \nthe Senator's comments.\n  The security of our Nation--the Senator has been here. She has been \nseeing what has been going on, the demand we had for foreign oil, what \nit has done to us, the areas of the world it has taken us to, and the \namount of resources we have spent in blood and treasure fighting for \nresources--whether people believe it or not. This is a chance for us to \nsecure that. So if the Senator could talk to us about that.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. The Senator from West Virginia is so right in focusing \nthis debate at this moment on the subject of national security because \nVeterans Day was just celebrated by all of us yesterday. We all \nparticipated in Veterans Day events.\n  So it pains me to say this, but I am going to give us all of the \nfacts--and the Senator knows this--that this country imports 340 \nmillion barrels today. Iraq exports 340,000 barrels of oil per day. \nThat is Iraq--blood and treasure. We have left men and women--not left \nthem on the battlefield--but they have died there, and we have many \nsoldiers here at home.\n  Canada--which is a friendly country, an ally of ours--with the \nKeystone Pipeline, would bring in 870,000 barrels into the United \nStates. So the American people sit here and think: OK, what is wrong \nwith this picture? We could be taking oil from our friend, Canada, \ncreating jobs in North America--good-paying jobs--not only building the \npipeline but maintaining the pipeline.\n  This pipeline doesn't come to Louisiana. I fought for it like a \ntiger, and the pipeline doesn't even come to my State. It goes to \nTexas. Now, I have refineries in Louisiana, and Louisiana most \ncertainly and the companies in Louisiana will benefit. This pipeline \ndoesn't connect Canada and Louisiana; it connects Canada and Texas.\n  I am sorry that the majority leader and the Senator from Texas had to \nscamper off the floor. I am sure he had a meeting to go to. But this is \nreally about refineries in Texas that are waiting for this oil and \nabout moving this oil, as the Senator knows, through the most safe \nmeans possible to these refineries--off of the highways, off of the \nrailroads, and supporting a relationship with Canada as opposed to \ncountries in other parts of the world that don't always share our \nvalues and that we have to spend a lot of our defense money protecting.\n  So this makes no sense, and that is why I think this pipeline has \nsuch overwhelming bipartisan support across the country.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I think that basically the Senator touched on something \nvery important and we want to go back to that--transportation of the \noil today. The oil is coming down into the refineries anyway. We have \nhad some explosions by our rail carriers. It is coming by truck, and it \nis coming in so many different forms. We have been told this is the \nsafest way to transport.\n  When people talk about safe transport, we know this was not the first \npipeline we have in America. I think if you ever look at a map--the \nSenator has had the map on the floor--there is a crisscross. We have \npipelines all across America, and I think that is the perfect map to \nsee.\n  So the bottom line is it is something we have done. If we take it in \nthe harshest environment in Alaska, the Alaskan pipeline--that means so \nmuch to us in America--it has been done in the harshest of environments \nand has been done safely. So I am concerned about that.\n  I am also concerned with--the Senator talked about it directly going \nto Texas, but you all benefit; everyone benefits.\n\n[[Page S5890]]\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Everyone benefits.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. The other thing I wanted to say is this. I know the \nSenator was in parades yesterday, and I can only imagine her schedule. \nIt has to be unbelievable. But with all that said, people still want \njobs. All they want is jobs and an opportunity to work with certainty. \nThis gives Americans a lot of certainty about jobs and future economic \ngrowth in our country.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Absolutely.\n  This morning, to prepare for offering this unanimous consent \nrequest--which I will do in a very short period of time and ask for a \ncouple of hours of debate tonight and then tomorrow--I spoke to the \nleader of the building trades council for the United States of America. \nHe was very strong in his words to me about how disappointed he has \nbeen with some Members who have not stood up for building trades.\n  These are men and women who work in every State. All they want to do \nis go to work and have jobs. He was extremely disappointed in the \ngridlock over this piece of legislation, and that is exactly what he \nsaid to me. He said: Senator, we are about fed up with elections and \npolitics because what my members want are jobs. That is what their \nfamilies want, and they are tired of fooling around with some \ncommonsense projects that would bring so much wealth to middle-class \nfamilies.\n  I know that the majority leader on our side is concerned about the \nflat line of middle-class income in this country, and I know his heart \nis working toward increasing income for all families. This is the first \nstep. Not only is the project itself going to generate huge amounts of \njobs and economic activity--and I am going to put that amount in the \nrecord. It is estimated to be $20 billion. It is slightly less than the \nsize of the entire State of Vermont's GDP. This one project is like the \noutput of one of our States--albeit a small State--but Vermont is an \nimportant State. I have never in my life seen a project with so much \neconomic benefit.\n  I have never seen an infrastructure project supported from a broader \nbase--from the left to the center to the right. I have never seen labor \nand business come together in my life as they have on this issue. I \nhave never seen so many Senators cosponsor a bill and yet--because of \nsomething I can't quite put my finger on--we haven't yet passed. We can \ndo that now, today or tomorrow, and that would send a very positive \nsignal that we have heard the voters, that we do understand this cry \nfor breaking the gridlock, moving forward together, and getting the job \ndone.\n\n  I could not think of a better bill that symbolizes what we are trying \nto do in terms of jobs, economic security, energy security, and looking \nto the future in our country than this bill. It would build this \npipeline, get this oil--which is going to be produced anyway--off of \nthe rails, off of our highways, and into refineries.\n  May I say, as the Senator from West Virginia knows, and the Senator \nfrom North Dakota, who is my right hand with the Senator from West \nVirginia, we have additional pipelines to build because we have to \nbuild these east-west. The real need for the supply is the west coast \nand the east coast.\n  As the Senator knows, you could produce all the oil and gas you want \nor all the energy, and produce and generate the power, but if you can't \nmove it to the places where it needs to be, it is as if you haven't \nproduced it.\n  I know something about this subject as chair of the energy committee. \nSo after we do Keystone, which we are going to do tomorrow, we have to \nbuild some other pipelines that go east and west.\n  This is only to take 10 percent of North Dakota's supply. North \nDakota has become the leading supplier of oil and gas in the country. I \nwish to talk about North Dakota for 1 minute. I can't do it justice, \nsuch as Senator Heitkamp can do it, but I heard her give this speech \nenough to be able to repeat it, and it is worth repeating.\n  The Senator from Texas just came to the floor and lamented: Oh, my \ngosh, what can we do to lift the middle class? How can we lift their \neconomic outlook?\n  The Senators, all three of them, came and asked that question. I gave \nthem an answer: Build the Keystone Pipeline. Do they know what is \nhappening in North Dakota? It might be a sparsely populated State, but \nit has now surpassed every State in the production of oil.\n  The other thing they do is they took their energy production, No. 36 \non a scale of 1 to 50--they were the poorest State. The Senator from \nWest Virginia would know where they are today. Do we know where they \nare in 4 years? They have moved from 36 to 6. Think about that. I want \nto let that sink in for just 1 minute. North Dakota moved their number \nfrom 36 out of 50 to 6 out of 50 in 4 years.\n  Now, I challenge any Senator from any part of this country or any \npolitical leaning to come down to this floor in the next 24 hours and \nshow me one piece of legislation, one tax cut, one jobs bill that could \nmove a State in 4 years or a group of States from 36 to 6. That is the \npower of this industry, and we are standing in its way.\n  It is shameful, it is wrong, and it must stop today. If people want \nto hide, they are going to have a hard time.\n  I want everybody to hear clearly this is not a time to hide, not a \ntime to sit down, and not a time to play games. It is a time to stand. \nWe already have enough votes to pass this bill. We have 45--we have \nevery single Republican, none of whom are on the floor now. Every \nsingle Republican of this Chamber is a cosponsor of this bill on which \nI am going to ask unanimous consent. So I would think very carefully \nbefore anyone objects because they are all cosponsors on the bill. \nThink hard before you do.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Senator, if I could just touch on one thing because we \nhave here our good friend Senator Tester of Montana, who also knows a \nthing or two about an energy-producing State.\n  I think on the environment, you touched on that. Most people believe \nthat people who come from energy States throw caution to the wind on \nenvironmental issues. There is no one in this body--I don't believe on \neither side of the aisle--who doesn't want the best for themselves, \ntheir children, families, and future generations.\n  With that being said, I think this pipeline has passed every hurdle \nthe environmental community--rightfully so--has put out so that we \nshould make sure we were protecting the environment and trying to find \na balance between the environment and the economics, if you will. The \neconomy is so vitally important. I don't know if there is any \nenvironmental impact study standing in the way that would prevent this.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I agree with the Senator. I think he is absolutely \ncorrect. The Senator from Montana knows this as well. The Senator from \nMontana also has an issue that I will ask him to explain in just a \nmoment--he knows it better than I do--about private property rights, \nbecause he negotiated the language in the bill.\n  But responding to the question of the Senator from West Virginia \nabout the environment, that is what is so exciting about this project, \nso compelling for us to move forward. Not only did the international \nstudy that was done say it is in our international interests, of \ncourse, to trade with our best and most friendly trading partner \nclosest to us that enjoys the same high quality standard of life that \nwe do and even higher environmental standards, but the environmental \nstudy that came in, conducted by the President's own administration--\nthis wasn't done previously--came back and concluded this is the safest \nway to move it and it is the most environmentally friendly way to move \nit, and that is the record.\n  So the Senator is right. Not only does it have a compelling economic \nargument, but it has a compelling environmental argument from that \nperspective.\n  I would ask the Senator from Montana if he could explain the very \nimportant language that is in the Landrieu-Hoeven bill that is \ncosponsored by every single Republican and this chairman and that is \nabout the language he negotiated on private property rights, because \nthis is a very important principle for many Republicans but also for \nmany Democrats, particularly in Louisiana, where we have a lot of \nprivate property. In West Virginia you have a lot of private property. \nIn Montana you have a lot of private but also some public lands.\n\n[[Page S5891]]\n\n  Would the Senator answer that question if he would.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. I thank the Senator from Louisiana and the Senator from \nWest Virginia. I have a few things to say, and I will do so very \nquickly. But since this is the first time we have been on the floor \nsince the election, I think the American people are frustrated with the \nways things work in Washington--enough political games.\n  They told us that Americans want lawmakers to compromise, to work \ntogether, and to get things done.\n  Americans told us they want a stronger economy with good-paying jobs. \nIt shouldn't have taken an election to get this message through, but it \ndid. Nationwide, including my State of Montana, it is fair to say the \nunemployment rate is down, but it is also fair to say wages are not \nwhere they need to be. Too many Americans and too many Montanans are \nstruggling to make ends meet.\n  The Keystone XL Pipeline can help address some of those issues. But \nnow we have another attempt to block consideration of this bipartisan \nbill written here by Senators Landrieu and Hoeven. The votes are there. \nWe know that. If there is one way we can create good-paying jobs right \naway, it is by approving and building this Keystone XL Pipeline. \nBuilding the pipeline would tell the American public that Washington is \nready to turn the page. It will tell them we heard them, that their \nvoices matter, and that Washington is reacting appropriately.\n  Building the pipeline will strengthen our economy and our \ninfrastructure. First, according to the State Department, building the \npipeline will create 16,000 jobs and support another 26,000 more. Those \nare jobs that will help working-class Americans provide for their \nfamilies.\n  Secondly, the pipeline will include an on ramp for oil from the \nBakken region of Montana and North Dakota, and let more energy go from \nour country to the marketplace, which is where it needs to go. With \nproduction in the Bakken continuing to boom, we need more options to \nget that American oil where it needs to be, and the XL Pipeline is \nwhere that needs to be.\n  Third, shipping oil by pipeline is the safest way to ship it. That is \na fact. And the safety of American families and communities must come \nfirst.\n  Fourth, building the pipeline means more business with Canada, our \nfriend to the north, and less business with the Middle East--folks who \ndon't like us. Our country continues to be involved in conflicts in the \nMiddle East. By continuing to do more business with our neighbors to \nthe north, as opposed to countries that don't share our world view, we \ncan help cut off the funds to those who work against us. I think the \nKeystone Pipeline is a big step toward creating that energy security.\n  The pipeline must be built right. I will get to the point Senator \nLandrieu talked about. It must be constructed with respect to private \nproperty rights. We cannot have foreign corporations using eminent \ndomain to run roughshod over the fields of a farmer in Montana or a \nbusiness owner in Nebraska or over sacred tribal lands. The respect for \nprivate property rights is in the Landrieu-Hoeven bill. It is not in \nthe House bill. It is a critical component. It has to be, otherwise we \nare making a huge mistake.\n  This pipeline also must be built to the highest safety standards. \nThere can be no corners cut. Leaks and spills don't make anybody any \nmoney. They are unacceptable. The most modern safety systems must be \nemployed, including double piping, if necessary. That is a fundamental \ndifference between the Landrieu-Hoeven bill--what they have drafted in \nthe House and the good work we have done in the Senate. The House bill \ncontains no protections for landowners. None. Zip.\n  The House bill says: Good luck, landowners. You are subject to \neminent domain by a foreign corporation. You have no spill prevention \nprotections. The Landrieu-Hoeven bill, on the other hand, protects \nrural America, protects private property rights.\n  Senator Landrieu has been working on this effort for years. This bill \nwill give the pipeline the Senate's seal of approval and it will send a \nsignal to all Americans that Congress is working together creating good \njobs, supporting our economy, and that we are able to make responsible \ndecisions.\n  But as this debate moves forward, I will continue to push to make \nsure the oil shipped through this pipeline stays in America. I have \nheard the arguments on all sides, but North America's oil should stay \nin North America. It will make our country more energy secure. It will \nlead to cheaper energy that will be more affordable for our homes, for \nour businesses, and for our working families. That will lead to more \ngood manufacturing jobs in this country. Because of our energy costs, \nwe will be able to recruit that manufacturing base back to our country \nthat we gave up some 20 or 30 years ago.\n  There are a lot of reasons to approve and build the Keystone XL \nPipeline. It will support our middle class--and we need to support our \nmiddle class--it will make us more energy secure; and it will \nstrengthen our transportation and infrastructure system.\n  But America needs a sign. It needs a reason to trust that Congress \nand Washington as a whole are listening. Approving the pipeline with \nthe needed protections and with respect to private property rights is \nthat sign. I, like the American people, am tired of the gridlock and \ntired of kicking the can down the road. I didn't come here to delay and \npush our problems to the future. I came here to work for commonsense \nsolutions we can enact today and move this country forward today. The \nKeystone XL Pipeline is one of those solutions.\n  Passing this bill and building this pipeline is one of those very \nimportant things we need to do for our infrastructure, for our energy \nsecurity, and for the country as a whole. I encourage my colleagues to \nsupport and help us rebuild our trust with the American people.\n  With that, I turn it back to the good Senator from West Virginia, Mr. \nManchin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Let me say the Senator from Montana, and all of us--\nthere are quite a few of us--are on this bill for a reason. It is about \nthe opportunities for jobs that we have. And it doesn't have an \nenvironmental detriment to our country. That has already been proven. \nSo with all of this, what is the hangup? Why can't we get this vote we \nare hoping to get by tomorrow at the latest?\n  I can only talk about the jobs with the thousand American companies \nthat are providing the goods it takes to build this pipeline. I have a \nchance in West Virginia--we are doing an awful lot of the work right \nnow because we come from an energy State that does an awful lot of the \nsupport work for any type of energy throughout the country and around \nthe world. But the bottom line is, again, if you are going to have a \nsecure nation, you have to have control of your own destiny. This gives \nus the control we don't have, it gives us the ability to say, listen, \nwe may not have to go around the world and engage in the different \nconflicts we see going on right now. That is what we are talking about.\n  So the security of the Nation, I think, is the most important thing \nKeystone does, is it helps us be more secure with the greatest trading \npartner we have. Canada is the best and the largest trading partner for \n35 States out of the 50. People take jaunts all over the world trying \nto develop a market here and there. But when it comes down to it, the \nNo. 1 trading partner for 35 States is Canada. And Canada is working \nwith us.\n  I know Canada has pressure from around the world to go somewhere \nelse. So if we have the best partner--the best outlook we have ever had \nor can imagine--working with us to help develop this product the whole \nworld seems to need and want and we need in America, why not have \ncontrol?\n  The Senator from Louisiana talked about this. Why shouldn't we bring \nthat oil into America and do all the heavy lifting and then ship it \nsomewhere else? It is supply and demand. When you have control of \nsupply, when you have the supply in your own back yard--and there might \nbe demand, but you have a need also within our country--that gives a \npretty good hand to play. That is what we are saying. Why would we let \nany of these advantages be turned to a disadvantage?\n  The only thing I can do is hope we can get this vote. And I would say \nto\n\n[[Page S5892]]\n\nmy good friends on the other side of the aisle, my Republican \ncolleagues, this would be the best gesture to move the ball forward. \nThis would be the best gesture they could make, coming off of the \nchanges, the shift we saw from Tuesday's election. People are speaking. \nThey want us to work. It is the same for the Senator from Montana, the \nsame for the Presiding Officer. They want us to do something. They want \nus to work.\n  We are not going to agree all the time with people. The best we can \ndo is try. We had a football game we played the other day at WVU. We \nplayed TCU. We were ahead. We should have won the game. Going into the \nlast half of the fourth quarter, for some reason the play calling \nwasn't as aggressive as it had been the first three quarters. We sat on \nthe ball and we got beat 31 to 30. People don't want us to sit on the \nball in the Senate.\n  It is time for us to do something. It is time for us to move forward. \nAfter Tuesday's election, we can work together. We have heard you loud \nand clear. We are willing to take a vote. We know the environment will \nbe protected. We know we can find a balance between the environment and \nthe economy. We know we can reap thousands and thousands and thousands \nof jobs and put millions and millions of dollars into the economy. That \nis what we do know.\n  There will still be some people who don't support this piece of \nlegislation, and they have all their reasons to speak about that. But \ngive us a reason to vote for something that will help America and help \nour States individually. That is what we are asking for. That is what \nthe good Senator has been fighting for since the day I have been here.\n  Senator Landrieu being the chairman of the energy committee has made \na difference from my standpoint, looking at our energy policy as a \nwhole. But how do we keep the United States of America secure and out \nof troubled spots in the world? I appreciate her efforts on this, and I \nlook forward to working with her on this. I endorsed the bill, I am a \ncosponsor, and I will definitely proudly vote for this piece of \nlegislation as soon as we can get it on the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I see the Senator from North Dakota has \narrived, and of course she wants to speak and can do so beautifully \nbecause this pipeline comes through her State, as I said. But I do want \nto respond to a few things and thank the Senator from West Virginia.\n  I have heard colleagues, particularly my colleague from California, \nsay this often, and she says it in committee and on the floor. And even \nthough she and I are on opposite sides of this debate, we have worked \ntogether on some important legislation for our country, and I have such \nrespect for her leadership on the RESTORE Act, which was an amazing \npiece of environmental legislation for our gulf coast States. Without \nher leadership it would not have happened. But I have heard her say \nover and over and over again that elections have consequences, and this \none does, just as they all do. And one of the consequences of this \nelection is that a clear path for Keystone has been opened up.\n  The reporters following this legislation, which they have followed \nvery carefully, know exactly what I am talking about when I say a path \nfor passage has been cleared. In my view, that path will never, ever be \nclearer than it is today. Now in order for the path to stay clear, and \nit is crystal clear today, politics must be set aside. Gamesmanship has \nto be set aside. We must come together to do what is right for the \ncountry, for the American people, and to vote.\n  There are strong feelings, I know, against this bill. There have been \nfor many years. But the overwhelming majority of this body--60-plus \nMembers--has indicated support for this legislation. And the Senate \nbill, from the perspective we just heard--from private property rights, \nfor clarity, for simplicity--is far superior to the House bill that has \nbeen passed.\n  The House is very agile--very agile. They can do lots of things \nquickly that the Senate can't do. So the House may decide to take the \nlanguage of this bill, pass it, and call it something else. I \nunderstand that. I don't know if that is what they will do, but there \nis a clear path for victory on Keystone. Whoever's name is on the bill \ndoes not matter to me as long as it gets done. I want to say that \nagain. The name on the bill does not matter to me as long as this gets \ndone. And it needs to get done right now--not in January, not in \nFebruary, not in March.\n  It doesn't need to be combined with anything else. It needs to get \ndone on its own, because it is standing alone. It will go to the \nPresident's desk as a stand-alone. I believe the President will have to \nmake an important decision. I am hoping he will sign it. But if he \ndoesn't, that is the process. I hope he will, and I will be urging him \nto do so because his administration--his State Department, his EPA, and \nhis Transportation Department--has urged him to support this piece of \nlegislation for the strength of our economy, a signal to our allies, \nand to strengthen America here and abroad. I would strongly urge him to \nsign it.\n  We have a job to do in the Senate, the President has a job to do, and \nthe House has a job to do. But if everybody would stop playing games \nwith this bill and think about what the American people said on \nelection day and stop trying to push one philosophy or one person ahead \nof the other, we can get this done.\n  My name is not even first on this bill. Senator Hoeven's name is \nfirst. It is a Hoeven bill. I am the lead Democratic sponsor because I \nam the chair of the energy committee, and I will be until January 2. If \nmy voters send me back, I will be here for 6 more years. That is why my \nname is on the bill, because I chair the committee. But if they want to \ntake my name off, put somebody's else name on it and pass it, so be it. \nI didn't come here to see my name in lights. I came here to create jobs \nfor my State and for this country, and I believe I have done an \nexcellent job in the 18 years I have been here, through very difficult \ncircumstances, and will continue should the voters want me to.\n  Today we need to talk about the Keystone Pipeline, and nobody can \nspeak better of this than the Senator from North Dakota. I wish to line \nthis up before she speaks, because she was traveling and she just \nlanded. She might not have heard what all three leaders said when they \ncame to the floor. Senator Reid, Senator Cornyn, and Senator McConnell \nsaid their No. 1 goal was to break gridlock, and they wanted to start \nnow. Their second goal was to expand middle-class job opportunities and \ncreate wealth in America.\n  So I am hoping the Senator from the State that has created the most \nwealth in the shortest period of time of any State of the Union might \nexpress to the rest of us actually how that happened and why she thinks \nthis Keystone Pipeline and other pipelines--because she and I agree, \nthis is just the first of several we are going to have to lay down to \nmake America a superenergy power. We don't become a superenergy power \nby just wishing it; we become a superenergy power by putting in the \ninfrastructure that makes it possible. Even kids in second grade \nunderstand this. We have to put up windmills, we have to put up solar \npanels, we have to put in pipelines, we have to put in highways.\n  The Senator from North Dakota, who has a very sparsely populated \nState, understands the issue of this infrastructure I think better than \nany Senator in this body. So I am going to ask her if she would respond \nto that and maybe elaborate on the question: How did her State get so \nwealthy in the last few years?\n  My State is doing well. I am not here complaining. My State is doing \nbeautifully. Our unemployment in south Louisiana is 3 percent, so we \nare blessed because we are an energy State. We are proud of it. We are \ncreating jobs hand over fist. But there are places such as Detroit, \nthere are places in Ohio, there are places in Pennsylvania and New York \nand New Mexico and other places where people are unemployed, begging \nfor work, willing to work. Three leaders came to the floor and said: It \nis time to break gridlock. Here is a project that can do it. So I hope \nto see them sometime before close of business tonight.\n  Would the Senator expound on that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n[[Page S5893]]\n\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I stand with my great colleague and a \ngreat champion of this energy renaissance--probably the greatest \nchampion of the energy renaissance here in the Senate, the Senator from \nLouisiana.\n  I wish to speak first about the election. I think all of us have had \nsome time now to reflect, and I think the clearest message this entire \nbody, as well as the entire U.S. Congress, received is: Stop fighting. \nGet your work done. I don't think it could have been any clearer.\n  We have an opportunity today to demonstrate we got that message, not \nin a partisan way, but in a bipartisan way--in a nonpartisan way--to \nsay: We heard you loud and clear. It is time to do the job we were sent \nhere to do, and that is to move legislation which moves this country \nforward.\n  Senator Landrieu has expounded on the great opportunity of this \nenergy renaissance, not just for this country but for the entire world. \nSo let's start with what is happening in North Dakota.\n  We have had an explosion of oil and gas production. In fact, we have \nrapidly moved to second place in this country in oil production. We \nproduce oil from oil shale.\n  What does that mean? It means nothing if we can't move the oil. It \nmeans nothing if we can't get this product to the refineries and this \nproduct to market. We can produce all the oil we want, but part of what \nwe need to address as we look at an energy infrastructure is how we \nmove energy products.\n  Today in America, and actually in Canada, how we are moving this \nproduct is by rail, which has created tremendous stress on our \nagricultural infrastructure. It has created tremendous stress on \nmanufacturers who need to use those rails to haul their finished \nproducts. It has created tremendous stress for the railroads. Are they \nglad for the business? You bet. And has that created and opened up new \nmarkets for the oil production in my State? You bet. But the bottom \nline is, the best way we know how to move oil and move this product is \nin a pipe, and that is essential to building all this energy \ninfrastructure.\n  Why is it important? Let's start first with the fact that we now are \nmoving toward North American energy self-sufficiency. A lot of people \ntalk about America, and that is a great goal. But if we include our \nfriends to the north--the people I grew up with, the people I know--I \nhave been to the oil sands, I have been all over Alberta, I have been \nall over Saskatchewan. This is a very friendly country which has the \nlongest contiguous border with which there has never been a conflict. \nWe celebrate this in North Dakota with Peace Garden, which is a lovely \npark on both sides of the border where one can easily cross. We \ncelebrate that. These are our friends. And if we are going to continue \nto build out this energy renaissance in North America, we had better be \nprepared to move this product.\n  We all know some of the opposition to this has very little to do with \nthe pipeline. It has to do with a concern about the increased \navailability of fossil fuels. This is still an economy that runs on \nfossil fuels. We have done tremendous work with fuel efficiency. We \nhave done tremendous work with energy efficiency. But we are going to \ncontinue to use gasoline in our cars, we are going to continue to use \ndiesel in our heavy equipment, and we are going to continue to use this \nproduct.\n  Who do we want to buy this product from? If we ask any American \nperson: Would you rather buy this product from Venezuela or would you \nrather buy this product from our friends to the north, Canada, I am \npretty sure what their answer will be.\n  So let's talk a little bit about why the United States, at a time \nwhen we are seeing a global slowdown in economic progress for many of \nthe other countries throughout the world--why is the United States \nseeming to go farther? Why are we producing and generating more wealth \nin our country than other places? I would tell you, it is because of \nthis energy renaissance. We are doing something no one else is doing--\nwe are producing our own oil and gas, we are developing the techniques \nto get this oil and gas out of the ground, and we are taking that as a \nraw material which is providing a renaissance, not just in the oil area \nbut also in natural gas as a feedstock for many of our manufacturing \nprocesses. So we have a real opportunity here. But all of that goes \naway if we don't move the product, if we don't figure out a way to make \nsure our product gets to market.\n\n  I will talk a little bit also about what this development in our \ncountry means to the world, when we are confronting great challenges in \ndealing with Russia, in looking at what is happening in the Middle \nEast. We are confronting all of these challenges throughout the world. \nWe know we can not only deploy our humanitarian efforts, our efforts by \nsupporting through air strikes some of the work that is being done on \nthe ground, but perhaps the single most important thing we can do is \nhelp provide oil and gas to Europe and to those countries dependent on \npeople or on countries that are not our friends.\n  We look at what our opportunities are today, and we know those \nopportunities are in the energy renaissance.\n  So how do we move this product? How do we send a signal that we are \nready to take advantage, both globally and domestically, of this \nproduct, of this renaissance in North America? We approve the Keystone \nPipeline.\n  A lot of people talk about what the Keystone Pipeline means to my \nState. It doesn't exactly go into my State, but the Governor of Montana \nmade sure when he was providing the permits that there wasn't what I \ncall an on ramp. There is a place where we can in fact access the \nKeystone Pipeline. We anticipate about 100,000 barrels a day of North \nDakota crude will be able to be placed into the Keystone Pipeline and \nsent down to refineries in Louisiana. That may sound like a lot, but it \nis less than 10 percent of our current production.\n  For me, the Keystone is so much more than this particular pipeline. \nIt is a national discussion about our failing energy transportation \ninfrastructure. That is what this is. And if we do not move this \nproject forward, if we say no, what is the next thing? What is the next \nproject that is essential? A 22-mile pipeline in Massachusetts that \nwould provide huge stability for the northeast in terms of their heat \nproduction. Twenty-two miles could be a huge benefit to our friends in \nMaine in terms of stabilizing their home heating costs this winter, but \nyet we fight the pipeline.\n  Keystone is a huge advantage we have in this country because we are \nan oil and gas producer, and could potentially be an oil exporter, \nproviding that source of soft power across the world. What do we do? We \nturn our back on the infrastructure that moves this product. So we have \ngot to do everything we can to get this approved.\n  I wish to turn briefly to the politics. A lot of people come here and \ntalk politics. I believe this is the place to talk policy, and that is \nwhat I try to do. But for a moment, I wish to talk about the respect we \nshould have for voters. I wish to talk about elections, and elections \nhave consequences. One of the things we can do to begin to restore the \npublic faith in our democracy and in the institution of the U.S. \nCongress is to do something bold to begin with: Actually move \nlegislation that people have been waiting for for a long time, and \nactually respond to concerns.\n  Maybe we get the votes, maybe we don't. But let's take a vote. Take a \nvote and get it done. Show the American public we are willing to come \nto this body, debate the great issues of the time, and bring things to \na vote so they actually see us doing something; they actually get \nresults. They pay our salary. We came here to vote. We came here to \nwork. We came here to do something for the American public.\n  We don't all agree; there is no doubt about that. But the thing we \nshould all agree on is it is essential in terms of providing certainty \nto the American public, confidence that the American public has in this \nbody--that they see us on this floor, not 2 years or 2 months from now, \nnot 3 months from now, not 4 months from now, but today--the first day \nwe are back in session after an election, a hard-fought election with \npretty dire consequences for our side of the aisle, but a hard \nelection. It is essential we send a message that we got the message and \nwe take a vote.\n  I am so proud of my colleague from Louisiana for coming back when, \narguably, she should be back in her State\n\n[[Page S5894]]\n\ndoing a little campaigning. But she is back here fighting for what she \nbelieves in and what she has always believed in, which is an energy \ninfrastructure which makes a difference for North America, makes a \ndifference for not just States such as mine but consumers of energy.\n  I thank the Senator from Louisiana for her tremendous leadership on \nthis and her willingness to basically come here and say: I don't care \nwho gets the credit. I don't care if my name is on it or not. Let's get \nthe Keystone Pipeline approved.\n  Now I want to make one final point and then I will close. If you have \ndriven the route of the Keystone Pipeline, what you will see stockpiled \nevery so many miles is thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars \nof pipe waiting--6 years waiting--infrastructure that needs to go \ntoday. So when people say we can wait to take this vote, you are wrong. \nThe sooner the better. The sooner we take this vote and get it \napproved, the sooner we are going to see those resources deployed and \nwe will not yet miss another construction season in the North Country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and express great gratitude for the \nopportunity to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I know the Senator from Tennessee is on the floor and I \nwould like to take 2 or 3 minutes. I know we can go back and forth but \nI want to conclude a little bit of this debate we have had.\n  First, I want to submit for the Record--because I am going to remain \non the floor and speak after the Senator from Tennessee--but I want to \nput into the Record the list of Republican cosponsors of S. 2280, the \ndate they became cosponsors, and the name of every single Member, \nincluding the Senator from Tennessee, who is a cosponsor of the Hoeven-\nLandrieu bill that is pending on the Senate Calendar, S. 2280. I ask \nunanimous consent that the list be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n List of Republican Co-Sponsors of S. 2280 and the Date They Became Co-\n                                Sponsors\n\n       Sen Alexander, Lamar [R-TN]--5/1/2014\n       Sen Ayotte, Kelly [R-NH]--5/1/2014\n       Sen Barrasso, John [R-WY]--5/1/2014\n       Sen Blunt, Roy [R-MO]--5/1/2014\n       Sen Boozman, John [R-AR]--5/1/2014\n       Sen Burr, Richard [R-NC]--5/1/2014\n       Sen Chambliss, Saxby [R-GA]--5/1/2014\n       Sen Coats, Daniel [R-IN]--5/1/2014\n       Sen Coburn, Tom [R-OK]--5/1/2014\n       Sen Cochran, Thad [R-MS]--5/1/2014\n       Sen Collins, Susan M.

I also want to put into the Record the 35-plus very \npowerful organizations that range from business to labor to \nmanufacturers that have been a strong and powerful and vocal coalition \nfor over 5 years in their efforts to bring us together. They have come \ntogether. The question is whether the Members of Congress will come \ntogether. These groups have come together. It is not often that you see \nthe laborers, pipefitters, boilermakers, and builders and trades all \ntogether sitting down with the Chamber of Commerce and the American \nPetroleum Institute, but they managed to find common ground at a common \ntable, and America will be best served when the Members of this body \nand the House do the same.\n  I also want to put into the Record two short statements, and this is \ndirected to those who are on the other side of this issue and who are \nwavering or are not sure. I want to put into the Record that the \nenvironmental review process has been conducted over 5 \\1/2\\ years. The \nreview process has been thorough. Five studies have been conducted, as \nrequired by law, and are complete.\n  I want to repeat that. The five environmental studies that are \nrequired by law have been conducted. They are completed. I ask \nunanimous consent that material be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        Support for Keystone XL\n\n       American Chemistry Council, American Concrete Pressure Pipe \n     Association, American Exploration & Production Council, \n     American Highway Users Alliance, American Petroleum \n     Institute, American Road & Transportation Builders \n     Association, American Trucking Association, Associated \n     General Contractors of America, Association of Oil Pipe \n     Lines, Concrete Reinforcing Steel Institute.\n       Distribution Contractors Association, Independent Petroleum \n     Association of America, Industrial Minerals Association-North \n     America, Institute for 21st Century Energy, International \n     Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Laborers' International \n     Union of North America, National Asphalt Pavement \n     Association, National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors, \n     National Ready Mixed Concrete Association, National Stone, \n     Sand, and Gravel Association.\n       North America's Building Trades Unions, Petroleum Equipment \n     Suppliers Association, Portland Cement Association, SPI: The \n     Plastic Industry Trade Association, The United Association of \n     Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipe Fitting \n     Industry of the United States and Canada, American Concrete \n     Pavement Association, American Council of Engineering \n     Companies.\n       American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, American Iron \n     and Steel Institute, American Rental Association, American \n     Supply Association, Associated Equipment Distributors, \n     Association of Equipment Manufacturers, Business Roundtable, \n     Consumer Energy Alliance, Energy Equipment & Infrastructure \n     Alliance, Industrial Fasteners Institute.\n       Industrial Union of Operating Engineers, Institute of \n     Makers of Explosives, International Union of Operating \n     Engineers, Manufacturers Alliance for Productivity and \n     Innovation, National Association of Manufacturers, National \n     Electrical Contractors Association, National Roofing \n     Contractors Association, National Utility Contractors \n     Association, North American Die Casting Association, \n     Petroleum Marketers Association of America, Small Business \n     and Entrepreneurship Council, Steel Manufacturers \n     Association, US Oil & Gas Association, Western Energy \n     Alliance.\n\n                            Background Info\n\n       Review Process: Five and a half years since it was first \n     proposed in 2008, we are still reviewing it. The review \n     process has been thorough. The five studies that have been \n     conducted, as required by law, are complete.\n       1. April 16, 2010--Department of State issues its Draft \n     Environmental Impact Statement. It opens a 45-day comment \n     period, which it extends for additional days.\n       2. April 15, 2011--Department of State issues a \n     Supplemental Draft Environmental Impact Statement and opens \n     another 45-day comment period. More than 280,000 comments are \n     received.\n       3. August 26, 2011--Department of State issues its Final \n     Environmental Impact Statement and opens up a 90-day review \n     period. The agency continues accepting public comments.\n       4. March 1, 2013--The U.S. State Department issued its \n     Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement for the Keystone \n     XL Presidential Permit application, which includes the \n     proposed new route through Nebraska. The SEIS findings are \n     similar to the Department's FEIS issued last August, which \n     found the pipeline will have limited adverse environmental \n     impacts.\n       5. January 31, 2014--The U.S. State Department issued its \n     Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement for the \n     permit application, confirming the project is safe and will \n     have limited environmental impacts. The report reflects that \n     TransCanada has agreed to incorporate 59 special safety \n     conditions.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. In addition, the only other requirement is from the \nState Department, and I want to put this into the Record. But the \nbottom line is the last statement of the State Department finds ``there \nwill be no significant impact on the environment from the [Keystone XL] \nproject.'' I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S5895]]\n\n        Latest Environmental Impact Study From State Department\n\n       The EIS finds that there will be no significant impact on \n     the environment from the project.\n       State Department finds that crude oil from the pipeline is \n     unlikely to be exported, because the transport cost of \n     getting it to the U.S. combined with transport overseas would \n     be uneconomical.\n       The study also finds that the failure to construct the \n     pipeline will not negatively affect the rate at which oil is \n     extracted from the oil sands--that is, State Department \n     predicts that rail transport expansion will be able to \n     support additional production.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. The path today is crystal clear. Today it is crystal \nclear. There is no guarantee that next week or next month or when the \nRepublicans take the majority that the path could be as clear as it is \ntoday. Let us not miss this opportunity. Let us get our work done on \nthe Keystone XL Pipeline, an important project in this country, and \nsend a message that we have heard the voters and show that trust with \nus begins today on their behalf.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Presiding Officer and the Senator from \nLouisiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/12/senate-section/article/S5895-1", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5895-S5896]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CHILD CARE AND DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Tomorrow at 2:15 we will have a vote on the Child Care \nand Development Block Grant of 2014.\n  I want to take a few minutes and explain why it is important to end \nthe debate on the Child Care and Development Block Grant and vote on \nwhether we want to turn it into a law.\n  When I talk about why it is important, I think of a young woman from \nMemphis who attended LeMoyne College. This woman had a young child and \nwas able to qualify for a child care voucher from the State of \nTennessee. There are about 900,000 families across the country that \ntake advantage of this Federal voucher program. She was able to get \n$500 or $600 a month in order to provide daycare for her child while \nshe pursued a business degree from LeMoyne-Owen College. With the help \nof this program she graduated with her degree and earned a position as \nan assistant manager at Walmart. With her new position, she is now able \nto pay for the child care for her second child without help from the \nFederal Government. This is exactly the kind of legislating we should \nbe doing at the Federal level.\n  What is the appropriate role of the Federal Government on an issue \nsuch as childcare? The answer this bill gives is that we should enable \nthis young mother and 21,000 other families in Tennessee to take a \nFederal voucher, choose their own childcare center, and help them to \nfinancial independence through work or continued education or training \nprograms. It has been an enormously successful program. The program has \nworked for over 20 years and was inaugurated in the administration of \nGeorge H.W. Bush and was a bipartisan product of Congress. It follows \nthe example of other successful Federal programs by enabling American \nfamilies to help themselves.\n  We follow the same model when we deal with Federal Pell grants and \nloans that help students pay for college. Last year the Presiding \nOfficer will remember we had an agreement in this body on huge changes \nto the student loan program. President Obama became involved and \nSecretary Arne Duncan led a bipartisan working group to develop a \nsolution. The Republican House of Representatives came along, and we \ncreated new rules for the $100 billion of loans the Federal Government \nmakes to students every year. The result was a market-based system that \nis revenue-neutral for the taxpayers, and lowered the interest rates on \nstudent loans to undergraduates by about one-half that year. We first \nused the idea of Federal vouchers for education with the passage of the \nGI bill in 1944. Recipients can take a voucher and then choose among \neducational institutions of their choice, such as the University of \nNotre Dame, University of New Mexico, University of Tennessee, \nVanderbilt University, Yeshiva College, or whichever accredited college \nthey so choose. This idea has worked very well and the GI bill may be \nthe most successful piece of social legislation ever passed.\n  The Child Care and Development Block Grant is a good example of the \ngovernment working as an enabler rather than simply prescribing \nmandates. The program provides $5.3 billion for childcare services for \nchildren under the age of 13, with plenty of flexibility. While it has \nbroad bipartisan support, Republican particularly appreciate the \nflexibility the act provides to States through block grants. States are \nthen able to provide parents with vouchers so that they can select a \nprovider that best meets their needs. It is a model that has proven \nsuccessful since 1944 and one I hope we continue.\n  Now we have the chance to move this bill forward by voting to end \ndebate. The cloture vote that we will have tomorrow will reflect that \nwe debated the bill fully and that at least 60 of us believe it is time \nto move forward and vote yes or no.\n  Have we all had our say? I believe so. Senator Harkin, Senator \nMikulski, and Senator Burr, have worked on this for several years as \nwell as several others of us. It was approved 1 year ago by the Senate \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee on a bipartisan basis. \nThen in March of this year, 2014, the bill was debated and discussed in \nthis very chamber over a 2-day period.\n  We have had a lot of discussion in the Senate about whether we get to \noffer amendments. That concern has come from the Senator who is \npresiding today, that concern has come from me, it has come from the \nSenator from Oklahoma, who is here. It is not easy to be elected to the \nSenate and it is not easy to stay in office. And once elected, senators \nwant their voices to be heard, whether it is on the Keystone Pipeline \nor the Child Care and Development Block Grant. The Child Care and \nDevelopment Block Grant went through a model process that began with \nthe Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, then to the \nSenate floor on March 12 through unanimous consent. There was no motion \nfor cloture, no filling of the tree, and anyone who offered a relevant \namendment was able to share and debate that amendment.\n  Senators offered 50 different amendments. Then we considered and \nagreed to 18 of those amendments. This body approved 4 by recorded vote \nand 14 by voice vote. Senators Enzi, Landrieu, Franken, Coburn, Boxer, \nLee, Portman, Tester, Scott, Thune, Bennet, Warren, Vitter, and Sanders \nall had amendments to this bill. They were allowed to offer them, speak \non them, and they were either voted on or accepted, and then the bill \nwas passed by the Senate.\n  The bill then went to the House of Representatives, was amended and \napproved and then sent back to us. Again, here we have an example of a \ngood process.\n  I think part of the reason for the quality of the process is the \nbipartisan appreciation for early childhood education. I think it is \ntime to stop talking and vote on the Child Care and Development Block \nGrant.\n  I ask our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote for it.\n  I think all of us can support the idea of early childhood education. \nI am the product of one of the first early learning programs in the \nState of Tennessee. When I was a child, my mother started one of the \ntwo early preschool education programs in our county. She held class in \na converted garage in our back yard with 24 3-year-olds in the morning \nand 25 5-year-olds in the afternoon. It is hard to imagine a single \nmother dealing with that many children all at one time, but she did. As \nher son, I was able to experience kindergarten for 5 years. I may be \nthe only U.S. Senator who can say that.\n  I had an appreciation for early childhood education instilled in me \nby both my mother and father. Many of us in this chamber have a very \nsimilar appreciation. We may have different ways of trying to get to \nthat goal, but this legislation, the Child Care and Development Block \nGrant, provides $5.3 billion to families across the country, namely \nmothers, who are going to school so they can get a job, or who are \nworking so like the young woman in Memphis I mentioned earlier, can \nstand on their own two feet. This program helps them get started.\n  It is an important bill. I congratulate Senators Harkin and Burr and \nMikulski for their hard work on this. I urge my colleagues tomorrow \nafternoon to\n\n[[Page S5896]]\n\nvote yes on ending debate on cloture for the Child Care and Development \nBlock Grant.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have been on the floor now for a \ncouple of hours urging some of our colleagues to take heed of one of \nthe clear messages from this election. People all over the country \nvoted and spoke, and spoke clearly and loudly to say let's get to work, \nlet's work together, let's stop the gridlock and let's find common \nground to move our country forward.\n  Two hours ago I came to the floor to see about one of the most \nimportant pieces of legislation, the Keystone Pipeline, as Chair of the \nEnergy Committee in the Senate. I have had the great privilege of \nworking in a bipartisan manner with the Members of the Republican \nCaucus on this bill led by Senator Hoeven. I am the lead sponsor on the \nDemocratic side and there is a large group of my colleagues trying to \nconvince this body to have a vote, and a strong 60-vote margin, which \nis required for passage on the Keystone Pipeline. The Senator from West \nVirginia has come down and the Senator from North Dakota came down to \nspeak and the Senator from Montana joined me, and I want to announce we \nhave just gotten great word from the House of Representatives. \nEvidently they heard us speaking, and they have introduced our bill in \nthe House.\n  They have introduced our bill in the House, and the information we \nhave gotten is that they plan to pass it tomorrow. Let me just say \nhallelujah. I will say it again--hallelujah--because their bill would \nnever have passed this body and their bill would not have any chance of \ngetting the President's signature because it is Keystone Pipeline \nplus--or it was--but now the House has introduced the exact same bill \nas the Hoeven-Landrieu bill. We now have an even clearer path to \nvictory. I started 2 hours ago saying that I could see the path. I am \nnot sure everybody else could, but it is clear to me now that everybody \nis starting to see it, and I could not be happier.\n  I don't have the actual number of the House bill. I was just told \nthey introduced an identical bill, including the private property \nlanguage, which is absolutely essential to secure the 60 votes \nrequired. That is why I drafted it in the bill, that is why Senator \nHoeven insisted it be in the bill, and that is why we have it in the \nbill. I thank the House for keeping that language, which is important \nfor its ultimate passage. To me, it looks as though just in the last 2 \nhours lots of people are paying attention, and this is wonderful \nbecause this is an important step.\n  I believe I am also a cosponsor of Senator Alexander's bill. No \nSenator has worked harder in either party, and that is saying a lot \nbecause Senator Murray and Senator Mikulski have worked hard on this \nissue. Senator Alexander--a former Secretary of Education--has been \nceaseless and tireless in his effort on behalf of early childhood \neducation. He and I worked together when President Bush was President. \nI believe and I hope I am a cosponsor of his bill, and I look forward \nto helping him move that piece of legislation forward for a vote. There \nmight be a few things in there other Members disagree with, but that is \nour process. This is a critical issue for education and job creation as \nwell. We have the Keystone Pipeline on one end, which is as concrete as \nsteel, and then we have the soft issues, which are also important \nissues, such as economic development, which begins with early childhood \neducation. I am so proud to be an advocate of both bills, and I thank \nthe Senator for his leadership.\n  I urge my Members, who I believe have been very supportive on this \nissue--as have the Republican Members--to give cloture on his bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/12/senate-section/article/S5896-2", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5896-S5897]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I read with a lot of interest about the trip President \nObama made to China and his meeting with President Xi over what they \ncharacterized as an agreement on greenhouse gas emissions. I didn't \nhear any kind of agreement or anything that was said by the President \nof China, and they have been talking about this as a historic \nbreakthrough. That is exactly what they said in 2009, back when \nCopenhagen was center stage for the big annual party.\n  Just so people are aware of what goes on, the United Nations throws a \nbig party to get countries to agree to reduce greenhouse gases by a \ncertain amount. It is kind of interesting since at one of the first \nones I went to, I saw a good friend of mine from Benin in West Africa, \nand I said: You guys are not sucked into this thing--I know that for a \nfact--in terms of any kind of reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. \nWhat would happen to the economy of West Africa if you did that?\n  He said: This is the biggest party of the year, so we are all going \nto be here.\n  The same thing was true in Copenhagen.\n  Before I go into that, let's take a look at what they called a major \nhistoric breakthrough between the United States and China where the \nPresident pledged to reduce the emissions in the United States between \n26 and 28 percent by 2025. What did China agree to? First of all, even \nif they did agree to reduce emissions, we would not believe them \nbecause they don't end up doing what they say they are going to do in \nthese agreements. But China says that what they are going to do is stop \nincreasing their CO2 emissions by 2030. In other words, \nbetween now and 2030 they are going to continue to increase their \nlevels of CO2 emissions, which I agree they are going to do \nthat.\n  Next year--that is, a year from December--there is going to be \nanother big party that will be in Paris, and it will be the one where \nPresident Obama says he and President Xi from China have an agreement. \nBut, of course, that is going to be kind of like it was in Copenhagen \nback in 2009.\n  I remember 2009 so well. At that time I was--and I still am--on the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. We had a wonderful lady who was \nPresident Obama's appointee to be the Director of the EPA, and at that \ntime in Copenhagen they already had Congresswoman Pelosi, Senator \nBoxer, President Obama, and then-Senator John Kerry. All of them were \nover there promising the 191 countries that were in Copenhagen that we \nwere going to pass some kind of cap and trade.\n  After that was over, I went on a quick roundtrip to Copenhagen. I \nalways remember that trip because I was on the ground, after all that \ntravel, all of 3 hours, but I think it was the most enjoyable 3 hours I \never had because I was able to be over there as a one-man truth squad \nand to say to the people attending that great meeting there that the \nUnited States was not going to pass any kind of cap and trade. In fact, \nthe most votes they could have gotten in the Senate at that time--and \nthe Senate is changing, as we all know--was 30 votes. Obviously it took \na lot more than that to do that.\n  I went over as the one-man truth squad to tell them that they were \nnot telling the truth and that there is no way in the world we are \ngoing to pass it, and the same is true this time.\n  I will tell you what that meeting reminds me of. It reminds me of the \nmeeting that took place in China a couple of days ago with our \nPresident. It reminded me of the meeting that took place in Rio de \nJaneiro. This would have been in 1998, which was during the Clinton \nWhite House. They went over there and agreed and signed the Kyoto \nTreaty. They signed the treaty knowing for a fact that it would not be \nratified on this end. We know it takes a supermajority to ratify a \ntreaty in the Senate.\n  We had a resolution that was passed at that time called the Byrd-\nHagel resolution. It said that we would not ratify any agreement, such \nas Kyoto or anything like that, that didn't do two things--that were \neither harmful to the economy or didn't treat all countries the same. \nIn other words, we have to treat the reductions in China the same as \nthey would be in the United States. Of course the Kyoto Treaty didn't \ndo that. They knew at the time it was not going to be ratified. In \nfact, they were not even going to submit it for ratification to this \nbody, and that is exactly what did happen.\n  Let's look at what is happening in China right now. China is doing \npretty\n\n[[Page S5897]]\n\nwell. Between 2005 and 2011, China added roughly two 600-megawatt coal-\nfired powerplants per week. That is two powerplants a week. In 7 years, \nChina added more coal capacity to its fleet than existed in the entire \nUnited States. This is not going to be slowing down in the years to \ncome. By their own admission, they will be increasing between now and \n2030. China is expected to bring a new coal-fired powerplant online \nevery 10 days to give its economy the electricity it demands. So China \nis now the largest consumer and importer of coal in the world.\n  It is kind of interesting. We are going through the shale revolution \nin this country. Wonderful things are happening here. If we did not \nhave the resistance from the White House, we could be totally \nindependent from any other nation for the production of energy. China, \non the other hand, doesn't have the shale or the oil or the gas. They \ndon't have the coal, but they can import the coal, and that is exact \nwhat they are doing, and they will continue to do that. Stop and think. \nIf you don't like the arguments, just use logic. Why would China ever \nagree unilaterally to reduce its emissions when that is the only way it \ncan produce electricity?\n  I have talked to them before. I talk to people who smile and laugh at \nus and say: Wait a minute. You say you believe us when we say we are \ngoing to reduce our emissions? We applaud the United States. We want \nthe United States to reduce its emissions. If they do that, the \nmanufacturing base has to leave the United States and come to China.\n  So it is to their advantage to increase their emissions, and that is \nexactly what will happen.\n  We will talking about this a lot. I will chair the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee. I chaired that several years ago when the \nRepublicans were in the majority, and the Republicans are a majority \nagain. We will look at these things logically, and we will conduct \nourselves in a way that will not give the United States of America the \nlargest single tax increase in history.\n  Way back in the beginning, in 2001 and that timeframe, a lot of us \nthought there was actually some truth to the global warming issue, and \na lot of people are trying to resurrect that now. However, at that time \npeople didn't know what the cost was going to be. Shortly after that, \nit was the MIT, Charles River Associates, and the Wharton School that \ncame out with an approximation of what it would cost in the way of a \ntax increase for the American people if we were to adopt the global \nwarming provisions they wanted to adopt, which was between $300 and \n$400 billion a year.\n  If you follow that statement with a statement not from me and not \nfrom anyone else on the floor of the Senate but from Lisa Jackson, who \nwas the Director of the EPA and was appointed by President Obama--I \nasked her this question on the record: Let's say that we go ahead and \npass one of these resolutions.\n  The resolutions have been offered since 2002. The first one was \noffered by McCain and Lieberman and the last one by my friend Senator \nMarkey, who was then in the House.\n  I said: If we pass any of these--the largest increase in history--\nwould this have the effect of reducing greenhouse gases?\n  Her answer--Lisa Jackson, Director of the EPA, said: No, it would \nnot. She said the problem is in China, India, and Mexico, and that \nwould not affect the overall world emissions of CO2.\n  So for those who really believe there is going to be something that \ncomes before us in the form of a treaty--as our President has said will \nhappen in Paris 13 months from now--keep in mind that it is something \nthat will not happen, the same as it was not going to happen in \nCopenhagen. The American people are not ready. They have studied this \nissue. They know the science is not there, and what they want to do is \nto avoid any kind of a negative effect on our economy, and that is \nexactly what I think will happen.\n  I see my good friend is here, and I yield the floor.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in the days after the election this year, I \nheard a number of my colleagues--many from my State--in the House of \nRepresentatives and in the Senate talk with great exuberance about \nrepealing the Affordable Care Act. They call it ObamaCare; others call \nit the Affordable Care Act. I am not sure where they were over the last \nmonth or so, but I remember hearing Pope Francis I exhort his parish \npriests to go out and smell like the flock. Abraham Lincoln used to \ntalk about it. He would say he needs to go outside of the White House \nand get his public opinion baths.\n  I cite Pope Francis and President Lincoln because I think if my \ncolleagues had been out talking to real people and not going to \nfundraisers, not meeting with rich people at country clubs, and not \ngoing to the political rallies, but out talking to real people, they \nwould have seen what the Affordable Care Act has done.\n  In a moment, I wish to talk about a couple of numbers, but more \nimportantly, I want to share some stories. More than 500,000 people in \nOhio--and I think New Mexico, the Presiding Officer's State, is \nproportionately no different--have health insurance today who did not \nhave it 14 months--did not have it 1 year ago. An additional 97,000 \nyoung Ohioans--people who are just a bit older than the pages sitting \nhere; 18, 20, 25--are on their parents' health plans. Thousands of \nOhioans have been protected as patients, as people who are insured. \nWhen they would get sick and their coverage was expensive, they would \nbe dropped by insurance companies because they were too costly. Now \nthey have the consumer protections and they can't be dropped from \ncoverage. One million Ohio seniors now have gotten--with no copay and \nno deductible--free preventive care for osteoporosis and physician \nscreenings. One million Ohio seniors were able to get their screenings \nat no cost.\n  I have to tell a quick story. Every Thursday anybody from Ohio can \ncome to a coffee we have in our office at 8:30 a.m. when the Senate is \nin session. A family came by on one of those Thursdays. They were \npretty conservative. I assume they were not really voters for me, but \nit didn't matter. We were talking about a bunch of different issues.\n  The mother said: Thank you for the Affordable Care Act. See my son \nover there? He is 15 years old.\n  I said: Yes.\n  He was across the room. She said that when he was 7, he was diagnosed \nwith diabetes.\n  She said: I have counted, since he was diagnosed, 34 times that he \nwas turned down for insurance.\n  My family was turned down for insurance. Last week she told me I got \ninsurance because of the Affordable Care Act, because we don't allow \nunder Federal law now that that be done.\n  Let me share for a moment, if I could, a handful of letters I have \nreceived from people who have written me because of the Affordable Care \nAct.\n  Rachel from Hamilton County writes that since 2008 she and her \nhusband insured themselves through individual insurance. It had been \ndifficult, and at times, we had to go without insurance because of the \nincredibly high cost. I had also been denied insurance due to a \npreexisting condition. All of that changed since we were able to sign \nup via the healthcare.gov site. But imagine my surprise when I heard \nthe D.C. Circuit Court struck down subsidies people like myself \nreceive. I receive a subsidy because health insurance has become so \nexpensive that it is unaffordable for so many of us. I fear we will not \nbe able to afford insurance if we lose our subsidy.\n  Linda from Madison County, west of Columbus, writes: My husband and I \nhave personally benefited from the portion of the bill that did away \nwith lifetime maximum payments. I suspect it may have saved our \nretirement and kept us off welfare rolls. My colleague benefited from \nthe portion of the bill that allowed her son, who suffers from a \npotentially fatal illness, to stay on her insurance through age 26, at \nwhich time he graduated with a master's degree and got a job.\n  So this is exactly what this was written for--a 23-24-year-old \ngraduating from college, going on to get more school, getting a \nmaster's degree, preparing himself or herself for something better in \nlife. That young man could\n\n[[Page S5898]]\n\nstay on his parents' health insurance plan until he got a job at 27, \nwith insurance.\n  Chandra in Summit County writes that she recently commented to some \nfriends about the surprising benefits she was receiving under the \nAffordable Care Act, and one of her friends suggested she share her \nstory with her elected officials. She says: Because of the ACA, we were \nable to switch to my husband's insurance without worrying that I would \nnot be covered due to my pregnancy being a preexisting medical \ncondition. The ACA had a very real financial impact on my family.\n  The question is, Why do some Members of this Congress, all of whom, I \nbelieve--almost all of whom--are receiving government-sponsored health \ninsurance benefits from a good government insurance plan--why do they \nwant to deny it to people such as Chandra and people such as Rachel and \nothers.\n  Chandra says: I am not the type of individual who one would first \nthink of when thinking of beneficiaries of the ACA. I have a master's \ndegree, my husband and I both work full-time, and our employers also \noffer a full range of medical, prenatal, and optical benefits.\n  A few years ago, my husband and I decided to begin growing our \nfamily. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, there were no copays for my \nprenatal care, suggested immunizations or potential well visits. When \nour son was born, I immediately saw the true impact of the Affordable \nCare Act. Babies have many well visits and the cost of copays and \nimmunizations have been a burden to some of my friends. Thanks to the \nACA, we didn't have that financial burden. Thanks to a combination of \ngood insurance and the Affordable Care Act, I was the recipient of a \nvery nice, double electric breast pump. I also became the first \nemployee at my job to utilize the provisions of the ACA for nursing \nmothers. A few years later, 2 months before our second child was due, I \nhad the opportunity to take a better job.\n  She goes on.\n  The question again is, Why do they want--why do a bunch of \npoliticians who have good insurance, paid for by taxpayers--why do they \nwant to take these benefits away from the 25-year-old man who now has \ninsurance on his parents' plan before he finishes school and goes out \nin the workplace? Why do they want to take away the preventive care \nfamilies now have so when their daughter has an earache they can \nactually go to a family doctor because of the insurance rather than go \nto the emergency room? All of those things just beg the question, Why \nthe politics of repealing ObamaCare and repealing the Affordable Care \nAct and taking these benefits away from so many Americans?\n  Five hundred thousand Ohioans have insurance, 100,000 more young \npeople, a million Ohio seniors getting benefits with no copays and no \ndeductibles, preventive care that helps them live longer, healthier \nlives. That is really the question.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to commend the historic agreement \nreached yesterday between the United States and China, the world's \nlargest emitters of carbon pollution. This agreement is the latest and \nperhaps most consequential in a string of actions President Obama has \ntaken to fight climate change.\n  Today, we have hope. We have hope because this agreement puts the \nworld on a path towards solving climate change--hope because the \nworld's two largest emitters have found common cause in protecting \npublic health and economic opportunity for their citizens and for the \nworld and hope because we are once again reminded what American \nleadership and political will can accomplish.\n  President Obama and President Xi of China recognize that climate \nchange threatens our families, our jobs, our health, and our way of \nlife. They deserve our thanks, as does Secretary Kerry, for their \ntireless work and dedication to this cause.\n  We can solve this. We know what we need to do, and we know how to do \nit. Today we see what political will can accomplish. I am now more \nhopeful than ever that we can keep warming below 2 degrees Celsius by \nthe end of the century. This is the level scientists say is necessary \nto stay below in order to avoid catastrophic global consequences.\n  Together our two countries account for about 40 percent of the \nworld's greenhouse gas emissions. We have a responsibility to act early \nand to act together, and this agreement puts us on that path.\n  The agreement recognizes that the United States and China must take \nshort- and long-term measures to reduce emissions and encourage the \ndevelopment of clean energy. This represents a major shift for China, \nwhich had struggled to balance economic growth with growing pollution \nand has now agreed to cap carbon pollution for the first time ever. It \nis difficult to overstate what an important achievement this is, \nespecially a full year before the next round of international \nnegotiations in Paris.\n  As Secretary Kerry said today, this is a major signal to other \ncountries that they should also put forth ambitious emissions reduction \ngoals well before international negotiations start in 2015.\n  In addition, China has agreed to get a full 20 percent of its energy \nfrom zero emission sources by 2030. This means China will have to \ndeploy close to 1,000 gigawatts of new zero emission powerplants. This \nis the amount of electricity the entire United States currently \ngenerates and shows just how serious China is about addressing this \nproblem.\n  American leadership was crucial in forging these goals. It wouldn't \nhave been possible without the President's Clean Power Plan, which will \nreduce emissions from the power sector by 30 percent relative to 2005 \nlevels by the year 2030.\n  This agreement goes beyond even those ambitious targets, and in the \ncoming months and years, it will be important for this President and \nthe next to maintain and strengthen the Environmental Protection \nAgency's ability to protect Americans from harmful pollution.\n  Despite near universal consensus among climate scientists that the \nClean Power Plan is part of the solution to fighting climate change, \ntoday that plan is under attack in Congress. Right after the President \nannounced this historic agreement, climate deniers in Congress started \nrolling out every tired argument in the book. In fact, one of our \ncolleagues here has already dubbed this plan ``unrealistic'' and called \nit an ``ideological war.''\n  These claims are the last bastion of a hopeless cause that ignores \nwhat we see all around us--from farmers to fishermen to small-town \nmayors. Theirs is an untenable position, because poll after poll shows \nthat Americans do care about this issue. They care about it deeply. \nAmericans care because they know fighting climate change is really \nabout protecting their children's health, protecting economic \nopportunity, and leaving our children a world better than our own.\n  We are seeing the deniers' arguments collapse around them. One of \ntheir favorite tropes was to claim that U.S. actions are meaningless \nwithout action from China. Well, it looks as though that argument took \na fairly big hit yesterday.\n  In fact, the U.S. did act first by developing the Clean Power Plan. \nThe rules haven't even been finalized, but they are already giving us \nthe leverage to reach major international agreements.\n  As excuse after excuse fails, we will see climate deniers retreat to \ntired claims that anything we do to reduce pollution will hurt the \neconomy. But remember that we have heard these claims before. They were \nwrong then, and they are wrong now.\n  The list is long, so I will mention just a few.

Mr. President, I was on the floor earlier today. I have \nbeen on the floor since we convened back into session--our first \nsession since the election--and I am very heartened by what I have \nheard from colleagues such as the Senator from Hawaii, who just spoke, \nour colleague from Montana, who just spoke, our colleague from \nTennessee, who spoke; as well as the leadership particularly, including \nLeader Reid, majority leader-to-be Mitch McConnell, and the Senator \nfrom Texas, Mr. Cornyn, all of whom came to the floor and said they \nheard the message of the American people. The message is that now is \nthe time to stop the bickering, stop the fighting, stop the gridlock, \nand take action on issues the American people know are the right \nanswers for our country, focusing on building jobs and economic hope \nfor the middle class, in large measure because of this extraordinary \nopportunity for an energy renaissance that is underway as we speak--\nenergy jobs, petrochemical jobs, manufacturing jobs.\n  Our unemployment rate in south Louisiana is 3.5 percent. Our general \nunemployment rate is much lower than the national average and has been \nfor many years. But even in my State, with these very positive numbers, \nmiddle-class families are seeing their incomes stagnate, their way of \nlife not progressing, and their economic progress not moving forward as \nit should.\n  So while people are happy and doing well in some parts of the \ncountry--every leader came to the floor and said, we heard the American \npeople. We want jobs. We want economic opportunity. We want the middle \nclass put first. We want gridlock put last, and we want you all to roll \nup your sleeves and get the job done. That was the message.\n  So I came to the floor at 2 o'clock, the first minute we opened, to \nclaim the floor to say let's begin with trusting each other, moving \nforward, and passing the Keystone Pipeline which is a bill that has \nenjoyed bipartisan support and has the 60 votes on this floor for \npassage.\n  There is strong objection from the 40 Members who have been opposed. \nOf course they have a right to be opposed. We debated this for 5 years, \nbut the process is let's vote and let the process move forward. I am \nvery encouraged that in the 2 hours 15 minutes I have been on the floor \nthat the House of Representatives has actually heard this call and has \ndecided to introduce--the Rules Committee will be meeting tonight. I \nunderstand they want to introduce the identical bill to the Hoeven-\nLandrieu bill which will give a clear path. It is a stand-alone \nKeystone only with private property rights language that is very \nimportant to the Republican base but it is also very important to \nDemocratic Members, for me, personally, and my State, but for many \nrural States on the Democratic side. We cannot allow international \ncompanies to expropriate our properties here without due process. It \ncannot happen. I am the strongest advocate of building pipelines \neverywhere, but there are private property rights that have to be \nfollowed.\n  The language carefully drafted by Senator Hoeven and myself respects \nthe private property rights of American citizens. I understand the \nHouse is going to take that language and the straight-up, no \nattachments, no riders, no anything--except for the Keystone language \nas it is written in this file that is pending and pass that out of the \nHouse.\n  We have already made some progress in getting the Keystone project \nbuilt or moving forward. I want to put into the record a couple of \nheadlines of magazines and articles that I think help to underline or \nunderscore what I am trying to say.\n  The ``Science'' magazine editor-in-chief says, ``Time to move forward \non Keystone Pipeline.''\n  LABI: ``Twenty Louisiana Chambers of Commerce support Keystone \nPipeline.'' This is the Louisiana Association of Business Industry. It \nis a recent headline.\n  The Washington Post: ``On the Keystone XL pipeline, put policy ahead \nof politics.'' That is what we are doing today.\n  Illinois Review--this is one of the most important. ``AFL-CIO says \nKeystone XL is not just a pipeline but a life line.''\n  The largest labor unions in our country have rolled up their sleeves. \nThey are in this fight. They are telling us, Democrats and Republicans, \nbut mostly to the Democratic Caucus, because they are part of our base, \nvote for the pipeline. This is jobs for average middle-class working \npeople that we need. We deserve them, they say, in States such as \nyours, Mr. President, Ohio, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and in States such \nas Colorado, New Mexico, New York. I could go on and on. In West \nVirginia.\n  Remember, my State--not that we don't need good jobs but our \nunemployment rate is very low. We have jobs and opportunities pouring \ninto Louisiana and Texas, the energy coast of America. We are proud of \nit.\n  We are proud not only to produce these jobs and this energy but we \nare helping to fuel a renaissance of manufacturing in the Midwest. We \nare exceedingly proud of this. We are not just creating jobs for \nourselves, we are creating jobs for the Midwest, for the manufacturing \nrenaissance of America.\n  We are allowing for the expansion of the economy on the east coast \nand providing help for the west coast. It is what we do. It is what \nAmerica's energy coast does. No coast does it better than we do.\n  We are connecting to a partner, Canada, which is better for us in \nmany ways than Venezuela or even some of our friends in the Mideast, \nand we don't--not every friend is our friend in the Mideast. We are \ngetting oil from our best friend, our best trading partner, our best \nally, that has equal economic standards as we do and even some higher \nenvironmental standards than we do to create economic opportunity for \nour country.\n  I wanted to submit this for the record. There are no other Senators \nto speak. I am going to yield the floor in a minute.\n  We are still in a time of morning business until votes at 5:30.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON.

Mr. President, there has been quite a bit in the press \nabout defective exploding airbags. This is a part of a steering wheel \nwith the airbag deployed. In the steering wheel, the driver would be \nlike this with their hands on the steering wheel. When the impact \noccurs and the airbag is deployed, instantly, if you have seen that \nkind of impact on the airbag, because of the chemicals inside of the \nsteering wheel, it causes an explosion that comes out of already \nexisting holes in the metal that contains the airbag and it deploys the \nairbag like this so that the--in this case, the driver--in the case of \nthe passenger, the same, but it is not a steering wheel like this. That \nprotects and has saved countless, thousands and thousands of lives. The \nfact is that we now know there are four people in this country who are \ndead. There are a hundred who are injured. That is not including the \ninternational office, because of the defective airbag that has been \nmanufactured by a Japanese manufacturer. What its defect is is that \ninstead of the chemicals exploding to inflate the airbag, it explodes \nwith such force for all of this that is contained within the steering \nwheel before it explodes. There is metal.\n  When the chemical explosion occurs, it is supposed to go through the \nairholes and fill the bag. Instead, what\n\n[[Page S5900]]\n\nhas happened in the explosion, it is with such force that some of the \nmetal becomes shrapnel and comes through the bag and in effect becomes \nlethal projectiles that harm either the driver or the passenger.\n  For example, on this exploded airbag, I want you to see the size of \nthe hole that was ripped in this bag here. Here is another one. A hole \nthat was ripped. There are holes in other parts of the bag. Obviously \nthis isn't supposed to occur.\n  As a matter of fact, I visited with a constituent from central \nFlorida. This is a firefighter with a young wife and a young child. A \npiece of shrapnel, in this particular constituent's case, came into his \neye.\n  Therefore, in his occupation as a firefighter, he will not be able to \nfulfill the financial support for his family as a firefighter. Four \npeople in this country are confirmed dead, and 100 are injured.\n  We have a Federal agency that is supposed to be protecting us. It is \ncalled the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n  Recently, because of the attention brought to this matter, they have \ncome out and said they want these recalls, but the recalls first \nstarted out at about 4.7 million. It has been doubled to 7.8 million. \nIt is increasing all the time, and it is expected that it will be in \nthe range of 11 million in this country and 16 million recalls \nworldwide.\n  Normally, if you could get the recalls done, once it occurs--once the \ndefect is known--then the public is protected.\n  But it seems like, similarly to some dragging of the feet of \nautomobile manufacturers and their parts manufacturers in the past, \nthat is what is occurring here. What we are also seeing is a Federal \nagency that in this Senator's opinion has not been right up front, \nforward leaning, and aggressive to protect the public.\n  Thus, I have requested of the Secretary of the Department of \nTransportation to get in this and to do several things: First, to make \nsure that all these recalls are happening, and, secondly, if you are a \nperson who knows of the recall because the automobile manufacturer has \nsent you a letter, are you going to be wanting to drive around if they \ntell you they can't fix it immediately? Are you going to be wanting to \ndrive around in an automobile that could suddenly explode and cover you \nwith metal shrapnel, severely injuring or killing you? Of course not.\n  So where is the automobile manufacturer with regard to giving a \nloaner until that air bag can be replaced with a safe one or where are \nthey with regard to providing a rental car?\n  For the automobile company to say we will disable the airbag until we \ncan get the proper replacement, that is not a solution because often \nthe seatbelt and the airbag are designed to work in conjunction with \neach other to protect the safety of the driver and the passenger. So \ndriving around in a disabled airbag is not a solution. The solution is \nprompt replacement of the defective, lethal airbags or, until they can \nbe replaced, to give the customer another automobile that is safe.\n  Along the way, someone came up with the brilliant idea in the Federal \nagency that they were going to issue just regional recalls under the \nassumption that highway humidity, in fact, is one of the causes. They \ndon't know that, but that is one of the suspicious causes. But what \ndoes a regional recall do for the protection of the public? Aren't we a \nmobile society? If you say we have high humidity in my State of \nFlorida, in Texas and in other Southern States, aren't we a mobile \nsociety in which people in other parts of the country who own \nautomobiles come to our States? Of course we are.\n  Oh, by the way, how about some States in the north that have high \nhumidity in the summer--if, in fact, that is the cause. So to say that \na solution to the problem is a regional recall is totally ridiculous \nand the Federal regulatory agency should not be issuing these kinds of \nedicts if we are serious about protecting the public.\n  I have recommended, in a letter that has been signed by several of \nour colleagues to the Secretary of Transportation, Secretary Foxx, that \nhe start imposing the maximum fine allowed by law per day against the \nautomobile manufacturers for any days that are missed in replacing the \ndefective airbags so that people will not have to drive around in cars \nwith this defect.\n  While we were home over this recess during the election, I had an \nairbag explode and demonstrate its force. It is severe, and it is \nquick, as it has to be in order to protect the passenger in an \nautomobile accident.\n  But if that airbag is defectively constructed so that the explosive \nforce becomes like a hand grenade exploding and sending pieces of a \nmetal into the human body which the very device is supposed to protect, \nthen it is time for action. I hope the folks who are manufacturing and \ninstalling these defective airbags indeed are hearing these words of \nwarning.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I wish to spend a few minutes talking about a bill that \npassed the House that has 37 bipartisan cosponsors in the Senate that \ncame out of my committee. It is an important transparency item for the \nAmerican taxpayers called the Taxpayers Right to Know Act.\n  What most Americans don't realize is there is only one agency that \nknows how many programs it has--only one. None of the rest of the \nFederal agencies know how many Federal programs they are running. They \ncan't put them down, can't list them on a piece of paper.\n  The GAO has recommended for a long period of time--starting about 3 \nor 4 years ago--that we should be putting this down when we have the \ntruth in transparency and the truth in accountability act and the \ntransparency act with President Obama. We started this process where \nthe GAO would look for duplication and report it to Congress.\n  We have a bill that has passed unanimously in the House. It is a \nbipartisan bill that came with a voice vote out of our committee. All \nit says is that every agency ought to have to list their programs every \nyear so we can know what they are doing. GAO says that will help \nimmensely in terms of eliminating this $200 billion to $300 billion a \nyear in duplication.\n  We are going to have some unanimous requests later today, and we will \nhave a bill that is on the floor for which the majority leader has once \nagain filled the tree, which allows no amendments whatsoever on the \nbill.\n  This bill should be on the floor, should be standing on its own, and \nshould be passed because nobody can honestly object to the agencies not \nknowing what programs they run, not having a complete list.\n  I mean, it is counterintuitive that anybody would vote against it. It \nmakes no sense that we don't know that, and we know we need to have it. \nIt is an easy vote for everybody, and the majority leader isn't going \nto allow an amendment.\n  So we are not at a new day yet with this present majority leader. \nThis is something that helps every American--Democrat or Republican. It \nhelps us run our government more efficiently, more effectively. It is a \ngood-government amendment, and yet it is not going to be allowed.\n  I am disheartened that at the end of the year we could actually do \nsome things together that would actually allow us to accomplish real \nthings for the American people that will make a real difference in the \nlong run, but we won't because we don't want to have what was \nguaranteed to the minority when the Senate was set up--the right to \noffer amendments.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, one of the great honors of being a Member \nof the Senate is the participation and the confirmation process the \nConstitution dictates to us on Federal judges and other critical \nappointees, such as Cabinet members of the President.\n  I have today a distinct honor and privilege to recommend to all of my \ncolleagues in the Senate a Georgia lawyer who has been nominated by the \nPresident of the United States, with the approval of Senator Chambliss \nand myself, to the Northern District Court of Georgia. Her name is \nLeigh May. She is an unbelievably exciting, unbelievably knowledgeable, \nunbelievably accomplished individual.\n  She graduated from the Georgia Institute of Technology, one of the \ntop three engineering schools in the United States of America, with \nhonors, in 1993. Then, in 1998, she graduated from the University of \nGeorgia Law School with a juris doctorate degree, magna cum laude in \nher class.\n  From 1998 to 2000, she served as a law clerk to Judge Dudley H. \nBowen, Jr., of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of \nGeorgia. She is a partner in the Atlanta office of Butler, Wooten & \nFryhofer, LLP, one of the leading law firms in our State. Her practice \nfocuses on complex civil litigation in both the State and Federal \ncourts, and she is currently vice chair of the litigation section of \nthe Atlanta Bar Association. Her ABA rating is unanimously very \n``qualified.''\n  She is a very talented, very deserving person. I thank the President \nfor his nomination. I thank Kathy Ruemmler, who was his leading advisor \nat the time, for her cooperation in this nomination.\n  I close my recommendation to my colleagues by telling them this: \nPlease vote for the cloture motion today so we can vote for \nconfirmation tomorrow.\n  This May, I was asked to address the University of Georgia's \ngraduation ceremony in Athens, GA. After the speech I made, I went back \nto the dressing room in the green room, and the dean of the law school \ncame up to me and said: I just want you to know, Mr. Isakson, you \nnominated one of the smartest people to ever graduate from the law \nschool of the University of Georgia when you nominated Leigh May.\n  I can't think of a higher or a better recommendation, and I commend \nLeigh May to my colleagues of the Senate with my highest recommendation \nin the hopes that folks will vote today to go to cloture and vote for \nthe confirmation tomorrow to confirm Leigh May to the Northern District \nof Georgia.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume executive session.\n  Under the previous order, there will be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to a vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the Moss \nnomination.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as we return from recess for the remaining \ndays of the 113th Congress, I begin by congratulating my friend Senator \nChuck Grassley who will become chairman of the Judiciary Committee \nbeginning in the 114th Congress. We have a very good working \nrelationship, and I hope this will continue when he assumes the \nchairmanship in January.\n  We still have several weeks left in this Congress with much work left \nto be done. As history shows, when both sides work together, the \nlameduck session can be a productive one for filling vacancies on our \ncourts. In 2002, after the midterm elections, Senate Democrats worked \nto confirm 20 of President Bush's judicial nominees--all but one by \nvoice vote. In the 2006 lameduck session, after Senate Democrats won \nthe majority in the elections, Democrats agreed to confirm the 14 \njudicial nominations pending on the floor, but this package was blocked \nby a Republican Senator. In the most recent lameduck sessions, in 2010 \nand 2012, a total of 32 judicial nominees were confirmed. With the 2014 \nmidterm elections behind us, I hope we will, as the incoming majority \nleader suggests, ``clear the decks'' on pending business so that we can \nstart fresh next year.\n  Currently, there are 16 district court nominations that have been \npending before the full Senate for months and another eight district \ncourt nominations and one Court of International Trade nomination that \nwill be reported out of the Judiciary Committee before the end of the \nmonth. There are also six nominees pending before the Senate to fill \nvacancies on the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, two nominees to fill \nvacancies on the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, and three \nnominees to fill vacancies on the U.S. Tax Court.\n  Today, we will vote to overcome the needless filibuster of just two \nof the district court nominations that have been pending before the \nfull Senate since June, one of which will fill a judicial emergency \nvacancy in Georgia.\n  Randolph Moss is nominated to serve on the U.S. District Court for \nthe District of Columbia. The ABA Standing Committee on the Federal \nJudiciary unanimously rated Mr. Moss ``well qualified'' to serve on \nthat court--its highest rating. Since 2001, he has been a partner at \nthe law firm of Wilmer, Cutler, Pickering, Hale and Dorr LLP. He has \nalso served in various capacities for the U.S. Department of Justice. \nUpon graduating from Yale Law School, Mr. Moss clerked for Judge Pierre \nN. Leval on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New \nYork and for Justice John Paul Stevens on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Leigh May is nominated to serve on the U.S. District Court for the \nNorthern District of Georgia. She is currently a partner at the law \nfirm of Butler, Wooten & Fryhofer, LLP, in Atlanta, GA, where she has \npracticed since 2000. After graduating magna cum laude from the \nUniversity of Georgia Law School, she served as a law clerk to the \nHonorable Judge Dudley H. Bowen, Jr., of the U.S. District Court for \nthe Southern District of Georgia.\n  We still have much work to do to fill the 64 current judicial \nvacancies and 27 known upcoming vacancies on our Federal district and \ncircuit courts. Before the end of this Congress we could cut the number \nof vacancies on our district and circuit courts by one-third. To get \nthis done, however, we must stop delaying for delay's sake votes for \nconsensus nominees. Unless there is cooperation from Republican \nSenators, we will not have time to clear the Executive Calendar before \nadjournment. At the very least, I would hope that the Republican \nSenators who recommended many of the pending judicial nominees to the \nPresident will work within their caucus to get consent to confirm their \nnominees.\n  I hope all Senators will vote to put an end to the filibuster of \nthese nominations.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  unanimous consent agreement--S. 2280\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nthe leader's remarks on Tuesday, November 18, the Senate proceed to \nconsideration of Calendar No. 371, S. 2280, a bill to approve the \nKeystone XL Pipeline; that there be up to 6 hours of debate equally \ndivided between opponents and proponents; that upon the use or yielding \nback of time, the bill be read a third time and the Senate proceed to \nvote on passage of S. 2280; that no amendments, motions, or points of \norder be in order to the bill prior to the vote on passage; that the \nvote on passage be subject to a 60 affirmative-vote\n\n[[Page S5903]]\n\nthreshold. And I will include something. I ask that unanimous consent \nas in legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. President, we have been trying to get the Keystone Pipeline \napproved and on the President's desk since 2012. The leader on our side \nhas been the Senator from North Dakota, Senator Hoeven. We have all \nsupported this effort because we believe the State Department estimate \nthat roughly 42,000 jobs would be created once the pipeline is \napproved. If the oil doesn't come to the United States and is not \nturned into fuel here, it will be shipped to China.\n  Unfortunately, the majority has blocked this pipeline several times. \nIt has been stalled for way too long, so I am glad to see some progress \nis being made, albeit at this late date, after a dramatic election on \nNovember 4.\n  I ask the Senator to modify her request so that if the Senate passes \nS. 2280 and receives a bill from the House that is identical to S. \n2280, then the House bill will be read three times and passed with no \nintervening action or debate, and thus we can send this bill directly \nto the President without further action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator wish to modify the request?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Reserving the right to object.\n  I thank the Senator from Texas engaging on this matter today. I \nappreciate it. Most importantly, I appreciate the comments he made \nearlier on the floor about rolling up our sleeves and getting to work. \nHe was one of the first speakers this morning when our Senate convened, \nand I was here when he spoke. I wish to thank him for his very \ninsightful and courageous words that said we should roll up our sleeves \nand get to work.\n  He knows very well that I, and about 12 to 15 Members on our side, \nhave been working very hard with him and his leadership and all the \nMembers of the Republican side to move the Keystone Pipeline bill \nforward.\n  I think the Senator also knows the bill that Senator Hoeven and I \ndrafted respects this process, wanted to see the process complete, and \nacknowledges that the process is now complete and it is time to move.\n  So because the House heard these words today and has decided to \nintroduce the identical language in the Hoeven-Landrieu bill--and I \nthink the Senator will agree with me it is good news--it looks to me as \nif they are prepared to pass it. I can see no reason to object to what \nthe Senator from Texas is asking for, and I consider it extraordinary \nprogress.\n  I am very happy that I came to the floor at 2:00 p.m. to get the ball \nrolling and that I was here in time to hear the Senator's remarks: \nLet's get to work.\n  So let's get it done. We can get it done in the lameduck session, and \nI will accept the Senator's counter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request has been modified.\n  Is there an objection to the modified request?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, a point of clarification. It is my \nunderstanding the Senator from Louisiana is not objecting to my amended \nrequest and has not posed another modification. I believe the question \nis, is there an objection to my modified request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I will clarify. I want the record to reflect my \nremarks. The Senator from Louisiana has absolutely no objection to the \nHouse of Representatives taking the exact language from my bill with \nSenator Hoeven and passing it. Why would I object? I have been working \non this for 4 years. Why would I object to that? The record should \nreflect that. The Senator from Louisiana has no objection whatsoever--\nand I am encouraged that the House is taking the exact language of the \nbill that I carefully drafted with Senator Hoeven. He is the lead on \nthis bill. I am not. It is his bill. He is the lead. I am just the \nChair of the energy committee.\n  I wish to thank Senator Tester and others who helped to craft a bill \nthat the House would accept, and so I have no objection to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modified request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/12/senate-section/article/S5903-1", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5903]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

A bill to amend title 17, United States Code, with respect \nto the definition of ``widow'' and ``widower'', and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, over the past few years we have seen \nremarkable progress in one of the defining civil rights issues of our \nera--ensuring that all lawfully married couples are treated equally \nunder the law. In 2011, when I chaired the first Congressional hearing \nto repeal the Defense of Marriage Act, only five states, including \nVermont, recognized same-sex marriage. Following the Supreme Court's \nhistoric decision last month to not review decisions from several \ncircuits\n\n[[Page S5921]]\n\nstriking down same-sex marriage bans as unconstitutional, same-sex \ncouples in 35 States and the District of Columbia are, or will soon be, \nable to marry. This is welcome progress. In modern America, no person \nshould face discrimination based on the one they love.\n  Despite this' tremendous progress, there is still more to be done. As \nI said when the Supreme Court struck down Section 3 of the Defense of \nMarriage Act, ``All couples who are lawfully married under state law, \nincluding in Vermont, should be entitled to the same Federal \nprotections afforded to all other married couples.'' Court challenges \nwill continue in the remaining states that do not recognize marriage \nequality. In Congress, there are several steps we can take immediately \nto help ensure our federal laws treat all marriages equally.\n  Surprisingly, the Copyright Act, which protects our Nation's diverse \ncreative voices, still bears vestiges of discrimination. A provision in \nthe Act grants rights to surviving spouses of copyright owners only if \nthe marriage is recognized in the owner's state of residence at the \ntime he or she dies. This means that a writer who lawfully marries his \nor her partner in Vermont or California is not a ``spouse'' under the \nCopyright Act if they move to Florida, Georgia, or one of the other \nstates that do not currently recognize their marriage.\n  Congress should close this discriminatory loophole to ensure our \nfederal statutes live up to our Nation's promise of equality under the \nlaw. It is wrong for the federal government to deny benefits or \nprivileges to couples who have lawfully wed.\n  Today I am introducing the Copyright and Marriage Equality Act in the \nSenate to correct this problem. The bill, a version of which was \nintroduced in the House of Representatives by Representatives Derek \nKilmer, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, and Jared Polis, amends the Copyright Act \nto look simply at whether a couple is lawfully married--not where a \nmarried couple happens to live when the copyright owner dies. It will \nensure that the rights attached to the works of our Nation's gay and \nlesbian authors, musicians, painters, photographers, and other creators \npass to their widows and widowers. Artists are the creative lifeblood \nof our Nation, and our laws should protect their families equally.\n  Statutes like the Copyright Act, or laws governing the Social \nSecurity Administration and Department of Veterans Affairs which also \ncontain remnants of discrimination, are no place for inequality in our \ncountry. It is time to fix these outdated laws once and for all. I urge \nthe Senate to pass this important piece of legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2919\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Copyright and Marriage \n     Equality Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

The clerk will report the nomination.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Leigh Martin May, of \nGeorgia, to be United States District Judge for the Northern District \nof Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, would the Senator from West Virginia \nyield for a question? I would like to figure out what the floor process \nis because, as I follow all of this, it appears to be a colloquy \nbetween Senators Manchin, Toomey, Alexander, and Harkin. I am trying to \nget a sense for how long this colloquy might take so I know when I \nshould be back on the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I can't speak for others. I will be about 3 to 5 \nminutes.\n  Senator Harkin?\n  Mr. HARKIN. About the same--about 3 minutes.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Senator Toomey?\n  Mr. TOOMEY. A good 20 minutes.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I would say a good half hour.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. And Senator Alexander?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I will have about 20 minutes.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. All right. Now I know.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n\n\n                       Child Predator Legislation\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. First, I wish to thank my good friend Senator Pat Toomey \nfor working with me on this critical legislation to make sure our kids \nremain safe in every single school across this great country of ours. I \nam a father of three and grandfather of eight, and there is nothing \nmore important to me than protecting our children and grandchildren. \nOur bill is just common sense and has already passed by a voice vote \nwith not one in opposition in the House.\n  This legislation makes sure all employees who work with our students \npass a background check to make sure they have no criminal records or \nan abusive history. That includes everyone from principals, teachers, \nand secretaries to cafeteria workers and janitors.\n  Since January 1, 410 teachers across America have been arrested for \nsexual misconduct--just since January 1 of this year. That is more than \none teacher per day who has sexually assaulted a student. And that only \nincludes those who have been caught and detained. Do we dare wonder how \nmany predators we could have prevented from harming our students if \nthis bill had been passed years ago, including the outcome of the rape \nof a young West Virginia student named Jeremy Bell?\n  Twelve-year-old Jeremy was a fifth grade student from Fayette County, \nWV, who had been on an overnight fishing trip with his elementary \nprincipal when he mysteriously died from a head injury in 1997. Nearly \n8 years later, investigators discovered that Jeremy was raped and \nmurdered by none other than Edward Friedrichs, Jr. That was Jeremy's \nprincipal and supervisor on the trip. Thankfully, Mr. Friedrichs is now \nserving a life sentence in connection with Jeremy's death.\n  Although Jeremy's death is in and of itself disturbing, Mr. \nFriedrichs' past proves to be even more troublesome. Prior to working \nas Fayette County's principal, Mr. Friedrichs had previously been \ndismissed by a school in Delaware County, PA, on suspicion of sexual \nmisconduct. That school then helped him land a new teaching position in \nFayette County, WV. He taught for 26 years in West Virginia--26 years--\nbefore he was finally dismissed in 2001 when he was indicted for \nsexually abusing four boys--not one but four we know of.\n  This story is heartbreaking and simply unacceptable today. As a \nparent and grandparent and as a representative of the great State of \nWest Virginia, inaction is not an option.\n  There are more than 4 million teachers and school staff employed by \nour public school districts across the United States. There are \nmillions of additional workers who have direct access to students, \nincluding busdrivers, cafeteria workers, and janitors. Yet there is no \nnational background check policy in place for the people who work \ndirectly with our kids everyday. Even worse, not all of our States \nrequire checks of child abuse and neglect registries or sex-offender \nregistries. Not all of them. Some do. A lot don't. A recent report by \nthe Government Accountability Office found that five States don't \nrequire background checks at all--nothing at all--for applicants \nseeking employment in our schools. In addition, not all States use both \nFederal and State sources of criminal data, such as a State law \nenforcement criminal database or the FBI's Interstate Identification \nIndex.\n  Our bill would simply require mandatory background checks of State \ncriminal registries, State child abuse and neglect registries, an FBI \nfingerprint check, and a check of the National Sex Offender Registry \nfor existing and prospective employees.\n  Every child deserves to have at least one place where they feel safe \nand comfortable. For many of our kids these days, that place is at \nschool.\n  This is truly a commonsense bill that aims to help protect our kids \nfrom sexual assault predators or any individual who inappropriately \nbehaves in our schools.\n  It only makes sense that we do everything we can to allow our \nchildren to have one safe place in their life, and unfortunately that \nis our schools. If we can make even the smallest difference\n\n[[Page S5940]]\n\nin changing the outcomes of the lives of students like Jeremy Bell, \nthen we have done our jobs.\n  I hope all my colleagues will consider this when they are thinking of \nsaying: Well, we already do it in our State. Well, guess what, there \nare many States that do not for whatever reason. We are just asking to \nmake it uniform across our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 2083\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleague Senator \nManchin from West Virginia for his work on this, for being the lead \nDemocratic sponsor on this very important piece of legislation. I also \nthank Senators McConnell and Inhofe for cosponsoring the legislation. I \nwould like to thank every single Member of the House of Representatives \nbecause every one of them voted in favor of this legislation.\n  I have a number of reasons I want to cite and develop in a series of \narguments, Mr. President, but I understand the senior Senator from Iowa \nhas some time constraints, so I will be cooperative in that respect and \nI will make a unanimous consent request at this time. I think Senator \nHarkin will likely respond to that, and then I will make my arguments \nin favor of this legislation.\n  So at this time, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate vitiate cloture on the motion to concur in the House amendment \nto S. 1086, the child care and development block grant bill; that \nfollowing the disposition of the Moss and May nominations, the Senate \nproceed to a vote on the motion to concur in the House amendment; and \nthat following the disposition of S. 1086, the HELP Committee be \ndischarged from consideration of H.R. 2083 and the Senate proceed to \nits immediate consideration, the bill be read a third time, and the \nSenate proceed to vote on passage of H.R. 2083.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Alexander and myself, \nI do object to the unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will take about 3 minutes, and I would \nlike to thank my friend from Pennsylvania for being a gentleman and \nletting me have a few minutes to express myself before he gives his own \nexpression of support for this bill.\n  First of all, I appreciate Senators Toomey and Manchin's interest in \nthis issue. We have worked on this over the months to try to \naccommodate this legislation and to move it, but the issues are \ncomplex. The bill would affect millions of people. Members of the \neducation and civil rights communities and others have raised \nlegitimate concerns that we need to work through.\n  Members on both sides of the HELP Committee--which I am privileged to \nchair--have expressed hesitation about moving this absent constructive \nengagement by our committee.\n  Unfortunately, the Senator is asking us to take this bill without any \ndebate or committee consideration. That, again, is a formula for bad \nlegislation because recent steps have been taken by States to do their \nown background check requirements.\n  For example--I don't know this particularly--Pennsylvania recently \nenacted legislation to protect kids in school. We need to make sure \nthat whatever we do here does not interfere with what the States \nthemselves are doing. I think probably my colleague Senator Alexander \nwould address himself to that.\n  Again, this is the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act which \npassed 96 to 2 here in the Senate. In fact, the Senator from \nPennsylvania supported the bill. It went to the House. They changed it \na little bit, and then they passed it on a voice vote and sent it back \nto us. Now we are concurring in that vote in the House. Again, the bill \nis ready to go.\n  I would state for the record that back in September Senator Alexander \nand I had offered the Senator from Pennsylvania a hearing on the bill \nand then an immediate markup. We would go to markup. What I could not \nguarantee the Senator from Pennsylvania was that his bill would come \nthrough as he wrote it. The committee sometimes makes decisions to \nchange this or do that. I couldn't guarantee him that. What I could \nguarantee was a hearing and an immediate markup on the bill. But that \ndid not seem to be acceptable to the Senator from Pennsylvania, and I \nunderstand.\n  Again, I just want the record to reflect that I am not unsympathetic \nto the goals of Senator Toomey and Senator Manchin on this issue, but I \ndo believe it should go through the committee process. Since we are so \nclose--we have worked on this Child Care and Development Block Grant \nAct a long time and it passed 96 to 2. The House added one little \nthing, and they passed it by voice vote; we agreed to that. We are \nready to pass it and send it to the President.\n  We have had a great bipartisan working relationship on our committee \nthanks to our ranking member, Senator Alexander, who will be taking \nover the chairmanship of this committee in January. I couldn't have \nasked for a better partner. We have a very diverse committee, but we \npassed 18 bills through our committee and signed by the President in \nthe last 2 years. This will be the 19th.\n  So because we haven't had any markup on the amendment, that is why I \nam objecting--not that I am absolutely opposed to what the Senator is \ntrying to do. But I do believe people on my committee deserve to have \nsome input into this. Since I will be leaving, it will then be Senator \nAlexander's committee after the first of the year.\n  I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for allowing me to speak first, \nand I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Iowa for his \ncomments.\n  He cited I believe two principal arguments or concerns of his. One is \nthe fact that this legislation has not yet been considered by his \ncommittee, and the second is that there are States taking action in \nvarious ways that ought to be contemplated. I am going to address both \nof those, but I would like to begin at what is, for me, the beginning.\n  Let me start by stating that I am a strong supporter of the Child \nCare and Development Block Grant bill. I voted for this bill in March, \nand I look forward to voting for it again. But one of the very reasons \nI support the bill is this bill that we are going to vote on, the Child \nCare and Development Block Grant bill, addresses the issue that I am \ntrying to address in my bill, and that is protecting our children from \nsexual and violent predators.\n  I am the father of three young kids. I can't imagine anything more \nimportant than the safety and security of my kids, and I think most \nAmericans would agree with me on that. While the Child Care and \nDevelopment Block Grant bill takes an important step in that \ndirection--it requires criminal background checks on daycare workers. \nAnd because it does, it is going to provide a level of protection for \nthe 1.6 million children in federally-subsidized daycare--protection \nfrom the sexual and violent predators who might otherwise obtain jobs \nas childcare workers or employees of these daycare centers.\n  My question is this. Why are we stopping there? Why are we interested \nonly in protecting the kids in federally-subsidized daycare? The 1.6 \nmillion there deserve protection, but what about the 49.6 million \nchildren who are a little bit older? They are in our Nation's \nelementary, middle, and high schools. Don't they deserve the same \nprotection from sexual or violent predators as the really young kids \ndo? I think we need to act now to protect all of our kids. That is what \nI am trying to do here, and it is a very urgent matter.\n  Senator Manchin talked of the absolutely horrendous case of Jeremy \nBell. That is how I became aware of this situation. As Senator Manchin \npointed out, it began in my State, Pennsylvania, and the terrible story \nended in Senator Manchin's State.\n  When the perpetrator began molesting and abusing children, he was a \nteacher. He had molested several boys and raped one before the school \nfigured out what was going on. Unfortunately, the prosecutors never \nfelt they had enough evidence to actually bring a case. The school \ndismissed the perpetrator. But then, amazingly, this school in \nPennsylvania helped this\n\n[[Page S5941]]\n\nmonster get a job at a school in West Virginia. As Senator Manchin \npointed out, he worked in West Virginia in exactly the same capacity, \nwhich gave him an opportunity to abuse more kids, and this tragic story \ndidn't end until he raped and murdered a 12-year-old boy.\n  Well, justice has finally caught up with that teacher. He is going to \nspend the rest of his life in jail--which is, frankly, too good for \nhim. But that is way too late for Jeremy Bell, his 12-year-old victim. \nOf course, now we know Jeremy Bell is not alone.\n  As Senator Manchin pointed out already, this year over 410 teachers \nand other school employees have been arrested across America for sexual \nassault or misconduct with children--410. That is more than 1 per day. \nAnd let's be clear. These are the people about whom we know enough and \nhave enough credible evidence to actually have an arrest. How many more \nare out there but the prosecutors aren't confident yet that they can \nmake a case?\n  In contrast to the 410 that have happened so far this year, back in \nApril when Senator Manchin and I first came to the floor and asked the \nSenate to pass our bipartisan bill, at the time the number of teachers \narrested was only 130. In the time we have waited, we have gone from \n130 teachers and other school employees arrested for sexual misconduct \nwith children to now over 410. How much bigger does this number have to \nget before the Senate decides this is something we should address?\n  Every one of these 410 stories represents a horrendous tragedy. One \nis a child whose abuse began at age 10 and only ended when, at age 17, \nshe found herself pregnant with a teacher's child. Another is a \nteacher's aide who raped a mentally disabled boy in his care. Another \nis a kindergarten teacher who kept a child during recess and forced her \nto perform sexual acts on him. One teacher after another caught with \nimages of child pornography on their computer--child pornography \ninvolving children as young as 1 years old. It is unbelievable stuff.\n  It is important, especially in my home State of Pennsylvania. Twenty-\nfive of these arrested have been Pennsylvania teachers. A recent study \nfound that Pennsylvania is second in the Nation for teachers who have \nbeen investigated for sexual misconduct with the children who are \nsupposed to be in their care.\n  So I think we need to be acting now. We need to stop these tragedies. \nOur bipartisan bill, Protecting Students from Sexual and Violent \nPredators Act, takes an important step toward that goal. It works to \nensure that school employees we hire are not sexual or violent \npredators. In fact, the background check provisions in our bill are \nnearly identical to the background check provisions in the Child Care \nand Development Block Grant bill, the one that we are going to vote on.\n  Specifically, the protecting students act requires background checks \nfor all existing and prospective school employees who have unsupervised \naccess to children. The background checks must be thorough, covering \nfour databases, including national databases. That would be the FBI \nfingerprint check, the National Crime Information Center database, the \nNational Sex Offender Registry established by the Adam Walsh Act, the \nState criminal registries, and the State child abuse and neglect \nregistries.\n  Now, let me give a recent example from the State of Alaska which \nillustrates just how important this requirement is. On August 29, \nAlaska State troopers arrested a middle-school teacher in Kiana, AK. \nThe teacher had fled Missouri 4 years earlier to escape arrest.\n  Numerous witnesses accused the teacher over a decade of sexual and \nphysical abuse of his own adopted children. This is hard to talk about \nbecause it is so disturbing, but I think we have to face it. The fact \nis he raped and starved his children. The children literally burrowed a \nhole in the wall, stole food from the freezer, and heated it on a \nfurnace in their home just to survive. This monster was able to obtain \na teaching certificate in Alaska and teach in the State for 4 years.\n  When asked how this could have happened, the Alaska Department of \nEducation explained that Alaska only checks the State's criminal \nregistry when running a background check on teachers. So his name never \ncame up. Now, had Alaska searched the FBI criminal database, as my bill \nrequires, the school would have learned that this monster was a \nfugitive in another State.\n\n  The protecting students act forbids schools from hiring a teacher who \nhas committed certain crimes, including any violent or sexual crime \nagainst the child--whether a misdemeanor or a felony. This is necessary \nbecause all too often a predator will plead down to a misdemeanor when \nin fact he or she may be guilty of something more serious.\n  The legislation also bans the horrible practice of a school knowingly \nhelping a child molester obtain a new teaching job somewhere else so \nthat he becomes a problem somewhere else. This practice sounds \noutrageous, it sounds incredible, but it happens. In fact, it happens \nso frequently it has its own name. It is called passing the trash.\n  Finally, if the State fails to comply with these requirements, it \nloses a portion of its funds under the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act.\n  I mentioned earlier that this is a bipartisan bill. It is, to say the \nleast, bipartisan. Support is so broad, in the House it passed \nunanimously over a year ago, in October of 2013. It was introduced by \nDemocrat George Miller of California, cosponsored by two Republicans \nand seven Democrats, including Frederica Wilson of Florida, who herself \nserved as an elementary school teacher and principal for 20 years, \nCharlie Rangel of New York, and Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas. Here in \nthe Senate, it has the bipartisan support of Senator Manchin, Senator \nMcConnell, Senator Inhofe, and myself.\n  Child advocates across America have endorsed the bill. The National \nChildren's Alliance, which oversees national child advocacy matters, \nthe Children's Defense Fund, the National Center for Missing and \nExploited Children, the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Rape have all \nendorsed this bill. Law enforcement and prosecutors all support this \nbill. The Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association supports it, as \ndo the Association of Prosecuting Attorneys and the National District \nAttorneys Association.\n  Teachers support this legislation--the American Federation of \nTeachers, the Pennsylvania School Board Association.\n  So more than 1 year after the House passed this bill unanimously, why \nhave we refused to act in the Senate? Well, some have argued that the \nFederal Government doesn't need to act because we can leave it to the \nStates. Some States have worked to address this problem to the extent \nthat they can. The Senator from Iowa mentioned that my home State of \nPennsylvania has recently enacted legislation that deals with it. This \nis true--much to the credit of State Senator Tony Williams, a Democrat, \nand State Representative Dave Maloney, a Republican.\n  The bill makes much-needed reform to strengthen background checks and \nban passing the trash within Pennsylvania. But as my friend, \nPennsylvania State Senator Tony Williams, explained, under the U.S. \nConstitution States cannot address the problem of child predators being \npassed across State lines. The jurisdiction of Pennsylvania ends at the \nPennsylvania borders. There is nothing Pennsylvania can do to make it \nillegal for someone in another State to send into Pennsylvania a \npredator of this sort. Of course, the example of Jeremy Bell is just \nexactly one such case.\n  Another example is this. Recently in Las Vegas, NV, a kindergarten \nteacher was arrested for kidnapping a 16-year-old girl and infecting \nher with a sexually-transmitted disease. The same teacher had molested \n6 children, all fourth and fifth graders, several years before while \nworking as a teacher in Los Angeles. The Los Angeles school district \nknew about these allegations. How do we know they knew? In 2009 the \nschool district had recommended settling a lawsuit alleging the teacher \nhad molested children.\n  The Nevada school district specifically asked if there had been any \ncriminal concerns regarding the teacher. The Los Angeles school \ndistrict not only hid the truth, but they provided three references for \nthe teacher.\n  Had my bill banning passing the trash been the law, maybe that 16-\nyear-old child might have been spared.\n\n[[Page S5942]]\n\n  There is another fundamental reason I think the Federal Government \nhas to act; that is, it needs to be accountable to the American \ntaxpayer. When the Federal Government gives billions of dollars to \nStates to help pay for the salaries of people who work with children, \nthe Federal Government has a duty to make sure it is not paying the \nsalary of child molesters. It is a basic accountability that every \ntaxpayer, I would think, should demand.\n  Again, in this regard, our protect all students bill is nearly \nidentical to the child care and development block grant bill that we \nare going to be voting on. Both the child care and development block \ngrant bill and our protect all students bill act to create what is a \nvoluntary mechanism for States to enhance their security. Both bills \nprovide that if the State accepts Federal funds, the State government \nmust pass the laws or regulations providing for the criminal background \nchecks of persons who will work with children. Both bills provide that \na State's compliance is essentially voluntary. A State that declines to \nimprove its background checks forgoes Federal funds. Under the child \ncare and development block grant bill, the State loses 5 percent of the \nfunds under that bill. Under our protecting students bill, the State \nloses funds under the Elementary Secondary Education Act. Thus, both \nbills have the same worthy goal, the same principle of accountability \nfor Federal funds. They even have the same basic enforcement mechanism.\n  Both bills were passed unanimously by the House of Representatives, \nthe child care and development block grant bill 2 months ago on \nSeptember 15, the protecting students bill over a year ago on October \n22, 2013. If one bill has legal problems for being passed, so does the \nother, but in fact neither bill should be blocked. They both take the \nsame approach and they both provide an urgently needed measure of \nsecurity for our kids.\n  Others have argued and we heard the senior Senator from Iowa make the \nargument that the Senate should wait and let the committee of \njurisdiction, the HELP Committee, consider the bill first. Well, it has \nbeen over 1 year now that the HELP Committee has chosen not to take any \naction on this bill. Senator Manchin and I have been working for months \ntrying to pass this urgently needed legislation, but we have never been \nable to make progress with the committee.\n  On April 10 of this year Senator Manchin and I asked unanimous \nconsent to pass our bill. The committee chairman objected. Next, the \ncommittee assured Senator Manchin and me that they would work with our \nstaff and the committee would vote on the bill in July. The committee \nscheduled a vote on our bill in July, posted an announcement on its Web \nsite that it was going to have a markup on this bill, and then at the \nlast minute the committee removed our bill from the agenda, had no \nconsideration of it, denied us a vote and we never got an answer as to \nwhy. Again, Senator Manchin and I were assured that the committee would \nvote on this bipartisan bill. We were told the committee would work \nwith our staffs during the 5-week recess in August and provide a vote \nin September. But then the committee ignored our staffs during the \nAugust recess and there was no such consideration in September.\n  Now here we are 7\\1/2\\ weeks after we went on recess in September and \nI still have no confidence that the committee is going to take this up \nand move this legislation. In the meantime, of course, child predators \nhave not been at rest. They have been moving on to new victims. Every \nday brings another story of a teacher arrested, another family whose \nchild has been shattered and a family who has been torn apart by grief \nand betrayal.\n  I think the children of America have waited long enough, and I say no \nmore waiting, no more promises about jurisdiction and process and \nprocedures that don't take place, no more passing child molesters on to \nnew schools and new victims, no more defenseless kids such as Jeremy \nBell falling victim to other child predators, no more excuses for \navoiding an up-or-down vote that passed the House unanimously.\n  Let's act now. Let's protect all our kids. Let's act now to protect \nthe 1.6 million kids in the federally subsidized daycares as the child \ncare and development block grant bill does. Let's pass that. I am for \nthat. But let's also protect the 49.6 million kids who are in our \nelementary and middle and high schools. We can do this. We can do this \ntomorrow. We can do this tomorrow. We can pass them both tomorrow if we \njust have a vote, and we would send two bills to the President's desk. \nI am quite confident he would sign them both. He would sign the child \ncare and development block grant bill and he would protect those 1.6 \nmillion kids and I am confident he would sign the Protecting Students \nFrom Sexual and Violent Predators Act, and then we would be protecting \nthe 49.6 million slightly older kids.\n  I urge my colleagues to act now and get on with a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I applaud the Senators from \nPennsylvania and from West Virginia for their concern. Of course, every \nsingle Senator would like, as the Senator from West Virginia said, to \nmake sure every single child is safe in every single school.\n  The question in my mind is, How does one do that? My mind goes back \nto a particularly horrific shooting in a school in the early 1990s and \nthe country was revulsed by it and Congress acted. We are going to make \nevery single school safe. So Congress passed the Gun-Free School Zones \nAct in about 1990, and the Supreme Court in a few years held it \nunconstitutional under the commerce clause, which isn't a problem here, \nbut I opposed that then--I was U.S. Education Secretary then--because \nthe way to make every child and every school safe is not the job of the \nU.S. Senate and U.S. Department of Education. That is not the way to do \nit.\n\n  We have 40 million children, right. We have 100,000 schools, correct. \nWe have 14,000 school boards. We have 100,000 principals. What this \nproposal would do is to put the U.S. Department of Education and the \nU.S. Congress--which currently has about a 10-percent approval rating--\nin charge of making every single child in every single school safer \nthan the local school board can, than the local legislator can, than \nthe local Governor can, than the local community can, than the parents \ncan. If we want safe schools, that is the job of parents, communities, \nschool boards, and States. It is not a duty to be bucked upstairs to \nthe Senate and the Department of Education. That doesn't make Sam \nHouston Elementary School in Lebanon, TN, any safer. I don't think many \nparents would go home feeling better tonight in my hometown if they \nknew it was the Senate they were counting on to make their child safe \nin their school. Of course this is the right goal, but there is a \nbetter way to do that. There is a better way to do that.\n  The reason the Senator from Iowa and I offered to the Senator from \nPennsylvania and the Senator from West Virginia an opportunity to have \na hearing and a markup on this bill in September was we think we have a \nbetter idea, and that was simply to take the very well-meaning impulse \nthat they have and change the direction in a fundamental way, which was \nto say instead of making every one of our 100,000 schools do this, and \ntelling them how to do it, we will enable them to do it by giving them \naccess to all the Federal registries by allowing them to use Federal \ntitle II money to do it, to use title II money for training. We thought \nwe had a better way to get to the same goal, which is to make every \nsingle child safe.\n  All of us are horrified by these stories. So the question is, What is \nthe best way to deal with it. Some people say let Washington do it.\n  I just went through a little reelection campaign in Tennessee. I \ndon't think I had one person come up to me and say: Why don't you let \nWashington tell us what to do about the employment practices in our \nlocal schools. I don't think I had a single person come up and say: I \nthink you guys in the Senate care more and know more about how to make \nevery single child in every Tennessee school safer by your actions in \nWashington. They know better than that. In fact, they came up to me and \nsaid: Tell Washington to stop telling us what to do about our academic \nstandards, Common Core. This is Common Core for employment practices. \nStop\n\n[[Page S5943]]\n\nWashington from telling us what to do and about what the curriculum \nought to be. Stop Washington from telling us what to do about training \nour teachers, about evaluating our teachers, about how long our class \nsessions ought to be, about how large our classes ought to be. We have \nproposals that come through this same committee. The President has one \ninvolving preschool that would create a national school board for \npreschool education. Class size, teacher salaries, length of school \ndays, all those things would be decided by people with wisdom in \nWashington. I reject that. I would particularly object to that when I \nwas Governor of Tennessee, which I was for 8 years.\n  If there were a horrific case in Tennessee of sexual predation in one \nof the schools, I wouldn't have phoned Washington to find out what to \ndo about it. I would have called the legislature into session and done \nsomething about it. If I were to have found that I didn't have access \nto the Federal registries or any central registries, I would then have \nsaid to my U.S. Senator: Why don't you give us these tools to do it--\nwhich is what I would propose to do.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a summary of a \nproposal I would make that would help every one of our 100,000 schools \nto do a better job of dealing with employment practices and criminal \nbackground checks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     Protecting Student Safety Act\n\n       Purpose: To protect student safety by allowing States to \n     use federal funding under the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act to establish, implement, or improve policies \n     and procedures for implementing background checks of school \n     personnel.\n\n\n                           What the Bill Does\n\n       Allows States or local school districts to use federal \n     funding under Title II of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act to establish, implement, or improve policies \n     and procedures on background checks for school employees to:\n       conduct searches of appropriate State and Federal criminal \n     registries, as determined by the State;\n       implement policies and procedures that prohibit the \n     employment of individuals who either refuse to commit to a \n     background check, make false statements, or have been \n     convicted of certain violent or child abuse related crimes, \n     as determined by the State;\n       establish implement, or improve policies and procedures \n     concerning the timely disclosure, notice, and appeal of \n     background check results;\n       develop, implement, or improve mechanisms for assisting in \n     the identification of and response to incidents of child \n     abuse, including by providing training and development for \n     school personnel; and\n       implement any other activities determined by the State to \n     protect student safety.\n       Precludes any private right of action if a school or school \n     district is in compliance with State regulations and \n     requirements.\n       Allows States and local districts to charge limited fees to \n     school employees for the costs of processing and \n     administering background checks, as required by State law.\n\n\n                      Reasons to Support this Bill\n\n       Support what most States are already doing--According to \n     GAO, 46 States already require background checks of some kind \n     for all public school employees and 42 States have \n     established professional standards or codes of conduct for \n     school personnel.\n       Rather than mandating a one-size-fits-all approach for \n     14,000 local school districts and 100,000 public schools, \n     provides States with flexibility to establish, implement, or \n     improve background check policies and procedures that best \n     meet State and local needs.\n       Supports State and local efforts to increase reporting of \n     child abuse, limit the transfer of school personnel \n     implicated in abuse, as well as provide training on how to \n     recognize, respond to, and prevent child abuse in schools.\n       It will protect schools and local school districts from \n     civil litigation resulting from background check decisions \n     that are otherwise in compliance with State regulations and \n     requirements.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. This is a surprising development for me. I understand \nthe terrible nature of the problem, but I think it is so important that \nwe not lead the American people into thinking we could solve these \ncommunity problems by asking Washington to do it. If we have an \nobstacle here, if there is no access to a registry, let's change that. \nI would love to have a Toomey-Manchin bill with their names on it to \ngive every single school board, 100,000 schools the tools they need to \ndo the job. But they should be accountable for it, not the Senator from \nTennessee. They should be accountable for it.\n  ADM Hyman Rickover was the leader and inventor, really, of our \nnuclear Navy, and our nuclear Navy has never had a problem--never had a \ndeath I should say--from the reactors on our nuclear submarines. I \nthink the reason is because Admiral Rickover hired every one of the \ncaptains. He told them: You have two responsibilities, one is the ship \nand one is the reactor. If something happens to the reactor, your \ncareer is over. I think putting the captain on the flagpole and making \nit clear whose job it is to be accountable for safe schools is a big \npart of it.\n  If we make it look as though somehow the Senate takes care of making \na school in Pennsylvania or West Virginia or Tennessee safe because we \npassed some bill and wrote some regulation and caused everybody to fill \nout a lot of forms in the 46 States that already have criminal \nbackground checks of their own, then I think we have done a disservice. \nI think we have done a disservice. We had a recent example on \nlegislation in our committee on compounding pharmacies. We had a \nterrible situation where a compounding pharmacy in Massachusetts, \nacting like a manufacturer, produced sterile products that weren't \nsterile, and as a result in Tennessee and many other States people were \ninjected with unsterile drugs and they caught meningitis and they died. \nIt was an awful disease and a terrible thing to happen. Part of the \nproblem was who was on the flagpole, who was in charge. Was it the Food \nand Drug Administration or was it the State Control Board in \nMassachusetts?\n  Our legislation sought to clean that up and to make it clear that \nsomeone was accountable. I think the persons accountable for safe \nschools are the principal of the school, the local school board, the \nparents, and the students in that community. The rest of us can give \nthem tools and remove obstacles and get out of the way. But the idea \nthat we should pass a law, tell them how to do it, and inevitably write \nthese complicated regulations that they have to fill out, that is not \ngoing to make every single child in every single school safer.\n  As I said when I began, the Senator's passion is evident. I respect \nthat, and I respect him as a Senator. We don't have two better Senators \nin our body than the Senator from West Virginia and the Senator from \nPennsylvania. They know I feel that way.\n  But I have a profound difference of opinion about this. I will say \nthat if they wanted to consider this with the child care and \ndevelopment block grant, they have plenty of opportunity to do that. We \nhave had a lot of complaining on our side of the aisle about the lack \nof what we call a regular order.\n  We say we have not been allowed to offer amendments, and that has \nbeen true. There has been a record-low number of amendments in this \nsession of Congress, and the distinguished Senator in the chair has \nbeen among those who have pointed that out. But in this case, this was \na model of how we should consider legislation. It was considered in the \ncommittees in the House and the Senate. This amendment was not offered \nin the committees in the House and the Senate. It then passed the \nSenate committee and came to the floor.\n  In March we had an open amendment process for anything that had to do \nwith the bill. Fifty amendments were filed, and 18 amendments were \nconsidered and agreed to. There was no filling of the tree. There was \nno motion for cloture. There was simply an open amendment process and a \nvote. This amendment could have been offered then.\n  Let's put that off to the side. I think the more important discussion \nwe need to have is who is in charge of these schools? Who should create \nthe academic standards? If the U.S. Department of Education should be \nresponsible for determining what the employment practices are in \n100,000 public schools, then there should be no objection to the U.S. \nDepartment of Education ordering every school in America to adopt the \nCommon Core or ordering every school in America to have a class size of \nX or ordering every school in America to pay teachers this much or \ndetermining, as this current Department of Education tries to do, how \nyou should evaluate teachers in Pennsylvania, New Mexico, or Tennessee. \nI don't think that is the way our country was set up. I don't think \nthat respects our constitutional framework. I don't think it is \nconsistent\n\n[[Page S5944]]\n\nwith the spirit, at least, of the 10th Amendment to the Constitution.\n  I do not think the American people--and I know Tennesseeans don't--\nwant Washington telling them how to run schools, and there is nothing \nmore fundamental about running schools than telling 100,000 schools and \ntheir school boards and their Governors and their legislators and their \nparents what their employment practices ought to be. Plus, I don't \nthink it will make the school safer. I think what will make it safer is \na bill that has the courageous attention--as the Senator from \nPennsylvania and West Virginia have given to the problem--that would \ngive all those local organizations an opportunity to access the \nregistries that are available, to deal with people who go across State \nlines, give them access to title II funding so they would have money \nfor that and money for training. So it is a choice between mandating \nand enabling. I am on the side of local school boards, not a national \nschool board.\n  While I respect the effort of the Senators and I believe the subject \nis urgently important for our country, I would prefer to see this \nmatter considered with the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, \nwhich will be the first order of business in the new session of \nCongress, and I am chairman of that committee. Let's have a discussion \nabout the best way to do that. Do a majority of the Senators on the \ncommittee really think Washington can do a better job of making every \nsingle child and every single school safe by mandating and ordering and \nregulating or does a majority of the committee in the Senate think that \nthe Senators have called to us an important need where we might step in \nand make it easier for local school boards and State departments of \neducation to update their programs--46 States already have them--and \nuse Federal dollars to implement those programs? I prefer the latter; \nthese Senators prefer the former. That is well worth discussing in the \ncommittee, and I look forward to doing that.\n  I came to the floor tonight to make clear that I see this as a \nfundamental difference of opinion, one that deserves attention, to show \nmy respect for the Senators from Pennsylvania and West Virginia, and to \noffer the framework for what I think is a better idea for making every \nsingle child in every single school safe.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I find myself in the unusual position of \ndisagreeing with the senior Senator from Tennessee. I have so much \nrespect for the Senator. We are in agreement far more than we are in \ndisagreement, but we do disagree about this, and I feel compelled to \naddress several of the issues the Senator from Tennessee raised, and \nthen I will be finished. I know there are other Senators who would like \nto speak.\n  First of all, I think it is very clear that my bill no more creates a \nnational school board than the child care and development block grant \ncreates a national school board for childcare centers. It is the exact \nsame set of circumstances, the exact same protections, and it is \nprovided by the Federal Government.\n  I don't understand why, if it is OK for the Senate and the Federal \nGovernment of the United States to ensure greater security for children \ndaycares, it is somehow not acceptable to provide that same level of \nsecurity to kids who happen to be a little older. That is what we are \ntalking about. I don't understand that.\n  The other point I would make is that, in fact, both bills--the child \ncare and development block grant bill and my bill, the Protecting \nStudents from Sexual and Violent Predators Act--are voluntary. Neither \none has the power or attempts to compel a State to do a thing. It says: \nThis is what we want you to do. If you don't, you are going to lose \nsome funding, but that is it.\n  So there is absolutely a mechanism that creates an incentive, but we \ndon't have the constitutional power to actually enforce it. Neither \nbill does. Both bills use the exact same mechanism to encourage \ncompliance with a standard that will ensure greater safety and security \nfor our kids.\n  Furthermore, I suggest that we absolutely have a responsibility to be \nconcerned with how the money is spent. The taxpayers whom we represent \nexpect us to provide some oversight and insist that there are some \nstandards in the way the moneys are spent. That is a reasonable \nexpectation for the Federal Government.\n  In addition, there is an element of this problem that can't be solved \nby any given State, and that is the cross-border nature of the problem. \nSpecifically, the case of Jeremy Bell illustrates this perfectly--\ntragically but perfectly--and that is when a teacher leaves one State \nand goes to another State and commits the atrocities on a new set of \nvictims. There is nothing the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania can do to \nmake it illegal for another State to have a school that sends a letter \nof recommendation. The powers of Pennsylvania end at the border of \nPennsylvania, and that is the case with all 50 States. So it seems to \nme that this, like other circumstances, simply requires a Federal \nsolution.\n  Finally, I will say that my constituents are in many ways very \nskeptical of the Federal Government. There is no doubt about that, as \nSenator Alexander observed with his constituents. But many of them are \nshocked to learn we don't have background-check requirements such as \nwhat my bill contemplates and what the child care and development block \ngrant bill does. They are shocked to discover this is not already the \nlaw. I think they would feel safer if they knew it was the law.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the Senator from Rhode Island is here, \nand it is his turn. I wish to make a few comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. There are a couple of differences. Under the \nParliamentarian's ruling, this amendment is not under the block grant \nbill. No. 2, all the funding for the vouchers that go to mothers who \nmay use the block grants for daycare while they go to work, which is \nwhat our bill is about, all comes from the Federal Government.\n  The whole principle of that bill--it is a pretty good Republican \nbill, in my view--is that there is a lot of flexibility. In fact, we \nhad a pretty good debate about the criminal background checks in our \nbill. I would have preferred to have given the States more flexibility \nfor the reasons I have stated, but I agreed to what was done. It has \n100 percent Federal funding, whereas the Federal Government only funds \n10 percent of our schools.\n  The penalties for not taking the Federal orders for what your \npersonnel practices ought to be are much more severe in the bill from \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania. He would cause you to lose 10 percent of \nyour school funding. Under the childcare block grant, you would lose 5 \npercent of the Federal funding. But the issue remains the same, and it \nis a good issue.\n  I hear it on our committee. The Senator from Rhode Island is on that \ncommittee. He has heard Senator Harkin and me argue about this. You can \nmake a very good argument to say that we provide some money, therefore \nwe ought to write some rules. So we are going to write the rules for \npersonnel practices; we are going to write the rules for academic \nstandards--also called Common Core; we are going to write the rules for \nqualifying how teachers should be evaluated. Even in our preschool \nprograms, we are going to say what the rules are for class size and the \nlength of the school day.\n  That sounds very good, but when you operate a school, you say: Who \nare these people? They might give me some tools, which we could do--and \nI would propose we do--or they might allow us to use some Federal money \nso we can have a better personnel practice, but we really don't think \nit works. We don't think that every time there is a horrific problem in \nour community, the Federal Government should step in and tell us how to \nfix it.\n  That is a really big difference, and it is particularly a big \ndifference with schools, and it is a debate that will likely go on for \nsome time.\n  I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for his patience.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I found the discussion edifying, and it was time that \nwas well spent.\n\n[[Page S5945]]\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. President, we are now reconvened after the election recess, and I \nam back on the Senate floor for the 79th consecutive week of Senate \nsession to draw the attention of this body to the growing threat of \nglobal climate change.\n  I will first congratulate my Republican colleagues on achieving a \nmajority in the Senate in the coming Congress. With control of the \nHouse and a majority in the Senate, Republicans now have great power in \nCongress. As the well-known saying goes, however, ``with great power \ncomes great responsibility.''\n  The hallmark of the Republican minority was obstruction--often \npointless obstruction, obstruction for obstruction's sake. A rational \nand fact-based focus on the issues has not been, to put it mildly, \ntheir hallmark. That was their choice, and it is the privilege of the \nminority party in the Senate to behave that way. The minority party in \nthe Senate can choose to simply make themselves antagonists with no \npolicy responsibility. I have to say they did an amazing job of that. \nBut now my colleagues have a majority, and they have the power and the \nresponsibility that comes with that beginning in January.\n  The touchstone of responsibility is to be responsible. I will concede \nthe Senate could actually become a better place if the new majority, \nwhen it comes in, chooses to be responsible and the uniquely partisan \nobstruction that characterized their role as the Senate minority passes \naway as they move into the majority.\n  A key test to this, however, will be whether the Republicans here in \nthe Senate choose to become responsible about climate change; about \nwhat carbon pollution is doing all around us, to our atmosphere and to \nour oceans; about what happens when carbon concentrations in the \natmosphere that have varied between 170 and 300 parts per million for \nas long as we have been a species on this planet suddenly surge to 400 \nand beyond; about what happens when scientific laws that have been \nunderstood since Abraham Lincoln was riding around Washington, DC, in \nhis top hat begin to impose their inexorable effects upon this world.\n  In the minority, they pretended it wasn't real. Some even said \nclimate change was a hoax. Many said they were not scientists and so \nthey couldn't do anything about it. I would note they are not \ngynecologists, either, but many have no hesitation about trying to \nregulate that area.\n\n  No one would work on doing anything serious about carbon dioxide \nemissions. It was not always this way. Republican Senator John Warner \nwas the lead sponsor of the Warner-Lieberman climate bill. Republican \nSenator John McCain ran for President on a solid climate change \nplatform. Republican Senator Susan Collins coauthored an important cap-\nand-dividend climate bill with Senator Cantwell. Republican Senator \nMark Kirk voted for the Waxman-Markey cap-and-trade bill in the House \nof Representatives. Republican Senator Jeff Flake was an original \ncosponsor of a carbon fee bill led by former Republican Congressman Bob \nInglis that would have placed a $15-per-ton fee on carbon pollution in \n2010, more than $20 per ton in 2015, and $100 per ton in 2040. Well, \nall of that ended. That and more ended shortly after the Citizens \nUnited decision when for the first time our elections were flooded with \npolluter money and flooded with dark money, which is probably polluter \nmoney, but because it is dark and anonymous, we don't really know.\n  So say you are not a scientist. Isn't the responsible thing to sound \nout scientific opinion? Scientific opinion about climate change is now \nfirmly settled. Climate change is caused by the massive carbon \npollution we have unleashed. Every major scientific society in our \ncountry knows this and has said so. Here is a list. If my colleagues \nwant to, they can check with them. This is a list from a letter dated \nOctober 21, 2009--more than 5 years ago. We have been fiddling around \non this since the science was so clear.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                 October 21, 2009.\n       Dear Senator: As you consider climate change legislation, \n     we, as leaders of scientific organizations, write to state \n     the consensus scientific view.\n       Observations throughout the world make it clear that \n     climate change is occurring, and rigorous scientific research \n     demonstrates that the greenhouse gases emitted by human \n     activities are the primary driver. These conclusions are \n     based on multiple independent lines of evidence, and contrary \n     assertions are inconsistent with an objective assessment of \n     the vast body of peer-reviewed science. Moreover, there is \n     strong evidence that ongoing climate change will have broad \n     impacts on society, including the global economy and on the \n     environment. For the United States, climate change impacts \n     include sea level rise for coastal states, greater threats of \n     extreme weather events, and increased risk of regional water \n     scarcity, urban heat waves, western wildfires, and the \n     disturbance of biological systems throughout the country. The \n     severity of climate change impacts is expected to increase \n     substantially in the coming decades.\n       If we are to avoid the most severe impacts of climate \n     change, emissions of greenhouse gases must be dramatically \n     reduced. In addition, adaptation will be necessary to address \n     those impacts that are already unavoidable. Adaptation \n     efforts include improved infrastructure design, more \n     sustainable management of water and other natural resources, \n     modified agricultural practices, and improved emergency \n     responses to storms, floods, fires and heat waves.\n       We in the scientific community offer our assistance to \n     inform your deliberations as you seek to address the impacts \n     of climate change.\n         Alan I.

I could start with the body that was chartered 150 \nyears ago, actually, to provide us independent, scientific, objective \nadvice--the National Academy of Sciences. If that doesn't suit, try the \nAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science or the American \nPhysical Society or the American Meteorological Society or the American \nGeophysical Union or the American Medical Association or the American \nChemical Society or the Geological Society of America. If none of my \ncolleagues are scientists, check it out. Ask the responsible \nscientists. Ask the leading scientific societies.\n  If my colleagues don't believe the measurements--measurements confirm \nwhat the scientists know. Sea level is rising, and the rise is \naccelerating. We measure that with a glorified yardstick. It is already \nup nearly 10 inches at the Newport Naval Station since the 1930s when \nwe in Rhode Island had the devastating hurricane of 1938. It is similar \nat Fort Pulaski in Georgia. Go visit Miami Beach, where they just spent \nhundreds of millions of dollars installing huge, 14,000 gallon-per-\nminute pumps to keep the city dry as the rising tides flood in.\n  The ocean is warming. We measure that with a thermometer. \nNarragansett Bay is nearly 4 degrees Fahrenheit warmer, mean water \ntemperature, than 50 years ago. That is an ecosystem shift, and it has \nwreaked havoc with our winter flounder catch, for instance. Warmer \nwaters aren't just in Rhode Island. They have brought the snook--a game \nfish from the Florida Keys--up into Georgia waters.\n  The ocean is more acidic, and it is getting more acidic at the \nfastest rate measured looking back millions of years in the geologic \nrecord. If my colleagues doubt that the ocean is acidifying, ask the \noyster growers in the Pacific Northwest and Maine. Ask the scientists \nwho study Alaska's salmon fishery about what is happening to\n\n[[Page S5946]]\n\nthe pteropod, a key food source for salmon.\n  Here is my challenge to my Republican colleagues who say they are not \nscientists: Ask the scientists. Ask the scientists at your own home \nState universities. And ask the folks, by the way, employed by your \noutdoor industries--the people who see the changes happening around \nthem. Ask your park rangers. Ask your forest rangers.\n  If a colleague is from North Carolina, ask the scientists at the \nUniversity of North Carolina Institute of Marine Sciences.\n  If a colleague is from Colorado, ask the scientists at the National \nCenter for Atmospheric Research in Boulder.\n  If a colleague is from Iowa, ask the scientists at the Center for \nGlobal and Regional Environmental Research at the University of Iowa.\n  If a colleague is from Arizona, ask the scientists at the University \nof Arizona, which hosts the Climate Assessment for the Southwest \nProgram.\n  If a colleague is from Florida, ask the scientists at the University \nof Florida's Climate Institute.\n  If a colleague is from Texas, ask the scientists at the Texas Center \nfor Climate Studies at Texas A The Aggies get climate change. Check \nit out.\n  If a colleague is from New Hampshire, ask biologist Eric Orff, who \nworked for the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department for 30 years, \nwhat is happening to the moose. Ask Mike Bartlett of the New Hampshire \nAudubon Society what is happening to the purple finch, the State bird.\n  If a colleague is from Utah, ask the Park City Foundation and, while \ncolleagues are at it, employees at Alta Ski Area, Canyons Resort, Deer \nCrest, Deer Valley, or Park City Mountain Resort what they foresee for \nthat industry.\n  If a colleague is from Idaho, ask University of Idaho Professor \nJeffrey Hicke how rising temperatures let loose the bark beetle and \ndecimated almost 1,000 square miles of the iconic mountain pine \nforests.\n  If my colleagues like big business, if they think only the private \nsector knows anything, then ask the big property casualty reinsurers \nsuch as Munich Re or Swiss Re, who have billions of dollars at stake \nand have to get this right.\n  If a colleague is from Georgia, ask the folks from Coca-Cola. If a \ncolleague is from Arkansas, ask the folks from Walmart. If a colleague \nis from North Carolina, ask the folks at $30 billion clothing maker VF \nCorporation. They all have a lot of money riding on getting this right, \nand they are making decisions based on business, not on ideology. So \nask them.\n  If my colleagues trust the military, ask ADM Samuel Locklear, \ncommander of U.S. Pacific Command, who says climate risk is the most \ndangerous long-term challenge we face in the Pacific.\n  If my colleagues are looking for some pretty good high-level \nscientists, they might want to ask NASA and NOAA. Remember NASA? They \nput a rover safely on the surface of Mars, and they are driving it \naround on Mars. Do my colleagues think they might know what they are \ntalking about?\n  If my colleagues need to hear it from Republicans, ask former \nRepublican Treasury Secretaries, such as George Shultz and Hank \nPaulson. Ask former Republican EPA Administrators such as Bill \nRuckelshaus, Christine Todd Whitman, William Reilly, and Lee Thomas. \nAsk James Brainard, the Republican mayor of Carmel, IN. Ask Bob Dixon, \nthe Republican mayor of Greensburg. Ask Betty Price, the Republican \nmayor of Fort Worth, TX. Ask Republican mayor Sylvia Murphy and county \ncommissioner George Neugent of Monroe County, FL.\n  If my colleagues are not scientists, just ask. Do your homework. \nExercise this new great responsibility that will come with the great \npower you have won. But don't pretend climate change isn't real. Even \nyour own young voters know better than that. A majority of Republican \nvoters under age 35 think a politician who denies climate change is \nignorant, out of touch, or crazy. Those were the words checked off in \nthe poll. To paraphrase Michael Corleone from that great movie, ``Don't \ntell me it isn't real, because it insults my intelligence and it makes \nme very angry.\n\n  To our Republicans, I say I want to be your best friend in all of \nthis, the kind of best friend who tells you when you are in no shape to \ndrive and should hand over the keys until you are sober enough to drive \nsafely even if it makes you mad to hear it, the kind of friend who will \ntell you the truth you need to hear but don't want to hear. And let me \nsay, friends don't let friends deny climate change.\n  I know the big carbon polluters want this issue to be ignored. But \nresponsibility is knowing when to tell even your friends no. \nResponsibility is doing what is factual and is based in real science \nand measurement. Responsibility is doing what is right for your State \nand for your country in the long run, not just what rewards your \nsupporters--even those really big supporters--in the short run.\n  Maybe as their friends you might even want to have a little \nconversation with them because this is only going one way. As Pope \nFrancis just said, God is not ``a magician with a magic wand.'' He put \nlaws of the universe, laws of nature in place, and we don't get a pass \non them just because it is politically convenient. How long does \nExxonMobil think it can pursue unsustainable fossil fuel goals by \nfixing the politics? Laws of nature can't be bought or repealed. The \nKoch brothers are rich enough to buy virtually anything, but even they \ncan't buy new laws of nature. BP went and quietly shut down its solar \nand wind programs, but carbon still does what carbon does. As your \nfriends, they might need a little intervention from you.\n  Just so you know, I am not going anywhere. I have homes and \nbusinesses being swept into the ocean in my State. I have fishermen who \ntell me it is getting weird out there in Rhode Island Sound, that the \nlobsters and fish aren't where they are supposed to be when they are \nsupposed to be there, that they are catching the kinds of fish their \nfathers and grandfathers never saw in their nets.\n  It is getting weird out there. I am not going anywhere. My State is \nsmall and coastal, and worse, bigger storms put us in serious danger. I \nam not ever going to ignore that. I am never going to walk away from \nthis issue. I will never deny what Rhode Islanders see right in front \nof their faces and what all our expert warnings tell us is only going \nto get worse.\n  If you are going to be responsible and not just powerful, you won't \ndeny this issue and walk away either. I promise you this. One way or \nanother, we are going to get this done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, a common reality that permeates the complex \nand colorful history of Latin America is large numbers of landless, \nimpoverished people and small elites who control the majority of the \nland and the country's wealth, often exploiting its natural resources \nfor personal gain.\n  While the significant growth of the middle class in some South \nAmerican countries over the past decade is encouraging, nowhere is the \ndisparity of land ownership more pronounced than in Paraguay, a \nlandlocked country of 6.5 million people that rarely receives the \nattention of the U.S. Congress.\n  A few statistics tell the story. Some 80 percent of agricultural land \nin Paraguay is owned by just 1.6 percent of the landowners, and the 600 \nlargest properties comprise 40 percent of the total productive land. \nMeanwhile, a third of a million small farmers have no land at all. It \nshould surprise no one that 40\n\n[[Page S5947]]\n\npercent of the country's population lives in poverty and that land, \nwealth, and political power are concentrated in the hands of a few.\n  The conflict over land in Paraguay, which dates back hundreds of \nyears, has grown even worse due to the expansion of mechanized soy \nproduction, primarily for export. Government policies, including tax \nbreaks, access to credit, and weak environmental and labor regulations, \nhave favored large corporate farms which are often foreign owned, over \nlocal family farms that receive little if any government support.\n  As we have seen in many other Latin countries, the Paraguayan \nGovernment has used the army, police, and judicial inaction or bias to \nprotect the interests of the large landowners.\n  The 35 year dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner ended in 1989. He \nruled under a state of siege, imprisoned and tortured political \nopponents, and reportedly gave away or sold for a pittance 20 percent \nof the country's land to friends of his regime. Paraguay is slowly \nmoving beyond the Stroessner years, but since 1989 more than 130 small \nfarmers who have tried to defend their rights under the agrarian reform \nlaw have reportedly been killed.\n  I mention this bit of history to put into context what happened on \nJune 15, 2012. According to information I have received, on that day \nseveral hundred police officers forcibly evicted a group of about 60 \nlandless farmers who were occupying an area known as Marina Kue in \neastern Paraguay. In the ensuing violence, eleven farmers and six \npolice officers were killed and others injured from the gunfire. There \nhas apparently been no investigation of the conduct of the police, \ndespite the existence of published reports about human rights abuses, \nbut all the farmers were charged with crimes.\n  This case offers the Paraguayan Government an important opportunity \nto conduct a thorough, independent investigation of the events of June \n15, prosecute and punish those responsible for the killings and \ninjuries of the farmers and police officers, and enable poor farmers in \nthat community to acquire legal rights to land and put it to productive \nuse to feed their families.\n  I understand that the Paraguayan Government recently began working to \nreach an agreement with the affected communities regarding the land \ndispute prior to the beginning of the trial of the farmers later this \nmonth. This is encouraging news, and it could be a turning point if it \nresults in a thorough, independent investigation and prosecution of \nthose responsible and a just resolution of the dispute.\n  Paraguay and the United States, while separated by more than 4,000 \nmiles, share many interests. As chairman of the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on the Department of State and Foreign Operations that \nfunds U.S. foreign assistance programs, I have supported programs to \nhelp Paraguay strengthen its democratic institutions, promote \nefficiency and transparency, and promote equitable economic \ndevelopment. I also supported the funding for the Millennium Challenge \nCorporation's Threshold Program in Paraguay.\n  There will be other ways the United States can help Paraguay build \nthe capacity and accountability of its public sector, expand its \neconomy, and sustainably manage its natural resources. Few things would \ndo more to advance these goals, and improve social stability, than \naddressing what happened at Marina Kue and providing access to land for \nParaguay's small farmers. I am aware that several other Members of \nCongress are sending a letter to President Horacio Cartes urging these \nsteps, and I look forward to his response.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/12/senate-section/article/S5947-1", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5947-S5948]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CHIXOY DAM REPARATIONS AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, more than 30 years ago, in the midst of \nGuatemala's civil war, the construction of a large hydroelectric dam on \nthe Chixoy River resulted in destruction of 33 indigenous Mayan \ncommunities and the massacres of more than 400 villagers and other \nabuses by the Guatemalan army.\n  The history of that tragedy is well known so I will not recount it \nhere. Suffice it to say that a great injustice was committed. There was \nample blame to go around between the Army, the World Bank, and Inter-\nAmerican Development Bank that financed the dam, governments, including \nthe United States, whose representatives on the banks' boards of \ndirectors voted for the construction, and subsequent Guatemalan \nGovernments that failed to compensate the victims or punish those \nresponsible.\n  Last month, the Guatemalan Government and representatives of the \ncommunities culminated many months of negotiations with an agreement to \nimplement the contents of the 2010 reparations plan, including \nindividual payments and community development investments that will be \nfinanced over a period of years. The agreement was formalized at a \npublic ceremony on Saturday, November 1, attended by Guatemala's \nPresident Otto Perez Molina, members of the communities, other \ngovernment officials, and representatives of the multilateral banks and \nthe United Nations.\n  There are many who thought this day would never come, and I commend \nthe commitment and patience of the members of the communities, \nparticularly those who lost loved ones so many years ago, the \nGuatemalan officials who negotiated the agreement, President Perez \nMolina for his personal support, as well as key officials from the \nmultilateral banks who played an indispensable role, and Inter-American \nDevelopment Bank President Luis Moreno, who also took a personal \ninterest. I also commend the U.S. Embassy officials and representatives \nof the Catholic Church who provided encouragement and support during \nthis process. Finally, I want to acknowledge Guatemala's Ambassador to \nthe United States and the U.S. Treasury Department officials who \nrecognized the need to resolve this issue.\n  This is a historic milestone that finally begins to right a grievous \nwrong, a wrong that was emblematic of the horrors of the armed conflict \nthat engulfed Guatemala a generation ago. A great many innocent people \nlost their lives or their livelihoods in that war, and many of the key \nprovisions of the 1992 Peace Accords remain unfulfilled.\n  Until now, Chixoy was among the unfinished business, so this is a \nwelcome and important step toward addressing the damages suffered by \nthese communities. Yet I am as mindful as others that in many respects \nthis agreement is only the beginning. The task ahead is to ensure its \nimplementation, which will be the responsibility of the current and \nfuture Guatemalan Governments, the multilateral banks that have pledged \nto redirect some of their own resources to this effort, and all those \nwho care about Guatemala's past, present, and future.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a description of \nSaturday's ceremony formalizing the agreement, provided by the \nGuatemalan Embassy in Washington, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          President Perez Molina Formalizes Historic Agreement\n\n       The President of Guatemala, Otto Perez Molina, formalized \n     an historic agreement for economical reparations for 33 \n     communities of Baja Verapaz affected by the construction of \n     the Chixoy Hydroelectric in 1978.\n       A public event was held in the Municipal Stadium in \n     Rabinal, Baja Verapaz on Saturday, where representatives of \n     the Executive, the affected communities, the Human Rights \n     Ombudsman's Office, the Organization of American States and \n     the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human \n     Rights handed the Government Decree number 378-2014 to the \n     Communities.\n       ``Today is an historic day'' expressed President Perez \n     Molina, ``one that closes a shameful chapter of abuses, human \n     rights violations and injustices suffered by thousands of \n     families that lived in the area where Chixoy was built''. \n     Also, in front of thousands of people from the affected \n     communities that attended the formalization of the Government \n     Decree at the Rabinal Municipal Stadium, he ratified his \n     administration's commitment to comply with the terms of the \n     Public Policy.\n       He continued to express, on behalf of the State of \n     Guatemala, a public apology to the families of the 33 \n     communities that were wronged by the construction in 1978 of \n     the Chixoy Hydroelectric Dam. With this public apology, he \n     began implementing the Government Decree for moral and \n     material reparations. ``I want to be the first to follow \n     through with the public policy of reparations and comply with \n     one of the main points of the agreement which is \n     responsibility of the Presidency of Guatemala. So today, in \n     this historic day of happiness and celebration of\n\n[[Page S5948]]\n\n     the Agreement reached by the Government and the Communities, \n     I want to take the first step and publicly apologize as \n     President of the Republic, as representative of the unity of \n     our citizens, for the abuse and human rights violations that \n     each one of the communities suffered''.\n       He continued to say: ``On behalf of the State of Guatemala \n     I ask you to accept these apologies so that we can heal the \n     wounds in our hearts without forgetting the injustices and \n     human rights violations that occurred''.\n       President Perez Molina also said that he felt honored that \n     his administration managed to reach an historic agreement \n     that will contribute to overcome the drama that the \n     Communities suffered for more than three decades. He \n     continued to say that with the public event to recognize and \n     repair the affected populations, one of his main objectives \n     when taking office in January of 2012 was fulfilled. He went \n     back and quoted his inauguration speech: ``I ask God to grant \n     us the wisdom to actively promote true reconciliation. A \n     reconciliation that gives us the strength to work on our \n     pending issues, on unattended injustices, on reconstructing \n     our social fabric and to keep investing on the most valuable \n     thing our Guatemala has, its citizens.''\n\n\n                Public Policy for Reparation of Damages\n\n       Several Government officials attended the public event, \n     which had Vice President Roxana Baldetti as honor witness. \n     Present also were representatives of the communities, local \n     authorities and representatives of international \n     organizations.\n       President Perez Molina highlighted that the agreement \n     required a public policy for reparations and a structured \n     plan to combat poverty, social injustice, inequality and the \n     abandonment that these communities have suffered.\n       The Government Decree that gives life to this agreement was \n     published on Friday in the Official Gazette and establishes \n     the Public Policy for the Reparation of the Communities \n     Affected by the Construction of the Chixoy Hydroelectric Dam.\n       The Policy will be applied to benefit 11,383 families and \n     will offer basic infrastructure for 33 communities in Baja \n     Verapaz, Alta Verapaz and Quiche, where the affected \n     populations lived when the violations occurred.\n       President Perez Molina highlighted that the implementation \n     during 2015 and 2016 has a budget of 200 million dollars for \n     individual reparations. Besides individual pay, the \n     Government will direct 1 billion quetzals in the next 15 \n     years to build basic infrastructure in the 33 affected \n     communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/12/senate-section/article/S5948-1", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5948]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO TERRY E.

He returned in 1964 \nto serve as a chairman of the Commerce Department at Cumberland \nCollege--now the University of the Cumberlands--and 3 years later he \nstarted his own law practice in Corbin, KY.\n  In 1972, Terry bought the Hillcrest Nursing Home in Corbin--an \nacquisition that is widely considered to be the first piece of what \nwould eventually become the Forcht Group of Kentucky. This initial \npurchase has grown into what is now called First Corbin Long Term Care \nand consists of nine health and rehabilitation centers in the region.\n  In 1972, Terry also became heavily involved in community banking. He \nwas appointed to the board of directors of Corbin Deposit Bank and \nTrust Company, and as his interest and expertise in the industry grew, \nhe founded Tri-County National Bank with a group of investors in 1985. \nAs with his nursing home acquisition, this community bank quickly \nprospered and grew. Today there are 30 Forcht Bank locations in \nKentucky with total assets of over $1 billion.\n  Mr. Forcht has grown his company over the years into a sprawling \nenterprise that employs over 2,100 people. The Forcht Group currently \nconsists of 22 radio stations, 19 finance company offices, 2 insurance \ncompanies, 2 newspapers, a pharmacy and diagnostic lab, a retail \nfurniture and gift store, a construction company, real estate, and \nseveral other small businesses.\n  Outside of his business, Terry still manages to find time to stay \ninvolved in his community. Although he is no longer a practicing \nlawyer, he is still a member of the Whitley County and Kentucky Bar \nAssociations. In the past he has been president of the Whitley County \nRepublican Party and has run for a seat in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives. He also currently serves on the board of directors of \nthe Kentucky Chamber of Commerce and the Kentucky Economic Development \nBoard.\n  Terry's success in business has also allowed him and his wife Marion \nto pursue their passion for philanthropy. They are both active members \nof Grace on the Hill Methodist Church and have generously donated large \nsums of their hard-earned money to the University of Louisville, the \nUniversity of the Cumberlands, and to the University of Kentucky. Many \ngenerations of Kentuckians will undoubtedly find new opportunities open \nto them because of Terry and Marion's contributions to education in the \nState.\n  The Knox County Chamber 2014 Man of the Year Award is a fitting \ntribute to a man who has contributed so much to his community. Terry's \nentrepreneurial zeal and commitment to furnishing quality higher \neducation in his State set a glowing example for us all. Therefore, I \nask that my U.S. Senate colleagues join me in honoring this exemplary \ncitizen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/12/senate-section/article/S5948-2", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5948-S5949]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                PORTRAIT UNVEILING OF JUDGE JOHN HEYBURN\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on October 3 of this year, I had the \nhonor of speaking at the portrait unveiling of U.S. District Court \nJudge John G. Heyburn. I ask unanimous consent that my comments at that \nceremony be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       I first met John Heyburn in 1971. Somehow, we had both \n     found ourselves here in Louisville working for a fledgling \n     gubernatorial candidate named Tom Emberton. It was the first \n     of many attempts by John to derail what was otherwise \n     destined to be a dazzling legal and judicial career with a \n     foray into politics. And I like to think the increasingly \n     frequent television ads many of you have seen for a certain \n     U.S. Senate race have finally confirmed him in the view that \n     between the two of us, he chose the nobler path.\n       So you're very welcome for that, John. I assure you, it's \n     been an expensive lesson in career advice.\n       Now, I don't remember a whole lot about that governor's \n     race, but I do remember what I was thinking when John and I \n     met--that we were cut from different cloth. He came from a \n     very prominent family here in Louisville. His dad had run for \n     Congress back when I was in college, which I remembered. He \n     attended boarding school up in New England . . . he went to \n     Harvard . . . he golfed. You get the drift . . .\n       So what happened next was unexpected, but in retrospect \n     entirely predictable: I liked him. I liked him a lot. And the \n     accuracy of that first impression has been validated again \n     and again in the decades since.\n       John Heyburn is just impossible not to like.\n       That's the first thing to say about the man we've come here \n     to honor. And I think it needs to be said, because it's \n     certainly not the main reason so many of us made sure to be \n     here today. But it's a big reason so many of us really wanted \n     to be here, and why this is such a happy occasion. John \n     doesn't just inspire confidence and respect. He doesn't just \n     impress with his intellect and erudition. He makes you feel \n     lucky to know him.\n       And I think I got a good sense for why that is on that \n     first campaign for Tom Emberton. I mean, here was a brilliant \n     young guy from a distinguished family, fresh out of Harvard, \n     about a head taller than everybody else. The rest of us on \n     the campaign were all basically operating without a license. \n     And yet he just loved it. He brought the same enthusiasm to \n     that race that he brings to everything else, the sense that \n     whatever it is you're doing, he's interested. And as long as \n     you put your whole self into it, it's worth it.\n       John's basic approach to life had already been set all \n     those years ago, and I can't think of a better way to \n     describe it than to borrow a phrase from Oliver Wendell \n     Holmes, who once gave the following piece of advice to a \n     group of Boston lawyers: ``Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, \n     do it with thy might.''\n       The language may be a little antiquated, but I think the \n     sentiment captures John perfectly. Because whether it's \n     running a marathon in college, keeping time at one of Will's \n     swim meets, tracking Jack's free-throw percentages in high \n     school, drafting a judicial decision, resolving a dispute \n     among lawyers . . . or facing up to the physical adversities \n     of recent years, John has done it ``with all his might''.\n       And that's the second thing to say about John Heyburn.\n\n[[Page S5949]]\n\n       Now, for those of you who may be wondering, Tom Emberton \n     ended up losing his race for governor. But as I indicated, \n     one losing campaign wasn't quite enough to drive John out of \n     politics. A few years later, he helped me win my own first \n     political campaign, as County Judge Executive here in \n     Jefferson County. And once elected, he gave me some very good \n     counsel as a lawyer on my staff.\n       In repayment for his services I invited John to join my \n     ticket for a run of his own . . . and then proceeded to run \n     what was hands-down the worst campaign of my life. The \n     defining artifact of the race was a billboard we put up along \n     I-65. It was basically just three disembodied heads on a big \n     neon board. I looked like Howdy Doody. John looked like \n     Hitler. We took it down after a day and a half. And John's \n     hopes for a career in politics were dashed once again . . .\n       It would take one more run for a political office to \n     extinguish John's political ambitions, and to show him where \n     his greatest talents lay. One of his recent judicial \n     decisions led him to make an unexpected cameo in this year's \n     Senate primary. But aside from that, he's been pretty quiet. \n     For the past 22 years, John Heyburn has put all his might \n     into this courtroom. And his impact has been enormous.\n       The truth is, John's such a friendly presence, it's easy to \n     forget what a penetrating intellect he has or what an \n     influential jurist he's been. But his skills and his focus as \n     a judge are by now legendary.\n       As Chair of the Judicial Panel on Multi-District \n     Litigation, he's interacted with some of the best lawyers in \n     the country. It's one of the main reasons he enjoys the job. \n     It's a welcome duty for him, yes, and a testament to his very \n     laudable commitment to public service. But mostly, I think, \n     it's just a great opportunity for John to put his mind to \n     work and to engage other legal minds on a very high level.\n       In more than two decades as a judge for the Western \n     District, John has also untangled countless legal knots and \n     delivered far-reaching opinions on some mind-numbingly \n     complex and important cases. And that's to say nothing of the \n     countless settlement conferences, which require a subtle \n     genius of their own.\n       Others can speak more intelligently about the ins and outs \n     of specific cases and the day-to-day demands of a judge. John \n     has clearly excelled at both. But I think one of the far \n     less-appreciated contributions he's made in his many years \n     here has been his strong, positive influence on the culture \n     of the place.\n       So let me just say that as someone who's played an active \n     role in nominations to the court over the years, it's very \n     gratifying to hear about the deep camaraderie and mutual \n     respect that the district court judges in the commonwealth, \n     and particularly in this district, enjoy. And of their \n     reputation for excellence.\n       I think there's no question that no one is more responsible \n     for that than John. And I'm grateful.\n       One veteran of the Kentucky bar summed it up like this: \n     ``It is a privilege,'' he said, ``to practice law in Kentucky \n     federal courts. The judges are fair, they're even-handed. \n     They follow the statutes . . . they follow precedent . . . \n     but they're [also] independent and they're really fine human \n     beings.''\n       I've heard of young lawyers dreading their first day in \n     court but leaving here encouraged and energized not just \n     because they made it through, but because Judge Heyburn was \n     so kind and generous to them.\n       Experienced court-watchers say he's tougher on the lawyers \n     he knows than on the ones he doesn't. And as for John's \n     clerks, well, some speak of their time here as nothing short \n     of a revelation. It's the dignified but humane way he \n     conducts his chambers. It's the methodical way he decides a \n     case. But it's also just the sheer joy he brings to his work \n     on the bench, or to talking politics over a sandwich at the \n     City Cafe, or even to teaching a high school civics class \n     with his clerks.\n       I'm told that on some of these field trips, by the way, \n     John actually has his clerks act out the characters in famous \n     court cases. It's not exactly something law school prepares \n     you for. But they seem to enjoy it. At least they pretend to.\n       The larger point is this: in a field that isn't exactly \n     known for excitement, John has always found a way to make the \n     law interesting. His enthusiasm is contagious. And that's \n     been one of his great gifts to the profession, and to \n     everyone whose lives intersect with the work of this court.\n       One of John's former clerks put it like this. He said that \n     after law school he was totally burned out, and not really \n     looking forward to the career ahead of him. Then he met Judge \n     Heyburn.\n       ``Judge Heyburn,'' he said, ``he just made me fall in love \n     with the law.''\n       That's why John attracts some of the best and the \n     brightest. It's why his clerks love him.\n       He brings the law to life. He looks beyond the facts at \n     hand and forces his clerks to ask ``Why.'' He takes an \n     interest in their lives long after they leave here. And he \n     also gives them something else. He gives them a model for how \n     to do their jobs well without forgetting that their first and \n     most important job is at home.\n       And that's the third thing I would like to say about John \n     Heyburn. He's a scholar. He's a giant on the bench. He's a \n     good friend to his friends. He's a lot of fun. But he is a \n     husband and a father first.\n       Ask his clerks what they remember about his chambers and \n     they're just as likely to remember all the photos of Martha \n     and Will and Jack as the wood paneling. Ask Martha about \n     their marriage and she'll tell you they have as much fun \n     together today as they did the day they met. Ask the boys \n     what they remember, and they'll tell you something about \n     their dad that a lot of other kids wish they could.\n       They'll say: ``My dad was never MIA.''\n       Now, for the past year or so, young Jack has had the great \n     misfortune of being one of the very first people that I see \n     in the morning when I'm up in Washington. I'm sure he doesn't \n     look forward to that. But to me it's a great comfort. Not \n     just because I like him too, but because whenever I see Jack \n     I see Martha and John.\n       It reminds me of home. It reminds me of good times past. \n     And it makes me hopeful about the future. Because these are \n     really good people. They're both impressive in their own \n     right.\n       And they really care about others.\n       So I'm delighted to be here to honor the judge on this \n     happy occasion.\n       John Heyburn finally found his calling. And to the surprise \n     of absolutely no one, he has lived it out with all his might. \n     He has earned the respect of his peers and the gratitude of \n     many clerks. He is greatly admired. And as the impressive \n     crowd that's gathered here attests, he is very deeply loved.\n       Congratulations, old friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/12/senate-section/article/S5949-1", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5949-S5951]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NOMINATION OBJECTION\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I intend to object to consideration of \nthe nomination of Lourdes Castro Ramirez to be the Assistant Secretary \nof the Department of Housing and Urban Development, HUD, for the Office \nof Public and Indian Housing.\n  Over the last 4 years, I have been raising concerns about serious \nproblems at public housing authorities and HUD's failure to address \nthem. The Office of Public and Indian Housing is responsible for \noverseeing the public housing authority program.\n  I recently learned that HUD is negotiating new, 10-year contracts \nwith the 39 housing authorities participating in the Moving to Work, \nMTW, demonstration program. The Office of Public and Indian Housing is \nalso responsible for administering this program but has failed to \nconduct proper oversight for years.\n  The current contracts don't expire until 2018 so there is no need to \nrush into signing new contracts. Instead, I recommend HUD takes serious \nsteps to address the program deficiencies and determine if this \ndemonstration should continue.\n  A group of housing advocacy organizations sent a letter to HUD on \nNovember 7, 2014, raising concerns about the lack of transparency in \nthe MTW contract negotiations. I am requesting that a copy of this \nletter be included with my statement in the Record. These organizations \nrepresent the people directly impacted by HUD decisions. They are \nasking questions that would strengthen the program and protect funding \nfrom abuse. But HUD is blocking them from participating in the process. \nOnly the MTW agencies are allowed to review the contracts and comment \non the proposed changes.\n  According to HUD briefing materials, the MTW housing authorities \noperate about 14 percent of the Nation's housing stock and receive over \n$3 billion in funding per year, equal to about 20 percent of total \nprogram funding. Yet HUD has failed to require any meaningful \naccountability or transparency.\n  This has led to financial abuses at the Chicago Housing Authority and \nother MTW housing authorities. On October 23, I sent a letter to HUD \nabout the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA), a Moving to Work \nparticipant. CHA has diverted approximately $432 million in Federal \nfunding into a reserve fund instead of issuing over 13,500 vouchers to \nChicago families who need affordable housing assistance.\n  For example, the Atlanta Housing Authority has at least 20 employees \nreceiving annual compensation ranging between $150,000 and $300,000 per \nyear. The executive director explained that these high salaries are \nnecessary ``to both `attract and retain' competent staff.''\n  The executive director of the Philadelphia Housing Authority also \nreceived a high salary over $300,000 per year. He also threw lavish \nparties, provided patronage to friends and supporters, and secretly \npaid sexual harassment claims.\n  Instead of providing safe, affordable housing for those in need, \nhousing authority officials are using Federal\n\n[[Page S5950]]\n\nfunding to feather their own nests. HUD tells me these problems are \nanomalies, which lead me to believe the Department may be turning a \nblind eye to program failures no matter what the costs.\n  Both the HUD inspector general and the Government Accountability \nOffice, or GAO, audited the MTW program. Both determined that little \nprogram oversight is actually being done. HUD has no procedures to \nverify agency self-reported performance data and HUD officials weren't \neven aware that they were required to perform annual risk assessments. \nHUD also has no program-wide performance indicators that would help \ndetermine if this program is a success or failure.\n  Worse yet, HUD never performed mandatory program evaluations to \ndetermine if the agencies complied with their MTW agreements or whether \nthey should still be in the program. Department officials said they \nlack the funding to performing the evaluations. Under the current \nbudget climate, additional funding may not be available anytime soon. \nIn other words, HUD can't tell me if the Moving to Work program \nactually works or if it will work in the future.\n  GAO officials informed me that the agency may be close to closing \nthree recommendations. For the other five recommendations, they are \nwaiting for HUD to provide additional documentation about what steps \nare being taken or what is needed to close each of them. Instead of \ntaking steps to improve program performance and provide more effective \noversight, the Agency is, instead, rushing to extend contracts for an \nadditional ten years.\n  I expect a lot more answers and accountability before there is a vote \non Ms. Castro Ramirez's nomination. HUD must also refrain from adding \nnew housing authorities to the MTW program until the agency provides \nGAO with the requested information and a definitive timeline for \nclosing the outstanding recommendations.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 November 7, 2014.\n     Hon. Julian Castro,\n     Secretary, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Castro: We represent housing advocates who \n     work with clients and community members in the jurisdictions \n     of public housing agencies (PHAs) that have Moving to Work \n     (MTW) status. We look forward to working with you to further \n     HUD's mission to create strong, sustainable, inclusive \n     communities and quality affordable homes for all.\n       We are writing to ask HUD to take immediate action to \n     create a more open, inclusive, and transparent process as HUD \n     negotiates the terms for any potential extensions to Moving \n     to Work Agreements past their current 2018 expiration. \n     Consistent with the statutory language creating the MTW \n     program, we specifically request that HUD consult with \n     advocates during the contract negotiations. Indeed, Congress \n     was clear that ''in making assessments throughout the \n     demonstration, the Secretary shall consult with \n     representatives of public housing agencies and residents.'' \n     As a first step, we urge HUD to make the baseline language it \n     is crafting for MTW extension contracts available for public \n     comment and discussion, and solicit and consider input from \n     resident and community advocates on the conditions for \n     extensions and the terms of the extension agreements.\n       As you undoubtedly know, HUD's MTW demonstration is steeped \n     in controversy. In addition to receiving criticism from \n     advocacy agencies providing services to PHA residents in \n     deregulated jurisdictions, HUD's own Office of the Inspector \n     General and the U.S. Government Accountability Office have \n     released studies critical of the MTW program's underlying \n     structure and HUD's implementation and oversight of the \n     program, including the GAO's 2012 Evaluation and the HUD IG's \n     2013 Study. These studies indicate that the Moving to Work \n     program lacks performance standards and evaluation, and HUD \n     has not provided critical oversight to agencies participating \n     in the MTW program to evaluate agencies' compliance with \n     statutory requirements or verify agencies' self-reported \n     performance data.\n       Based on these pervasive critiques, we believe that any \n     extension of the MTW demonstration must be done with \n     thoughtfulness, diligence, and open discussion of the lessons \n     learned from HUD's previous experiments in deregulation, \n     which simply have not demonstrated any of the programmatic \n     results this venture was designed to achieve.\n       The current MTW Agreements do not expire until 2018. We \n     understand that HUD's stated goal for beginning MTW extension \n     discussions in 2014 has been to develop better tools and \n     standards to enable more effective regulation and oversight \n     of MTW Agencies moving forward. We support any process that \n     will ensure that new language in MTW contracts will provide \n     clear metrics for performance, clear processes for \n     evaluation, and clear protocols for HUD to monitor and \n     enforce Agencies' compliance with statutory requirements and \n     standards, even amidst the flexibility the MTW program \n     intentionally allows.\n       We strongly support some goals HUD has put forward for the \n     extensions, including establishing requirements that agencies \n     use the bulk of their voucher funds for vouchers, higher \n     baselines to determine if agencies are assisting \n     ``substantially the same'' number of families, and more \n     rigorous evaluation of policies that pose risks to \n     participants. Effective requirements in these areas would \n     have major benefits for low-income families. Without more \n     information on the details, however, it is impossible for us \n     to assess whether the changes HUD plans will bring about \n     meaningful improvements.\n       As advocacy organizations who work with tenants who are the \n     ``end-users'' of HUD's programs in regions de-regulated under \n     the MTW program, we believe we have experiences and \n     observations that can help contribute to HUD's success in \n     amending the program.\n       We have documented concerns with the current MTW Agreements \n     that are not adequately addressed by the limited information \n     HUD has released about the planned extensions. These concerns \n     include but are not limited to:\n       How new MTW Agreements will prevent de-regulated PHAs from \n     diverting significant resources out of their housing programs \n     into unrestricted cash reserves or towards other questionable \n     uses such as excessive executive compensation. These actions \n     clearly contradict MTW's statutory goal to, ``reduce cost and \n     achieve greater cost effectiveness.'' The agreements should, \n     for example, include clear limits on reserve levels and \n     specific sanctions for agencies that exceed those limits.\n       How HUD will evaluate the real effects of proposed or \n     existing major policy changes allowed under MTW, such as time \n     limits, work requirements, and major rent changes, to assess \n     whether these changes are achieving the program's statutory \n     goals of helping families achieve economic self-sufficiency \n     and increasing housing choice, or instead just creating a \n     revolving door of homelessness and hardship. HUD has \n     indicated that it will require more rigorous evaluation of \n     some new policies, but it should also seek to evaluate \n     policies already in place and should make clear that it will \n     prohibit agencies from adopting risky measures like time \n     limits and work requirements unless funding for a rigorous \n     evaluation is available.\n       How HUD will define, monitor, and enforce, the new standard \n     of 90% voucher utilization, both before and after new MTW \n     agreements go into effect. This standard will be far more \n     effective if HUD uses the voucher funding formula to enforce \n     it, and if it prohibits agencies from counting funds spent \n     for purposes other than rental assistance toward voucher \n     utilization.\n       How HUD will define and enforce the requirement to assist \n     substantially the same number of families.

Mr. President, this week, the Senate will once again \nconsider S. 1086 as amended by the House, the Child Care and \nDevelopment Block Grant Act of 2014. This is bipartisan legislation \nthat I introduced along with Senators Burr, Harkin, and Alexander.\n  A version of this bill was passed by the Senate earlier this year by \nan overwhelming bipartisan vote of 96-2. An amended version passed the \nHouse on September 15th, by unanimous consent. I stand here today, on \nthe side of families and children across the nation, encouraging the \nSenate to once again pass this child care bill and send it to the \nPresident's desk to become law.\n  Before I was the Senator for Maryland, I was a social worker for \nBaltimore families and worked with children and the elderly. At the \ndawn of the civil rights movement, I went from being a social worker to \na social activist in elected office. Today, I'm a social worker in \nCongress, working to build opportunities for families throughout \nAmerica. I stand here today, proud that with this bill, we can make a \ndifference for parents and children across America. Every family \ndeserves child care that is affordable, accessible, and exceptional.\n  Child care is one of the most important decisions a parent will make \nwhen raising their child. But we live in the aqe of scrimp and save. \nTimes are tough and budgets are tight. Every day, parents across \nAmerican struggle to put food on the table, pay their bills, and \nprovide care for their kids. Maybe you are a single parent, working \ndouble shifts, wondering if your child is safe and sound, or maybe you \nare a student, working to get your degree for a better job and a \nbrighter future. But instead of studying statistics, you are \ncalculating the cash you need to pay your babysitter. Those worries \nweigh heavily on the shoulders of parents everywhere. Our bill helps \nlift that burden by giving families and children the child care they \nneed to succeed.\n  That is why I am so proud to move this bill forward. This bill is the \nproduct of brilliant bipartisan effort between Senators Burr, Harkin, \nAlexander, and myself. We also worked on a bicameral basis with \nRepresentatives Kline and Miller from the House Education and the \nWorkforce Committee.\n  This bill reforms and refreshes important child care legislation, so \nmoms and dads earning lower incomes can afford child care for their \nkids while they go to work or school. Child care is something all \nfamilies worry about, regardless of income or zip code. People want \ncare that is reliable and undeniable, safe, affordable, and accessible. \nThis bill helps ensure that all children get the care they need and \ndeserve so they and their families can have a better, brighter future.\n  In 1990, the CCDBG program was first signed into law by President \nGeorge H.W. Bush to assist working families with the cost of providing \nchild care. It has not been reauthorized since 1996. Through the CCDBG \nprogram, the Federal government provides states and Indian tribes and \nterritories with funding. That funding is used to help lower-income \nfamilies afford child care while parents work, train for work, or \nattend school. Families are given vouchers based on their income level \nto help cover costs of care. These vouchers can be used by parents for \nthe provider of their choice: care in the home, at a relative's home, \nor in a child care center. Every month, CCDBG serves more than 1.5 \nmillion children in the United States, including 19,000 children in \nMaryland.\n  Why is this program so important? Because child care is expensive. It \nis the highest household expense faced by dual income households and \naverages $14,872 per year for two children. In Maryland, families \nspend, on average, 20% of their family income on child care. This is \nabout $14,000 per year or $249 per week. Keep in mind that the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services recommends that families not \nspend more than 10% of their income on child care. Child care isn't a \nluxury, it is a necessity. It shouldn't reach beyond the bounds of the \nfamily budget, especially in these tough economic times.\n  CCDBG has not been reauthorized since 1996. At the time, the program \nwas envisioned solely as workforce aid--something to help moms and dads \nget back to work. This was and remains an important goal, but we have \nlearned a lot since 1996. What we know today, but didn't know 18 years \nago, is that the most rapid period of development for the brain happens \nin the first five years of life. That is why it is so imperative that \nwe ensure our young children are in high-quality child care programs \nthat give kids building blocks for a lifetime of success. It is not \nenough to ensure that kids have someplace to go. We must ensure that \nthey go someplace safe that nurtures their development, challenges \ntheir mind, and prepares them for school. The current program is \noutdated. It does not go far enough in promoting and supporting high-\nquality child care, safeguarding health and safety of children, \nensuring children have continuity of care, and focusing on infant and \ntoddler care.\n  Senators Burr, Harkin, Alexander, and I got together more than two \nyears ago. We held three bipartisan Subcommittee on Children and \nFamilies hearings, got input from more than fifty stakeholder \norganizations, worked with every member of the Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee to put together a comprehensive \nreauthorization bill. It does not solve every program for every family, \nbut it does a lot of good for families relying on CCDBG.\n  First, the reauthorization requires states to prioritize quality. \nStates will be required to eventually set aside at least 9% of funding \nfor quality initiatives, 5% more than current law. States will choose \nwhat is best for them, whether it is training of the workforce, \nsupporting early learning guidelines, expanding quality rating systems, \nor improving quality and quantity of child care programs and services \nfor infants and toddlers.\n  Second, it requires that providers meet health requirements so \nparents know that the individuals taking care of their children are \ncapable and competent when it comes to handling first aid and CPR, \nchild abuse, sudden infant death syndrome, or shaken baby syndrome. \nThird, it requires mandatory background checks. And lastly, this \nreauthorization gives families using the CCDBG program more stability \nby ensuring that their kids get care for at least one year, even if a \nparent sees a change in their pay check.\n  We know that increasing funding for this program is important. More \nkids and families are in need of access. That is why as Chairwoman of \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee, I am pushing for $2.46 billion for \nchild care in the FY15 Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and \nRelated Agencies appropriations bill. This is an increase of $100 \nmillion over FY14. This funding would ensure that countless additional \nchildren have access to this vital program, bringing more families of \nvery modest means peace of mind when it comes to child care.\n\n[[Page S5952]]\n\n  I am fighting hard for this increase, because I know quality child \ncare is worth every penny. I could not have done it without Senator \nHarkin as the Labor-HHS Chairman. And rest assured, we will keep \nfighting for this child care program. So you see, we put money in a \nprogram through appropriations channels and now we are improving the \nprogram through authorizing channels.\n  I would like to thank my partner in crime, Senator Richard Burr, who \nwas Ranking Member of Children and Families when I was Chair of that \nSubcommittee. Senator Burr's unwavering commitment to reauthorizing \nthis program and ensuring safety of children is unrivaled, \nunparalleled, and unmatched. It has been a pleasure working with \nSenator Burr and his staff, Chris Toppings. They deserve a lot of \ncredit for getting us here today.\n  I would also like to extend a sincere thanks to Chairman Harkin and \nRanking Member Alexander, as well as former Ranking Member Enzi, and \nall of their staffs. Senators Harkin, Alexander, and Enzi have been \ninvolved in drafting the bill from the outset. They have worked to make \nsure that the bill remained a priority for the HELP Committee. The \nexpertise of their staffs has been invaluable throughout this process. \nI want to thank Senator Harkin's staff, Mario Cardona and Mildred \nOtero, and Senator Alexander's staff, Peter Oppenheim and Patrick \nMurray. I would also like to thank our House colleagues, \nRepresentatives Kline and Miller, for making this bill a priority and \nfor getting it done.\n  Every working parent with children, no matter their income level, \nworries about child care. What's affordable? What's accessible? Will my \nchild be safe? Where can I get the best care for my kid? The CCDBG \nprogram has given many families over many years peace of mind, but we \ncan and should be doing more to improve child care for children, \nparents, and providers alike. It is long past time to revitalize, \nrefresh, and reform this vitally important program. It is my hope that \nwe can move swiftly to pass this bill and send it to the President's \ndesk. It has been 18 years in the making. Let's not wait any longer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/12/senate-section/article/S5952-1", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5952]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FALL OF THE BERLIN WALL\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, November 9, 1989, was the day the Berlin \nWall came down, a day we can all be proud. It is a day that reminds us \nof the power of democratic values and ideals.\n  I am filled with happiness as I remember that wonderful day 25 years \nago. I am a proud American, there is no other country blessed with such \nopportunity, but the roots of my heritage lie in Poland. I grew up in a \nhome that kept the heritage of the old country alive. As a child of \nWorld War II, Europe has always been fundamental to my life.\n  Together with my family I watched Poland fall, along with Hungary and \nthe Czech Republic and others, behind the Iron Curtain. I remember when \nPoland was sold out at Yalta and Potsdam because of an ill-conceived \nagreement. These countries became captive nations.\n  We watched as a wall was built in Berlin. Those in East Berlin found \nthemselves behind not only the Iron Curtain but the Berlin Wall as \nwell, cut off from family, friends, and their livelihoods.\n  I am proud that Americans stood up at this moment--the famous Berlin \nAirlift provided those in West Berlin during the Berlin Blockade. The \nUnited States, with our allies, delivered basic necessities, food, and \nfuel. We all stood with President Kennedy as he declared ``Ich bin ein \nBerliner.'' American leadership was instrumental in making small cracks \nin the wall. As Madeline Albright, whose heritage is also rooted in \nEastern Europe like my own, has said of the United States, 'We are the \nindispensable nation. We stand tall. We see further into the future.'\n  The wall began to crumble when an obscure Polish electrician named \nLech Walesa jumped over a wall in a shipyard in Gdansk. It began with \nthe Solidarity movement. From this, a people's revolution was sparked \nin Central Europe.\n  And thanks to the nonviolent protestors, the dissidents, such as \nVaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia, and the political leadership from \nPresident Reagan and Maggie Thatcher and members of Congress the Wall \ncame down.\n  I stand here to commemorate the fall of the Berlin Wall, bringing \ndown the Iron Curtain. Twenty five years ago, as a citizen of a strong \ndemocratic United States of America, I joined President Reagan when he \nsaid, ``Mr. Gorbochev, tear down this wall.'' I take this opportunity \nto stand together with my countrymen and celebrate our democratic \nvalues, our respect for human rights, and our freedom. The United \nStates is a great nation, and through our action, commitment, and \nresolve, we will continue to bring down walls of oppression.\n  This is a great occasion for all of us and for the world and deserves \nour remembrance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/12/senate-section/article/S5952-2", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5952-S5955]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                        Corporal Thomas A.

Blair of Wagoner, OK who lost his \nlife on March 24, 2003, from injuries sustained during a lengthy battle \nwith insurgents while serving his Nation in Nasiriyah, Iraq.\n  The son of Alfred Jr. and Nancy Hinton Blair, Tommy was born July 7, \n1978, in Wagoner, OK. After graduating from Broken Arrow High School, \nhe entered the Marine Corps in 1997 and was assigned to the 2nd Low \nAltitude Air Defense Battalion, Marine Air Control Group-28, 2nd Marine \nAircraft Wing, Cherry Point, NC.\n  Tommy was posthumously awarded the Navy-Marine Corps Commendation \nMedal for helping pull nine wounded marines into an armored vehicle \nbefore it was hit by at least four enemy rocket-propelled grenades and \nthen a missile fired from an American attack plane. He was among 18 \nmarines killed that day in fighting around Nasiriyah.\n  Tommy was laid to rest in Ozark Memorial Park Cemetery in Joplin, MO, \nand is survived by his father Alfred Jr., mother Nancy, and brother \nAlfred III.\n  ``He was a young man that would give the shirt off his back if \nsomeone needed it,'' recalled his older brother, Marine SSG Alfred \nBlair, III. ``He lived life to the fullest and enjoyed every minute of \nevery day. In his first letter home to our mom, he said he was doing \nwhat he had been trained to do and was proud to be doing it for his \ncountry.''\n  Today we remember Marine CPL Thomas A. Blair, the first known native \nOklahoman to lose his life in Operation Iraqi Freedom.

After graduating from Union High School in Tulsa, OK, in \n1993, I nominated this bright young man to attend the U.S. Air Force \nAcademy. He spent a year at the Academy's Prep School before entering \nthe U.S. Air Force Academy, where he graduated in 1998. Upon completing \nflight training, he was assigned as an instructor and KC-135 pilot at \nthe 911th Refueling Squadron at Grand Forks Air Force Base, ND, and was \ndeployed to Qatar to work in the Combined Air Operations Center in June \n2004.\n  Funeral services were held on September 14, 2004, at Broken Arrow \nAssembly of God Church, with internment at the U.S. Air Force Academy \nCemetery in Colorado Springs, CO. Javy is survived by his parents John \nand Wanda and brother Joe.\n  His favorite Bible verse in John 15 states, depending on the \ntranslation, that ``no greater love has a man than he lay down his life \nfor his friends,'' his mother said. When discussing becoming an organ \ndonor with his mother during his junior year at the Academy, Javy said, \n``I want to be a donor too. If I die and part of me could be used, it \ncould give somebody else a chance to live the life that I won't have.''\n  Today we remember Air Force Capt. John J.

An active member of ROTC in high school in Lake \nElsinore, CA, he followed in the footsteps of his father and \ngrandfather, enlisting in the Army at the age of 17, just 2 weeks after \ngraduating from Lake Elsinore High School. His first assignment after \ncompleting training at Ft Sill, OK was B Battery, 2nd Battalion, 44th \nAir Defense Artillery Regiment, 101st Airborne Division, Air Assault, \nFort Campbell, KY.\n  Deploying for the first time in March 2003, Dan was part of the team \nsent to the villa where two sons of Saddam Hussein were hiding on July \n23, 2003. After the gunfight that killed Odai and Qusai Hussein, Dan's \nphoto was taken by media and he was on the cover of the Los Angeles \nTimes standing in front of the building, holding his gun.\n  Dan was laid to rest in Riverside National Cemetery in Riverside, CA, \nand is survived by his parents, Billy and Sherri Parker; three \nbrothers, Dustin, Dalton, and Dallas; and a sister, Danielle.\n  Just before Dan deployed, his father drove to Nashville, TN, to spend \ntime with him. ``We drove around Nashville, went out to Opryland, drove \ndown Music Row. I told him no one has a guarantee on the number of \nyears you got. We don't know what the number is, but the important \nthing is every day you do what you're supposed to do,'' said his \nfather.\n  ``Not one time, ever, did I think that he wasn't going to walk \nthrough that door back home, but that's OK. I'm not disappointed in the \n20 or 30 or 40 or 50 years that he didn't have. I'm excited about the \n18 he did have. He was able to touch so many people's lives,'' Billy \nParker said.\n  Today we remember Army PFC Daniel R.

Powers, of Skiatook, OK who died on February 24, 2006, of \nnoncombat related injuries while serving his nation in Baghdad, Iraq.\n  As the youngest of three boys, Joshua was born February 11, 1985 and \nenlisted in July 2005. After basic training he was assigned to 2nd \nBattalion, 502nd Infantry Regiment, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 101st \nAirborne Division, Fort Campbell, KY. He had been in Iraq for just over \ntwo weeks.\n  Josh was buried at Osage Garden Cemetery, Skiatook, OK where Army \npersonnel honored him with a 21-gun salute and played ``Taps''. He is \nsurvived by his mother Patricia; father Ernest; and brothers Michael \nand Jonathan.\n  At the funeral service, an elder at Sperry's Remnant Church of Jesus \nChrist of Latter-day Saints, C.H. Whiteman, said Joshua was doing what \nhe thought was right. ``If it weren't for young men like him, we \ncouldn't enjoy the kind of life we have in America,'' he said.\n  Today we remember Army PFC Joshua F. Powers, a young man who loved \nhis family and country, and gave his life as a sacrifice for freedom.\n\n[[Page S5954]]\n\n                      Specialist Bryan L. Quinton\n\n  Mr. President, I also wish to remember the life and sacrifice of Army \nSPC Bryan L. Quinton, of Sand Springs, OK, who died on May 4, 2006, of \ninjuries sustained when a rocket propelled grenade struck near his \nvehicle while he served his nation in Baghdad, Iraq.\n  Born June 29, 1981 to Timothy and Kristi Quinton in Tulsa, OK, Bryan \nenlisted in the United States Army on January 15, 2004 and completed \nbasic training and advanced individual training at Fort Leonard Wood, \nMO. He served in Alpha Company, 2nd Engineer Battalion, 2nd Infantry \nDivision, Camp Giant, Korea before being reassigned to Bravo Company, \n5th Engineer Battalion, Ft Leonard Wood, MO.\n  On the day he died, Bryan, like he had done so many times before, \ninsisted on being in the ``point''--the lead vehicle in a 12-vehicle \nconvoy checking for bombs. ``Let me make it safe for everyone else,'' \nhe was quoted as saying. No one would travel those highways until he \nand his comrades gave the ``all-clear signal,'' said BG Todd Semonite, \ncommander of the engineer school at Fort Leonard Wood, MO. Everyone \nlooked to him for their own personal safety.\n  Funeral services were held on May 17, 2006 at First United Methodist \nChurch in Sapulpa, OK. The road leading into the Green Hill Memorial \nGardens Cemetery was bordered on both sides by scores of American \nflags, snapping in the breeze. Nearly 100 motorcyclists, many of them \nveterans from previous wars, stood at attention along the flag-lined \nroad as the funeral procession glided past them. As eight Army \npallbearers pulled the silver-colored casket from the hearse, a \nbagpiper in the distance softly played ``Amazing Grace.'' His wife \nCyndi was given the folded flag that draped the coffin as her husband \nwas honored by a 21-gun salute and the playing of taps.\n  Bryan is survived by his wife Cyndi; daughter Pyper; son Connor; \nparents Tim and Kristy Quinton; brother Garth; brother Brent and his \nwife Alison; nephew Clay Quinton; grandmother Barbara Weaver; and \ngrandfather Grady Quinton.\n  ``My heart died when my husband did, but I know he would want us to \nthink about all the crazy stunts he pulled and all the laughter,'' \nCyndi said. ``God, you are very lucky to have him! Heaven, just get \nready to laugh!''\n  Today we remember Army SPC Bryan L. Quinton, a young man who loved \nhis family and country, and gave his life as a sacrifice for freedom.\n\n\n                      Specialist Stephen M. Scott\n\n  Mr. President, it is my honor to pay tribute to the life and \nsacrifice of Army SPC Stephen M. Scott of Lawton, OK, who died on \nAugust 23, 2003 from non-combat injuries sustained while serving his \nnation near Fallujah, Iraq.\n  Born in San Antonio, Stephen moved several times before settling in \nLawton, OK. He met his wife Marie in a psychology class before \ngraduating from Eisenhower High School in Lawton and the couple married \non July 4, 2002.\n  Stephen joined the Oklahoma National Guard in 2001 and he and Marie \nchose to go on active duty a year later. Stephen was a cook assigned to \n2nd Squadron, 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment and Marie worked community \nrelations for the 14th Public Affairs Detachment in Fort Carson, CO. He \ndeployed to Iraq in June 2002. While she was aware of the risk involved \nin her husband's deployment, Marie never thought her office would be \nhandling a news release announcing his death.\n  ``Especially not Stephen,'' she said. ``He was amazing. I'm so sad, \nbut sometimes I can't help but smile. He was so goofy he would make you \nlaugh. He was very spiritual. He was very strong. We had a lot of \nplans.''\n  Today we remember Army SPC Stephen M.

He enlisted in the U.S. \nMarine Corps on December 7, 1993 and spent his 6 years guarding U.S. \nembassies in Brasilia, Moscow and the consulate in Rio de Janeiro. \nAfter separating from the Marine Corps in 2000, he attended Oklahoma \nChristian University and enlisted with the 486th Civil Affairs \nBattalion, Army Reserve, Broken Arrow, OK.\n  While at Oklahoma Christian University, Kyle worked for the student \nnewspaper, serving as an editor for 2 years. In 2002, he was selected \nas one of 16 student journalists to participate in the Summer Institute \nin Journalism sponsored by the Coalition of Christian Colleges and \nUniversities. His assignments included interviews with the Colombian \npresident as well as U.S. Representatives Ernest Istook and J.C. Watts. \nIn 2003, Kyle spent 6 months in Costa Rica in a program designed to \nimmerse the learner in the Spanish language. While serving in Brasilia, \nhe ``adopted'' two young poor girls and urged his family to send them \ngifts. He wasted no time, rising early to explore the many cities he \nvisited. It is as though he knew he needed a faster pace to complete \nhis life.\n  Just 12 months short of his graduation with a dual major in \njournalism and Spanish, Kyle was called to active duty in November 2003 \nand deployed to Afghanistan.\n  Kyle is survived by his father Dan; mother Jo; and two sisters, Karla \nSeitsinger and Penny Owen Cockerell.

Hatak was assigned to 3rd \nBattalion, 3rd Marine Regiment, 3rd Marine Division, III Marine \nExpeditionary Force, Marine Corps Base Kaneohe Bay, HI.\n  Hatak was born on March 11, 1985 in Overbrook, OK and graduated from \nMarietta High School in 2003 where he was remembered as a quiet, well-\nmannered young man who was a good student and person. A proud native \nAmerican, he grew up attending powwows, where he performed and competed \nas a traditional Choctaw dancer. Good at his craft, he earned second \nplace at the Trail of Tears Powwow in September 2003 and second-place \nat the Citizen Potawatomi Nation Intertribal Powwow in October 2004. \nWearing two long braids much of his life, he woke one morning and told \nhis mother he had to cut his hair because of a dream.

Mr. President, today I wish to honor a naval vessel and \ncrew that served with distinction during an important chapter of U.S. \nmilitary history.\n  The Navy's modernization program of the 1950s included construction \nof a new class of fleet tankers that combined speed and an enlarged \ncapacity to deliver fuel to the fleet. One of the vessels ordered in \nthis modernization effort was named the USS Ponchatoula, AO-148. The \nvessel was laid down in Camden, NJ on March 1, 1954. The new fleet \ntanker displaced 38,000 tons when fully loaded greatly exceeding the \ncapacity of tankers used during World War II. The ship had a complement \nof 324 officers and men. Although the USS Ponchatoula was a support \nvessel rather than a combat warship, she was armed with two 5-inch guns \nand twelve 3-inch antiaircraft guns.\n  The launching of the USS Ponchatoula into the waters of the Delaware \nRiver took place on July 9, 1954, at Camden, and she subsequently \nsailed across the river to Philadelphia, where the vessel was \ncommissioned on January 12, 1956.\n  Assigned to the Pacific Fleet, USS Ponchatoula made the long voyage \nto the west coast. Following her arrival at Long Beach, CA, on March \n10, 1956, the oiler conducted her shakedown cruise off the California \ncoast.\n  In the fall of 1956, USS Ponchatoula was ordered to the western \nPacific, her home waters for most of her active career. While en-route \nto Sasebo, Japan, to join Seventh Fleet as a unit of Service Squadron \nThree, she assisted a disabled Panamanian merchant ship that had been \nbattered by two typhoons.\n  USS Ponchatoula accompanied the Seventh Fleet in early 1958 as the \nNavy sailed into harm's way in the Formosa Strait off the coast of the \nPeople's Republic of China, PRC. PRC forces were threatening to occupy \nseveral small islands off the coast of China, notably Quemoy and Matsu. \nPresident Eisenhower ordered the Navy to the area to symbolize American \ndetermination and support Taiwanese forces holding those small islands. \nPresident Eisenhower's tough stand and the presence of the Seventh \nFleet off shore forced the PRC to back down.\n  In late April and early May of 1962, USS Ponchatoula replenished \nships in the task force that participated in the atmospheric nuclear \ntest Operation Dominic near Christmas Island.\n  In September 1962, the oiler sailed to Midway Island to supply ships \ninvolved in the recovery of CDR Wally Schirra's Project Mercury Space \nCapsule Sigma 8 and in May 1963 supported the recovery of the then-\nMajor Gordon Cooper's Mercury Space Capsule Faith 7. USS Ponchatoula \nalso supported recovery operations for Gemini 4, 6, and 7 in 1965 and \nApollo 7 in 1968.\n  When hostilities began to escalate in Vietnam during the summer and \nfall of 1964, USS Ponchatoula was deployed to the South China Sea to \nsupport fleet operations off the coast of Vietnam. She refueled \nnumerous warships in those waters during the 1964 and 1965 bombing \ncampaign against targets in North Vietnam.\n  In the summer of 1969 and into 1970 the USS Ponchatoula returned to \nPearl Harbor and served the fleet in Hawaiian waters.\n  During the 1970s USS Ponchatoula's area of operations expanded into \nthe Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf, reflecting growing U.S. Navy \nactivity in that part of the globe. In September 1980 the ship was \ntransferred to the Military Sealift Command, becoming USNS Ponchatoula, \nT-AO-148 and beginning operation with a mainly civilian crew. Based at \nSubic Bay for most of the next decade, she continued her underway \nreplenishment work, helping maintain the Navy's mobility and striking \npower in an often troubled region. USNS Ponchatoula was inactivated in \nFebruary 1992 and laid up at Suisun Bay, CA. Though stricken from the \nNaval Vessel Register at the end of August 1992, she remained in Navy \ncustody until transferred to the Maritime Administration for disposal \nin May 1999.\n  During the 43 years between her commissioning in 1956 and her \ntransfer to the reserve fleet in 1999, the USS Ponchatoula rendered \nmeritorious service to her country, helping to stop aggression in the \nTaiwan Strait, assisting the space program and supporting U.S. forces \nin Vietnam. She and the thousands of Navy sailors who served aboard her \nover the decades deserve the accolades of a grateful nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/12/senate-section/article/S5955-2", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5955]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        PIERMONT, NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I wish to honor the town of \nPiermont, NH, which is celebrating the 250th anniversary of its \nfounding this year. I am delighted to recognize this very special \nmilestone.\n  Piermont, a town in Grafton County, lies in the shadow of Piermont \nMountain and is bordered by the Connecticut River and the magnificent \nWhite Mountain National Forest.\n  The town of Piermont has a unique history. It was chartered on \nNovember 6, 1764, by colonial Governor Benning Wentworth, and the town \nderives its name from the ``Piemonte'' region of Italy, which in \nItalian means ``at the foot of the mountain.'' Piermont's location in \nthe Connecticut River Valley played an important role in the \ndevelopment of its proud agricultural heritage.\n  Piermont is home to Lake Tarleton, named after Colonel William \nTarleton, who served as a delegate to the 1791 Constitutional \nConvention. Two well-known summer camps are located on the lake--Camp \nWalt Whitman and Kingswood Camp for Boys. Each year, campers come to \nPiermont to enjoy the great outdoors and have some good old-fashioned \nsummer fun.\n  Throughout the town's history, Piermont residents have been well \nknown for their commitment to serve our great Nation. One distinguished \nPiermont resident, Ira Hobart Evans, a Civil War hero, was awarded the \nMedal of Honor, our Nation's highest military honor.\n  As the town marks its 250th anniversary this year, Piermont citizens \nare demonstrating their pride and community spirit with many special \nevents in celebrating this historic occasion--including a parade in \nAugust that brought together residents, businesses, and community \norganizations. I am pleased to join all Granite Staters in \ncongratulating Piermont citizens on reaching this milestone and in \nthanking them for their contributions to the State of New Hampshire. \nCongratulations, Piermont.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/12/senate-section/article/S5955-3", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5955-S5956]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECOGNIZING SUNSHINE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL\n\n Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nschool that is celebrating its 150th year of service to students in \nSpringfield, MO. Sunshine Elementary School began serving young people \nduring the Civil War. The wooden one-room country school house was \noriginally located at what is now the major intersection of Campbell \nRoad and Sunshine Lane. During the Civil War, students often witnessed \nthe movement of troops along the road known at the time as the Old Wire \nRoad. Later, the adjacent Sunshine Drive took its name from the school.\n  According to ``So That All May Learn,'' a history of the Springfield \nPublic School system published in 1995, Sunshine Elementary School was \nannexed into the Springfield School District in the mid-1920s, and the \none-room school was relocated and replaced with a larger structure at \nits current location. The original school site, close to what is now \nthe headquarters of Bass Pro Shops, was sold by the district in 1930.\n  In the boom years following World War II, student growth surged with \nthe start of the baby boomer generation. In the late 1940s, student \nenrollment at Sunshine Elementary School grew by 430 kids in a single \nyear, creating an overcrowding issue. The solution involved moving \nstudents in grades five and six to the nearby Phelps School. The first \nmajor addition to the Sunshine School came in 1950 when six new \nclassrooms were built, along with a multipurpose room. Forty years \nlater, new restrooms, two classrooms, and a library were added. More \nrecently, Sunshine Elementary School became the last traditional school \nbuilding equipped with air conditioning.\n\n[[Page S5956]]\n\n  In October, students, faculty, parents and community leaders observed \nthe 150th year of educating children at Sunshine Elementary School. \nOctober 24 was designated as Sunshine Elementary School Day in \nSpringfield, which included Civil War reenactors, games, the planting \nof a commemorative tree, food and other fun activities.\n  Current and former Sunshine Elementary School students joined \ntogether for a sesquicentennial celebration at the school. Sunshine \nElementary School principal David Martin encouraged students, families, \nfaculty, and alumni to participate in the sesquicentennial by providing \noral histories and historical artifacts, including photographs, report \ncards, yearbooks, and newspaper articles.\n  Today, more than 200 students attend Sunshine Elementary School. \nStudent to teacher ratios are 12 to 1, which is the second best among \nthe 36 elementary schools in the Springfield district. In 2014, \nSunshine Elementary School academically ranks higher than 65.3 percent \nof elementary schools in Missouri and 11th among those in the \nSpringfield district. I congratulate Sunshine Elementary School and its \nmany alumni and supporters for its decades of continued service and \nsuccess. Happy 150th birthday Sunshine Elementary School.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/12/senate-section/article/S5956-1", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5956]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                REMEMBERING DR. CLEMENT ALEXANDER PRICE\n\n Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, today I recognize the life and \nlegacy of New Jerseyan and Newark city historian Dr. Clement Alexander \nPrice, who was taken from us too soon on November 5. Clem was a mentor \nand valued friend to me, and he will be sorely missed by all who knew \nhim.\n  The foremost authority on the history of African Americans in New \nJersey, Clement Alexander Price was born in 1945 in Washington, DC, to \nJames Price, Sr. and Anna Christine Spann Price. He inherited his love \nof history from his parents and since then instilled in generations \nthis love for history. After earning his bachelor's and master's \ndegrees at the University of Bridgeport, Clem came to Newark to teach \nat Essex Community College. He earned his Ph.D. at Rutgers University, \nbecame a professor at Rutgers University-Newark, and founded the \nInstitute on Ethnicity, Culture, and the Modern Experience.\n  Clem was devoted to Newark, and he served not only as our leading \nhistorian but as a powerful spiritual force in our State's largest \ncity. He was invested in Newark, and--ever generous with his time--was \nknown to arrange tours for visitors that highlighted not only the \ncity's rich history but its considerable promise. Clem always \nrecognized the vital truth that charting a brighter course for the \nfuture requires a comprehensive understanding of the past. As a fervent \nbeliever in Newark's potential, Clem, with his unparalleled knowledge \nand thoughtful advice, was invaluable to me and so many others who were \nelected to serve the city.\n  Clem's commitment to the city of Newark was surpassed only by his \ndedication to public service, and he lent his time and expertise to a \nmultitude of causes and organizations. From serving as president of the \nNewark Education Trust to chairing President Obama's 2008 transition \nteam for the National Endowment for the Humanities, Clem was always \nseeking opportunities to serve his community and his Nation. He \nbelieved in the power of civic engagement, and he dedicated his career \nto cultivating that engagement through historical literacy and \nunyielding activism in service of Newark and beyond. Clem was truly one \nof Newark's great statesmen.\n  Most of all, Clem was kind. He touched so many lives and helped all \nwho knew him to learn, grow, heal, and come together.\n  Clem is mourned by his wife Mary Sue Sweeney Price, his sister \nJarmila, and his brother James, and by friends and colleagues in the \ncity of Newark, the State of New Jersey, and across the Nation. I ask \nthat the Senate join me in remembering and honoring the extraordinary \nlife of Dr. Clement Alexander Price.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/12/senate-section/article/S5956-2", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5956]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  REMEMBERING GEOFFREY ``CRAIG'' HUNT\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I ask my colleagues to join \nme in paying tribute to Geoffrey ``Craig'' Hunt, a 13-year veteran \npilot with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, \nCAL FIRE. Craig was an exceptional firefighting pilot, a loyal friend, \nand most of all a devoted family man who was tragically killed in the \nline of duty fighting the Dog Rock Fire near Yosemite National Park on \nOctober 7, 2014.\n  Craig Hunt was born in Richmond, IN, and dedicated his life to \nserving his country, first as a U.S. Navy P-3 pilot from 1975 to 1984 \nand then in the Naval Reserve for 20 years after leaving active duty. \nCraig was also an enthusiastic and accomplished scholar who received a \nmaster's degree in business from the University of Southern California. \nA lifelong interest in science and the natural world led him to also \nearn a master's degree in biochemistry from the University of \nCalifornia at Santa Cruz. His passion for learning led him to teaching. \nIn the winter months, when the fire season was over, he worked at UC \nSanta Cruz as a course assistant teaching general chemistry and organic \nchemistry labs.\n  Always at home in the cockpit of a plane, Craig loved his job as a \npilot with CAL FIRE. For 13 years he valiantly answered the call to \nprotect public safety and the environment by piloting aircraft during \nemergencies. He had a vast knowledge about wild land fires and was \nskilled in pinpointing aerial attacks in places that were difficult for \nground crews to reach.\n  Colleagues remember Craig as an experienced and respected pilot who \nloved his job. He was happy and outgoing, quick with a smile, and had a \nfantastic sense of humor. A friend and neighbor recalled that Craig \nwould ``drop anything in a heartbeat if you needed help or \nassistance.''\n  When he was not on duty, Craig was an avid outdoorsman with a passion \nfor golfing, fly fishing, hiking, bird watching, and scuba diving. \nStanding beside him through it all was his beloved wife Sally, whom he \nmet in college and married in 1975. Craig was also a devoted father to \nhis two daughters, Sarah and Nancy. His daughter Sarah said about him, \n``My dad died a hero. There was not a day that went by that I didn't \ntalk to my dad. He was my best friend.''\n  Craig Hunt dedicated his life to his family, his community, and his \ncountry, and his courageous service will be forever remembered. On \nbehalf of the people of California, whom he served so bravely, I extend \nmy gratitude and deepest sympathies to his family, friends, and \ncolleagues. He will be deeply missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/12/senate-section/article/S5956-3", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5956-S5957]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING EDGAR P. SILVER\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I want to take a moment today to \nhonor retired Baltimore Circuit Court Judge Edgar P. Silver, who died \nyesterday at the age of 91. I am deeply saddened by the passing of \nEdgar Silver. He was a loyal friend, valued mentor, and trusted \nadvisor--and not just to me but also to my father. Judge Silver served \nwith my father on the Circuit Court of Baltimore City, and he also \nserved with my uncle, Maurice Cardin, in the Maryland House of \nDelegates. Judge Silver was as fine a person as you could ever hope to \nmeet, and he always found the time to listen. Foremost among his many \nremarkable qualities was his empathy. He had the rare ability to \ntranscend generations and connect with people of any age: when he was a \nyoung man, he quickly won the respect of his elders, and as he became \nolder he never lost the ability to speak to and inspire the young.\n  Judge Silver's parents Samuel and Lena were immigrants. His father \nwas a tailor. Judge Silver was a native of East Baltimore and a \nneighbor throughout his later life, as well as a fellow alumnus of \nBaltimore City College. He served our Nation in the U.S. Merchant \nMarine from 1943 to 1945. He was a 1954 graduate of the University of \nBaltimore Law School and was elected as a city delegate to the general \nassembly that same year. He served in the house of delegates until \n1965. In 1965, he moved to the judicial branch, where he served on the \nold Municipal Court of Baltimore City until 1971. He served on the \nDistrict Court of Baltimore City until 1977, when he was appointed to \nthe Circuit Court by acting Governor\n\n[[Page S5957]]\n\nBlair Lee III. Judge Silver retired from the bench in 1988. But after \nretiring from the bench, Judge Silver found a whole new career as a \npartner in Rifkin, Weiner, Livingston, Levitan & Silver LLC, where he \nwas still working when he died.\n  The Baltimore Sun obituary quoted Alan M. Rifkin, who cofounded the \nlaw firm that ultimately became Rifkin, Weiner, Livingston, Levitan & \nSilver LLC with Judge Silver, as saying, ``He lived his life by two \nprinciples: 'The best is yet to come' and 'Never trade old friends for \nnew ones, just keep adding them on.' '' I couldn't agree more. Judge \nSilver simply loved his home city and relished the chance to serve its \ncitizens. He approached his time on the Baltimore Circuit Court with \nenormous humility and never lost sight of the fact that his decisions \nfrom the bench had far-reaching effects on people's lives. His \ncontributions to the Maryland Legislature were varied and lasting, and \nthe number of issues he shaped for the better are innumerable. Judge \nSilver was a political historian and touchstone with a perspective like \nfew others. His counsel through the years has been invaluable to me and \nmy family. We will be forever grateful.\n  I want to extend my deepest sympathies to Ann, his wife of 64 years; \ntheir children, Michael Silver and Roslyn ``Rozzie'' Benjamin; and \nJudge Silver's other family members, all of whom he loved deeply, \nincluding his four grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. The \npeople of Maryland have lost a tremendous asset with Judge Silver's \npassing, but all of us who knew him are richer for having done \nso.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/12/senate-section/article/S5957-1", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5957]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO LEROY GOODMAN\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate Mayor LeRoy \nGoodman, of Fernley, on his retirement. After serving as the mayor of \nFernley for several years, Mayor Goodman will be retiring on November \n19, 2014. It gives me great pleasure to congratulate him on his \nretirement after 42 years of hard work and dedication to the Silver \nState.\n  Upon graduating from the University of Nevada, Reno, with a \nbachelor's degree in business, Mayor Goodman went on to earn his \nmaster's degree in education and became a basketball coach and teacher \nat Fernley High School in 1965. Aside from dedicating his time \neducating the youth in Fernley, he has devoted much of his time and \nefforts to the betterment of his community through his roles as a board \nmember of the Northern Nevada Development Authority, a member of the \nFernley Town Board, sitting on the board of directors for a multitude \nof Nevada organizations, and as Lyon county commissioner. His many \nyears of experience made him an ideal candidate for Fernley Mayor after \nthe resignation of former Mayor Todd Cutler. Upon being sworn in as \nmayor on August 5, 2009, he immediately began working on improving the \nfunctioning of the council and city operations. His main focus remained \nhis constituency and ensuring their needs and priorities were met.\n  I have been fortunate during my time in Congress to be able to work \nclosely with Mayor Goodman on Federal legislation--the Fernley Economic \nSelf-Determination Act, S.1983, which will provide the city of Fernley \nthe option to purchase Federal lands within the city's boundaries that \nare currently landlocked by checkerboard parcels of Federal land. \nWorking alongside private business partners and State and Federal \nregional agencies, we are seeking to develop a long-term sustainable \neconomic development plan that will enable all parties to benefit from \nthe use of private land within the city. This bill will greatly help \nthe city and will clear the way for thousands of high-paying, private \nsector jobs. The progress we have made in Congress on this initiative \nwould not be possible without the mayor's strong leadership.\n  His service to the Fernley community extends far beyond the many \npositions he has held in the Silver State over the years. Mayor Goodman \nalso served his country as a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Air Force. \nI extend my deepest gratitude to Mayor Goodman for his courageous \ncontributions to the United States of America and to freedom-loving \nnations around the world. His service to his country and his bravery \nand dedication earn him a place among the outstanding men and women who \nhave valiantly defended our Nation.\n  As a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I recognize \nthat Congress has a responsibility not only to honor these brave \nindividuals who serve America but also to ensure they are cared for \nwhen they return home. I remain committed to upholding this promise for \nour veterans and servicemembers in Nevada and throughout the Nation.\n  I am grateful for his dedication and commitment to the people of \nFernley and to the State of Nevada. He exemplifies the highest \nstandards of leadership and community service and should be proud of \nhis long and meaningful career. Today, I ask that all of my colleagues \njoin me in congratulating Mayor Goodman on his retirement, and I offer \nmy deepest appreciation for all that he has done to make Nevada an even \nbetter place. I offer my best wishes for many successful and fulfilling \nyears to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/12/senate-section/article/S5957-2", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5957]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PRIVILEGES OF THE FLOOR\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE.
