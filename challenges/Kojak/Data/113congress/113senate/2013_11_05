Mr. President, my thanks to the majority leader this \nmorning. Before I say a few words about Rev. Gregory Knox Jones, I want \nto go back in time for a couple of minutes. I was talking to the pages \nout in the hall behind the leader about how when our country was first \nsettled folks came here from all over the world. They came here in part \nin pursuit of religious freedom. They were people of different faiths. \nThey wanted to be able to worship God as they saw fit.\n  When it got really tough in Philadelphia at the Constitutional \nConvention--trying to wrestle with issues such as slavery, rights of \nwomen, whether there should be little States, big States, how we were \ngoing to be represented here--many times the Founding Fathers hit the \npause button and they called in a person of faith to pray, to help them \nto find a way to progress, and they did again and again.\n  When George Washington was inaugurated--not here but in New York \nCity--at the end of the day they did not go off and have big parties; \nthey actually went to church. In the early days of our country, worship \nservices were actually held here, as some of us know. We start every \nday here in the Senate with a prayer, oftentimes delivered by retired \nNavy ADM Barry C. Black, our Chaplain, and today with a special guest, \nmy pastor, Gregory Knox Jones from Westminster Presbyterian Church.\n  Our leader Harry Reid has run a number of marathons. As it happens, \nso has our guest. He is a long-distance\n\n[[Page S7802]]\n\nrunner, literally and figuratively. He just ran his 10th marathon. He \nran the New York Marathon on Sunday--I might say in good time. He won \nin the category of White men over 50 who pastor large Presbyterian \nchurches on the east coast and who were former team captains from the \nKansas State University football team. That category he won hands down. \nI congratulate him, and I am sure my colleagues do as well.\n  He reminds us every Sunday of the idea that we have a moral \nimperative to look out for the least of those in our society, people \nwho are hungry and need to be fed, people who have no health care. We \nhave an obligation to look after them. He reminds us every Sunday that \nwe have an obligation to look out for not only those who are in our \ncommunity in Wilmington, DE, but way beyond our borders, such as those \nin Guatemala and also those who live in Israel and the West Bank of \nJordan, to make sure justice is done in those places as well.\n  He reminds us every Sunday of the Golden Rule for our neighbor: Treat \nothers the way we want to be treated. We have to focus on the poor, \nwidows and the orphans, and those who are in need. He reminds us to not \njust talk a good game but to actually deliver on our words. What does \nit say in James 2? You show me your faith by your words, I will show \nyou my faith by my deeds. He reminds us of that every Sunday.\n  To my colleagues, he reminds us we are servants. There is a great \nsermon in Mark chapter 10. The words are, as I recall--I will \nparaphrase him--for those who want to be a leader, you have to be a \nslave to all. For those who want to become first, you must become last.\n  We thank you for those remembrances.\n  Every week I go to a Bible study led by our Chaplain. On Sundays I \ntry to show up in our own church. It reminds me of a double shot. You \nand I, Mr. President, are about the same age. We remember the days of \nMotown, the great song called ``Double Shot of My Baby's Love.'' Every \nweek I get a double shot of God's love from these two, my pastor and \nour Chaplain.\n  To his life partner Camilla and three children and six grandchildren, \nwe are honored you are here.\n  I want to close with the way he closes our sermons every Sunday, \ncolleagues. He does it with these words. I hope I have them right. It \ngoes something like this. When he lets us go and dismisses his flock he \nsays these words: May the love of God, the grace of Christ, and the \nfellowship of the Holy Spirit bless you, those you love, and the ones \nthat no one loves.\n  And the ones that no one loves. He sends us on our way. Those are \ngreat words for us today as well. We welcome him.\n  I thank the leader for allowing me to say these words this morning.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/05/senate-section/article/S7802-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7802]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--H.R. 3204\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I have spoken to the Republican leader on \nmore than one occasion, but I want to make sure all the Members \nunderstand that we have a 4-week work period. This is the second week \nof a 4-week work period, and we have certain work we have outlined that \nneeds to get accomplished. I hope everyone understands what we have to \nget done this week, next week, and the week after.\n  The reason we are pressing so much work into this limited work \nschedule is, first of all, it is necessary for a number of reasons and, \nsecond, this Senate has worked over the last number of years really \nhard during holidays. I have traveled, trying to get home for \nChristmas. I was here on Christmas Eve; I have done that twice. It has \nbeen extremely difficult for Christmas, Thanksgiving, and, of course, \nNew Year's.\n  It is wonderful to be able to go home to our families, our friends, \nbut we also have work to do. We represent our States, and there is work \nwe cannot do when we can only go home for weekends. Some of us live a \nlong ways away--it takes a day to get there and a day to get back--so \nit really is more complicated for those who live west of the \nMississippi.\n  The whole point is to communicate to everyone that we are going to \ntry to take Thanksgiving week off and the week after. The Republican \nleader and I really want to get that done, but we cannot do it if we \nare held up on procedural matters that are unnecessary.\n  I have outlined what we need to get done. I have explained this to \nthe Republican leader and explained it to my caucus on more than one \noccasion. The issue at hand is this: We have a few weekends left. We \nare going to be out Monday because it is Veterans Day. But all weekends \nuntil we leave here for Thanksgiving are going to be work weekends in \norder to get our work done.\n  I know people have schedules, but understand that you better keep \nthem pretty loose; otherwise, you are going to be missing some votes \naround here.\n  We voted on EDNA last night, and we were able to move that, get past \nthe cloture aspect of that. We have a way of going forward. There is no \nreason to eat up the whole 30 hours that are postcloture.\n  I am just telling everybody who is in effect forcing us to do this \nthat it may impinge upon the holidays, the situation dealing with \nThanksgiving. I hope we can get out of here on the Friday before \nThanksgiving, but it is up to people who I think have gotten into the \nhabit of having unnecessary delays. I need not say more. I really would \nlike, for myself personally and for the Senate, Democrats and \nRepublicans, to have those two weekends off.\n\n\n                                  ENDA\n\n  Take a look at where we are postcloture on a motion to proceed to \nENDA, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act.\n  I was disappointed to read yesterday that Speaker Boehner opposes the \nEmployment Non-Discrimination Act because he believes it will result in \nfrivolous lawsuits. But coming from a man whose caucus spent $3 million \nin taxpayer dollars defending the unconstitutional defense of marriage \nlaw in court, that is pretty rich.\n  Still, I thought it was important to investigate the Speaker's claim \nthat protecting lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Americans from \nbeing denied job opportunities, fired or harassed because of their \nsexual orientation or gender identity, would risk American jobs. To the \ncontrary, according to a study by the U.S. Government Accountability \nOffice--nonpartisan--in 21 States that have some protection against \nthis kind of discrimination, relatively few lawsuits have resulted. \nAlmost every State with an antidiscrimination law that prevents \nworkplace discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender \nindividuals had fewer than 10 lawsuits filed between 2007 and 2012, \naccording to the study. In fact, the lack of one clear and consistent \nFederal standard protecting against this harassment actually creates \nmore confusions for businesses and local government.\n  So I was also stunned when the Speaker said today that he wasn't even \ngoing to bring it up for a vote. Yesterday he said he didn't like it. \nToday he said he was not going to bring it up for a vote. If it came up \nfor a vote in the House, it would pass. We can look at a number of \ndifferent examples of this litigation aspect he raised.\n\n  Take the example of Kile Nave, a veteran police officer who was fired \nfrom the Audubon Park Police Department in Louisville, KY, after 3 \nyears of being terrorized by his supervisors. After speaking up against \nthe harassment, he was fired.\n  Kentucky is 1 of 33 States with no statute preventing discrimination \non the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. But Louisville \nhas a local\n\n[[Page S7803]]\n\nnondiscrimination ordinance, and the department had a written policy \nagainst sexual harassment, although it did not expressly protect \nagainst discrimination based on sexual orientation.\n  So Officer Nave has filed two separate legal complaints against his \nformer employer. Those complaints are still pending.\n  If there was one Federal law protecting all Americans from \ndiscrimination instead of a patchwork of ineffective and inefficient \nState and local laws, it would be simpler and less confusing for \nbusinesses and employees alike. That is one reason more than 100 of the \nNation's largest companies support the Employment Non-Discrimination \nAct and why most Fortune 500 companies already prohibit persecution \nbased on sexual orientation or gender identity. These companies know \nthat to recruit the best and brightest employees and remain \ncompetitive, they must foster an environment where all workers can \nreach their full potential.\n  Not only is Speaker Boehner's claim that ENDA would hurt business \nuntrue, it is also callous. It fails to take into account the \nheartbreaking suffering--not to mention lost wages and productivity--\nthat workplace discrimination causes every year.\n  When Kile Nave was hired by the Audubon Police Department, he already \nserved 20 years--two decades--as a police officer with other \ndepartments. This is what Kile said yesterday:\n\n       I've been a law enforcement officer since 1989 and I had \n     never experienced anything like what I experienced with my \n     previous employer. . . . But I wasn't going to let them push \n     me out of a job I loved.\n\n  So for 3\\1/2\\ years Kile endured torture at the hands of two of his \nsupervisors, including the chief and the deputy chief. Although \ncoworkers described Officer Nave's on-the-job performance as exemplary, \nhis supervisors called him derogatory names, told gay jokes in front of \nhim and about him, and directed profanity-laced rants toward him. This \nis the chief and the assistant chief.\n  This is what Officer Nave remembers about trying to get through the \nordeal:\n\n       Each day I kept thinking, `It's going to get better today.' \n     But it didn't. As a police officer you're supposed to have \n     thick skin. But it never got any better.\n\n  Then, last year, 2 weeks after Officer Nave filed a formal complaint \nwith his chief, he was fired based on charges of insubordination--\nsomebody who had basically been a police officer for one-quarter of a \ncentury.\n  For the first time since he was 16 years old, Kile Nave was \nunemployed, as he is right now. He is still unemployed. Although Kile \nwould love to return to police work and to doing the job he loves--and \nhe did it for a long time--no department will hire him with a \ntermination on his resume.\n  With one simple Federal law in place, which is the ENDA bill, people \nsuch as Kile could go to work without fearing such torment--and it was \ntorment. Every American deserves that right and that protection. Every \nemployee deserves to be judged on the quality of his or her work \ninstead of on their sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/05/senate-section/article/S7803-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7803]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, almost 1 year ago now, Michigan's \nGovernor Rick Snyder signed historic right-to-work legislation into \nlaw. At the time he said he viewed it ``as an opportunity to stand up \nfor Michigan's workers, to be pro-worker.''\n  The union bosses, the entrenched special interests, and the \nprofessional left may have stood in united, militant disagreement, but \nMichigan's soft-spoken Governor was right. The more venom Big Labor \ndirected at him, the more it seemed to confirm the suspicions of many \nof the middle-class workers Snyder was trying to help. He was, in fact, \non their side.\n  The truth is, over the years, Big Labor has come to care more about \nits own perks and power than the workers it was charged with \nprotecting. Snyder knew that and he knew it was time to tip the scales \nback in favor of workers. He is not alone.\n  In the Senate, Senator Paul and I share Governor Snyder's commitment \nto helping restore worker rights. That is why yesterday we filed an \namendment that would enact similar forward-looking reforms at the \nFederal level.\n  Our right-to-work amendment is simple enough. It merely calls for \nrepealing the discriminatory clauses in Federal law that allow, as a \ncondition of employment, forcing workers to join a union or forcing \nworkers to pay union dues. In practical terms, here is what that would \nmean for middle-class folks in Kentucky and across America: If you want \nto join a union, you can. If you don't want to join a union, you don't \nhave to. That is it. That is all this is about.\n  This is just common sense. It is basic fairness. According to one \nsurvey, about 80 percent of unionized workers agree that employees \nshould be able to decide whether joining a union is for them. But this \namendment isn't just about ending institutional discrimination against \nworkers; it is also about job creation, economic growth, and making \nAmerica more competitive in the 21st century.\n  Consider the fact that manufacturing employment is one-third higher \nin States with right-to-work laws or that, according to a recent study, \nStates with right-to-work saw improvements in real personal income and \naverage annual employment compared to what they would have seen without \nsuch laws or that many of our Nation's labor laws were passed in an \nearlier era, in some cases before many folks even had television sets.\n  America's labor regulations are antiquated and they need to be \nupdated for the modern world. That is what the flextime legislation I \nintroduced last week sought to achieve, and that is what right-to-work \nseeks to achieve as well.\n  Protecting the rights of workers, creating jobs, growing the economy, \nand keeping pace with the modern world is what right-to-work is all \nabout. It is just common sense. If States such as Michigan, with proud \ntraditions of organized labor, can look their problems in the face and \nact, then it is time for the Federal Government to act too.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senator Paul and me in supporting this \nimportant amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/05/senate-section/article/S7803-3", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7803-S7804]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               OBAMACARE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to say a word about ObamaCare as \nwell.\n  I wish to remind my colleagues that the President is absolutely \ncorrect. He is correct when he says ObamaCare is about so much more \nthan some flawed Web site. It is about people. People such as the \nCalifornia woman with stage 4 gallbladder cancer whose story we read \nabout in the Wall Street Journal just this past weekend. I will read \nsome of what she wrote:\n\n       I am a determined fighter and extremely lucky. But this \n     luck may have just run out: My affordable, lifesaving medical \n     insurance policy has been canceled effective December 31.\n\n  Here are the impossible choices she says she is left with. She can \neither get coverage through the exchange and lose access to her cancer \ndoctors or she can pay up to 50 percent more for, as she put it, ``the \nprivilege of starting over with an unfamiliar insurance company and \nimpaired benefits.''\n  That is just not right. It is not what the President promised, and it \nis not the kind of health care reform Americans asked for.\n  So we should keep our focus where it belongs--on the real people \ngetting hurt by this law.\n  But that doesn't mean we should stop asking questions about \nhealthcare.gov too. Because if the government can't even run a Web site \nthat it had 3 years--3 years--and hundreds of millions of dollars to \ncreate, can Americans entrust the same bureaucracy with even more power \nover their health care?\n  The calamitous rollout reminds us that we do not even know if data \nbeing submitted over this Web site is 100 percent secure. In today's \nage of digital scammers, that is a real concern for our constituents. \nIdentity theft is about the last problem Americans need to be dealing \nwith right now, especially with everything else this economy and this \nlaw have been throwing right at them. They are already mad enough\n\n[[Page S7804]]\n\nabout the President's repeated, unequivocal claims of, ``If you like \nit, you can keep it.''\n  The White House keeps trying to message its way out of this whopper, \nbut no matter what they say, the reality remains: People are getting \nhurt. People are getting hit with premiums they can't afford and \nmillions are losing the coverage they like. In my home State of \nKentucky alone, 130,000 individual policies and 150,000 small group \npolicies will be canceled. Remember, the President assured Americans up \nand down this wasn't going to happen.\n  I read about one DC woman who just lost her plan. She found something \ncomparable on the exchange, but it cost a lot more than what she had \nbefore. Here is what she said: ``[It's] just not fair.

The majority whip.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Unions in America\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I will speak as in morning business before \naddressing the matter that is pending before the Senate. I will speak \nin morning business on two issues, to respond to the Republican leader \nwho just left the floor, as he spoke on two issues; first is the issue \nof unions in America. History shows us that after World War II, when \nlabor organizations across the United States were at their peak \norganizing workers, giving them an opportunity to bargain collectively \nin the workplace for wages, benefits, safety, retirement, and health \ncare, that was one of the most amazing periods in America history. The \ngrowth of the American middle class was unprecedented as men and \nwomen--some fresh from serving in the war--came home and had a chance \nto earn a livelihood, to build a family, to build neighborhoods, \ncommunities, and literally build the middle class in America. It is no \ncoincidence that when the workers were given this voice and this \nstrength through the collective bargaining process, they prospered and \nAmerica prospered.\n  Today, we are in a much more difficult and challenging situation, \nwhen so many workers are living paycheck to paycheck while their \nproductivity gains, when it comes to our economy, are well documented. \nWhile the companies they work for are showing unprecedented levels of \nprofit, when the individuals who are managing these companies are being \ncompensated at the highest levels in our history, many of these men and \nwomen working every day are falling further and further behind. If we \nlook to the state of unionism, I think the facts speak for themselves. \nThose in the private sector who are in organized labor--part of a labor \nunion--are in very low percentage.\n  I think there is a parallel that can be drawn. At a time when workers \nhad a voice in the process, when their rights and their futures were \nwithin their control at a bargaining table, they prospered and America \nprospered. Today, without that strength at the bargaining table, many \nof these same families are falling further and further behind, despite \nthe profitability of the companies they work for. So those who want to \neliminate the opportunity for collective bargaining and make it more \ndifficult for workers to stand and speak for themselves in the \nworkplace, frankly, are going to condemn us to a much slower growing \neconomy and much more injustice when it comes to compensation.\n\n\n                        The Affordable Care Act\n\n  Secondly, the Republican leader spoke to the whole issue of the \nAffordable Care Act, which is characterized by some as ObamaCare. It is \nironic that the Commonwealth of Kentucky is one of the top three States \nthat is the most successful in signing up people for this new approach \nto health insurance. Some 31,000 people have signed up already through \nthe Affordable Care Act. Governor Beshear was on television just about \n10 days ago talking about the opportunities for Kentuckians to finally \nhave an opportunity for affordable health insurance, some of them for \nthe first time in their lives. It is an opportunity which I voted for \nand I support. I will make no excuses for the dismal rollout of this \nWeb site, and I hope it is fixed soon so people across the country will \nhave ready access to the information they need about their health \ninsurance. But I will not apologize for standing up for 40 or 50 \nmillion Americans who have no health insurance today.\n\n  Those of us who have gone through life experiences as a father with a \nsick child and no health insurance will never forget it as long as we \nlive. To sit in a waiting room of a hospital in Washington, DC, with \nyour baby and wonder who is going to walk through the door and take \ncare of her because you do not have insurance--you just have to hope \nthat the charity care being offered in that hospital will be good \ncare--that is a feeling no one should ever have.\n  I have lived it. I do not want others to have to live it. We have to \ngive to every American family a chance for health insurance.\n  Let me say a word about this notion of canceled policies. The market \nof insurance we are talking about here are people who are buying \nindividual health insurance, not the group plans at most places of \nemployment. It is a small segment but an important segment of our \npopulation. If you look at the facts you will find that almost two-\nthirds of the people who are in the individual health insurance market \nbuying their own plans for their family--through a broker, for \nexample--almost two-thirds of those plans are literally changed and \ncanceled every 2 years. There is a lot of flux and change in this \nmarket, and prices continue to go up.\n  At the end of the day, here is what we are facing: Some 2, 3, or 4 \nmillion people may find themselves in a more difficult position because \nthe policy they once had does not meet the standards which have now \nbeen established in law for minimum health insurance coverage in \nAmerica.\n  What are those standards that we say should be in every health \ninsurance policy?\n  No. 1, you cannot discriminate against people because of a \npreexisting condition. Is there a person alive in America today--any \nfamily who does not have someone with a preexisting condition? It can \nbe something as basic as asthma, diabetes, high blood pressure, \ncholesterol issues, mental illness. These things literally disqualified \npeople from coverage in health insurance. We have changed that law and \nsaid you cannot discriminate based on preexisting conditions. That is \nbasic.\n  Second, we have said you cannot put a lifetime limit on how much the \ninsurance policy will pay. Who knows--who knows--whether they are one \ndiagnosis or one accident away from needing health insurance that costs \nway beyond what we can even imagine. Mr. President, $100,000, $200,000 \nis not an unusual charge for what used to be considered somewhat \nroutine. We say you cannot cap the coverage in a health insurance \npolicy because life is unpredictable and our medical future is \nunpredictable. That is one of the provisions that has to be built into \nthe policy.\n  We also say you cannot discriminate against people in selling health \ninsurance because they happen to be women. And there was rank \ndiscrimination against women in America when it came to the issuance of \nhealth insurance before this new law.\n  We go on to say that 80 percent of the premiums you collect have to \nbe paid\n\n[[Page S7805]]\n\ninto medical services, not taken out in profit and marketing.\n  We also say that if you have a health insurance policy, your son or \ndaughter can stay under it until they reach the age of 26. That is \nimportant to every family with a graduating college student or someone \nlooking for a job in the household. They may not find a job, or if they \ndo, it may not have benefits. Don't you want the peace of mind as a \nparent to know that up to age 26 you can keep them on the family \npolicy?\n  I have just given you five parts of so-called ObamaCare, five parts \nthat have to be written now into every health insurance policy and five \nreasons why many companies are saying: We have to cancel the old policy \nand reissue a new one consistent with these five principles, with these \nfive protections. That is why many of these policies are being \nrewritten. The President should have been more expansive in his \nexplanation, but the fact is that is the story. That is what the \nAffordable Care Act does.\n  I hear the Senator from Kentucky tell us that 120,000 people may face \na new policy. I would like to ask, what is the normal turnover in \nhealth insurance policies in his State or other States. It happens with \nsome frequency. It is estimated that 17 million Americans are going to \nhave help in paying for their health insurance because of the \nAffordable Care Act. That means some will qualify for Medicaid. That \nmeans others will receive tax credits and tax benefits to help with \ntheir health insurance payments.\n  We are moving toward a society that has health insurance protection \nfor all, and that is good, not just for the peace of mind of each and \nevery individual and family affected by it but also because the system \nbecomes more just, more fair. Uninsured people get sick. They go to the \nhospital. They go to the doctor. They incur bills, many of which they \ncannot pay, and that burden is shifted to everyone else in America.\n  Let's accept the personal responsibility of health insurance. Let's \nmove forward as the Presiding Officer's State of Massachusetts has \nalready done. Some 98 percent, I understand, has health insurance \nprotection in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, thanks to the \nleadership of Governor Mitt Romney and the cooperation of both \npolitical parties. Massachusetts has shown us the way. Let's follow \nthat now. Let's not turn our back on it.\n  The last point I will make on this issue is that I keep hearing from \nthe Republican side they have a better idea. What is it? I would like \nto see the proposal from the Republican side that they would put up \nagainst the Affordable Care Act. You will never see it because they \nbasically believe: Let the market work its will. The market working its \nwill has resulted in 40 to 50 million uninsured Americans. The number \nis growing, and it should not, it will not, under the Affordable Care \nAct.\n  Mr. President, I would like to address the business pending before \nthe Senate: the Employment Non-Discrimination Act.\n  It was about 20 years ago that I first heard the name Margarethe \nCammermeyer. I had no idea who she was, but I read about her, and it \nturned out she was a remarkable woman. She started off during the \nVietnam era as a combat nurse in the Air Force. She risked her life in \nVietnam to save the lives of those who were in battle and those who \nwere injured and wounded. Then, after the war, she rose through the \nranks and became a colonel in the U.S. Air Force.\n  There came a time when she had to make a disclosure, a regular \ndisclosure, and in that disclosure she said, for the first time \npublicly, she was gay. Margarethe Cammermeyer, a colonel in the Air \nForce, conceded she was gay. As a result of that concession and \nstatement, she was discharged from the Air Force. Had she done anything \nwrong? Not a single thing. She had done everything right, including \nrisking her life as a combat nurse in the Air Force and moving up \nthrough the ranks with a stellar record. But her admission that she was \ngay in those days, 20 years ago, was grounds for her discharge from the \nU.S. Air Force.\n  I never met her, but I heard her story and thought: That is just \nplain wrong. She served our country and served it well, and to \ndischarge her from the military because of this admission is just \nunfair.\n  The first time I ever saw her was a few years ago. President Barack \nObama was signing into law the repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell. I was \nin the audience when that signing ceremony took place, and they called \nthe name: Margarethe Cammermeyer, for her to come up and lead us in the \nPledge of Allegiance. It was the first time I had ever seen her.\n  I remember that day also because there was a rabbi who gave an \ninvocation. He said in this invocation that if you look into the eyes \nof another and you do not see the face of God, at least see the face of \nanother human being. How apropos that Margarethe Cammermeyer would lead \nthe Pledge of Allegiance and the rabbi that invocation because it \nreally calls into sharp focus what is pending on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate.\n  We waste too many hours and too many days and too many weeks on \nCapitol Hill with government shutdowns, threats of defaulting on our \ndebt, but every once in a while this Senate and this Congress can rise \nto the challenge and do something of a historic nature. Yesterday was \none of those days. Yesterday, on the floor of the Senate, with 61 \nvotes, we voted to move forward on the Employment Non-Discrimination \nAct. Here is what it says: that you cannot discriminate against a \nperson because of their sexual orientation or sexual identity.\n  What I thought was unfair about Margarethe Cammermeyer--dismissing \nher not for anything she had done but for who she was--can happen now \nin more than half of the States. In more than half of the States, there \nis no protection against discrimination based on a person's sexual \norientation or sexual identity. It means that in those States, you can \nliterally be fired, denied a promotion, denied a raise, simply because \nof your sexual orientation. That is not right.\n  Hiring, promoting and retaining employees based on performance is not \nonly the right thing to do, it helps American business attract and \nretain the best and brightest employees.\n  Attracting and keeping the best and the brightest employees is \nessential to succeeding in a global economy. That is why 88 percent of \nFortune 500 companies already have policies preventing discrimination \non the basis of sexual orientation.\n  More than 100 companies have already endorsed this bill, including a \nnumber of leading companies in my home State of Illinois such as \nMotorola, GroupOn, Hyatt Hotels, BP America, Orbitz, Nielsen, Miller \nCoors, HSBC North America, and others.\n  It is time that Federal law caught up with the best practices that \nhave already been adopted by leading companies across the country.\n  Luckily, we had bipartisan support last night. Seven Republicans \njoined us in voting to move forward on this bill. I came to the floor \nyesterday to thank one of them who spoke, Senator Collins of Maine. Her \nstatement in the Congressional Record is an important one for everyone \nto read.\n  But I would like to call attention, as well, to my colleague Senator \nMark Kirk of Illinois, a Republican, who came to the floor of the U.S. \nSenate yesterday and gave his first speech on the floor in 2 years. You \nsee, my colleague suffered a stroke, and as a consequence he has gone \nthrough a lengthy rehab and hospitalization, and he has really made a \nremarkable comeback.\n  I was here on the day when he walked up the steps of the Capitol to \nthe Senate, and there were people of both political parties, Senators \ncheering him on, as they should. I have watched his progress ever \nsince, and it is remarkable. His determination to serve our State and \nNation continues.\n  Yesterday, he gave his first speech on the floor in 2 years. That \nspeech was brief, but it was important. I would like to quote from my \ncolleague's speech. This is from Senator Kirk's statement yesterday in \nthe Congressional Record:\n\n       I think it is particularly appropriate for an Illinois \n     Republican to speak on behalf of this measure--Speaking of \n     the Employment Non-Discrimination Act--in the true \n     tradition of Everett McKinley Dirksen and Abraham Lincoln, \n     men who gave us the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 13th \n     Amendment to the Constitution.\n\n  It was a brief statement but it was important. Senator Kirk joined in \na bipartisan effort to move this bill forward. I searched the \nCongressional\n\n[[Page S7806]]\n\nRecord. I searched the Congressional Record of yesterday to look for \none statement in opposition to the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. \nThere is not one. There was a specific opportunity given for anyone \nopposed to that measure to stand and speak. Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa \nsupported it. He spoke eloquently from this desk yesterday before the \nvote, and then time was allocated to those in opposition. No one stood \nto speak. But then 30 voted against it.\n  So what I would like to do is encourage my colleagues to take, in the \nspirit of Senator Kirk and Senator Collins, this opportunity for us to \ntruly do something in a bipartisan way. Let us move this Employment \nNon-Discrimination Act forward, and let us do it with dispatch. We know \nit is the right thing to do. America is not a stronger nation when \nthere is discrimination anywhere--anywhere--including the workplace, \nand this bill will end that form of discrimination.\n  There are those who say: Well, you are just wasting your time, \nSenator, because Speaker John Boehner of Ohio has already announced \nthat he not only opposes this, he will not let it see the light of day \nin the House of Representatives.\n  The Presiding Officer served there for many years; I did as well. The \nSpeaker has lots of control in the House. He can decide what is going \nto come to the floor and what will not come to the floor. Unless a \nmajority of the Members of the House overrule him with a discharge \npetition, he usually has his way. But if we can show a strong \nbipartisan vote, even beyond the vote yesterday, when seven Republicans \njoined the Democrats in trying to end this form of discrimination, then \nperhaps we can prevail on the House of Representatives to move forward \nin what Senator Harkin characterized as a historic achievement putting \nan end to discrimination.\n  There was a time in our country when it was perfectly acceptable to \nrefuse to hire or even interview someone based solely on the color of \ntheir skin, their religion or gender. It wasn't easy, but Congress \nultimately corrected this wrong by passing title VII of the Civil \nRights Act.\n  At one time, employers could fire someone solely because of their \nage. Congress recognized this was wrong and passed the Age \nDiscrimination in Employment Act to put an end to age discrimination.\n  There was also a time in our country when an employee could be passed \nover for a promotion solely because they were living with a disability, \neven if they were the most qualified person for the position. The \nAmericans with Disabilities Act put an end to this type of \ndiscrimination.\n  We now have an opportunity to outlaw one of the last vestiges of \ndiscrimination in the workplace. All Americans deserve an equal \nopportunity to succeed or fail in their jobs based solely on their \nability and performance.\n  This is our opportunity to take a historic stand against \ndiscrimination. Passing ENDA is our chance to get on the right side of \nhistory and close an embarrassing loophole in our Nation's employment \nlaws.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Employment Non-Discrimination Act \nso that all Americans have an opportunity to excel in the workplace \nbased on their job performance--not who they are or who they love.\n  We will be a better nation for it. Both political parties should \ngather together all the political strength and support they have to \nmake this a reality.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I see my colleague from Maryland is here. I promise I \nwill not take all of that time.\n  During the debate over ObamaCare back in 2009 and 2010, the President \nrepeatedly and unequivocally promised his fellow Americans that if they \nliked their current health care plan, they could keep it. By one \naccount, there were as many as 29 different times where the President \nwas captured on videotape making that same unequivocal commitment. This \nwas not an off-the-cuff remark or a casual throwaway comment, it was \nessential to the President's entire argument selling ObamaCare.\n  I heard the distinguished majority whip from Illinois talking about \nthe reasons why ObamaCare was so important, suggesting that you could \nnot cover preexisting conditions or even young adults up to the age of \n26 unless you accepted the whole package, the whole enchilada, as we \nwould say in Texas. Well, that is not true. The truth is we are \ncommitted to dealing with preexisting conditions, we are committed to \nhelping people be able to buy and afford health care coverage. What the \nPresident sold in 2009 and 2010 was basically sold under false \npretenses, as it turns out. If Americans had known that ObamaCare would \nresult in them losing their current coverage which they like, it never \nwould have become law. According to one estimate, as many as 3.5 \nmillion people will lose their current health insurance coverage.\n  I have heard the revisionist history here on the floor and elsewhere. \nThey are trying to change the commitment. Rather than: You can keep \nyour current coverage if you like it, period, which is what I know the \nPresident said at the American Medical Association and many other \ntimes, now they are trying to tweak that and say: If it is not \notherwise changed or canceled by our insurance company.\n  Well, that is not what the President said then. That is not what the \nAmerican people heard. That is not the basis upon which ObamaCare was \nsold to the American people in 2009 and 2010. When President Obama \ncampaigned for reelection in 2012, he reiterated his promise from 2009 \nand 2010, again a remarkably consistent message from the President. He \nsaid: If you liked your existing plan and you wanted to keep it, you \nhad nothing to worry about.\n  Here is the exact statement the President made on June 28, 2012, at a \nWhite House press conference. ``If you are one of the more than 250 \nmillion Americans who already have health insurance, you will keep your \nhealth insurance.'' That is a direct quote, no qualifiers, no caveats--\na simple unequivocal promise. However, way back in 2010 we now learn \nthat the Obama administration itself issued the very regulations which \nhave made, keeping this promise impossible. Indeed, the 2010 ObamaCare \nregulations acknowledged that between 40 to 67 percent of all policies \nin the individual market would lose their grandfathered status by 2014 \nand must be required to meet the costly mandates in ObamaCare. In other \nwords, at the same time the President was making the promise, his own \nadministration acknowledged that the regulations they were passing \nwould make it impossible to keep it.\n  Well, as you can imagine, people are increasingly frustrated by these \nbroken promises.\n  I recently set up a Web site in my office where my constituents can \nlet me know how their personal health care coverage has been affected \nby the implementation of ObamaCare. I hope if others who perhaps may \nhear my comments on the floor this morning have stories they would like \nfor us to be able to tell to explain how these broken promises have \nresulted in their inability to keep what they have, they will let us \nknow on our Web site. It is cornyn.senate.gov. I plan to forward these \nstories to the President.\n  One woman from Livingston, TX, over in East Texas, writes:\n\n       My health insurance is being canceled due to the Affordable \n     Care Act. My insurance company offered a plan . . . that I \n     can keep until 2014. Guess what? It's 19 percent more a month \n     than my current plan and drops coverage for laboratory and \n     imaging studies.\n\n  So not only is it more expensive, it actually reduces the coverage. \nGoing on, she said:\n\n       In December 2014, I'll have to change it again. Premiums \n     for myself and my husband at that time will increase 100 \n     percent each, which will equal just about half--50 percent--\n     of our gross monthly income. What exactly are we supposed to \n     do?\n\n  Another woman from Pampa, TX, up in the Texas Panhandle, writes that \nher monthly health insurance premiums have increased by 30 percent \nalready over last year, and now her policy is being canceled altogether \nbecause of ObamaCare, so she has to purchase a new health insurance \npolicy that will cost, in her words, ``much more'' than her existing \ncoverage.\n\n[[Page S7807]]\n\n  As her letter indicates, many of the folks losing their insurance \nwill be forced to buy a new ObamaCare-approved policy from an online \nexchange which does not even work yet. It is no wonder that a growing \nnumber of our friends across the aisle are beginning to wonder: Why did \nthe administration not extend the open enrollment period beyond March \n2014? They realize they were marching in lockstep with the President \nwhen he made these promises, and the fact that these promises are not \nbeing kept is a political liability for them. At the very least it is a \nhardship for their constituents that they would like to see rectified.\n  Why is the ObamaCare Web site malfunctioning? It is an important \nquestion. But it is again just the tip of the iceberg. Remember, \nObamaCare became the law of the land more than 3\\1/2\\ years ago. I \nthink most people are astonished to learn that. Some news reports I \nhave read said that people thought ObamaCare had already been fully \nimplemented, we have been talking about it for so long. But by design, \nit was created to be implemented over a many-year period of time. I \nthink that was a terrible mistake, because the political accountability \nthat comes with implementing a law and then having to live with the \npolitical consequences of not delivering on your promises has now been \ndelayed.\n  But 3\\1/2\\ years ago the administration should have gotten prepared \nto roll out its signature legislative achievement. According to CBS \nNews, one of President Obama's top outside health care advisors sent \nthe White House a memo back in May of 2010 warning them that ObamaCare \nwas spiraling out of control. This memo came from Harvard economist \nDavid Cutler and reads in part:\n\n       I do not believe the relevant members of the Administration \n     understand the President's vision or have the capability \n     to carry it out. . . . You need to have people who have \n     the understanding of the political process, people who \n     understand how to work within an Administration, and \n     people who understand how to start and to build a \n     business, and unfortunately, nationally they just didn't \n     get all of those people together.\n\n  Republicans have for years been warning that this government takeover \nof one-sixth of our economy, this central planning scheme, social \nengineering, if you will, would not work. At the very least, the \nFederal Government has proven itself incompetent on making something \nthis big and this complicated and this expensive work as advertised, it \nis becoming increasingly clear. We spent years warning that ObamaCare \nwould force many Americans to lose their existing coverage. We spent \nyears warning that ObamaCare would limit patient choices and reduce \nhealth options. We have spent years warning that the law itself would \nprove to be unworkable. Now it appears that many of those warnings have \ncome true. We are reiterating our call to dismantle ObamaCare and to \nreplace it with patient-centered reforms that will help bring down the \ncost, will not limit patient choices, and which will address most of \nthe biggest problems in our broken health care system.\n  There are other areas such as preexisting conditions, young adult \ncoverage, that we could readily agree on. Those are not debatable. I \nthink the fact that the distinguished majority whip has suggested you \nhave to have ObamaCare in order to get those is a gross exaggeration.\n  Remember, ObamaCare was sold as a policy that would expand health \ncare coverage without raising costs, and without disrupting anyone's \nexisting health care arrangement. It has proven to be a false promise \non both of those counts. Despite the promises made in 2009 and 2010, \npromises that were repeated on the campaign trail in 2012, it is \nbecoming increasingly evident that ObamaCare is making it harder for \nAmericans to get or to keep the insurance coverage they already have, \nand which they want.\n  By the way, ObamaCare was sold to the American people as a way to get \neverybody covered with insurance. The Congressional Budget Office has \ndocumented that as many as 30 million Americans will remain uncovered \neven after ObamaCare is fully implemented. So you have not met the goal \nof universal coverage, the CBO says.\n  We are finding that rather than your costs going down, they are going \nup; you are finding that if you like what you have, you cannot keep it. \nWell, as Republicans have said all along, there are much better ways to \nexpand health insurance coverage. I heard the majority whip this \nmorning say they would like to hear our plan. Well, either their memory \nis faulty or they just were not listening.\n  ObamaCare regulations are incompatible with the genuine marketplace \nin health care insurance. They are incompatible with cost control. I \nthink perhaps the best example I can think of is where the market \nactually works in conjunction with a government program, such as \nMedicare prescription drug coverage.\n  Remember when the Medicare prescription drug coverage plan was \nadopted, Medicare Part D, true competition in the market was created \nand vendors competed for the business of beneficiaries when it came to \nselling them their prescription drug plan. Lo and behold, due to the \ndiscipline and the competition, not only did quality of service go up \nand cost go down, we have seen that actually there is a 40-percent \nreduction, or I should say the cost of the plan is 40 percent under \nwhat was originally projected. That is something we could use with \nObamaCare, which has been completely rejected. But that is why we \nbelieve we can replace ObamaCare with reforms that will make it easier \nfor people to acquire or keep a health insurance plan that meets their \nactual individual needs.\n  My friends across the aisle continue to say we have not offered a \npractical alternative, but that is not true. Just to remind them, some \nof the alternatives we offered include equalizing the tax treatment of \nhealth care so individuals purchasing insurance on their own are on the \nsame level playing field as those who have employer-provided coverage. \nWe would let Americans buy their health insurance coverage across State \nlines, something that is now not currently permitted, which would \nincrease competition and increase consumer choice. So if I found a \npolicy I needed from Maryland or Massachusetts or anywhere else around \nthe country, I could buy it. So could my 26 million constituents. We \nwould let individuals in small businesses form risk pools in the \nindividual market, which is the most expensive part of the insurance \nmarket, helping to bring costs down. We would make price and quality \ninformation more transparent, again to increase that discipline known \nas market forces, which would help improve consumer choice and, in the \nprocess, bring down cost, while improving quality of service.\n  We would also expand the power of individuals to control their own \nhealth care spending through tax-free health savings accounts, which \nalso have the additional benefit of providing skin in the game for \nconsumers. One of the reasons why our health care spending is so high \nand so worrisome is that for too long our health care coverage was like \na credit card that each of us, or many of us--not all of us--85 percent \nof us had in our pocket, where we could continue to charge and charge, \nbut we would never see the bill. Well, that is a recipe for a runaway \nsystem, which is the reason we do need true health insurance reform.\n  Part of that reform would be to control frivolous malpractice \nlawsuits that help drive up costs by increasing the incentives for \ndefensive medicine, doctors treating patients not because they think it \nis called for based on clinical guidelines but, rather in their effort \nto say: I have conducted every test, I have done everything possible so \nI cannot get sued successfully. We would use high-risk pools to ensure \nthat people with preexisting conditions could get coverage. We would \ngive the States a lot more flexibility in how to manage Medicaid.\n  I read with interest that a lot of the increased coverage since \nObamaCare passed is not in the exchanges but it is Medicaid, the \nMedicaid expansion. Well, in my State, Medicaid pays a doctor about 50 \ncents on the dollar for what private insurance pays that doctor. So \nonly about one-third of doctors will actually see a new Medicaid \npatient, because the cost of doing so eats into their profit, and, \nindeed, may make their doing so completely unprofitable and nonviable. \nBut we could improve Medicaid by creating more flexibility in the \nStates to manage that beneficiary population and to expand coverage.\n\n[[Page S7808]]\n\n  Then we would expand provider competition and patient choice and \nMedicare.\n  Those are nine different reform proposals we have been making since \n2009 when ObamaCare was first being debated, but it is clear our \ncolleagues across the aisle were so concentrated on this huge takeover \nof our health care system--one-sixth of our economy, in a way that we \nnow know is not going to work--that they weren't even listening. I hope \nthey will now.\n  While the reforms I have described enjoy broad support among \nRepublicans on Capitol Hill, my hope is whether you were a critic of \nObamaCare, as I was, or you were a skeptic and thought, well, maybe it \nwill work but I am not sure it will, or whether you were one of its \nbiggest cheerleaders--now that we are seeing these promises that were \nmade by the President and others in order to sell this to the American \npeople are not true, I am hopeful Democrats and Republicans can come \ntogether to try to fix our broken health care system. After witnessing \nObamaCare's disastrous rollout and its long trail of broken promises, I \nthink most Americans would agree it is time for something different.\n  I have read that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing \nover and over and expecting different results. ObamaCare is not going \nto get any better by continuing to do the same thing over and over. I \nhope we will learn from our mistakes, and we will work together to \nimprove access and the price of health care to the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, the legislation that is currently pending \nbefore this body, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, S. 815, \nprovides a historic opportunity for us to advance civil rights in this \ncountry and end employment discrimination against lesbians, gays, \nbisexuals, and transgenders, the LGBT community.\n  The United States has shown international leadership against \ndiscrimination, promoting better understanding and tolerance around the \nglobe. That has made the security of countries better. It has provided \nopportunities for minority communities. The United States has been in \nthe forefront of those efforts. We have shown leadership \ninternationally and we have done that because we have taken action in \nour own country to protect against discrimination. Action at home helps \nus provide that credibility for our international leadership. Passage \nof S. 815, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, would demonstrate \nthat action, that we have taken the right action at home and, \ntherefore, we have the standing to promote better understanding \nglobally.\n  The U.S. leadership has been shown in many different ways. I am very \nproud that one of the primary organizations the United States has \nparticipated in that has advanced human rights is the Organization for \nSecurity and Co-operation in Europe. Our local arm in participating is \nthe Helsinki Commission. I have the honor of chairing the Helsinki \nCommission, which includes Members of both the House and the Senate, \nalong with members of the administration. We have used that role in the \nHelsinki Commission to promote an international agenda to deal with \nbest practices to end discrimination on ethnic communities, religious \ncommunities, and racial discrimination. As a result of U.S. leadership, \nwe have made a difference. We made a difference in Europe, we made a \ndifference in North America, and we made a difference around the world.\n  Today there are special representatives under the OSCE to promote \ntolerance in regard to minority communities on race, the Muslim \ncommunity, and Jewish communities. We have made a difference in the \nRoma population in Europe, which has been badly discriminated against. \nWe have had conferences to deal with anti-Semitism to help the Jewish \ncommunities of Europe, and we have helped religious minorities around \nthe region.\n  U.S. leadership is needed to help the LGBT community. We have seen \ncountries in Europe take discriminatory actions to marginalize \nlesbians, gays, and those who, because of their sexual orientation or \ngender identity, have been discriminated against. In order to do that, \nwe need to pass the legislation before us to give us the moral ground \nand to promote the core values of our country. America's core values \nare based upon equal rights for all citizens, and that is what we need \nto promote by the passage of this legislation.\n  I must tell you it also is important for economic advancements. If we \nare going to be able to adequately compete globally, we need to empower \nall of the people of this country. We can't leave anyone behind.\n  I am proud of what has happened in my own State of Maryland. Maryland \nhas had a proud history of advancing civil rights for all of its \ncitizens. Two weekends ago I had the opportunity to join in the 25th \nanniversary of Equality Maryland. In 25 years, they have changed the \nlandscape in regard to the LGBT community in my State of Maryland. We \npassed many laws that have advanced protection for all of our citizens \nin our State.\n  The State of Maryland has passed laws. We have had local governments \npass law. Baltimore City has passed a law, Baltimore County, Montgomery \nCounty, Howard County, and the list goes on. In Maryland, not only did \nour legislature pass marriage equality, it was a petition to referendum \nand the voters of Maryland approved marriage equality. We have taken \nsteps in our State to advance the rights of all of our citizens, \nincluding the LGBT community.\n  It has been nearly half a century since we passed the Civil Rights \nAct of 1964. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prevents discrimination in \nemployment based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. \nThat has been our law for almost half a century. ENDA, the legislation \nbefore us, would expand that to sexual orientation and gender identity.\n  The Civil Rights Act of 1964 has worked. It has worked. It has \nprovided enforcement mechanisms for those who have been discriminated \nagainst in their employment because of their race or because of their \nreligion or because of their national origin or because of their sex. \nIt has worked. ENDA would expand that protection for sexual orientation \nand gender identity. It is time we do this. Twenty-one States have \nalready acted, including my State of Maryland. We have passed laws. \nSeventeen States include gender identity. Federalism has worked.\n  What do I mean by that? We have seen that there is a national law. \nThe law is the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It set up the framework so \nthat everyone understands we won't tolerate discrimination in the \nworkplace. It has had a workable way where those who are victimized can \nget remedy, but the real remedy we want is equal employment opportunity \nfor all the citizens of this country. It has worked.\n  Our States have said we can go farther, we can protect the LGBT \ncommunity. They have and it has worked. Those who have said: Look, we \nare going to have problems because of religious organizations or we are \ngoing to have problems because of this group--that has not been the \ncase.\n  Federalism has demonstrated it is now time to pass a national law to \nprotect against those who discriminate in employment on a person's \nsexual orientation or gender identity. We need a national law.\n  I can give you many specific examples that have been shared with us. \nWe could talk the numbers. We know the numbers. I want to speak about \nspecific cases and to mention two people.\n  Kimya has a master's degree in social work and nearly two decades of \nexperience in the field. She was the manager of a unit of a long-term \ncare facility for those suffering from Alzheimer's and dementia. She \nenjoyed her job and was good at it but suffered through nearly a year \nof threatening messages, vandalism to her car, and slurs uttered in the \nhalls. In 2003, she was fired, her supervisors telling her: ``This \nwould not be happening if you were not a lesbian.''\n  Next is the case of Linda. Linda is an attorney who relocated to this \nregion when her partner accepted a faculty position with a local \nuniversity. Linda was invited for a second interview with a local law \nfirm. During the interview, Linda was asked why she was moving to this \nregion, and she replied that her spouse had taken a position at a local \nuniversity. The law firm asked Linda\n\n[[Page S7809]]\n\nto come back for a final interview, which would include a dinner with \nall the partners and their spouses ``to make sure we all got along.'' \nAt that point, Linda told one of the partners at the law firm that her \nspouse was a woman. Soon after, Linda was told that the firm would not \nhire a lesbian and she should not bother coming in for the third \ninterview.\n  In Kimya's and Linda's cases, they live in States that do not have \nprotection for the LGBT community, and therefore there was no way to \naddress this wrong.\n  The legislation before us has been endorsed by the Leadership \nConference on Civil and Human Rights that represents over 200 civil \nrights, religious, labor, and women's rights organizations. It has \nbroad support. It is supported by the American people. It is the right \nthing to do. It represents our core values.\n  Our former colleague Senator Ted Kennedy said civil rights was the \ngreat unfinished business of America. We are on that path. The passage \nof the Employment Non-Discrimination Act would be a major step forward \nto making us a more perfect union.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schatz). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I appreciate the comments of my colleague from Maryland, \nwho has argued so well that the time has come to take a bold step in \nfavor of equality, in favor of fairness in passing employment \nnondiscrimination. I too rise to speak to the importance of this \naction.\n  The Declaration of Independence in its second paragraph says, in \nwords that are famous and well-known to all Americans:\n\n       We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are \n     created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with \n     certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, \n     Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.\n\n  Certainly that vision of life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness is \ninfused into everything we pursue in this Nation in the success of \nindividuals, the success of our families, the success of our \ncommunities, and the success of our Nation. The debate on which we are \nabout to embark is deeply connected to this issue because certainly the \nability to be free from discrimination in the pursuit of a job and to \nbe free from discrimination in the course of employment is central to \nthat pursuit of happiness. It is central to the issue of liberty.\n  I rise today to say how important and vital this is to millions of \nAmericans for whom discrimination has blocked and compromised the \nvision laid out in the Declaration of Independence. This bill, this \nframework for ending discrimination in employment, S. 815, is born with \na lot of bipartisan partners whom I wish to thank at this moment.\n  It was back in 2009, my first year in the Senate, that Senator \nKennedy and his team asked me to take the leadership of this bill that \nhe had held near and dear to his heart and to carry the torch forward \nin fighting for fairness in employment, fighting for an end to \ndiscrimination. Since that time, many have stepped forward to be \npartners in this journey.\n  Senator Collins was the first chief cosponsor on the Republican side, \nstepping forward and taking her voice, her energy, her experience, and \nher insight in bringing that to bear. After 2 years, she passed the \nbaton to Senator Mark Kirk, who had been a long-time champion of the \nvision of fairness and equality for all Americans. Both of them have \ndone an outstanding and extraordinary job in forwarding this dialogue.\n  On the Democratic side we have, first and foremost Senator Kennedy, \nwho carried the leadership for many years, including back in 1996 when \nwe had this on the floor of the Senate--and I will return to that in \ndue course. He was a champion for civil rights in many different parts \nof our world, including race discrimination, gender discrimination, and \ndiscrimination against the LGBT community.\n  Senator Harkin, who chairs the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee, carried this bill forward through two hearings in 2009 and \n2012, and then brought it to markup this past year and is prepared to \nsend it to the floor. So I thank Senator Harkin for his leadership.\n  Senator Tammy Baldwin, who came to us with her own personal story and \nher experience with leadership in the House, has extended the \nconversation here in the Senate and has carried on so many individual \nmeetings to speak to these core issues of equality, fairness, and \nopportunity.\n  So I thank all the bipartisan sponsors, and I thank all of those who \nlast night said, yes, we should debate this issue. We should debate \nthis issue of discrimination and blocking full opportunity for millions \nof Americans. So shortly we will be engaged in that debate.\n  After the Declaration of Independence, we had the preamble to the \nConstitution. This also is well known to Americans across our land.\n\n       We, the people of the United States, in order to form a \n     more perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic \n     tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the \n     general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to \n     ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish the \n     Constitution of the United States of America.\n\n  So here we have this core concept of justice and the blessings of \nliberty for that generation and the generations that would follow. But \nwhat exactly is liberty? What is freedom?\n  President Johnson, in 1965, at a commencement address at Howard \nUniversity, said:\n\n       Freedom is the right to share, share fully and equally, in \n     American society--to vote, to hold a job, to enter a public \n     place, to go to a school. It is the right to be treated in \n     every part of our national life as a person equal in dignity \n     and promise to all others.\n\n  I think that is a pretty good description of what liberty and freedom \nmean--a right to participate fully in American society in every \nrespect: at the voting booth, in the job place, and in the public \nsquare, as you would choose to participate.\n  So the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which ends discrimination \nagainst our LGBT community, is rooted in the best of American values. \nIt is rooted in the concepts of liberty and freedom in our founding \ndocuments and in our founding vision. It is rooted in the concept of \nfundamental fairness.\n  How unfair is it if an individual who is seeking to apply for a job \ncannot have the full opportunity for that job, the full opportunity to \nthrive because of discrimination? How fair is it that because of who \nyou are outside of the workplace you are fired from the workplace?\n  Let us think of the Golden Rule. We all learned this early in life--\nthat we should treat others according to how we would want to be \ntreated. And we all want to be treated with the respect and dignity \nPresident Johnson referred to.\n  It is the vision of equality that was in the Declaration of \nIndependence, and it is the vision of opportunity that is rooted so \ndeeply in the American Dream--the idea that in America, if you work and \nstudy hard, you can do just about anything. That is the vision my \nfather gave me when he took me to the schoolhouse doors when I was \nsmall and said: If you go through those doors and you study hard, here \nin America you can do just about anything.\n  But discrimination takes away from that vision of opportunity. It \nsays: If you study hard, here in America you can do just about \nanything, unless you have a certain color of skin, unless you are a \ncertain gender, unless you have a certain gender identity or sexual \norientation.\n  We have struck down many of those barriers. We have advanced on this \nvision of equality, but we have further to go. That is what this debate \nis about. In 29 States, an individual can still be fired from their \njob, they can still be told not to apply in the first place because of \ntheir sexual orientation or their gender identity--in 29 States. It \nshould not be the case that the vision of equality and fairness and \nopportunity happens to occur on one side of a State line but it is \ndestroyed if you cross that State line. This vision of opportunity and \nfairness and equality in the Constitution and in the Declaration of \nIndependence didn't say the vision is only if you live in particular \nStates, only if you live in the 21 States that have protections for our \nlesbian, gay, and bisexual community; only if you live in the 17 States \nthat have employment protection for our transgender community.\n\n[[Page S7810]]\n\n  The journey of this legislation began in 1974. It was a year after \nStonewall. It was 39 years ago that Bella Abzug and Ed Koch introduced \nin the House of Representatives legislation that would ban job \ndiscrimination. It took another 19 years before such legislation was \nintroduced here in the Senate and where hearings were held in the Labor \nand Human Resources Committee in 1994. It was 2 years later the bill \nwas debated here in this Chamber--right here in this very room. The \noutcome was 49 for and 50 against, with Vice President Gore sitting in \nthe presiding chair where the Senator from Hawaii now sits.\n\n  Vice President Gore had already clarified where he stood, so we were \nmissing one Senator and one vote, and the result was that it took 17 \nyears to again hold this conversation in this Chamber--17 years of \ndiscrimination in so many States across America. It is time to end that \ndiscrimination and enhance the vision of equality and fairness.\n  Today, we have a bill before us with 55 cosponsors. When we think \nabout that 49-50 vote 17 years ago, we might think: Well, isn't this a \ndone deal? There are 55 cosponsors and you only need 51 or 50 plus the \nVice President to pass a bill in the Senate. But it is not a done deal. \nBecause in the last decade and a half, the Senate has gone from being a \nsimple majority Chamber, as envisioned in the Constitution, to being a \nChamber where every action takes a supermajority vote.\n  We needed a supermajority of 60 to get on to the bill last night, and \neveryone anticipates we will need 60 votes to get off the bill; that \nis, to close debate and have a final vote. That is not the Senate of \nthe past 200 years, but it is the Senate of the last 10 years, where \nthe courtesy of extended debate has been turned into the veto of a \nsupermajority. That is where we stand right now. Therefore, we need 60 \nvotes.\n  We had 61 votes last night to get onto this debate, and I thank every \none of those 61 Senators who stood up and said: Yes, after 17 years it \nis time to debate this issue; yes, it is right to consider the core \nissue of fairness to millions of Americans; yes, it is right to \nrecognize that we should have a debate about the impact of \ndiscrimination on the ability of the individual to have full \nopportunity in our Nation.\n  Have no doubt. Discrimination is alive and well. I will share with \nyou the story of Laura from Portland, OR, before Oregon had \nnondiscrimination clauses, which we adopted in 2007. Laura wrote that \nfrom 1980 to 1996 she worked for the Josephine County Sheriff's Office \nin Grants Pass, OR. She had the rank of sergeant. She was promoted \noften. She worked in a variety of capacities, including as a SWAT team \ncommander, as a detective of the major crimes unit, and in the \nnarcotics task force. During her 16 years, she says: I received \nnumerous commendations, including commendations for removing an \nautomobile accident victim from a burning vehicle, delivering a baby \nalongside a roadside, and disarming an armed man intent on harming \nhimself. She was awarded for her expertise and diligence shown in a \nnumber of complicated criminal cases. She was named Deputy of the Year \nin 1994. She taught law enforcement classes at Rogue Community College \nand at the Oregon Police Academy. She had a distinguished employment \nrecord.\n  On Labor Day 1995, Laura was in a remote area when a police dog \nattacked her and did some damage to her leg and she was put on \nadministrative leave. During the month that followed, her storage unit \nwas broken into. Out of that break-in of her storage unit came \ninformation she was a transgender individual, and because of that she \nwas fired. She had a stellar career in every aspect, but a break-in \ninto her storage unit, plus discrimination, ended that career.\n  She ends her commentary by saying: Had employment nondiscrimination \nlaws been in effect, I likely would have continued serving the citizens \nof Josephine County to this day.\n  We know from her employment record she would have served well. But \nthat was before Oregon adopted antidiscrimination legislation.\n  Many people have written to share their stories. Terri from Aloha \nwrote:\n\n       Thank you for continuing the fight against discrimination. \n     I am retired now, but I did lose a job when I was young, for \n     being a lesbian. Until later in life, I stayed deep in the \n     closet after that to keep from losing another job. All of the \n     non-discrimination bills help us define who we are as a \n     people and underscores our belief in life, liberty, and the \n     pursuit of happiness for every American.\n\n  By one survey, far more than a third of LGBT individuals have \nexperienced some form of harassment or discrimination in the workplace. \nThat has a tremendous impact on the pursuit of happiness. That is a \ntremendous shrinking of freedom and liberty as envisioned in our \nfounding documents, our vision for this Nation.\n  There are a number of issues which have been raised as colleagues \nhave talked about this bill before it comes to the floor, and I wish to \naddress some of them.\n  First, this bill is fully inclusive. It includes the lesbian, gay, \nbisexual, and transgender community. It should be fully inclusive \nbecause discrimination is wrong. Discrimination shrinks opportunity. \nDiscrimination is an offense against liberty and freedom in our Nation \nand full participation in society. So of course this bill should be \nfully inclusive, as it is in 17 of the 21 States that have laws on \ntheir books right now.\n  A second issue has been concern about lawsuits. We heard this \nyesterday from the Speaker of the House. But we have all of these \npilots, if you will, with 21 States with measures on the books with all \nkinds of experience. So I asked the General Accounting Office to do an \nupdated study on the issue of lawsuits, and what did we find? There has \nbeen no abuse. There has been no extraordinary stream of unfounded \nlawsuits against businesses, no damage to business, none at all.\n  In Oregon, LGBT discrimination claims are less than 2 percent of the \ntotal number of employment discrimination claims. That is less than 1 \nout of 50. In other States it has ranged from 2 to 6 percent. That is a \nsmall number, and that is why the business community has remained so \nsupportive. In fact, close to 90 percent of the Fortune 500 companies \nhave nondiscrimination practices they have adopted on their own. They \nhave adopted them because it is good business.\n  Nike, in my home State of Oregon, says that ``ENDA is good for \nbusiness, for our employees, and for our communities.''\n  The Nike statement continues: Inclusive, nondiscrimination policies \n``enable us to attract and retain the best and brightest people around \nthe world.''\n  That is why Fortune 500 companies have lined up to adopt \nnondiscrimination provisions--because what is good for liberty and what \nis good for opportunity is good for business. And the GAO study shows \nthat any claim that there has been a problem with excessive lawsuits is \nsimply false.\n  A third concern is about the religious exemption. The religious \nexemption in this bill is deeply founded on title VII of the Civil \nRights Act, so there is a whole history of interpretation and \nunderstanding exactly where the boundaries are. This is the same \nreligious exemption that was voted in favor of in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives by a measure of 420 to 25. Mr. President, 420 to 25 \nsaid this is the right foundation to make sure we create the balance \nfor religious organizations.\n  There are others who are concerned that, simply, the American people \nare not ready for this discussion--despite the fact that it has been \nadopted in 21 States, despite the fact that we have had many related \nissues before the American public up for discussion, including hate \ncrimes. We have the Matthew Shepard hate crimes act; we had don't ask, \ndon't tell; we had a Supreme Court discussion about marriage equality. \nCertainly Americans are well familiar with this. In fact, 80 percent of \nAmericans think we have already done this.\n  I was explaining to my daughter Brynne about this bill, this fight \nagainst discrimination and its terrible impacts on liberty, freedom, \nand opportunity.\n  She said: But, Dad, people can't fire others because they are lesbian \nor gay, right? That is not possible.\n  I said: Sweetie, it was possible right here in Oregon until a couple \nyears ago when in 2007 we adopted nondiscrimination policies and \nnondiscrimination statutes for our State.\n  She just shook her head.\n  It took me back to when I was in high school and I was hearing about\n\n[[Page S7811]]\n\nJim Crow and discrimination against those with dark skin instead of \nlighter skin, and I thought that is not possible, not under our vision \nof opportunity and equality in our Constitution and our pursuit of \nhappiness. It is not possible.\n  But it was possible, and it was very real well after I was born. But \nwe ended that discrimination, and it is time to end this \ndiscrimination.\n  This is about the individual, but it is about our Nation as well. It \nis certainly about the vision of the Declaration of Independence, which \nhas the promise of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness as the \nfounding motivation. It certainly is about our Constitution, which says \nthat the core purpose is to secure the blessings of liberty because \ncertainly you do not have liberty if you do not have the full \nopportunity to participate in the workplace across America.\n  Senator Ted Kennedy carried this battle until days before his death. \nThe quote I am about to share is from August 5, 2009. He died just 20 \ndays later. This may well have been one of his last public comments and \nintroducing the 2009 bill may well have been one of his last \nlegislative acts. He said:\n\n       The promise of America will never be fulfilled as long as \n     justice is denied to even one among us.\n\n  I urge my colleagues, take a stand for equality. Take a stand for \nfundamental fairness. Take a stand for the vision of the pursuit of \nhappiness embedded in our Constitution. Take a stand for justice for \nall. Support this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. the Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               ObamaCare\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, among the many promises the President made \nwhen he and congressional Democrats enacted their unpopular health care \nlaw nearly 4 years ago--which, by the way, was enacted without any \nbipartisan input or support--there is one thing in particular Americans \ndefinitely have not forgotten. It was the promise President Obama \nrepeated over and over again to the American people at rally after \nrally. You can't turn on the TV or radio or pick up a newspaper these \ndays without this promise the President made so definitively being \nplayed over and over again because it was so ingrained in the thoughts \nof the American people:\n\n       If you like your health care plan, you'll be able to keep \n     your health care plan, period.\n\n  By saying ``period'' behind it, it is like he puts a stamp on it: \nThat is it. No disagreement.\n\n       If you like your health care plan, you'll be able to keep \n     it. Period.\n\n  Well, here are the facts. The ObamaCare online marketplace has been \nin place for 1 month and a couple of days. Already, at least 3.5 \nmillion Americans have received cancellation notices from their \ninsurance companies. Lord knows how many more letters are in the mail \nor will be in the mail, arriving in Americans' mailboxes in the coming \nweeks and months ahead. So when the President says: If you like your \nhealth care plan, you can keep it--already 3.5 million Americans have \nbeen told: No, actually you can't keep your health care plan.\n  Thousands of Hoosiers are receiving those letters, and many more will \nreceive them as well.\n  Rebecca from Muncie received a letter saying that her individual \nhealth care plan will be canceled. She also learned that the premiums \nin the government-approved plans are double and triple what she is \npaying now. Do you remember when the administration said ``This won't \ncost one penny more''?\n  Dwight from Indianapolis wrote to me and shared a similar story. \nDwight also received notice in the mail that his health care plan is \nbeing terminated. When he started looking for an alternative \ngovernment-approved plan he experienced sticker shock: dramatic \nincreases in the premiums he would have to pay for having to buy an \nObamaCare plan now that his plan has been terminated.\n  That sticker shock was felt by Garth in Marion, IN, as well. Garth \ntold me his family's health insurance costs will be more than three \ntimes as much under ObamaCare as they are paying now.\n  Rebecca, Dwight, Garth, and tens of thousands of other Hoosiers now \nhave found out that the promise the President made is a broken promise.\n  But despite the repeated promise by the President for several years \nto the American people--that you can keep your health care plan if you \nlike it, period--we have now learned the administration knew all along \nthis wasn't true. For at least the past 3 years the administration has \nknown that millions of Americans would receive cancellation notices and \nlose their current health care coverage. Yet the President has \ncontinued to package this flawed product with false advertising and \napparently deliberate dishonesty to sell it to the American people. We \nwonder why Americans are losing confidence in their government? We \nwonder why there is such an alarming trust deficit in the country \ntoday?\n  As Washington Post writer Chris Cillizza wrote recently, ``When \nyou're the President, words matter.''\n  Mr. President, words matter. Your words were: If you like your health \ncare plan, you can keep it, period. Mr. President, that was a false \npromise, and it has undermined the confidence and trust of the American \npeople in this President and in this government.\n  The fact is that you can only keep your health care plan if the Obama \nadministration likes that plan, and apparently there are millions of \nplans already that they don't like. The ones they do like are their own \ncreation, with multiple doubles and triples of premium costs.\n  In 2009 the President also said:\n\n       We will keep this promise: If you like your doctor, you'll \n     be able to keep your doctor, period.\n\n  The President keeps enunciating his promises with a period. That \nmeans that is it, final, nothing else to say about it. The fact is that \nunder ObamaCare many individuals are not going to have access to the \ndoctors they have trusted for years. If the White House had been honest \nwith Americans, would the administration have promised people could \nkeep doctors they like?\n  Many individuals and families are seeing higher premiums, higher \ncopays, and higher deductibles under ObamaCare. If the White House had \nbeen honest with Americans, would it have told the public the health \ncare law would save families up to $2,500? We haven't seen any of those \nstories yet.\n  What is the President's response to all of this and to the millions \nof Americans who have had their insurance coverage canceled? He says: \nJust shop around.\n  Well, first of all, maybe the President has forgotten that Americans \ncan't even shop around because his Web site doesn't work. Maybe the \nPresident hasn't tried shopping around himself because he and his \npolitical appointees are not required to join ObamaCare. That is right. \nEverybody else is forced into ObamaCare but not the President nor his \nappointees and his team. They think it is good enough for the American \npeople, but they are not going to be forced to join it as the rest of \nus are--including Members of Congress. Congress and the administration \nshould be forced to join ObamaCare because if we are going to impose \nthis on the American people, it needs to be imposed on us so that we \nfeel the pain just as they are feeling the pain. But the President? He \nexempted himself. The President's appointees? Exempted. What kind of \nleadership is that?\n  Individuals and families who have been able to shop around are \nfinding that many of the Obama-approved health care policies are going \nto cost them more money, not less. Middle-class families are getting \nhit with massive premium increases and outrageous deductibles. \nRemember, the point of health care reform was to lower the cost of \nhealth care and increase access, but we are seeing just the opposite of \nwhat the President promised. I think it is now clear that if the White \nHouse had been honest with the American people, this law would never \nhave been passed in the first place.\n  It was Abraham Lincoln who said:\n\n       If you once forfeit the confidence of your fellow citizens, \n     you can never regain their respect and esteem. It is true \n     that you may fool all of the people some of the time; you can \n     even fool some of the people all of the\n\n[[Page S7812]]\n\n     time; but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time.\n\n  Unfortunately, today many Americans believe they have been fooled by \na series of promises by this administration and its supporters that \nwere simply not true. Given the many problems and broken promises with \nObamaCare, given the law's negative impact on American families, the \nsensible course of action at this time is to take a time-out from \nimplementation of this law. Recent polling shows that nearly three in \nfour American voters now support delaying ObamaCare's individual \nmandate. In September I introduced a bill to delay that mandate for 1 \nyear. The House has already passed similar legislation offered by my \nIndiana colleague, Todd Young, to delay both the employer--and the \nindividual--mandate. By the way, 22 House Democrats supported it.\n  The first step we should take today is to pass this legislation to \ndelay the ObamaCare mandates and put people over politics. There is a \nlot of work ahead to deliver real health care reform. We need to bring \ndown the cost of health care, not raise it. We need to put patients in \ncontrol of their health care decisions, not Washington bureaucrats. We \nneed to increase competition, reform medical malpractice, allow people \nto buy insurance across State lines, create risk pools, and a number of \nother initiatives that have been put forward that would make it an \naffordable health care reform and not the unaffordable, overpromised \nand under-delivered health care plan that the American people got from \nthis administration.\n  Delaying the individual mandate will give the American people an \nopportunity to voice their displeasure over this false information by \nthe President and the chance to start over with a real, honest approach \nto health care reform. It is time to start now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask consent to speak for up to 15 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, recently, President Obama made the comment \nthat ObamaCare is not just a web site, it is much more. I could not \nagree more with that statement. His health care law is also a list of \nbroken promises that harm middle-class Americans. While he was trying \nto sell ObamaCare to the American people, President Obama repeatedly \nstated that ``if you like your health care plan, you'll be able to keep \nyour health care plan, period.''\n  He did not say that if you like your health care plan, you can keep \nyour health care plan unless your health care plan changes or if you \nlike your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan unless \nyour health care plan gets canceled. He didn't say that you can only \nkeep your health care plan if the White House likes your health care \nplan. He said, ``If you like your health care plan, you'll be able to \nkeep your health care plan, period.''\n  It is pretty emphatic, I would argue, when the President of the \nUnited States says something such as that. Yet just 1 month after the \nObamaCare exchange rollout, at least 3.5 million Americans have \nreceived insurance cancellation notices, according to the Associated \nPress. That number just reflects the number of dropped plans in about \n25 States. There are about 25 other States that have not reported their \nnumbers yet.\n  A report by the American Action Forum cites that this number is \nexpected to dramatically increase in the coming months. On Sunday, \nformer White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs conceded that it was \ncertainly wrong for the President to claim that ``if you like your \nplan, you can keep it.''\n  The Washington Post fact checker even gave the President four \nPinocchios for his oft-repeated pledge that no one will ever take away \nyour health care plan. We are now learning it is actually only if the \nWhite House likes your plan that you are going to be able to keep your \nplan.\n  We are also learning the White House knew people would be losing \ntheir coverage. After ObamaCare was signed into law, the President's \nadministration released regulations that would invalidate grandfathered \nhealth care plans if they made routine changes. This information was \nburied in 2010 regulation and, despite the fact that the administration \nhad posted this regulation, the President continued to state, ``If you \nlike your health care plan, you'll be able to keep your health care \nplan.''\n  At the time this regulation was released, the administration issued \nestimates stating that 40 to 67 percent of Americans who purchased \ninsurance in the individual market would lose their coverage. The \nadministration also stated in that regulation that by the year 2013, 39 \nto 69 percent of businesses, large and small, would lose their \ngrandfathered plans.\n  What the President blatantly left out of his promise was the caveat \nthat if the Federal Government approves of your health care plan, then \nyou can keep it--not if you like it you can keep it, but if the Federal \nGovernment likes it, then you can keep it. But what we are finding is \nthe opposite is true. It is a completely broken promise--completely. \nWhat makes this issue even more startling is that in 2010 Senate \nDemocrats voted along party lines to reaffirm that those Americans who \nlike their plan can only keep it if it receives a government seal of \napproval.\n  In September of 2010, Senator Mike Enzi from Wyoming proposed a \nresolution to block the way the administration was planning to handle \nplan cancellations. On a party-line vote, Democrats killed the \nresolution, effectively endorsing the administration's proposal to \ncancel plans individuals have and like. After breaking his oft-repeated \npromise, the President is now telling millions of Americans who had \ntheir insurance canceled that they should just shop around for policies \nthat can be more costly on a Web site that does not function.\n  It is clear the administration has mislead Americans with their \npromises. Jerry Buckley of Marion, AR, says he did not pay attention to \nany of that because the President kept telling you this will not affect \nyou if you like what you have. Despite being assured he could keep his \nplan, Mr. Buckley received a letter from Arkansas Blue Cross Blue \nShield saying his policy did not comply with the new regulations under \nObamaCare. A comparable plan has a higher premium, higher out-of-pocket \ncosts, and less coverage.\n  As the leader of our country, the President's words matter. He needs \nto be held accountable for these millions of insurance plans he \npromised the American people they could keep. Simply having \nadministration officials apologize for a broken Web site is not a \nsolution. The issues run much deeper than anything any IT expert can \nfix. This is fundamentally about the flaws in this law. That is why the \ncancellation notices continue to go out despite the President's \nassertions and promises that if you like your plan, you can keep it.\n  In addition to the cancellation notices, consumers are experiencing \nsticker shock when they see what plans are available to them this next \nyear. Forbes reports that premiums in 41 States are going to increase \nunder ObamaCare. My home State of South Dakota ranks seventh on that \nlist, with premiums rising 77 percent, on average. In four States, \ninsurance premiums are expected to rise over 100 percent. A Washington \nPost headline from the weekend reads:\n\n       For consumers whose health premiums will go up under the \n     new law, sticker shock leads to anger.\n\n  The article cites an anecdote by an area lawyer, Deborah Persico. Ms. \nPersico recently found out her insurance is being canceled due to \nObamaCare. Under a comparable plan with the new law, her premium is \ngoing to increase by 55 percent and her deductible will double. She \nexpects this new plan will cost her at least $5,000 a year more than \nshe pays under her current plan.\n  There are millions of middle-class Americans just like Deborah whose \nhealth care costs are skyrocketing under ObamaCare. The rising premiums \nare affecting both Americans\n\n[[Page S7813]]\n\nwho buy their insurance in the individual market and those who have \nemployer-provided health care as well. In an effort to avoid these \nhigher costs, small businesses are renewing their plans early to avoid \nrequirements imposed by ObamaCare. Insurance brokers told USA Today \nthat 60 to 80 percent of small businesses with less than 50 employees \nare scrambling to renew their policies before the year's end to avoid \npaying the ObamaCare prices for 1 more year.\n  With our still sluggish economy and unacceptably high unemployment \nrate, Americans cannot afford ObamaCare. This catastrophic law is \nleading to canceled policies, higher costs, and less coverage.\n  Senate Republicans want to hear your stories. If you had a plan of \nyour choice canceled, visit Republicans\n.senate.gov/yourstory.\n  It is now evident that after supporting the rule that led to \ninsurance cancellations, nervous Democrats are beginning to recommend a \ndelay in the individual mandate. It is clear that even those who \nsupported this law in 2009 and 2010 are having second thoughts, but \nsecond thoughts are not enough. We need to work together to repeal this \nlaw and replace it with policies that actually lower the cost of care \nand allow individuals to keep the plans and the doctors they like.\n  Republicans will continue to fight to protect as many Americans as \npossible from this train wreck, and we hope the Democrats in the Senate \nwill work with us.\n  Over the weekend we saw more examples, including a story in the Wall \nStreet Journal from yesterday, about a lady who lost her coverage and \ncan't use her doctors. She is a stage 4 cancer survivor, and she has \nused health care facilities in her own State of California that have \ndone wonderful things for her in treating her illness. Yet under the \nObamaCare policies that are currently in place, she is losing that \ncoverage and losing access to her doctor.\n  The promise that ``you can keep your plan if you like it'' and the \npromise that ``you can keep your doctor if you like your doctor'' are \nbroken promises that cannot be fulfilled. The President of the United \nStates, over and over, said, ``If you like your health care plan, you \ncan keep it.'' We know that is not true, and we know it is never going \nto be true. We know now, going back to 2010, they knew it wasn't going \nto be true. They were predicting that there were going to be \ncancellations and sticker shock. Yet never once did the President \nmodify his statement. He consistently said, ``If you like your health \ncare plan today, you can keep it, period''--completely misleading. \nMillions of Americans who have received cancellation notices and who \nare seeing skyrocketing premiums are in peril in their ability to cover \nthemselves and their family.\n  There is a better way. There was a better way back then and there is \na better way today of bringing down health care costs and making it \nmore affordable for more Americans, allowing them to have access to the \nhealth care plan they like and the doctor they choose. Yet if we stay \non this current path, we are headed for a train wreck. We have time to \nturn the train around before this is fully implemented, and I hope to \nfind bipartisan cooperation because health care is an important issue \nto millions of Americans. It is a pocketbook issue that affects so many \nfamilies across this country, and their ability to provide affordable \ncoverage for themselves and their families is an economic issue and \nsomething everybody talks about at the kitchen table.\n  We can come up with a better solution. We should come up with a \nbetter solution. If we don't, not only will we see millions of \nAmericans with canceled coverage and millions of Americans with \ndramatic increases in the amount they are paying for health insurance \ncoverage today, we will also see the impact this will have on jobs as \nmore and more employers find it more difficult to retain their \nemployees and hire more workers. The chronically high unemployment rate \nwe see today, as well as the historically low labor participation rate, \nthe reduced take-home pay we have seen for middle-class Americans, \nthose will become a permanent state for the American people. I think \nthe American people want to see us work on policies that will improve \ntheir standard of living, improve their quality of life, get more \nAmericans back to work, and increase take-home pay for middle-class \nAmericans.\n  This policy takes us backward. This policy takes us down a track that \nleads to broken promises and unfulfilled expectations for the American \npeople. It is high time we change that. We can do that. I hope we will \nfind the bipartisan cooperation here and hopefully the engagement of \nthe President of the United States who, after all, made the promise \nthat ``if you like your plan, you can keep it, period,'' repeatedly, \nover and over--a broken promise. It is not too late to do the right \nthing. I hope we will be able to find the bipartisan cooperation to do \nthat.\n  I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n             Honoring Senior Pastor Jasper W. Williams, Jr.\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, we get to do a lot as Members of the \nSenate on the floor of this great body. We make great speeches and we \nhave great debates. Periodically, from time to time, we pay tribute to \nsomeone in our State who has done great work for many people. I take \nthis opportunity to do exactly that on the floor of the Senate.\n  This Sunday night, at 5 p.m., at the Salem Baptist Church in Atlanta, \nGA, the Reverend Jasper W. Williams will be honored for his 50th year \nof continued service at the Salem Baptist Church. I have been \nprivileged to know Jasper for 20 of those 50 years. I have been a \nmember of that church and I heard his sermons. I have heard him preach \nthe Gospel. I have seen him teach others and I have seen him save \npeople's lives. I have heard and I have seen him reach out into the \ncommunity to bring children together for daycare, to watch him help to \nmend the sick and the poor, and doing everything that is expected of a \nchurch and doing so without any expectation of benefit to himself, \nexcept for the self-satisfaction of serving the Lord and serving his \nchurch.\n  He has a great church at Salem Baptist. They have two sites, as a \nmatter of fact, and two large congregations.\n  He succeeded his father as a minister and learned the ministry from \nhis father. He went to Salem Baptist Church to preach as a guest on \nEaster Sunday in 1963. And in November of that year, at the age of 19, \nthat church offered Jasper the pastorship of Salem Baptist, and he has \nbeen there every day since.\n  His two sons also preach in the Salem Baptist Church community to \ncarry on the tradition of the Jasper Williams family.\n  He is a graduate of Morehouse College, the leading Black institution \nin Atlanta at the Atlanta University complex. He is a great citizen of \nour city, a great citizen of our State, and a great citizen of our \ncountry.\n  So I take a privilege at this time on the floor of the U.S. Senate to \npay tribute to my friend, Jasper W. Williams, Jr., to thank him and to \nthank the Lord for his service to the people of Atlanta, GA, and to the \nBaptist Church.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, I ask to be recognized to speak on \nbehalf of the passage of ENDA.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, I rise today in support of equal \ntreatment for all Americans. The Employment Non-Discrimination Act, or \nENDA, is aimed at protecting all lesbian, gay, bisexual, and \ntransgender\n\n[[Page S7814]]\n\nAmericans from workplace discrimination based on their sexual \norientation or gender identity. All Americans deserve to be free from \ndiscrimination in the workplace, and ENDA is a crucial step to ensuring \nequal treatment.\n  I have been a cosponsor of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act \nevery time it was introduced in Congress since the bill was first \ndrafted in 1994. Two years later, in 1996, I was one of only 67 Members \nof the House of Representatives to vote against the Defense of Marriage \nAct. That seems like ancient history now--so long ago.\n  I am proud to say that the Employment Non-Discrimination Act has its \nroots in my home State of Massachusetts. Back in 1994, it was \noriginally written by two titans of Massachusetts politics: Congressman \nGerry Studds in the House of Representatives and Senator Ted Kennedy \nhere in the U.S. Senate. We are coming up now close to 20 years since \nthose bills were introduced first in the House and in the Senate.\n  While neither of these visionary leaders is with us today, their \ntireless work for equality lives on. They helped pave the way for this \ndebate by challenging the pervasive view that LGBT people do not need \nor deserve the same legal rights and protections as everyone else.\n  We began debating this actually in the Massachusetts State \nlegislature in the mid-1970s. In Massachusetts, in the 1970s, a law \nlike this could not pass. But in 1989 Massachusetts became the second \nState in the Nation to adopt a law prohibiting discrimination based on \nsexual orientation in employment, public accommodation, housing, and \ncredit services.\n  In 2004 Massachusetts became the first State in the Nation to extend \nmarriage equality to same-sex couples. Massachusetts is again paving \nthe way with the passage of one of the first transgender equal rights \nlaws in the Nation.\n  The people of Massachusetts know that when some of our citizens are \nbeing discriminated against, the liberty of all people is diminished.\n  From schoolrooms to boardrooms, members of the Massachusetts LGBT \ncommunity have made stunning progress toward full legal equality. \nSimply put, equality works in Massachusetts, and it works for \nMassachusetts. By ensuring that LGBT individuals have the same \nemployment protections as everyone else, we have made the light of \nliberty in our State burn even more brightly.\n  The same basic civil rights protections that have been extended to \nLGBT residents of Massachusetts should be extended to LGBT people \nacross the entire Nation.\n  For the last two decades, the people of Massachusetts have supported \na national employment nondiscrimination law because we cannot allow our \nNation to have one standard in States that pass laws that protect \npeople from discrimination and have other States that do not. We cannot \nhave the careers of people, the dreams of people, to be in fear of \nprosecution as people move from State to State. There should be a \nnational standard which we establish--a standard that ensures that \nevery person knows that wherever they are in the United States of \nAmerica, they are going to be protected, that they were created by God, \nand they have a right to these protections in every State in our \ncountry.\n  Today the number of States that have adopted their own \nantidiscrimination laws is basically increasing. I applaud the progress \nthat has been made to advance the cause of equality on the State level. \nHowever, 29 States still do not have these critical protections in \nplace. That is 29 States too many that still refuse to provide those \nprotections.\n  In the end, it comes down to this: We should treat others as we would \nlike to be treated ourselves. The LGBT community is made up of our \nfriends, our neighbors, our coworkers, and our families. We all deserve \nthe same rights regardless of who we are, regardless of where we live \nin our great Nation. That is what is truly exceptional about America. \nDespite our challenges, we remain the brightest beacon of freedom, \nopportunity, and equality in the world.\n  I have a great deal of pride in our Nation and our people. I truly \nbelieve that despite our differences, we can come together with one \nvoice to say that discrimination is wrong. So let's here, this week, \nall stand together for a future without discrimination in the \nworkplace. It will make America more productive. It will make us more \nwealthy but, most importantly, it will ensure that we have removed that \nstigma of discrimination that puts fear into the hearts of American \ncitizens unnecessarily. This is a huge, historic week that we are about \nto see unfold in our Nation's capital. I pray we can pass this bill and \nsend it over to the House of Representatives so we can have this full \ndebate in our Nation for equality for every person who lives within our \nboundaries.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/05/senate-section/article/S7814-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7814]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I ask to be allowed to address the \nSenate for a brief period of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n\n\n                          Balancing The Budget\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. This afternoon I wish to touch on two issues. One is the \nissue of Social Security, which is life-and-death for many millions of \nAmericans, and the other is the issue of Medicare and Medicaid.\n  The main point I would like to make--and I make this as a member of \nthe budget conference committee--is that the American people, \nregardless of their political persuasion--Democratic, Republican, \nIndependent, conservative, progressive, whatever--are quite united in \nstating they do not want cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and \nMedicaid and they do not believe we should balance the budget on the \nbacks of some of the most vulnerable people in this country.\n  According to the latest National Journal/United Technologies poll, 81 \npercent of the American people do not want to cut Medicare benefits at \nall, 76 percent of the American people do not want to cut Social \nSecurity benefits at all, and 60 percent of the American people do not \nwant to cut Medicaid benefits at all. This is only one of many polls \nthat are out.\n  What the American people understand is that millions of people are \nhurting in today's economy. The number of people living in poverty is \nat an alltime high, and median family income is going down. \nUnemployment is much too high. People are hurting, and we cannot make \ndevastating cuts to the social safety net that is literally life-and-\ndeath for so many of our people.\n  I did want to mention that I worked on a petition drive with a number \nof grassroots organizations throughout this country. They include \nCREDO, Daily Kos, Campaign for America's Future, Social Security Works, \nDemocracy for America, Progressives United, MoveOn, Other98, USAction, \nand the Alliance for Retired Americans. In a pretty short time--less \nthan 1 week--we received over 500,000 names on a petition that says \nvery clearly: Do not cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Do \nnot balance the budget on the backs of some of the most vulnerable \npeople in this country.\n  The other point I would make when we talk about the budget is that at \nthe end of the day people do believe the deficit is too high. We should \nbe proud, by the way, that in the last 4 years we have cut the deficit \nin half, but it is too high. But what the American people also say is \nthat what is much more significant to them is the economy and the fact \nthat we have so many people who are unemployed.\n  I would point out, as somebody who believes very strongly--and I \nspeak as a former mayor of Burlington, VT--who believes absolutely that \nwhen your infrastructure--your roads, bridges, and rail system--is in \nneed of enormous investment, where we can create millions of decent-\npaying jobs rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, what the American \npeople are saying is, yes,\n\n[[Page S7815]]\n\nwe have to create jobs. According to a March 3, 2013, Gallup poll, 75 \npercent of the American people--including 56 percent of Republicans, 74 \npercent of Independents, and 93 percent of Democrats--support ``a \nfederal jobs creation law'' that would spend government money for a \nprogram ``designed to create more than 1 million new jobs.''\n  Again, of course, people say we are divided in America. In many ways \nwe are not quite so divided. The American people say don't cut Social \nSecurity, Medicare, and Medicaid. The American people say the most \nimportant issue facing our country is creating jobs. They want the \nFederal Government to do that. In this body we are divided, but among \nthe American people, on these issues, Republicans, Democrats, and \nIndependents are not quite so divided.\n  When we talk about unemployment, an issue that does not get anywhere \nnear the kind of discussion we need is youth unemployment in America. \nAs horrendous as unemployment is for anybody of any age, it is terrible \nfor the young people who are graduating high school and graduating \ncollege. All of us say to the young people in this country: Don't stand \non street corners. Don't do drugs. Go out and get a job, create a \ncareer, and make it into the middle class.\n  Yet real unemployment for young people in this country, for youth in \nthis country, is somewhere around 20 percent. Among African-American \nyoung people it is over 40 percent. I don't hear the discussion in the \nSenate about the need to create the millions of jobs our young people \ndesperately need so when they leave school they can go out and create a \ncareer for themselves and make it into the middle class. I worry very \nmuch about those young people who don't have that opportunity.\n  In an interview published October 1, 2013, Pope Francis said:\n\n       The most serious of the evils that afflict the world these \n     days are youth unemployment and the loneliness of the old.\n\n  He is not, of course, only talking about America; he is talking about \nwhat is going on throughout the world.\n  Continuing:\n\n       The old need care and companionship; the young need work \n     and hope but have neither one nor the other, and the problem \n     is they don't even look for them anymore.\n\n  I couldn't agree more.\n  We cannot turn our backs on the elderly. We cannot cut Social \nSecurity and Medicare. We cannot turn our backs on the young people. \nThey need to be given the opportunity to have decent jobs and make a \nlife for themselves.\n\n\n                          Older Americans Act\n\n  I would also like to say a few words about a piece of legislation \nthat just passed the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. I \nam the chairperson of the Subcommittee on Primary Health and Aging. I \nthank Chairman Harkin and Ranking Member Alexander, who are cosponsors \nof the Older Americans Act legislation that only last week came out of \ncommittee. This is a bill some of us have been working on for several \nyears.\n  The Older Americans Act is an enormously important piece of \nlegislation for senior citizens all over this country. The bill that \ncame out of committee in a very strong bipartisan way has the strong \nsupport of over 50 national organizations representing tens of millions \nof Americans, including AARP, the National Committee to Preserve Social \nSecurity and Medicare, the National Council on Aging, the Alzheimer's \nAssociation, and the Meals On Wheels Association of America.\n  I won't go into all of what this bill does, as I don't have the time \ndo that, but it deals with the very important issue of elder abuse and \nmaking sure that seniors in nursing homes get the care and respect to \nwhich they are entitled. It deals with the Long-Term Care Ombudsman \nProgram. It places an increased emphasis on evidence-based programs. It \naddresses the changing nature of senior centers in America, prevents \nfraud and abuse, and it focuses on home care and nutrition services. \nThere is a lot in this bill that I believe is quite good, and it is a \nstep forward.\n  One of the problems we have--Senator Burr of North Carolina raised \nit, and appropriately so--the issue is that we are seeing in this \ncountry in general a migration of folks from northern parts of the \ncountry to the South--this is not a new issue--including many seniors. \nWhat Senator Burr was arguing is that he thinks the current formula is \nunfair and that it does not take into account that kind of migration. I \nthink he has a valid point, which we want to address.\n  The other point and the most important point is that since 2006--the \nlast year in which the Older Americans Act was authorized--the U.S. \nelder population has grown by over 20 percent. As the baby boomers age, \nevery single State in this country has seen its senior population grow. \nThe important point is that Federal funding for this legislation is the \nsame today as it was in 2006--$1.8 billion. Funding for the act in \nterms of real inflation-accounted-for dollars has decreased by more \nthan $250 million during that period of time.\n  We have a growth in the senior population and a decline in real \ndollars going into the needs of seniors through the Older Americans \nAct, and this is a very serious problem. We compound that problem with \nthe migration from the North in some States to the South.\n  What is the solution? I believe the solution is very simple. If we \nunderstand that the Older Americans Act is an enormously cost-effective \nact--one doesn't need to be a gerontologist or a physician who deals \nwith senior citizens to understand that when a senior is malnourished \nand doesn't get the nutrition he or she needs, that senior is more \nlikely to break a hip by falling, that senior is more likely to get \nsick, go to the emergency room, and go to the hospital at great cost. \nEverybody knows that. There is no debate about that. When seniors have \nthe companionship and the nutrition they need, they are less likely to \ngo to the emergency room, they are less likely to go to the hospital, \nand we can save money.\n  Study after study shows that investing in programs such as the Older \nAmericans Act--that is, the Meals On Wheels program, the congregate \nmeal program, employment opportunities for seniors, dealing with elder \nabuse--when we invest in those programs, we save money. We not only \nfrom a moral perspective make life better for seniors, we actually save \nFederal money by preventing other bad things from happening.\n  I hope our committee and Members of the Senate can work together to \nsay that increasing funding for the Older Americans Act is not only the \nright thing to do for millions of Americans, it is also the cost-\neffective way to go. If we can increase funding, we can deal with some \nof the issues Senator Burr has raised.\n  What I will not support is making drastic cuts in certain States, \nsuch as Iowa, New York, or Massachusetts, in order to increase funding \nin other States. We have to protect every State in this country because \nthere is no State in which programs like the Meals On Wheels program \ndon't already have long waiting lines. What we need to do is invest in \nthese programs. When we do, we will have done something that is very \nimportant for seniors all over this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business \nfor 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, I come to the floor today to talk about \nthe health care law. We have reached the 1-month milestone of the \nembarrassing rollout of healthcare.gov, and it doesn't work. There is \nno shortage of headlines about the issues.\n  CNBC: ``99 percent of Obamacare applications hit a wall.''\n  Bloomberg: ``Insurers Getting Faulty Data From U.S. Health \nExchanges.''\n  Consumer Reports: ``Stay away from HealthCare.gov for at least \nanother month if you can.''\n  Forbes: ``Now She Tells Us: Sebelius Says Obamacare's Exchange \nWebsite Needed Six Years of Development, Instead Of Two.''\n  The Associated Press: `` . . . government memo shows . . . a lack of \ntesting posed a high security risk . . . ''\n  Nebraskans have relayed the same frustrating messages to me and to my \noffice. One Nebraskan from Ogallala\n\n[[Page S7816]]\n\nshared that she was on the Web site from 9 a.m. until 3 p.m. and was \nnot able to set up an account. She said that after 6 hours the Web site \nscreen read: ``The account couldn't be created at this time.'' Another \nNebraskan from Norfolk said he couldn't get the Web site to work, so he \ncontacted a Web site official, who actually said he could not help \nhim. Instead, the official directed him back to the nonworking Web \nsite.\n\n  The accounts from people who have experienced page crashes, hours and \nhours of slow service, no service, and information errors goes on and \non. Yesterday, I launched a page on my Web site for Nebraskans to share \ntheir ObamaCare stories. In just the first 24 hours, nearly all of the \nstories I have received are heart-wrenching accounts about the law's \nnegative impact.\n  Despite the headlines and stories flooding in across the country, the \nPresident continues his all-too-familiar cheerleading act. Rather than \noffering Americans the accountability and the transparency they \ndeserve, the President claims, ``the product is working; it's really \ngood.''\n  Top HHS officials reflected the President's poor leadership in their \nhearings today and last week. They dodged questions, they withheld \ncritical information, and they delivered more promises that won't be \nkept. Strikingly, the ObamaCare enrollment site was actually down as \nthe HHS Secretary testified for the first time about the Web site's \ntroubled rollout and even assured Americans the Web site is working and \nthat it is just slow and unreliable.\n  Americans are understandably frustrated with this failed effort and, \nmost importantly, this failed law. Last week I cosponsored legislation \nthat requires HHS to provide weekly reports to Congress and to the \npublic about healthcare.gov. This ensures Americans, who have paid over \n$400 million for this exchange, will actually receive the transparency \nthey deserve. While enacting this bill is one worthwhile step, the \nissues with this law aren't just about the Web site. The reality is \nthere are much larger issues--issues that no fix to the Web site can \nsolve.\n  Not surprisingly, the law's botched implementation is mimicking the \nclumsy passage. I was here. I saw it--2,700 pages written behind closed \ndoors, passed on party-line votes, full of unrealistic promises and \nfilled with pork. It indeed has been a recipe for disaster since day 1. \nWe received clear warnings in 2009 that a lack of transparency, missed \ndeadlines, and broken promises were to be the legacy of this law. And \nnow, almost 4 years later, we are seeing just the start of the real-\nlife consequences of this irresponsible process and policy.\n  A number of stories I have heard from Nebraskans reflect what is \nhappening on a large-scale basis across this great country. A widowed \nmother from Kearney pays for her family's health insurance out of her \nown wages. She is extremely disappointed because her existing plan \nwon't be offered next year. The President's repeated promise to her and \nto others that ``if you like your plan, you can keep it'' is not true \nfor that mother in Kearney or for millions of Americans.\n  So this Nebraskan is stuck with two options: She can choose a plan \nwith a similar premium, but her coinsurance will go up, her deductible \nwill increase to $1,500, and her family out-of-pocket limit will \nincrease to $9,700. Her second option is to select a plan with similar \ncoverage that costs an additional $200 per month. That is $2,400 more \nper year. She said in her letter:\n\n       I don't find this to be affordable health care. I had \n     affordable health care.\n\n  This woman is not alone, according to figures released by the \nNebraska Department of Insurance about the exchange in our State. \nNebraska's insurance director said:\n\n       Basically, the rates are going up.\n\n  Family coverage for a single mom with 3 children in Hastings, NE, \nwill increase 21 percent. A single male in Lincoln will see a 144 \npercent increase. Let me repeat that--a 144 percent increase.\n  A Manhattan Institute study found that Nebraska would be one of the \nworst-hit States for rate hikes, specifically citing young males and \nmiddle-aged women.\n  A practicing physician in Nebraska wrote to me saying Obamacare will \n``destroy'' our health care system. She says the law means ``more \npaperwork, less time with patients, doctors outright quitting or \nretiring early, and fewer students willing to invest time and money to \nbecome doctors.''\n  This fall Nebraska grocers came to my office to discuss ObamaCare. \nThey shared that small grocery stores are hiring fewer people and are \ncutting back hours. As we all know, the employer mandate requires \nbusinesses with over 50 employees to provide coverage for all of their \nemployees or pay a $2,000 penalty for each employee. Even though the \nmandate was delayed, grocers shared, ``The labor force is fundamentally \nchanging already.'' I might add, not for the better.\n  I find it amazingly contradictory that the Obama administration is \ngranting a delay that provides private businesses temporary relief from \nan employer mandate. Yet American families will be subject to the \nindividual mandate. It is even more inconsistent and unfair to punish \nAmerican families by imposing a penalty for not enrolling on a Web site \nthat isn't working.\n  Last week I signed on to legislation to delay the individual mandate \nuntil 6 months after the Web site is verifiably fixed. I have also \nsigned on to a bill that delays the mandate for 1 year and another bill \nthat would repeal it entirely. I firmly oppose the mandate. I hope to \nrepeal it. But at the very least, I believe the American people should \nhave the same protection our Nation's businesses have been promised. \nBecause the reality is this law has put goodwill and hardworking \nAmericans, who are playing by the rules, in the most frustrating and \nheartbreaking situations.\n  When it comes to this law, I have already said I believe the people \nof Nebraska and the citizens of our great country deserve so much \nbetter. They deserve a law that addresses the rising cost of care. They \ndeserve a government that fosters economic growth so that families can \nconfidently make a downpayment on a house, send their kids to college, \ngrow their businesses or start a new one. Instead, because of their \ngovernment, Americans are more uncertain than ever. They simply can't \nmake sense of the 2,700-page law or its 20,000 pages of regulations and \nwhat that means for their families. You would need a cadre of lawyers \nto figure that out.\n  The administration's failed Web site launch only deepens Americans' \nconcern about what more could come. ObamaCare was never ready for prime \ntime. It wasn't ready that Christmas Eve when it was passed on a pure \nparty-line vote. Sadly, we all knew this when it passed, but now we are \nbeginning to see that you reap what you sew.\n  Today we find ourselves at a crossroads, and it is time to listen to \nthe American people and repeal the law. That would deliver the single \nbiggest solution to removing the uncertainty, anxiety, and burden upon \nour economy. History will harshly judge those who defend, for political \nreasons, a law that is so clearly inflicting so much harm.\n  Lately, a few of my colleagues from the other side of the aisle have \nbegun to admit the problems and admit they are real and substantial. \nThere is tremendous pressure on them not to break ranks. Yet several \nare beginning to speak for the people instead of the party. Some are \nrightly beginning to refuse to defend promises that have now proven to \nbe lies. Most importantly, some are now signaling a willingness to \nsupport legislative solutions.\n  Maybe there is a crack in the armor, but we need more than the \ncurrent few to stand with the American people. We need 15 Democrats to \njoin our 45 Republican Senators to actually repeal or amend any section \nof this ill-advised law. It is a worthwhile endeavor, and it is one we \nmust pursue.\n  I believe that, ultimately, history will commend those who rise above \nthe political fray to recognize that at this moment in time true \nstatesmen, true public servants must stand with the American people.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n[[Page S7817]]\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I wish to begin by thanking a number \nof my colleagues for their leadership, including Senators Merkley and \nHarkin and others in this body who have championed the Employment Non-\nDiscrimination Act, known as ENDA, over many years with great passion \nand constancy. Now we are literally on the verge of approving this \nhistoric measure in this body and hopefully in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  I have heard from numerous organizations that represent America's \nworkforce, such as the Service Employees International Union and the \nUnited Auto Workers Union, that--and I am quoting the UAW--``this \nlegislation represents a step in the right direction toward providing \nequal opportunity for all Americans.'' That message is also carried on \nby America's faith leaders, our business community, generally, and many \nothers who have fought over the years for civil rights and civil \nliberties. It is one of the paramount civil rights issues of our time \nand I am proud to be fighting for it.\n  I wish to mention some of the American businesses that have stepped \nforward to endorse this legislation: Boehringer Ingelheim \nPharmaceuticals of Ridgefield, CT; Diageo North America of Norwalk, CT; \nUBS AG of Stamford, CT; and Xerox Corporation, also of Stamford, CT. \nThere are many others around Connecticut, big and small.\n  The reason the business community is steadfastly and strongly behind \nthis bill is that it is good for America's working men and women and it \nis good for the business community. It has attracted bipartisan support \nin this body and around the Nation. America is moving toward this kind \nof guarantee against discrimination.\n  This bill is many years in the making. The last time the Senate voted \non this issue in 1995 the bill couldn't even attain 50 votes. Our \nNation has made tremendous progress since then, of course--not only on \nthis bill but on a range of LGBT civil rights issues. This bill is \nimportant because it is inclusive. ``Inclusive'' is the word that ought \nto characterize our society.\n  In the 18 years since the Senate last voted on ENDA, 14 States, which \ntogether are home to almost one-third of the Nation's population, have \ncome to recognize same-sex marriage. This is, of course, an increase \nfrom zero in 1995.\n  Over the past two decades, we have seen a string of landmark Supreme \nCourt cases, from Romer v. Evans to Lawrence v. Texas, to this year's \nhugely important and inspirational ruling in Windsor v. United States. \nBut this issue is about more than just legal reasoning and rulings. It \nis about real people. It is about members--millions of them--of the \nLGBT community who are now just beginning to enjoy full freedom and \nequality that is guaranteed to them by our Constitution as citizens. It \nis about their moms and dads, brothers and sisters, sons and daughters, \nmembers of their families from all over, as well as their coworkers in \nthe places where discrimination will be banned and who are supporting \nthis legislation. They deserve nothing less than full equality, which \nis what this bill would give to them. They should not be victims of \ndiscrimination because of whom they love. That is the simple idea \nbehind this historical potential law.\n  Still, we have a lot more work to do on this bill. The House \ncertainly will not be an easy battle. We need to make sure, very \nsimply, that the House is given an opportunity to vote. Because if it \nis given that opportunity--if the House votes--it will approve this \nbill, just as it did the Violence Against Women Act, after the Speaker \ninitially denied that opportunity. The last time this bill came to a \nvote in the House was in 2007, when 35 Republicans joined Democrats to \npass the bill, but it did not pass the Senate.\n  I understand Speaker Boehner may have reservations. He has expressed \nthem already. I understand the politics for other Members may be \ndifficult. But this vote is about the future of our Nation, about what \nkind of America we are going to be. It transcends in importance a lot \nof the measures we undertake. It is about real people's lives in the \nworkplace, in their homes, and what kind of life they have, what kind \nof opportunities they have to fulfill all of their potential as human \nbeings. That is why America is so special. It guarantees people an \nequal opportunity.\n  In 29 States, LGBT Americans live without any protections against \ndiscrimination in private sector employment. They have those \nprotections in 21 States across the country. Between 15 percent and 43 \npercent of all LGBT Americans have experienced discrimination or \nharassment in their workplaces because of their sexual orientation or \ngender identity, and that number rises to a staggering 90 percent for \ntransgendered Americans in particular, with more than one-quarter--25 \npercent--reporting they have been fired. These kinds of troubling \nstatistics have no place in the America of the 21st century.\n  We have an opportunity in this same bill to ban discrimination \nagainst our veterans. I would suggest--and I will propose it in an \namendment--that similar protections be afforded to them. Hiring a \nveteran is a good investment for any business. Veterans have unique \nqualities, including dedication and discipline, which make them \nqualified for many civilian jobs. Unfortunately, too many veterans are \nunable to find work today, most especially our younger veterans who \nexperience higher unemployment rates than their contemporaries who have \nnot made the sacrifice and have not given the service they have in \nuniform. For them to be unemployed at higher rates is a disgrace. It is \nan outrage that the greatest Nation in the history of the world whose \ncitizens volunteer to serve and sacrifice, preserving our freedom, have \nhigher unemployment rates when they come home than others.\n  The evidence is--and I have heard it and seen it from veterans as \nwell as others--that they are sometimes victims of discrimination. That \nought to be outlawed. That is what I believe this law can do, in \naddition to seeking equality and opportunity for all Americans and \nbanning discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.\n  I wish to express my gratitude to AMVETS, Veterans of Foreign Wars, \nand the National Guard Association of the United States, which have \nsupported this initiative prohibiting discrimination against veterans. \nWhen I introduced S. 1281, the Veterans and Servicemembers Employment \nRights and Housing Act of 2013, they supported it, and I am grateful to \nthem. I think this kind of amendment would be a welcome companion to \nENDA, the landmark legislation the Senate is moving forward toward \npassing.\n\n\n                 Manufacturing Reinvestment Account Act\n\n  When it comes to the workplace--on a separate, unrelated piece of \nlegislation--I wish to thank Senator Coons for his leadership in the \nmanufacturing initiative area he has spearheaded and speak on a \nparticular measure that will help manufacturers grow and invest, the \nManufacturing Reinvestment Account Act. This legislation was \ncosponsored by my colleague from Connecticut, Senator Murphy, as well \nas sponsored in the House by another Connecticut colleague, Rosa \nDeLauro, to create a new type of an account that manufacturers can use \nto help save and eventually make investments in their businesses.\n  I am proud the Manufacturing Reinvestment Account Act is part of the \nSenate's manufacturing American jobs agenda led by Senator Coons. Under \nthis initiative, several of my colleagues have come together to make \nsure we move away from manufacturing crises and toward manufacturing \njobs. That is what we should be doing, helping to create jobs, not \ncreate crises, especially when they result in self-inflicted wounds.\n  This bill will allow manufacturers to put up to $500,000 a year in \nthese special manufacturing reinvestment accounts, much like people put \naway money in IRAs. It would give them 7 years to use the money they \ndeposit for qualified manufacturing expenses. Essentially, these \nmanufacturers can use these funds for investments in physical capital \nsuch as equipment and new facilities or human capital such as job \ntraining and workforce development. They then would be able to withdraw \nthe funds from their accounts at a low 15-percent tax rate.\n\n[[Page S7818]]\n\n  This bill is a Connecticut original. I am very proud I sponsored it \nlast session and I am proud to do so again now. I wish to thank in \nparticular Jamie Scott of Air Handling Systems in Woodbridge, CT, for \nthe key role he played in developing this idea. He came to me with the \nbasic concept and we developed it into a bill which is so eminently \nqualified for support. It makes such clear common sense, and it shows \nwhat happens when industry leaders and their elected representatives \nwork together to devise innovative ideas to grow the economy. We not \nonly produce in Connecticut and make the best manufactured products in \nthe world, but we also make ideas, which is why this Yankee ingenuity \nhas produced a bill that favors reinvestment accounts to enable \ninvestment at low tax rates and spur and incentivize job creation.\n  With the support of Mr. Scott and Congresswoman DeLauro, it has been \nreintroduced on the House side. I have been happy to introduce this \nlegislation in the Senate. I hope it will provide real encouragement \nfor manufacturers to grow and invest and expand job training, taking \nthis money from profits and putting it away so it can be saved without \ntaxation, and then using it at lower rates of taxation is a basic \nprinciple that makes eminent good sense. I think it comes at an \nimportant time as we all grapple--economists, experts, businesspeople--\nwith how to recognize and spur a manufacturing renaissance throughout \nthe United States. What is needed is dollars and capital and the \ncommitment to make sure we create jobs and use people for those jobs \nwho are not only willing but eager to work.\n  I also thank our community colleges, such as Asnuntuck and others \naround the State, that have done so much to provide job training in the \nskills that are needed, matching skills to jobs that exist and jobs \nthat will be created. Asnuntuck Community College's manufacturing \ntechnology program is just one example among all of our community \ncolleges which have trained more than 1,000 students who have \ntransitioned successfully to private sector jobs that make use of the \ncutting-edge skills they learned on machinery, often donated by \nbusinesses, so Asnuntuck can teach those students so they can be \nmatched to those businesses' needs. I have seen those students in \naction during my visits to Delta Industries in East Granby and ATI \nStowe Machining in Windsor. Both of these companies have hired many \nstudents from Asnuntuck and are looking to hire more as they grow and \nexpand in Connecticut.\n  So these programs serve a profoundly important public good for our \nwhole country that should bring us together on a bipartisan basis. We \nwant to work together, not divide ourselves over false crises and \nunnecessary partisan division. I am confident, if we pass this \nlegislation, our manufacturers will use this innovative tool and the \nmanufacturing reinvestment account will help us to double down on \ngrowing America.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak for 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Budget Conference\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, earlier this year, a man named William, \nwho is from Gig Harbor, WA, wrote to me to express his frustration with \nwhat he saw happening here in Congress. William served in the Navy. He \nnow works for a tech company that supports Navy communications in the \nPacific Northwest.\n  Like so many Americans in recent years, he has witnessed hiring \nfreezes and cutbacks and furloughs and layoffs. He said a couple of \nyears ago he was hoping for a promotion, but now he considers himself \njust lucky to have a job. He is not even sure how long he can count on \nthat.\n  Well, William is not alone. The partisanship and the gridlock here in \nWashington, DC, have been devastating for families such as his in my \nhome State of Washington and across the country.\n  The government shutdown and the debt limit brinkmanship last month \nwere just the latest examples. But Congress has been lurching from \ncrisis to crisis to crisis for years and it has got to end. So today I \nam going to share a few stories from families who have been paying the \nprice for the dysfunction here in Congress. I have worked very hard to \nmake sure that voices such as theirs are heard loudly and clearly in \nthe budget process. I am going to keep fighting to make sure their \ninterests are represented every day as we work now toward a balanced \nand bipartisan budget agreement.\n  Seven months ago the House and the Senate each passed their budget. \nThe Senate budget that we passed here was built on three principles. \nFirst of all, our highest priority was investing in jobs and economic \ngrowth and prosperity that is built from the middle out, not from the \ntop down.\n  Secondly, the deficit has been now cut in half and we built on the \n$2\\1/2\\ trillion in deficit reduction we have passed now since 2011 to \ncontinue to tackle this challenge fairly and responsibly.\n  Third, our budget keeps the promises that we have made to our seniors \nand our families and our communities.\n  The budget that passed the House reflects different values and \npriorities. But it was our job to get in a room, make some compromises \nwith them, and find a way to bring those two budgets together. Although \nI had hoped we could start this bipartisan budget negotiation far \nsooner and avoided last month's crisis, the budget conference has now \nbegun--started last week--and offers us now the opportunity to break \nthis cycle of gridlock and dysfunction and start moving our country \nback in the right direction. We have a chance now to turn our attention \nback to where it belongs, strengthening our economy and creating jobs, \ncontinue making responsible spending cuts while closing wasteful tax \nloopholes that are used by the wealthiest Americans and biggest \ncorporations, and to finally show the American people that Congress can \nwork together. We can compromise and alleviate the uncertainty and the \npain that families across the country are facing.\n  The effect of these years of gridlock is clear in places such as the \nDenise Louie Education Center in Seattle. I visited that Head Start \nProgram earlier this year where pre-K students from low-income families \ncan learn their ABCs and take part in story time and benefit from \nhealth and nutrition programs. Even before the major cuts to Head Start \nthat took effect last month, that center had a waiting list. Now the \ndirector of the school has had to drop kids from that program because \nof these tight budget constraints.\n  They are far from alone. Another Head Start in Everett, WA, a program \nthat has served needy kids since the 1970s, had to completely shut its \ndoors this summer because Congress could not work together. That one \nfacility alone was helping 40 kids prepare for kindergarten. \nNationwide, these cuts have forced tens of thousands of children out of \nHead Start as well.\n  That is not all. The senseless cuts for sequestration have impacted \neducation programs all across the country. Researchers and scientists \nwho are working on cures for cancer and other diseases have lost their \njobs. Programs such as Meals on Wheels that deliver food to seniors \nhave been cut.\n  There is so much more. The ripples from the so-called sequester have \nbeen felt in our homes and in our businesses and across our fragile \neconomy.\n  The across-the-board cuts have also had, of course, serious impact on \ndefense programs and workers. Earlier this year I heard from one of my \nconstituents whose family was impacted by this very directly. His name \nis Bob. He is from Bremerton, WA, and is an engineer at the Puget Sound \nNaval Shipyard. He told me every day highly skilled employees come into \nhis office, often in tears, and tell him they do not know how they are \ngoing to manage to make ends meet if they are furloughed or laid off. \nThey are worried now. They have felt the pain for months. They know it \ncould get worse. Because if these automatic cuts are not replaced in a \nbipartisan deal, another $20 billion\n\n[[Page S7819]]\n\nis scheduled to be cut from defense spending in January, just a few \nshort months from now. That would make more furloughs and layoffs much \nmore likely. It would mean continued and deeper cuts to combat \ntraining.\n\n  It does not have to be this way, because something both Democrats and \nRepublicans agree on is that the very least this budget conference \nshould be able to accomplish, at an absolute minimum, is finding a path \nto replace these terrible sequester cuts and set a budget level for at \nleast the short term.\n  Republican Congressman Hal Rogers, the House Appropriations Committee \nchairman, said, ``Sequestration--and its unrealistic and ill-conceived \ndiscretionary cuts--must be brought to an end.''\n  Even House Speaker John Boehner said the cuts would ``hollow out'' \nour military.\n  Just recently the House Armed Service Committee Republicans sent me \nand Chairman Ryan a letter urging us to replace the sequester, saying \nit was ``never intended to be policy.''\n  That is exactly right. Sequester was intended to be so bad it would \ndrive both sides to the table to be willing to make some compromises, \nto replace it with smarter savings. I am very glad that more and more \nof our colleagues from both sides of the aisle are stepping up to try \nand find a solution. So the question now is not whether we should \nreplace the across-the-board sequester cuts, but how we do it.\n  The House and the Senate budgets both deal with sequester, just in \ndifferent ways. The House budget fully replaces the defense cuts and \nlifts the BCA cap. It pays for that by cutting even more deeply into \nkey domestic investments. Our Senate budget, on the other hand, \nreplaces all of the automatic cuts and pays for it with an equal mix of \nresponsible spending cuts and revenue that we raise by closing wasteful \ntax loopholes.\n  Finding a bipartisan solution will not be easy. We all know that. It \nwill require compromise from both sides. As I mentioned at our first \nbudget committee conference last week, I am going into this process \nready to offer some tough spending cuts that, unlike the sequester caps \nthat disappear in 2022, would be permanently locked into law. I know \nthere are many Republicans who would be very interested in swapping \nsome of the inefficient and damaging cuts in the sequester with \nstructural changes to programs that would save many multiples of the \ncuts to be replaced in the coming decades.\n  In short, I am willing to compromise. I am ready to listen to \nRepublican ideas, as long as their proposals are fair for seniors and \nfamilies. I am prepared to make some tough concessions to get this deal \ndone. But I cannot negotiate by myself. Compromise has to run both \nways. That means in addition to the responsible spending cuts, \nRepublicans need to work with us to close wasteful tax loopholes and \nspecial-interest subsidies, because it would be unfair and unacceptable \nto put the entire burden of deficit reduction on the backs of our \nseniors and our families. It should not be difficult for Republicans to \nagree to put just a few of the most egregious, wasteful loopholes and \nspecial-interest carveouts on the table to get a balanced and \nbipartisan deal.\n  If the choice is between closing a wasteful loophole and lurching to \nanother crisis, I hope every one of my colleagues will put their \nconstituents before special interests. Over the last few years people \nacross the country have lost a great deal of confidence in Congress's \nability to work together for the good of our Nation, people such as \nNaani King, who, as the New York Times recently reported, serves as a \nregistered nurse at Madigan Army Medical Center in my home State of \nWashington. During the shutdown last month, she worked without pay. \nWithout a paycheck, she had to dip into her retirement account to make \nher monthly mortgage payment. Now, even though the shutdown is over, \nher family cannot take any chances. She told the Times, ``We just have \ntoo much to lose.''\n  We here in Congress owe it to her family and to families all over \nthis country to work to find a path forward. So let's put an end to \nthis gridlock. Let's put an end to these crises. Let's show the \nAmerican people we are listening to them. In fact, let's show them that \ntheir stories are more important than sticking to party lines or \nstaying in ideological corners.\n  We have got to rebuild some trust and we can do that. We need to find \na path to compromise. We need to work together to strengthen our \neconomy and create jobs. I am ready to do that in this budget \nconference. I am hopeful that over the coming weeks every one of my \ncolleagues on that committee will make it clear that they are as well.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I am very proud to be here today speaking \nin support of historic legislation that will move us one step closer to \nthe day when who you love has absolutely nothing to do with the rights \nthat you are afforded as a citizen of the greatest country in the \nworld.\n  Frankly, the passage of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act is \nembarrassingly long overdue. In my State of Connecticut we have had \nantidiscrimination laws on the books for over 20 years. In 1991, \nConnecticut became the fourth State to formally protect LGBT workplace \nrights, and in 2011 we became the 15th State to offer similar \nprotections to our transgender citizens.\n  So it is funny, because my constituents assume that all across this \ncountry it is already illegal to fire somebody for whom they love and \nfor who they are. But, of course, as we know, that is just not the case \nacross most of the country.\n  Right now, in some States, you can be fired from your job simply \nbecause of having a little photograph of your partner on your desk at \nwork. While ENDA has been a commonly accepted civil rights protection \nin my State, you may hear some express opposition to this legislation \non this floor by vaguely citing what are commonly referred to as the \n``concerns of the business community.'' I am not sure what businesses \nthey are referring to, because in my State we have some of the biggest \nand most successful multistate and multinational businesses in the \nworld; and they know that nondiscrimination isn't just the right thing \nto do, it is also really good for business.\n  Companies such as United Technologies, General Electric, and Xerox \nwant the best and the brightest people to work in an inclusive team \nenvironment--not having their employees hiding from each other who they \nreally are. Companies such as BI Pharmaceuticals and Aetna haven't \nfolded under the weight of having these State-based workplace \nprotections. In fact, they are thriving in Connecticut, across the \ncountry, and all around the world.\n  So in speaking with companies from all over Connecticut, none, to me, \nhas ever argued that equal protection in Connecticut is something that \nis holding their businesses back. They have been living under this law \nfor decades now. And it is not just Connecticut's largest employers. \nConnecticut's law actually goes further than ENDA does in prohibiting \ndiscrimination even among businesses with fewer than 15 employees. Our \nsmall business community understands that, far from inhibiting \ncommerce, nondiscrimination policies actually help make our companies--\nbig and small--stronger.\n  So even though a majority of American businesses oppose employment \ndiscrimination, some argue this legislation is going to harm businesses \nwhose leaders have very strong religious beliefs. However, I think it \nis important to note the religious exemption in this legislation is \neven broader--remarkably broader, I would argue--than the exemption \nthat is in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, and it represents a \ncompromise that doesn't go as far as some Members of this body, \nincluding myself, would like.\n  In an op-ed that was published this summer, the former head of the \nNAACP, Julian Bond, equated these religious concerns with the arguments \nhe heard from opponents of the civil rights movement in the 1960s. Here \nis what Bond wrote.\n\n\n[[Page S7820]]\n\n\n       In response to the historic gains of the Civil Rights \n     movement in the 1960s, opponents argued that their religious \n     beliefs prohibited integration. To be true to their religious \n     beliefs, they argued they couldn't serve African-Americans in \n     their restaurants or accept interracial marriages.\n\n  It would be shocking to hear somebody make a similar argument today \nabout the treatment of African-Americans in our society. Frankly, I \nthink it will be just as shocking 40 or 50 years from now for people to \nread that this argument is being made today about the treatment of LGBT \nAmericans. There are, in fact--interesting to point out--numerous \nChristian and Jewish organizations and denominations that have taken a \nstrong stand in favor of this legislation because they understand that \nunequal treatment under the law is at odds with their faith.\n  Others on this floor have made the argument that passage of ENDA will \nlead to frivolous lawsuits from fired workers. So let me give my \nState's perspective on this. Again, we have been living under this law \nsince 1991. We have had protections that we are debating today for two \ndecades and we simply haven't seen frivolous lawsuits. And again, we \nhave big companies that employ thousands of people across the State and \nacross the Nation. Let me cite the statistics from 2009 to 2010, which \nis the most recent year for which we have data available.\n  Out of a total of 1,740 employment-based discrimination complaints \nthat were filed in the State that year, only 53 were based on sexual \norientation discrimination. Just as a means of comparison, 464 \ncomplaints were filed based on age discrimination. We went back a \nnumber of years, and in not a single year over the last half decade \nthat we looked at were there more than about 40 or 50 complaints.\n  My State has been a test case for these protections for sexual \norientation and gender identity. The parade of horrible consequences \nopponents of this bill say will happen just have not happened in \nConnecticut.\n  What we are doing here is pretty simple. We are not trampling on the \nFirst Amendment. We are not dictating morality. We are not harming the \neconomy. We are not undermining the religious community. We are just \nsaying that you can't discriminate against people in the workplace \nbecause of whom they choose to love or who they are inside.\n  The simplicity of this bill is why two-thirds of the American public \nsupport it, and it is why I believe that 50 years from now history is \ngoing to judge no less harshly those who vote against this act as it \nnow judges those who voted against some of the civil rights acts of the \n1950s and 1960s. Whom you love, who you are inside, and what you feel \nshould never, ever be a reason for discrimination.\n  I was on the House floor 6 years ago when the House passed ENDA, and \nI still remember listening to Congressman Barney Frank's closing \nargument. He welled up as he was giving it, and there were a lot of \ntears shed on the floor as well. I just want to close by quoting what \nhe said, and I won't try to do his accent. Barney Frank said:\n\n       I used to be someone subject to this prejudice. And through \n     luck and circumstance, I got to be a big shot. I am now above \n     that prejudice. But I feel an obligation to 15-year-olds \n     dreading to go to school because of the torment they endure, \n     to people who fear they will lose their job at a gas station \n     if somebody finds out whom they love. I feel an obligation to \n     use the status that I have been lucky enough to get to help \n     them. I make a personal appeal to my colleagues, please don't \n     turn your back on them.\n\n  We are all big shots here. We have been lucky enough to get elected \nto the greatest deliberative body in the world, and there is an \nobligation and a responsibility that comes with the job we have to \nstick up for people who are being discriminated against because of who \nthey are. The greatest moments of this body have been when we have \njoined together, Republican and Democrat, to stand against that kind of \ndiscrimination.\n  Our ability to rise to Congressman Frank's challenge--``please, don't \nturn your back on them''--can be this week, another great chapter in \nthe history of this great body.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, what is the pending business before the \nSenate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are on the motion to proceed to S. 815.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak 10 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak about how \nwe can avoid another shutdown of our government and also, even more \nimportant, avoid another shutdown or slowdown of our economy. That is \nhow we in the Congress, both sides of the aisle, both sides of the \ndome, need to work to arrive at a budget agreement and then an \nappropriations agreement for the rest of the fiscal year.\n  Earlier today on the floor we heard from the distinguished chair of \nthe Budget Committee, the Senator from Washington State, Patty Murray, \nwho talked about the budget and what was going on. I come here today to \nsupport her efforts and the work of the budget conferees as they work \nto reach an agreement on the funding levels that will invest in \nAmerica's future--creating jobs, repairing infrastructure, keeping us \nsafe in our communities and making sure our children are well educated \nfor the 21st century.\n  The budget conference is absolutely important to America's future \nbecause it is about how much we should invest in America's future: What \nshould we do in terms of revenue? How do we close corporate loopholes \nand corporate welfare and also have them step up to their patriotic \nresponsibility? Also, what is the best way to approach the funding for \nthis government?\n  There is no doubt we need to reduce public debt, but austerity alone \nis not the answer. We have seen it in Europe where, yes, they have \nreduced their public debt, but they have not been progrowth. The agenda \nI stand for--and I know the chair of the Budget Committee does and many \nof us on both sides of the aisle do--is we not only want to reduce \npublic debt, we also want to reduce unemployment, and we also want to \nreduce statistics such as crime rates.\n  We need to be able to work together. My goals for the conference \ncommittee that is meeting are simple and straightforward. I would like \nto see the Budget Committee come up with not only a 1-year framework \nbut a 2-year framework, giving a top-line funding level for 2014 and \n2015 and replacing the sequester policy for at least 2 years and do \nthat with increased revenues and strategic cuts--a balanced approach.\n  Let me say why this is important, because many people do not \nunderstand the difference between the Budget Committee and the \nAppropriations Committee. The Budget Committee looks at the entire \nbudget of the government of the United States of America, money out and \nmoney in. It looks at money out in two categories. Discretionary \nspending, that is the Appropriations Committee; mandatory spending, \nthat is Social Security, that is Medicare, that is veterans benefits. \nThen the other is revenue in, either through trust fund contributions \nor through fees or through taxes.\n  The so-called top line is what discretionary spending is, what they \nallow for discretionary spending. In the budget it is under an act \ncalled section 302(a) of the budget. In order to do my job as the chair \nof the Appropriations Committee, I need the Budget Committee, with the \nconcurrence of the Congress, to give my counterparts in the House--\nCongressman Rogers and Nita Lowey--and myself and Senator Shelby, my \nvice chairman on the other side of the aisle, the so-called top line. \nThen we work through our 12 subcommittees. This is absolutely crucial \nbecause we cannot do discretionary spending for fiscal year 2014 until \nwe hear from the Budget Committee.\n  We do not want another CR. We do not want another shutdown. We do not \nwant another slowdown. We are ready to go to work. We have already done \nour due diligence. We have already worked our way through the 12 \nsubcommittees, looking at what public investments should be made and, \nby the\n\n[[Page S7821]]\n\nway, how we can be more frugal, how do we get rid of what is dated, \nwhat is duplicative, and what is dysfunctional.\n  As the chair of the subcommittee, again with Senator Shelby, the \ndistinguished Senator from Alabama, my vice chairman, we asked the \ncommittee to look at what is it we need to spend and what is it we can \nget rid of. We have done a great job this year. I am very proud of \nthem. By August 1 all of my subcommittees were marked up, but we need \nto have this agreement. So we say we need to have this agreement and we \nneed to have it sooner rather than later.\n  In the deal, the Budget Committee is to report out to the Congress, \nand therefore to the Appropriations Committee, by December 15. My \ncommittee and my counterparts in the House are to produce an \nappropriations omnibus by January 15. I do not want to get lost in \nwords and the weeds. But essentially as it stands now, Congress will \nonly be in session 8 days from December 15 to January 15 because of the \nholiday. Eight days--it is an awful lot to ask Barbara Mikulski and \nRichard Shelby and Harold Rogers and Nita Lowey and our wonderful \nsubcommittees to produce a bill. We will do it if we have to. But we \nwould prefer sooner rather than later.\n  We believe so strongly about it that my House counterpart, \nCongressman Hal Rogers, a distinguished gentleman from Kentucky--and I \nsay gentleman in the true sense of the word: civil, candid, \nstraightforward, courteous. We have talked about issues, the \ndifferences in fiscal approach and so on. But we know how to get the \njob done. Where we differ we know how to resolve the conflicts and we \nare ready to go.\n  We have sent a letter to the chair of the Budget Committee on both \nsides, to Senator Murray and to Paul Ryan, asking that they report to \nthe Congress before the Thanksgiving recess--before the Thanksgiving \nrecess. This was unprecedented. We didn't talk about dollars--that is \nthe Budget Committee. We will take our pot of discretionary money, \ncalled the top line, and get it done.\n  What both the House chairman and I are very worried about is that if \nwe do not act, sequester kicks in January 15. What an awful way to do \nbusiness in our government. You heard me say our subcommittee chairmen \nhave worked to get rid of what is dated, what is duplicative, and what \nis dysfunctional. That is not just meant to be an alliterative, clever \nthrowaway line. That was a governing policy, both sides of the aisle, \nscrutinizing.\n  I am worried. When I look at defense, funding for defense would be \n$54 billion lower than the Senate's version in both defense and \nmilitary construction. According to the military chiefs, the readiness \nof our force has been degraded under existing sequesters. Eighty-five \npercent of Army brigade combat teams will not be fully trained to \ndeploy. The Navy and our Marine Corps will only have one carrier strike \ngroup and one amphibious ready group. They are always going to be \nsemper fi, but we have to be semper fi too and always faithful to \ngetting the job done. The Air Force will have to cut aircraft and \npossibly an entire fleet.\n  This is a dangerous time in the world with numerous threats to our \nsecurity. We cannot operate our military on the cheap.\n  Just to give a sense of what furlough meant, over 650,000 national \nsecurity employees were initially furloughed in defense and \nintelligence and in other security positions in key government \nagencies. This is unacceptable. We cannot protect the country and run \nthe government like that.\n  I chair the commerce, justice subcommittee. That is the committee \nthat funds Federal law enforcement, FBI, drug enforcement, U.S. \nMarshals, the U.S. attorneys who actually move this, the bureau of \nalcohol and firearms that keeps us safe from terrorism, catches child \npredators, prosecutes drug dealers, and gangs.\n  Think of how the FBI went after the Boston Marathon killers. The CJS \nbill adds $2.3 billion above sequester levels to allow Federal law \nenforcement to do their jobs. U.S. Marshals track down violent \nfugitives and sex offenders. DEA goes after not only drug dealers but \ninternational drug cartels, so it doesn't make it to the playground or \nto the school room.\n  The new FBI Director recently announced that if sequester continued, \nthe FBI will have to furlough people up to 10 days over the next year. \nThis is not good. In the long term CR at the sequester level, a \ncontinuing resolution will fund--they will keep a hiring freeze of over \n3,000 positions. We cannot have the kind of law enforcement we need at \nthose levels.\n  We have a big job to do. We have to do it sooner rather than later. I \nask the support of the Congress for the Budget Committee for them to be \nable to bring a budget to the floor. Let's try to do it before the \nThanksgiving break. Let's look at how we can look at a balanced \napproach between strategic cuts--and we on the Appropriations Committee \nare ready to keep on doing the job we started almost 7 years ago under \nSenator Byrd, our wonderful, most beloved leader of West Virginia, and \nSenator Inouye and Senator Stevens. We need to keep on doing that, but \nwe need the Budget Committee to do their job.\n  The impact on national security is significant. The impact on our \ndomestic economy is significant. We need to step to the plate and not \nonly avoid a crisis such as a shutdown, we also have to avoid the \ncrisis of confidence that is occurring in our government: Can they \ngovern? Can they get the job done? Are there significant pragmatists \nwho will look at what is the must-do list we have around spending, of \nwhich I think security for our country is at the top of the list. I \nbelieve we can do it.\n  I know the Presiding Officer was part of a bipartisan group during \nthe shutdown to try to find a compromise. That group, I salute them. \nThey changed the tone, showed civility, showed bipartisanship, and I \nthink their initial effort was enough to stimulate and encourage coming \nto the final resolution that we did. That is the kind of spirit we need \nin this body.\n\n  I would say to my colleagues, let's have the Budget Committee act \nsooner rather than later. Let's support them in a balanced approach to \nnot only look at austerity but also growth, and that also means closing \ncorporate loopholes.\n  I welcome the Presiding Officer to the Chair. I think that concludes \nwhat I wanted to say today. As we get ready to approach the holidays, I \nwant the American people to have confidence in their government. I want \nthe American people to have confidence in those of us who have been \nelected.\n  This is a big election day all over America. I recall this time last \nyear--the reelection of President Obama and the election of the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts who is now the Presiding Officer. It was a big day. \nIt was a big deal. Twenty women came to the Senate--a new Democratic \nwoman and the distinguished Senator from the State of Nebraska. When \nthey came, they were filled with excitement and passion to serve the \nNation, represent the views of the people of their State, and to get \nsomething done, not only to do it with the lowest common denominator \nbut also to be able to work together for the common good and worry \nabout the next generation, not the next election. That is what we did. \nLet's recall how we felt this time last year. Let's get our act \ntogether and press on.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I was so excited talking about my topic, I forgot to note the absence \nof a quorum, so I hereby note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Judicial Nominations\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, in 2005--May of that year--the \nSenate faced a crisis that seems very familiar and very much like the \none we face today in this body. Very simply, the Senate was unable to \napprove judges, which threatened to incapacitate a coequal branch of \nour government, the U.S. judiciary, and it confronted the threat of \nwhat came to be called the nuclear option, a change in the rules that \nwould have wrecked the collegiality and civility that have \ncharacterized this body.\n  Members of both parties recognized that the situation was untenable, \nand they recognized as well that the American court system was too \nimportant\n\n[[Page S7822]]\n\nfor the Senate to simply stop approving judges and suspend that very \nimportant constitutional responsibility on behalf of this body.\n  At the time, 14 Senators came together to find a solution. They came \nto be known as the Gang of 14--7 Republicans and 7 Democrats. I want to \nread their names for the record because I think their conduct \ncharacterized what is really perhaps best about this institution. They \nwere Senators Robert Byrd of West Virginia, Lincoln Chafee of Rhode \nIsland, Susan Collins of Maine, Mike DeWine of Ohio, Lindsey Graham of \nSouth Carolina, Daniel Inouye of Hawaii, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, \nJoseph Lieberman of Connecticut, John McCain of Arizona, Ben Nelson of \nNebraska, Mark Pryor of Arkansas, Ken Salazar of Colorado, Olympia \nSnowe of Maine, and John Warner of Virginia.\n  What they devised was a quite simple solution. They were grappling \nwith the same question that confronts us now: What can justify a Member \nof the U.S. Senate voting to block consideration--in other words, to \nfilibuster a nominee to the judicial branch? Their idea, simple as it \nwas, had tremendous power. They agreed they would oppose a judicial \nnominee only in ``extraordinary circumstances.'' That was the gist of \nthe agreement. There were other features to it, but their spirit and \nintent in this short phrase had profoundly meaningful impact. In fact, \nfor the remainder of the Bush Presidency, there were no more \nfilibusters on judicial nominees, and those Senators, with that short \nphrase, accomplished a historic impact.\n  What did they mean by it? One of them said at the time:\n\n       Ideological attacks are not an ``extraordinary \n     circumstance.'' It would have to be a character problem, an \n     ethics problem, some allegations about the qualifications of \n     a person, not an ideological bent.\n\n  An ethics problem, a character problem, some allegations about the \nqualifications of a person.\n  Today, I ask for a renewed and revived commitment to the spirit of \nthat agreement, a reinvigorated effort to apply that standard, and \noffer to work with my colleagues to revive that spirit of opposing a \nnominee and blocking that individual only in an extraordinary \ncircumstance.\n  I come to the floor today because we have heard objections to a \nnumber of nominees on the basis of claims that clearly cannot \nconstitute an extraordinary circumstance. Opposed through that 60-vote \nthreshold filibuster just last week were a couple of nominees who \nclearly have the qualifications to serve on the Court of Appeals for \nthe District of Columbia Circuit.\n  I rise in support today of another: Cornelia Pillard. Whatever has \nbeen said about this process, we have heard no extraordinary \ncircumstance to oppose any of these nominees and certainly not Ms. \nPillard. Senators can always disagree about exactly what our courts \nshould do and how we should divide and allocate resources, and the \nclaim has been made here that the reason to oppose those nominees is \nthat there is insufficient workload to justify them. The fact is this \nCongress has approved the positions that are vacant and they have been \nnominated to fill.\n  I know a lot of my colleagues have opinions on how to structure the \ncourts and what the workloads should be, but I would assume these \ndifferences of opinion do not amount to extraordinary circumstances. \nThey happen all the time. We debate what the workloads of the courts \nshould be, and certainly the job of this Senate and of every Senator is \nto advise and consent on judicial nominations. If we refuse to consider \nthe qualifications of a nominee and if we make the judgment based on \nirrelevant considerations, we are failing to advise and consent. We can \ndebate about the structure and workload and number of cases before a \ncourt, but they are not extraordinary circumstances.\n  The fact is that the workload of this court well justifies these \nnominations. In fact, it has grown in number since nominees were last \napproved. The waiting time for decisions on cases makes it eighth out \nof 12 circuit courts. The cases themselves cannot be judged only by the \nnumbers, by the sheer volume of the caseload; the Senate, in my view, \nhas to look also to the complexity and difficulty of the cases.\n  I have argued before this circuit court and I participated in cases \nsuch as the Microsoft appeal, which took months--in fact, years--to \nresolve from start to finish and involved precedent-setting issues and \ndecisions by the circuit court and literally hours of argument. So the \nargument about workload and about the need to fill or leave vacant, as \nthe opponents say, those vacancies is incorrect and wrong.\n  Agreeing with me are the Judicial Conference and a majority of their \ncolleagues, who also say the vacancies should be filled, as do judges \nfrom across the political spectrum and appointees of a lot of different \nPresidents.\n  But the point is that disagreement or even the claim that the \nworkload does not justify it is not an extraordinary circumstance, and \nthat ought to be the standard, consistent with the Gang of 14's \nagreement.\n  I happen to believe Cornelia Pillard is almost the ideal nominee. If \nyou were to design someone to sit on the court--if you had that \nability--on the basis of record and talent and temperament, I do not \nthink you could do much better.\n  The DC court is said to be the second highest court in the country. I \nthink they are all the second highest court. I do not think any one of \nthem is better than the others.\n  But what we want is an individual in each of these judgeships who is \nworthy of the immense responsibility because for most litigants the \ncircuit court is the last stop on the litigation course.\n  Nina Pillard brings to this nomination not only brilliance in an \nacademic sense but a variety of experiences and a record of thoughtful \nengagement with diverse views and a dedication to excellence and to \npublic service. She has spent time in the classroom as well as the \ncourtroom, and she is a civil rights hero as well as a public servant \nand an expert on the judicial system. In other words, if you had to \ndesign someone with a record and experience that is ideal for this \ncourt or any of the other circuit courts, you would pick Nina Pillard.\n  Now, I am going to come back to the floor. I am going to speak about \nher, I am going to speak about this court, I am going to speak about \nthe Gang of 14, and I am going to speak about what should justify \nblocking a nominee of the President of the United States to serve in \nthe courts. But for now let me just say about her that I hope my \ncolleagues will see her qualifications, listen to her story, and listen \nto the better angels of their nature.\n  The present situation cannot stand. If we continue on the present \ncourse, we will arrive at the same juncture that existed in May of 2005 \nwhen the Gang of 14 helped to save the Senate from a crisis. It would \nhave been a crisis for the collegiality and civility of this \ninstitution. It would have also been a crisis for the country. I hope \nwe can again avoid it if we permit this process to move forward and \nrecognize there is no extraordinary circumstance for any of these \nnominees that should block their approval by the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I request permission to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Affordable Care Act\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, this morning in the HELP Committee we \nhad an opportunity to hear from the administrator of the health \nexchanges, Ms. Tavenner, who came before the committee to talk about \nwhere we are in the process now with the exchanges that have been set \nup through the Affordable Care Act. It was an opportunity, in the 5 \nminutes we have allocated to each of us, to pose questions and to speak \nto the situation in Alaska as it relates to the exchanges.\n  I come to the floor this afternoon because there was so much that I \nas one Senator had to say that you cannot possibly condense into a 5-\nminute exchange. But it did cause me to want to take a moment to speak \nabout what is happening on the ground in the State of Alaska.\n  I think it is probably not an unfair assessment to say that most of \nthe constituents I am hearing from are not supportive of the Affordable \nCare Act and have been very skeptical about what benefits may come to \nour State.\n  We are a high-cost State--high cost when it comes to health care and \nhigh\n\n[[Page S7823]]\n\ncost when it comes to our insurance premiums. Right now we are No. 2 in \nthe Nation in terms of the premiums that Alaskans pay. So as much as \nAlaskans might not like the Affordable Care Act, I hear very clearly \ntheir expressions of concern about making sure we are working actively \nand aggressively to reduce the cost of health care, to increase access \nto providers, and to increase access to insurance that is affordable.\n  But affordability is such a key factor in what we face. I had a \nchance to query Ms. Tavenner about the situation we are seeing in the \nState of Alaska right now with regard to enrollments within the \nexchange. The State of Alaska has opted not to have its own State \nexchange. They are part of the Federal exchange, an organization called \nEnroll Alaska which was established to provide for outreach, education, \nand enrollment of Alaskans into the federally facilitated marketplace.\n  I met with a representative from Enroll Alaska about 10 days or so \nago. It was October 27, I believe. At that point in time, I was \ninformed that there was one Alaskan who had been successfully enrolled. \nI met with the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium, United Way, and \nEnroll Alaska. They confirmed that no one had been successfully \nenrolled at that point in time.\n  Moving forward to yesterday. As of yesterday, it has been confirmed \nthat Enroll Alaska, the entity that has been set up specifically to \nadvance enrollment within the exchanges, has been able to enroll just \nthree individuals and has not been able to confirm that anyone else in \nthe State has been successfully enrolled. So as folks are talking in \ndifferent parts of the country about what is happening, they are using \nnumbers: several thousand, several hundred initially. But it has been \nnot only surprisingly slow, astonishingly slow, to the point where \npeople are saying: Is it even open?\n  Let me suggest that in Alaska things are not open right now. Enroll \nAlaska made a determination last week that--they had discovered that \nthe FFM, the federally facilitated marketplace, was calculating the \nsubsidy for Alaskans incorrectly, so due to this they suspended all \ntheir enrollments until this issue was resolved.\n  I brought this up with the Administrator in committee this morning. \nShe acknowledged that, in fact, they had learned that perhaps the \ncalculation was incorrect and that they were ``working on it.'' Well, \nin the meantime, you have folks who are interested in signing up, \nwanting to avail themselves of the Affordable Care Act, or one of the \n5,600 who received a letter on Friday telling them that their insurance \nwith Premera was going to be canceled at year end and being told: Well, \nyou can, in fact, sign up for what Premera is going to offer. But in \nlooking at this, they are learning that not only are their premiums \ngoing to increase, but in many cases they may double and the deductible \nwill increase.\n  So they want to know: Am I going to get a better deal on the \nexchange? Our problem is not being able to access, to utilize, to gain \nthe information, when the entity that has been set up to help \nfacilitate this says they have suspended all enrollments until this \nissue is resolved, and further going into their letter that was \nreceived last week, they say: We asked for the Obama administration to \npull the Web site down, rebuild it, and redeploy it.\n  Again, these are entities that are banking on the exchanges to work. \nThey want to help facilitate it. Things are so confused and complicated \nand, quite honestly, a mess with the exchange up north that they are \nsaying: We are not going to push further if we are not certain that the \nsubsidy is being calculated correctly. It is not right to tell people \nthat you can sign up in the State of Alaska right now.\n  So the exchanges, we recognize, are a mess. They need to be \naddressed. I think we have recognized that at some point in time they \nwill be addressed, they will be corrected. The Administrator has \nindicated that between 1 a.m. and 5 a.m. eastern standard time the \nexchanges are going to be down so they can work on them, so they can be \naddressing these software glitches.\n  Well, 1 a.m. to 5 a.m. eastern standard time, for those of us who are \nliving on the west coast, is about the time when the dinner dishes are \ndone, the kids' homework is done, they are in bed, you can actually sit \ndown at your computer and go on line and try to figure out what might \nbe the best option for you on an exchange. But we are being told that \nthe exchange is going to be down between the time that most Alaskans, \nand certainly Hawaiians, who are a 5 hour time difference instead of \njust the 4 hours Alaskans are, are not even going to be able to go on \nline to address it there.\n  That is one aspect of where we are with the exchanges and what that \nis going to mean if we are still going to continue with the deadlines \nthat have been put in place by the administration in terms of when you \nhave to sign up by, and when you may be assessed a fine or a penalty \nfor failure to successfully enroll.\n  I mentioned that on Friday there were some 5,600 Alaskans who \nactually--excuse me, 5,360 Alaskans who received discontinuation \nnotices from Premera. Premera is the largest health insurer in Alaska. \nThis represents about 60 percent of the folks whom Premera insures \nwithin the State in terms of its individual members. So when you think \nabout these folks who have now received their letters this weekend, \nrecognize that the policies they have had for a period of time are not \ngoing to be available to them, they read in the news and they see on \nthe evening news that the ability to get on line and to better \nunderstand what is going on with the exchange is not available to them \nbecause the exchanges are down while they are working on them here in \nWashington, DC, or wherever they are working on them, and that the \nentities, the navigator, the Enroll Alaska, those who have been put out \nthere to help them navigate this process, are effectively saying: We \ncannot enroll you right now and we will not until there is a greater \nassurance that the system is up and running and working.\n  The Administrator has confirmed to us today that, well, we are \nworking on it. But in the meantime, we still have these deadlines that \nfolks are facing. The emails that have been coming to my office of \nlate, though, have not been concerned with the exchanges themselves. \nWhat we have seen in the past few weeks has been a concern, an outcry, \nabout what people will be expected to pay for their insurance once all \naspects of the Affordable Care Act come into play. I mentioned already \nthat Alaska faces the second highest premiums in the country. We are \nhigh for a lot of things, though. Our energy costs are some of the \nhighest in the Nation. Our transportation costs are some of the highest \nin the Nation. Our food costs are some of the highest in the Nation. \nOur health care costs are some of the highest in the Nation. Now our \npremiums are going to be some of the highest in the Nation.\n  But we recognize that to live in Alaska--it is expensive. So when you \nlook at the average wages of an Alaskan, they are a little bit higher \nthan you might see in other parts of the country. That is a good thing. \nThat is going to help you pay for your transportation, for your fuel, \nfor your food. But when we are talking about any level of subsidy, this \nis a concern we are seeing around the State. The higher income levels \nare going to kick you out of being eligible for any level of subsidy. \nSo we have got Alaskans who are trying to be diligent about their \nhealth care and the insurance, wanting to be able to provide for their \nfamily. They are trying to figure out: Well, where do I go?\n  I have got a letter here from a gentleman in Fairbanks. He runs a \nsmall knife and tool shop there. He has indicated that he was on \nPremera. He got the notice that they were not going to continue his \ncoverage. The new policy with them, the least expensive he could get, \nwas going to cost $1,260, up from $575. This is over a 60-percent \nincrease he is going to experience. On top of that, his deductible is \nalso going up from $5,000 to $6,000, an increase of about $2,700.\n  We got an e-mail from a woman who is in the 55-and-above age bracket, \nshe said. She says: We make a decent income, so we will not be eligible \nfor the subsidies. We have looked at this. But she said they are going \nto be seeing premiums of over $1,500 a month. She says: This is more \nthan our mortgage. This is like taking on a second mortgage. And also \nin her situation, she\n\n[[Page S7824]]\n\nsays: My deductible has gone from $5,000 to $6,300. So deductibles are \ngoing up, premiums are escalating.\n  This woman said: You know, am I going to be in a situation where it \nis just going to be cheaper for me to pay the fine?\n  So I started going back through the binder I have utilized to collect \nthe emails from Alaskans over the past few weeks here. A woman in \nAnchorage says her rates are going to increase 23 percent from last \nyear. A woman from Talkeetna says: It is an increase of 47 percent with \n1 fewer member in the family insured, a $10,000 deductible. But she is \ngoing up by 47 percent.\n  Out in Wasilla, this woman has indicated: I calculated we are \nexpected to have an increased monthly premium of 224 percent. Our \npremiums will be exceeding our mortgage by more than $300 a month.\n  William in Anchorage says his health insurance has gone up 115 \npercent. Out in Anchorage, a woman is facing an increase in premiums of \n45 percent. Again, she has indicated that she has been informed she is \nnot going to be eligible for any level of subsidy.\n  The gentleman in this email, Anthony, out of Valdez, has said he is \nlooking at an 85-percent increase in his premium, and that is just over \nthe past 4 months when he started out. He is a single guy. He is 41 \nyears old. He says: I am healthy. I have got money in my health savings \naccount. But he has got a situation where he is going to be paying an \n85-percent increase in his medical insurance premiums.\n  I go through these. These are not statistics. These are addressed \nto--I know this is not about you, Lisa Murkowski, but about \nrepresentation for the people of Alaska.\n  Address this. They are asking me to help them out because they can't \nafford the Affordable Care Act.\n  I go through each of these, the folks in Petersburg, such as the 25-\nyear-old male, nonsmoker, who had a $10,000 deductible. He was paying \n$102 per month. Now he will have to pay $281 with a $6,300 deductible; \na 35-year-old male, nonsmoker, paying $159 per month now has to pay \n$340; a 63-year-old male, nonsmoker, paying $525 per month, as of \nJanuary paying $827. We go through these stories. These stories are \npeople we represent, whether it is Tom or Wenda or Teresa or Chris or \nMark, they are saying I thought what was coming our way with health \ncare reform was reform that was going to increase my access and \ndecrease my costs.\n  Frustration with the Web site is one thing, and I am hopeful we will \nget on the other side of that very soon. The people of Alaska are done \nholding their breath on this. They are basically saying call me when \nyou have it fixed.\n  What they are concerned about is they are going to get that call, we \nwill be up against the end of the year, and they have already received \ntheir notices saying: We are not going to continue this coverage. They \nare worried about what happens if we do have a family medical emergency \nin early January and this all hasn't knitted together. I didn't get a \nvery satisfactory answer from the Administrator this afternoon in \nresponse to that question.\n  I want to be able to have the right answers for these people, but I \nam extraordinarily concerned that as we address the issues with the Web \nsite, the issues that the people in Alaska, who already face some of \nthe highest costs for living in the nation, are going to be seeing \nincreased insurance costs that will be out of their range, out of their \nability to pay. The subsidies that would make a difference are not \navailable to them.\n  We have a great deal of work to do in this Congress to address health \ncare reform. Alaskans are asking what are we going to do to address the \nconcerns in my family when I am trying to figure out how I knit it all \ntogether. They want to know how have we reformed health care. How have \nwe made our costs lower and increased our access?\n  I suggest we have much more work to do. I stand ready to work with my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle, and in the other body. We can \nfight and argue about whether the Web site and the exchanges are going \nto work or are going to fail on their own or whether we need to push \ndeadlines out. This is only a part of what we are talking about.\n  We have to do a better job when it comes to reining in the cost of \nhealth care itself, and how we deal with the delivery system. We \nhaven't addressed these issues or how we deal with rural markets, such \nas Alaska because we don't have a very attractive market--it certainly \nwould help us if we could purchase our insurance across State lines--\nand how we work to make sure that when we have payment structures, the \nincentives are in the right place so we are encouraging efficiencies in \nour healthcare system.\n  I encourage us to not lose sight of what we have to do in resolving \nour issues to bring down the cost of health care.\n  I note that my colleague from Tennessee is on floor. I thank him for \nhis leadership as the ranking member on the HELP Committee and the very \nthoughtful issues he raised this morning.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from Alaska for her excellent \nremarks. I was pleased I was able to hear them. The Senator from Alaska \nand the Senator from Massachusetts were at the hearing this morning \nwhen the head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services talked \nabout the health care law.\n  I thought the Senator from Alaska was especially cogent in pointing \nout the difficulties and the differences between those who live in \nAlaska and their inability to connect to the services in the new health \ncare law. If I remember correctly, she said only three had been able to \nenroll and she pointed out the differences in time.\n  I wish to spend a few minutes reflecting on what happened this \nmorning and what I said to Ms. Tavenner, the administration's witness. \nI began by telling her a story, a story about 16,000 Tennesseans who \nhave insurance through something called CoverTN, a low-cost, narrow \ncoverage State program. ObamaCare is canceling their policies, those \n16,000 policies. CoverTN apparently is an example of what the President \nhas called ``bad apples,'' an insurance plan that Washington has \ndecided isn't good enough for you.\n  I recently heard from one of those Tennesseans whose policy will be \ncancelled on January 1. Her name is Emilie, and she is 39 years of age. \nShe has lupus and lives in Middle Tennessee. She told me:\n\n       I cannot keep my current plan because it does not meet the \n     standards of coverage. This alone is a travesty. CoverTN has \n     been a lifeline. . . . With the discontinuation of CoverTN, I \n     am being forced to purchase a plan through the Exchange. . . \n     . My insurance premiums alone will increase a staggering \n     410%. My out of pocket expense will increase by more than \n     $6,000.00 a year [including subsidies]. Please help me \n     understand how this is ``affordable.''\n\n  Our health care system makes up nearly 20 percent of our economy, \ntouching the lives of every American. Today ObamaCare is pushing that \n20 percent of our economy in the wrong direction.\n  As the President has said, this law is more than a Web site that will \nnot work. It is a law transforming our health care system in the wrong \ndirection by increasing premiums, canceling insurance plans, destroying \npatient relationships with doctors, raising taxes, forcing people into \nMedicaid, spending $500 billion Medicare dollars on a new program \ninstead of using the money to make Medicare more solvent, encouraging \nemployers to reduce their employees to a 30-hour work week, and having \nthe IRS fine Americans for failing to sign up for insurance on a Web \nsite that doesn't work.\n  The President has promised--at this morning's hearing I read from an \niPad on the White House Web site. The President's Web site says: ``If \nyou like your plan you can keep it and you don't have to change a thing \ndue to the health care law.''\n  It says, ``If you like your plan, you can keep it, and you don't have \nto change a thing due to the health care law.''\n  In fact, the law cancels millions of individual policies. For \nmillions of others, employers are dropping insurance programs as they \ndiscover the added costs of ObamaCare. For these Americans, the new \npromise is if you want health care, go find it on a Web site that the \nadministration says will not be working properly until the end of \nNovember. That is an unwelcome\n\n[[Page S7825]]\n\nChristmas present, to have only 2 weeks to shop for and buy a new \ninsurance policy by December 15 so people are covered next year when \nObamaCare outlaws their policies.\n  This administration had 3\\1/2\\ years to set up the Web site. Millions \nof Americans will have 2 weeks to buy their insurance.\n  The President put Secretary Sebelius in charge of implementing this \nlaw. I have called on her to resign because this has hurt so many \nAmericans.\n  Before the Internet, RCA could tell us every day how many records \nElvis was selling. Ford could tell us every day how many cars they were \nselling. McDonald's would tell us every day how many hamburgers it \nsold. Congressman Issa has put on his committee's Web site notes from \nmeetings at an Obama administration war room where apparently they are \ntelling each other how many people are enrolling in health care.\n  I asked Ms. Tavenner this morning if she knew how many people are \nenrolling, how many have tried, what level of insurance they are \nbuying, and in what ZIP Code they live. Why don't you tell us? Why \ndon't you tell Congress? Why don't you tell the American people?\n  She said she would tell us by the end of the month--but we need to \nknow every day. We need to know every week at least. Governors need to \nknow. As they make decisions about expanding Medicaid, wouldn't it help \nto know how many of these new enrollees are going into Medicaid?\n  Members of Congress need to know. We have appropriated at least $400 \nmillion for this Web site that doesn't work. The American people need \nto know. They might gain confidence in the system if they could see \nthat every day more people were signing up for this or that.\n  I can't get over the fact that we are not being told how many are \nenrolled, how many trying, what kind of insurance they are buying, \nwhere they live. We have a right to know that.\n  Why doesn't the administration tell us that? One Senator has \ndescribed the new health care law as an approaching train wreck. I know \nsomething about trains.\n  My grandfather was a railroad engineer in Newton, KS, when I was a \nlittle boy. I was sure he was probably the most important person in the \nworld sitting in that big locomotive. His job was to drive a steam \nengine locomotive onto what they called a round table, turn the train \naround and head it in the right direction. That was the only way you \ncould turn something that big that fast.\n  That is what our country needs to do. We need to turn this train \naround. We need to turn this law around and head it in the right \ndirection.\n  ObamaCare is the wrong direction because it expands a health care \ndelivery system that we already knew cost too much.\n  What is the right direction? The right direction is more choices and \nmore competition that lowers costs so more Americans can afford to buy \ninsurance.\n  Don't expect Republicans to show up on this Senate floor with our \n3,000-page plan to move the health care delivery system in the way we \nthink it ought to go. We don't believe in that approach. We are policy \nskeptics, one might say. We don't believe these big comprehensive plans \nare wise enough to do what needs to be done. Instead, we believe we \nshould change our health care delivery system step-by-step.\n  I remember during the health care debate in 2010 I counted the number \nof times Republicans spoke on the floor about our step-by-step plan to \ntake the health care delivery system in a different direction--173 \ntimes just during 2010.\n  These are some of the steps we suggested and still do suggest that we \nshould take to turn the train around and head it in the right \ndirection:\n  Make Medicare solvent. The trustees have said that in 13 years it \nwill not have enough money to pay hospital bills. I know plenty of \nTennesseans who are counting on Medicare to pay their hospital bills.\n  Reform Traditional Medicare to compete on a level playing field with \nMedicare Advantage. That would provide competition and more choices for \nseniors. The Congressional Budget Office says it would save taxpayers \nmoney.\n  Make Medicaid flexible. When I was Governor of Tennessee in the \n1980s, Medicaid was 8 percent of the State budget. Today it is 26 \npercent. As a result, Democratic and Republican Governors of Tennessee \nhave been told by Washington to spend money on Medicaid that they \ninstead would rather spend on higher education.\n  Make Medicaid more flexible. Perhaps we can cover more people and set \nour own priorities.\n  Encourage employee wellness incentives. We talk a good game in the \nSenate about that, but the administration's regulation actually limits \nthe ability of employers to say to employees if you have a healthy \nlifestyle, your insurance will be cheaper. We should repeal that \nregulation and make it easier for employers to encourage that kind of \nbehavior, and offer cheaper insurance.\n\n  Allow small businesses to pool their resources and offer insurance \ntogether. We call that small business health plans.\n  All of these steps, by the way, are in legislative form. They are \nbills we have introduced. They are steps we could take today if we had \nenough votes to pass them, turning the train around and heading it in a \ndifferent direction.\n  Buy insurance across State lines. If Americans could look on the \nInternet and buy insurance across State lines that suited their needs, \nperhaps more Americans could afford insurance. Isn't that what we want \nto do? Change the 30-hour workweek to 40 hours. Both Democrats and \nRepublicans support this idea. I am not sure where it ever came from, \nbut it is one of the worst features of ObamaCare. It creates a big \nincentive to cause businesses to reduce the number of working hours \nfrom 40 to 30 so their employees will be part-time and the business \nwon't be affected by the ObamaCare rule. That creates consternation \nwithin business, and it doesn't create good relations between the \nemployer and the employee. Think about the employee. Think about the \npay cut from 40 hours to 30 hours. Think about the employee going out \nto find another part-time job at, say, another restaurant. Why not give \nthese employees a 33 percent pay increase? That would be a pretty good \nway to get up above the so-called minimum wage and give businesses a \nchance to have full-time employees again.\n  So these are all steps that would change the health care delivery \nsystem by changing its direction away from expanding a health care \nsystem that we know already costs too much and sending it in the \ndirection of choice and competition and finding ways to lower the cost \nof health care plans so more Americans can afford to buy insurance.\n  The 39-year-old Tennessee woman whom I talked about this morning to \nMs. Tavenner, the woman named Emilie who is losing insurance because \nObamaCare has decided that her plan isn't good enough for her, finished \nher story with these words:\n\n       This is one of the biggest betrayals our government has \n     ever been committed on its citizens. I beg of you to continue \n     to fight for those, like me, who would only ask to be allowed \n     to continue to have what we already enjoy. A fair health \n     insurance plan at a fair price. Please find a way to return \n     to affordable health care.\n\n  One good way to do that is to put the President's words into law: \n``If you like your health plan, you can keep it.'' Senator Johnson of \nWisconsin has offered that legislation. I have cosponsored it, as have \nothers.\n  My message to Emilie is that I am going to do my best to turn this \ntrain around and head our health care delivery system in the right \ndirection so that she can buy and keep health care insurance that she \ncan afford.\n  I thank the Chair, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, during this time of budget constraints, \nsequestration, and continuing resolutions, it is crucial that every \nFederal department and agency identify maximum cost savings and improve \nefficiencies to minimize the impact of reductions on critical programs \nand personnel. It is also the responsibility of Congress to encourage \ndepartments and agencies to consistently identify and implement such \nsavings and efficiencies.\n  We do not have the luxury of allowing the continuation of programs \nthat are no longer relevant, are redundant with other Federal programs, \ncan be done more cheaply, or that perpetuate past mistakes. \nUnfortunately it seems that the State Department and the U.S. Agency \nfor International Development are not able to identify some potential \nsavings. It takes outside watchdogs such as the inspectors general and \nthe Government Accountability Office to review and independently \nevaluate department or agency programs and operations.\n  As chairman of the appropriations subcommittee that funds the State \nDepartment and USAID, I and ranking member Lindsey Graham have taken \nsteps to avoid wasteful and unnecessary spending. We have reduced costs \nbased on inspector general findings, directed the State Department to \neliminate unnecessary overseas support staff and administrative \nexpenses, and directed the Department and USAID to improve financial \nand contract management. We will continue to look for opportunities to \nreduce waste, terminate programs that are poorly designed or not \nmeeting their goals, and save taxpayer dollars.\n  But this is not enough. The State Department, USAID, and other \nFederal agencies need to act proactively to identify efficiencies and \nreduce costs. Unfortunately, some of the inspector generals' findings \nare so obvious it is surprising, and troubling, that the State \nDepartment or USAID did not identify the savings on their own.\n  Here are just a few examples from fiscal year 2013 reports of the \nState Department and USAID inspectors general.\n  The State Department inspector general found that the Department has \na team based in Frankfurt, Germany, that travels to posts in the former \nYugoslavia and the countries of the former Soviet Union to train local \nstaff and provide administrative support to posts. This might have made \nsense in the early 1990s, but it makes no sense 24 years after the fall \nof the Iron Curtain.\n  The inspector general determined that 80 percent of the Regional \nInformation Management Center staff in Frankfurt does not need to be \nassigned overseas. Their work could be done in Washington, saving \nmillions of dollars each year. According to the inspector general, an \nemployee assigned overseas costs $232,000 more each year than an \nemployee based in the United States.\n  In Iraq, at one of our most oversized and expensive Embassies, the \ninspector general found that the Department hired and paid for 513 \nBaghdad security personnel when only 253 were actually used. The \nDepartment also paid $20.6 million for an unnecessary airport security \nprogram that added 84 personnel.\n  The inspector general found that the Department had 955 expired \ngrants with a total of $81.9 million in unspent funds. The inspector \ngeneral also found that the Department had not closed out 1,421 expired \ngrants each with a $0 balance, costing $97,069 each year in unnecessary \nadministrative fees.\n  The USAID inspector general found that USAID added five overseas food \nstorage warehouses but had not determined whether delivery times of \nfood prepositioned overseas justifies the additional cost when compared \nwith prepositioning food domestically. In fact, a cost-benefit analysis \nconducted in response to a 2007 Government Accountability Office \nrecommendation found that food prepositioned overseas is seven times \nmore costly than food prepositioned domestically and recommended that \nUSAID consider increasing the amount of domestic prepositioned food. \nUSAID has now agreed to compare the timeliness and cost of \nprepositioning food overseas versus domestically. We cannot afford to \nmake decisions that expand programs or increase costs without some \nevidence that there is a benefit worth the additional expense.\n  The USAID inspector general found that in a 3-month period, September \nthrough November 2012, USAID paid $64,000 for more than 300 mobile \ndevices that had not been used for at least 1 month during that time \nperiod and $48,000 for 267 devices that had not been used at all during \nthose 3 months, and an average of 127 employees had excessive user \ncharges of $118,000 which USAID could not verify had been reviewed and \naccepted. While these are relatively small amounts, they add up.\n  And the list goes on.\n  I know that the employees of the State Department and USAID are \ndedicated, hard-working people. Most Americans have little if any idea \nof what they do to protect the interests of the United States around \nthe world. But it is because their work is so important that we cannot \nafford to waste the money they need to do their jobs. Top officials at \nthe State Department and USAID must identify and eliminate outdated, \nredundant, and ineffective programs and unnecessary operating expenses. \nWe cannot wait for the inspectors general to do their job for them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/05/senate-section/article/S7826-2", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7826]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                CRIMINAL ANTITRUST ANTI-RETALIATION ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am pleased that the Senate passed \nyesterday bipartisan legislation that will improve the enforcement of \nthe antitrust laws. The bipartisan Criminal Antitrust Anti-Retaliation \nAct extends whistleblower protections to employees who report criminal \nviolations of the antitrust laws. These kinds of violations, which \ninclude price fixing, have a particularly pernicious impact on \nconsumers.\n  This legislation represents a continuation of my partnership with \nSenator Grassley on whistleblower issues. Senator Grassley has long \nbeen an advocate for protecting those who blow the whistle on wasteful \nor criminal conduct. Our bill is modeled on whistleblower protections \nthat he and I authored as part of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Criminal \nAntitrust Anti-Retaliation Act does not provide employees with an \neconomic incentive to report violations. The legislation simply makes \nwhole employees who have been fired or discriminated against for \nblowing the whistle on criminal conduct.\n  Whistleblower protection was recommended by the Government \nAccountability Office, GAO, in a 2011 report to Congress. The GAO \nsurveyed an array of stakeholders and found widespread support for the \nkind of basic protections contained in this legislation. The bill \nallows employees who have reported a criminal violation to file an \naction with the Department of Labor if they have been fired or \notherwise discriminated against for disclosing the violation. While the \nremedies provided by the bill are limited, they are crucial in \nprotecting employees from retaliation.\n  The antitrust laws exist to promote a free and open marketplace and \nserve to protect consumers. These laws can only be effective if they \nare vigorously enforced. The Criminal Antitrust Anti-Retaliation Act \nwill aid in enforcement efforts and ensure that consumers are protected \nfrom harmful activity. I urge the House to act quickly to pass this \nimportant bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/05/senate-section/article/S7826-3", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7826-S7827]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   75TH ANNIVERSARY OF KRISTALLNACHT\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I rise today to remember those who \nperished and suffered during Kristallnacht, the Night of Broken Glass, \n75 years ago on November 9 and 10 in Germany, German-occupied Austria, \nand German-occupied Czechoslovakia.\n  Earlier that year, in March 1938, Germany absorbed Austria--the so-\ncalled Anschluss. Then, at the September 1938 Munich conference, \nFrance, Britain, and Italy allowed Germany to annex the western rim of \nCzechoslovakia and to claim its 3 million Sudeten Germans as its own. \nIn both acts, the concept of loyalty to the state was equated with \nethnic identity.\n  Then, in October 1938, Germany expelled 17,000 Jews with Polish \ncitizenship from Germany into Poland. These families were arrested at \nnight, transported by train to the Polish border,\n\n[[Page S7827]]\n\nand effectively left in limbo, as Poland initially refused to accept \nthem. The son of two of these expellees, a Polish Jew in France, took \nrevenge: He assassinated a German diplomat in Paris.\n  Propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels subsequently asserted that \n``World Jewry'' was responsible for the assassination and gave the \nsignal for the start of the first large open pogrom in Germany: ``The \nFuhrer,'' he stated, ``has decided that . . . demonstrations should not \nbe prepared or organized by the Party, but insofar as they erupt \nspontaneously, they are not to be hampered.''\n  As described by the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum:\n\n       The rioters destroyed 267 synagogues throughout Germany, \n     Austria, and the Sudetenland. Many synagogues burned \n     throughout the night, in full view of the public and of local \n     firefighters, who had received orders to intervene only to \n     prevent flames from spreading to nearby buildings. SA and \n     Hitler Youth members across the country shattered the shop \n     windows of an estimated 7,500 Jewish-owned commercial \n     establishments, and looted their wares. Jewish cemeteries \n     became a particular object of desecration in many regions. \n     The pogrom proved especially destructive in Berlin and \n     Vienna, home to the two largest Jewish communities in the \n     German Reich. Mobs of SA men roamed the streets, attacking \n     Jews in their houses and forcing Jews they encountered to \n     perform acts of public humiliation. Although murder did not \n     figure in the central directives, Kristallnacht claimed the \n     lives of at least 91 Jews between the 9th and 10th of \n     November. Police records of the period document a high number \n     of rapes and of suicides in the aftermath of the violence.\n\n  Kristallnacht was thus a crucial turning point in the Holocaust--\nmoving from a policy of removing Jews from Germany and German occupied \nlands, to murdering them. It also stands as an enduring example of the \ndanger of associating citizenship with ethnicity, of tying loyalty to \nthe state with blood identity.\n  Kristallnacht is but one example of how hate can proliferate and \nerode our societies and why I have worked tirelessly to advance global \nefforts to ensure atrocities such as this never happen again. In my \ncapacity as a chair of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in \nEurope and decades-long work as a Member of Congress, I have advanced \nefforts to combat anti-Semitism and other forms of intolerance and \ndiscrimination in North America and Europe.\n  This work has ranged from commission hearings to raise awareness of \nthe continuing scourge of anti-Semitism to leading interparliamentary \nefforts to create personal representatives or high-level officials \nwithin the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to \ncombat Anti-Semitism and other forms of intolerance. Sadly, the \nelection of anti-Semitic political parties in Europe coupled with \nefforts to adopt circumcision, ritual slaughter, and other laws in \nEurope that would alter Jewish life and continuing incidents of anti-\nSemitic violence let us know that the work to eradicate anti-Semitism \nis not yet complete.\n  As we honor the 75th anniversary of Kristallnacht, I ask that you \njoin me in honoring the victims and families of that horrible tragedy \nand join me in fighting hate and bias in all its forms.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/05/senate-section/article/S7827-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7827]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado.

The 11 phenomenal \nstudent players from Westport, CT comprised the first team from \nConnecticut to reach the final rounds of the Little League World Series \nsince 1989.\n  The Westport Little League team came to the Little League World \nSeries as New England champions and played against the reigning \nNorthwest team from Washington State to make it to the finals. In this \nthrilling qualifier, Westport rallied from behind, winning 14 to 13 in \nthe seventh inning with a single to left field. This game was the \nfourth time in Little League World Series history where both teams \ncompleted 27 runs and the third time in history to score a collective \n30 hits.\n  Although these students from Westport did not win in the next few \nchampionship games, they never gave up. Even in their fight for third \nplace against a team from Tijuana, Mexico, they played their hardest to \nthe very end. Player Chad Knight hit two home runs and drove in seven \nmore, making a Little League Series world record of nine runs.\n  After their great success, Connecticut welcomed them home with a \nparade through the streets of Westport and an afternoon at the \nGovernor's mansion. The Westport Little League team was invited as a \nspecial guest of the Yankees and hosted by the Red Sox at Fenway Park.\n  I also wish to congratulate Tim Rogers, manager and head coach of the \nteam, assistant coaches Brett Reiner and Tom Whelan, and the parents \nand loved ones of these inspiring young players. I am incredibly proud \nof their success, representing Connecticut as role models for student \nathletes around the country. They worked together as a team to reach \nthe ultimate honor in youth baseball.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/05/senate-section/article/S7827-3", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7827-S7828]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EASTLAKE ALL-STARS\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I am pleased to congratulate the \n2013 Eastlake Little League All-Star team from Chula Vista, CA on \ncapturing the U.S. Championship at the 67th Little League World Series \nin Williamsport, PA. The determination, sportsmanship, and love of the \ngame exhibited by these young athletes inspired people in Chula Vista \nand throughout California.\n  Since its establishment almost 75 years ago, Little League Baseball \nhas grown from just three teams to become the world's largest youth \nsports program. This year's Little League World Series featured 8 \nregional champions from the United States and 8 international teams, \nrepresenting the millions of children in 79 countries on 6 continents \nwho take part in the great American pastime.\n  The Eastlake Little League All-Stars traveled a long road to \nWilliamsport. In order to qualify for the Little League World Series, \nthese extraordinary young players had to first defeat worthy opponents \nat the District 42 Championship in South Bay, the Section 7 \nChampionship in Spring Valley, the Sub-Division III Championship in \nCorona, and the Division III Championship in Long Beach, before \nsecuring the West Region Championship in San Bernardino with a 3-to-1 \ntournament record.\n  Representing the West at the World Series, the Eastlake All-Stars \nshowcased their talents with several impressive feats of athleticism. \nIn a tense game against the Great Lakes All-Stars, Eastlake's Grant \nHolman became the first pitcher since 1979 to throw an extra-inning no-\nhitter at the Little League World Series. Later, Eastlake routed the \nNew England All-Stars 12-to-l to take the U.S. Championship. Reaching \nthe World Series Championship game, Eastlake fought valiantly to take \nthe lead before falling 6-to-4 to the talented team from Tokyo, Japan.\n  In Chula Vista, the Eastlake All-Stars received a hero's welcome at a \ncommunity homecoming celebrating the new U.S. World Series Champions. \nIn the spirit of international goodwill and sportsmanship that \ncharacterizes the Little League World Series, the Eastlake players were \njoined in Chula Vista by the neighboring team from the Municipal de \nTijuana Little League of Tijuana, Mexico, who placed third in the World \nSeries.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing all the members of the \nEastlake Little League All-Star team on their extraordinary \nachievement: Micah Pietila-Wiggs, Ricky Tibbett, Rennard Williams, \nDominic Haley, Patrick Archer, Kevin Bateman II, Jake Espinoza, \nGiancarlo Cortez, Grant Holman, Charly Peterson, Michael Gaines, and \nNick Mora, along with the dedicated coaches, parents, and volunteers \nwho contributed to their success.\n\n[[Page S7828]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/05/senate-section/article/S7828-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7828]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO KEVIN P. McDERBY\n\n Mr. COONS. Madam President, I wish to honor the service, \ndedication, and passion of an individual whose name is synonymous with \nlaw enforcement in Delaware, New Castle police chief Kevin P. McDerby. \nAfter more than 40 years of service to the people of Delaware, Chief \nMcDerby embarked on a well-earned retirement at the end of last month. \nWhile known for his long and decorated career in law enforcement, Chief \nMcDerby's tenure will be most remembered for his work with veterans and \ncommunity groups, such as Delaware Concerns of Police Survivors, or \nC.O.P.S, and the Special Olympics Torch Run, as well as his efforts \nleading trips to the Nation's Capital to bring Delaware WWII and Korean \nveterans to visit national memorials and coordinating the establishment \nof the Delaware Law Enforcement Memorial on Legislative Mall in Dover.\n  Chief McDerby began his public safety career in Delaware on January \n12, 1971, when he joined the Delaware State Police as a trooper working \nin the Criminal Investigation and Tactical Support Units. He quickly \nclimbed the ranks, rising to sergeant in January 1979, to lieutenant \nand commander of Troop 6 in January 1986, to captain in February 1987, \nand finally to major in May 1989, where he took on the role of \noperations major for New Castle County.\n  Shortly after his retirement from the Delaware State Police in August \n2000, McDerby was appointed chief of the New Castle Police Department, \none of the oldest existing police departments in the Nation, \nestablished in 1672. As New Castle police chief, McDerby continued the \ndepartment's proud legacy of dedication to duty and service with honor, \nestablished by a long line of distinguished officers who have served \nthe department over five centuries.\n  Chief McDerby's dedication to service was a hallmark of his law \nenforcement career. A strong advocate for law enforcement families, he \nwas a founding member of Delaware C.O.P.S, an organization dedicated to \nproviding resources to assist surviving families of officers killed in \nthe line of duty.\n  In his 40-plus years of law enforcement service to the people of New \nCastle and Delaware, Chief McDerby leaves behind not just a policing \nlegacy but also an opportunity, a benchmark for his fellow officers to \nstrive to reach. To follow Chief McDerby's example is to be more than \njust the best police officer you can be; it is to be a leader and a \ntrue ambassador for the law enforcement community in Delaware. On \nbehalf of all Delawareans, I thank Chief McDerby for his tremendous \nservice and wish him well in his retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/05/senate-section/article/S7828-2", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7828]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING KATHY MULLEN\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nhonoring the memory of Kathleen Joy ``Kathy'' Mullen, a trailblazer in \nFresno's special abilities community who was beloved locally and \nbeyond. Ms. Mullen passed away on July 18 at the age of 52.\n  Kathy was born with Down syndrome, but she never allowed it or \nanything else to keep her from fully pursuing her dreams. From an early \nage, Kathy loved performing for others, whether she was shadowing her \nsister practicing a gymnastics routine or staging her own performances \nin the family backyard.\n  Kathy's love of athletics and performing drew her to competitive \nsports, where through focus and dedication, she made history as Fresno \nCounty's first Special Olympian. Kathy was a gifted athlete who broke \nrecords as the only Special Olympian to receive State, national and \nworld gold medals in four different sports--gymnastics, swimming, \nbowling, and ice skating.\n  In 1983, inspired by Kathy's accomplishments and passion for \nathletics, her family founded Break the Barriers, a Fresno-based \norganization that enables athletes of all ages and physical abilities \nto hone their skills, train together, and establish bonds of \nunderstanding and respect. Thirty years later, Break the Barriers \nprovides instruction and training to 3,000 people each year in a \n32,000-square-foot, state-of-the-art facility.\n  To those fortunate enough to have known her, Kathy Mullen will be \nfondly remembered not just for her gold medals, but also for her \ninfectious smile, character, resolve and remarkable ability to inspire \neveryone lucky enough to have known her.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Federal government is the largest consumer of \n     energy in the United States;\n       (2) Federal agencies are expected to meet, by law, \n     Executive order, and mandate, stringent energy efficiency and \n     conservation targets;\n       (3) the utility energy service contract (referred to in \n     this section as ``UESC'') was developed to provide Federal \n     agencies an effective means to implement energy efficiency, \n     renewable energy and water efficiency projects, and has been \n     used successfully to invest nearly $2,700,000,000 in property \n     at Federal facilities;\n       (4) the General Services Administration, which manages more \n     than 9,600 Federal properties and is the lead agency for \n     procuring utility services for the Federal government, has \n     determined that UESCs may extend beyond a 10-year period \n     under the law;\n       (5) the Federal Energy Management Program, which oversees \n     the UESC program and is a principal office guiding agencies \n     to use funding more effectively in meeting Federal and \n     agency-specific energy and resource management objectives, \n     has determined that UESCs may extend beyond a 10-year period \n     under the law;\n       (6) extensive precedent exists for Federal agencies to \n     contract for energy saving services using contracts with term \n     limits of more than 10 years but not to exceed 25 years;\n       (7) a number of Federal agencies, contrary to congressional \n     intent, have sought to limit UESC term limits to periods of \n     less than 10 years; and\n       (8) greater flexibility with UESCs will help reduce the \n     operational cost of Federal agencies, ultimately saving money \n     for taxpayers.\n\n     SEC. 3. UTILITY ENERGY SERVICE CONTRACTS.\n\n       Part 3 of title V of the National Energy Conservation \n     Policy Act is amended by adding after section 553 (42 U.S.C. \n     8259b) the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 554. UTILITY ENERGY SERVICE CONTRACTS.\n\n       ``(a) In General.--Each Federal agency may use, to the \n     maximum extent practicable, measures provided by law to meet \n     energy efficiency and conservation mandates and laws, \n     including through utility energy service contracts.\n       ``(b) Contract Period.--The term of a utility energy \n     service contract entered into by a Federal agency may have a \n     contract period that extends beyond 10 years, but not to \n     exceed 25 years.\n       ``(c) Requirements.--The conditions of a utility energy \n     service contract entered into by a Federal agency shall \n     include requirements for measurement, verification, and \n     performance assurances or guarantees of the savings.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself and Mr. Grassley)\n  S. 1654. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to deny \ntax deductions for corporate regulatory violations; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am introducing, along with Senator \nGrassley, the Government Settlement Transparency and Reform Act. This \nbill closes a loophole that allows corporations to reap tax benefits \nfrom payments made to the government stemming from settling corporate \nmisdeeds. So this bill aims to end the subsidization of illegal \ncorporate behavior by taxpayers.\n  Corporations accused of illegal activity routinely settle legal \ndisputes with the government out of court because it allows both the \ncompany and the government to avoid the time, expense, and uncertainty \nof going to trial. Under Federal law, money paid to settle corporate \ncivil or criminal penalties is not deductible. But under the tax code, \noffending companies may often write off any portion of a settlement \nthat is not paid directly to the government as a penalty or fine for \nviolation of the law. Corporations exploit this provision by later \ncharacterizing settlement penalties as restitution and a tax-deductible \nbusiness expense.\n  I think it is common sense that, for example, a corporation should \nnot agree to pay the government $500 million in criminal or civil fines \nand then when they file their taxes count those fines as a business \nexpense and take a tax windfall. Corporations that do this are \neffectively using taxpayer money to subsidize their illegal behavior. \nIn 2005, the Government Accountability Office found that of the 34 \ncompanies and $1 billion in settlements they examined, 20 companies \ntook a tax deduction for some or all of the money it paid to the \ngovernment. Those settlements were silent on whether that $1 billion to \nthe government counted as penalties or restitution. According to GAO, \nin 2 of those settlements, company representatives said they made a \nmistake in deducting civil penalty payments totaling $1.9 million and \nsaid they would amend their tax returns.\n  The Reed-Grassley bill would address these practices by amending \n162(f) of the tax code and requiring the government and the settling \nparty to reach pre-filing agreements on how the settlement payments \nshould be treated for tax purposes. The bill also clarifies the rules \nabout what settlement payments are punitive and therefore non-\ndeductible. Furthermore, it increases transparency by requiring the \ngovernment to file a return at the time of settlement to accurately \nreflect the tax treatment of the amounts that will be paid by the \noffending party.\n  Over a 10 year budget window, this legislation is estimated to raise \nbetween $200 to $300 million in revenue.\n  With this legislation we can close this tax loophole that flies in \nthe face of sensible and fair tax policy. The tax code should not be \nused to subsidize illegal activity by corporations--when a fine is \nlevied that fine should not be construed as a legitimate business \nexpense. Instead, it should be paid in full, with no tax deduction \ntaken.\n  I want to thank Senator Grassley for working with me on this \nlegislation. I would also thank Chairman Baucus who introduced similar \nlegislation in previous Congresses. They have long championed closing \nthis loophole. I urge our colleagues to join us by cosponsoring this \nlegislation and seeking its passage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/05/senate-section/article/S7831-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7831-S7832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 286--CONGRATULATING ORACLE TEAM USA FOR WINNING THE \n                           34TH AMERICA'S CUP\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Whitehouse, and Mrs. Boxer) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.
