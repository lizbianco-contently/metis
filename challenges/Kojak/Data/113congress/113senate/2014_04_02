I would object to any further proceedings to both of these \nmatters at this time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection having been heard, the \nmeasures will be placed on the calendar.\n\n\n                              House Budget\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in what has become an annual frustration for \nthe American people, the tea party-controlled House Budget Committee \nreleased its budget proposal yesterday. This budget is frustrating for \nAmericans because it doesn't reflect what they envision for this \nNation. In fact, the Ryan budget more closely resembles the wants of \nthe multibillionaire Koch brothers than it does a pattern for helping \nAmerica.\n  For those who haven't seen the prequels; that is, the newest budget \nproposal, it is the same old story, and it is a story of broken \npromises--of broken promises to our children, to our seniors, and to \nour families.\n  To our children we have promised we will protect and provide for \nthem, safeguarding them during the vulnerable years of childhood and \nadolescence--at least try to do everything we can to help them. Yet by \nrepealing the expansion of health care to millions of Americans by \ncutting Medicaid by $1.5 trillion, the Ryan-Koch budget tells our \nNation's children they are on their own.\n\n[[Page S2044]]\n\n  We must provide for our children by supplying the tools they need to \nsucceed--most importantly, a quality education. But evidently House \nRepublicans don't see the need for us to invest in education because \ntheir budget slashes tens of billions of dollars in funding for schools \nand rolls back Federal financial aid to college students.\n  The Koch-Ryan budget breaks the promise to seniors we have had in \nexistence since the Great Depression. It would be the end of Medicare \nas we know it. Health insurance premiums for seniors would skyrocket as \nwould their prescription costs.\n  Finally, a Ryan-Koch budget breaks a promise to every American family \nthat we in the Federal Government have given them; that by working hard \nand playing by the rules, they can get ahead. That isn't what the Ryan-\nKoch budget would allow.\n  What do the Republicans propose to do with this money they cut from \nMedicare, Medicaid, and education? They will create more tax breaks for \ncorporations and the wealthy, but it is more than that. It is some of \nthe things not written--these holes in the budget that we have heard \nbefore. We know they want to whack Social Security. They are just \nafraid to put it in writing. The Koch budget would cut the corporate \ntax rate to 25 percent and lower the top individual tax rate for \nAmerica's highest earners.\n  I guess what I would say to the House Budget Committee and all the \nHouse Members--Democrats and Republicans--isn't $80 billion personal \nwealth of the Koch brothers enough? I think most everyone would say, \nyes, it is enough, but not the Koch brothers. They want more. They are \nthe richest people in the world. Individually they are only fifth, but \nput them together and they are the richest in the world.\n  Under this budget I have talked about, middle-class families would \npay about $2,000 a year more in taxes, but the rich would pay less. \nDemocrats believe in growing the economy from the middle out, but the \nRepublicans are still trapped in the trickle-down economics based on \nhandouts to the superwealthy and special interests.\n  Perhaps the Ryan-Koch budget is summarized best by the Center on \nBudget and Policy Priorities' Robert Greenstein: ``More poverty and \nless opportunity.'' That is what their budget is all about: more \npoverty, less opportunity.\n  So whether it is current law such as the Affordable Care Act or much \nneeded legislation such as comprehensive immigration reform or an \noverhaul of the tax system, I ask my Republican colleagues to work with \nus for a better America.\n\n\n                  Recognition of the Republican Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                       Delivering Real Prosperity\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Democratic majority led us to \nbelieve the Senate would be discussing jobs this week, but it seemed to \nbe a pretty one-sided discussion.\n  Republican Senators came to the floor to talk about our innovative \nideas to create jobs and grow opportunity for all Americans. As for \nSenate Democrats though--well, they wouldn't even stand to call for \nvotes on the jobs proposals.\n  I think this reflects a growing divide in the Senate between a \nRepublican Party focused on the middle class and a Democratic Party \nthat is obsessed with November 4.\n  That is very disappointing for America. The American people need two \nserious political parties in this country. But at least our \nconstituents can be assured of one thing: Republicans are laser-focused \non delivering real prosperity to the families who have struggled so \nmuch in this economy. It is the impetus behind basically everything we \ndo, and it is the impetus behind the numerous jobs proposals Republican \nSenators are rolling out this week.\n  For instance, several Republican Senators will take to the floor \nagain today to talk about energy's potential for driving growth and \nAmerican job creation and why the government needs to stop holding \nAmericans back from sharing in the energy boom. I also plan to join and \ndiscuss my own amendment that would fight back against the President's \nwar on coal jobs. I am looking forward to that colloquy.\n\n  But right now I wish to talk about another jobs proposal Senator Paul \nand I have again introduced: national right-to-work legislation. It \nwould allow American workers to choose whether they would like to join \na union, and it would protect the worker from getting fired if she \nwould rather not subsidize a union boss who fails to represent her \nconcerns and priorities. It is such a commonsense proworker proposal. \nAccording to one survey, about 80 percent of union workers agree that \nemployees should be able to decide whether joining a union is right for \nthem. One obvious benefit is increased take-home pay for workers who \nchoose to keep the hundreds of dollars that would otherwise be taken \nfrom their paychecks by union bosses. There is a huge opportunity \ncomponent here as well, because most unions operate on a seniority \nsystem with pay raises often based off the amount of time the worker \nhas spent at a company rather than on her performance. Well, I think an \nAmerican worker deserves an opportunity to earn more money if she works \nhard. I think she deserves the opportunity to rise through the ranks \nand put more money in her pocket if she is determined to do it. That is \nreal paycheck fairness.\n  These are bedrock American values--core workers rights that should \nnever be denied to our constituents, especially in a terrible economy \nsuch as this one. Many of Kentucky's neighboring States have gone \nright-to-work with great success, and I hope Kentucky will join them \nsoon. I recently read an op-ed that laid out how much we could have \ngained over the last decade if we had. It noted that private sector \njobs have grown about 15.3 percent in right-to-work States compared to \njust 6.9 percent in Kentucky; manufacturing had expanded three times \nfaster in right-to-work States and compensation had grown about 14.2 \npercent compared to just 4.3 percent in Kentucky.\n  So I am encouraged by the members of Kentucky's legislature who \ncontinue to fight for right-to-work legislation. Kentuckians shouldn't \nbe subjected to that kind of prosperity gap any longer, and neither \nshould millions of other Americans struggling across our country. I \nbelieve they should have a more equal chance of finding work in every \nState, and they should no longer see their communities failing to \nsecure new investment because their State hasn't passed right-to-work. \nThat is just one more reason why I believe in our national legislation \ntoo.\n  So I am asking our Democratic friends to join Senator Paul and me in \nstanding up for workers rights and a stronger middle class to join us \nin passing right-to-work legislation.\n  Let's be honest. After more than 5 years of economic misery under \ntheir watch, that is the least Washington Democrats can do for the \nAmerican people. Unfortunately, I suspect we will hear a lot of excuses \ninstead about why Washington Democrats cannot or won't stand with us in \nthis fight. No matter what they say, though, the American people will \nknow the truth: It is because big labor bosses have such sway over \ntoday's Democratic Party and because big labor bosses aren't about to \ngive up their perks or their vise grip over American workers.\n  Well, big labor bosses should know that Republicans are determined to \nfight for American workers, American jobs, and a stronger middle class, \neven if the bosses work against us every step of the way. Right-to-work \nis a smart way to get America on the path to real recovery, and it is \ncritical to empowering workers and giving them more freedom.\n  I commend Senator Paul for his leadership on this legislation and for \nhis long-time advocacy on this issue. I hope our colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle will prove me wrong by working together to pass \nimportant job initiatives such as right-to-work for the American \npeople.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 10 a.m. will be equally divided and controlled between the two \nleaders or their designees.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I rise to discuss and present amendment No. 2931 to the bill before \nus. This is a germane amendment. It is all about the substance of the \nbill before us and it is a fully bipartisan proposal, since all of the \nsubstance of this amendment was actually contained in the President's \nmost recent budget submission.\n  The amendment idea is very simple: It would prohibit unemployment \ninsurance and disability double-dipping. Those are two different \nthings. One is about somebody who is temporarily unable to find work, \nstill looking for work, clearly able to work. That is unemployment \ninsurance. Disability is fundamentally different, somebody who is \ndisabled and because of that disability cannot work on a long-term \nbasis.\n  So, as President Obama has proposed, as many Republicans have \nproposed, this would simply prohibit an individual from receiving both \nof those benefits at the same time, and would save about $1 billion \nover 10 years. That is President Obama's own estimation.\n  To fully present and consider this, I would ask unanimous consent \nthat it be in order for me to offer my amendment No. 2931.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, we have had \nmillions of people over the last many months who have lost their \nunemployment benefits. In most instances it is real tragic. Many of the \npeople who lost these benefits are past middle age. Because of the \nrecession they lost their jobs they had for a long time and they cannot \nfind work.\n  We have read into the Record the tragic stories about people using \ntheir Social Security to try to save their son's home. We have the \nwoman who is couch surfing. She said, ``I didn't know what the term \nmeant. Now I know.'' They have had to struggle without extended \nunemployment benefits.\n  The senior Senator from Rhode Island has negotiated a bipartisan fix \nto this. It has basically given the Republicans everything they asked \nfor. Everything is paid for. There is no disagreement as to the pay-\nfors. It hasn't increased the deficit at all. In fact, it would \nstimulate the economy significantly.\n  We have been told by economist Mark Zandi, John McCain's chief \neconomic advisor when he ran for President, we have been told by him \nand others that unemployment benefits stimulate the economy quicker and \nfaster and more efficiently than any other thing we do, because they \nare desperate for money and they spend it.\n  But in spite of the bipartisan agreement negotiated with Senator Jack \nReed, Senator Heller from Nevada and other Republicans, we have the \nvast majority of Republican Senators doing the same thing they have \ndone for a long time. They respond in their usual way. When they face a \nbill they are trying to kill, they try to change the subject--\ndiversion.\n  Now already on this piece of legislation before the Senate today we \nhave more than 24 amendments that have been filed by Republicans \ndealing with ObamaCare alone, in spite of the fact--in spite of the \nfact--that yesterday it was announced that there are 7.1 million people \nwho have already signed up. That doesn't count the 14 State exchanges \nthat will get another 900,000, it is estimated, plus the 2-week \nextension in which hundreds of thousands more will sign up.\n  They are tone deaf. They have got to go to some other issue. But they \ncannot. There are more than two dozen amendments on this bill alone \ndealing with ObamaCare, repealing it in different ways.\n  Several other amendments have been singled out that we have before \nthe body to attack the administration's efforts to protect the \nenvironment. The protests of Republican Senators to the contrary \nnotwithstanding, these amendments show that the other side of the aisle \nis not serious about unemployment insurance benefits. They are more \nconcerned about protecting the Koch brothers. This is the behavior of \nSenators who want to kill something, who want to kick up enough dust so \nthey don't get blamed for what they are trying to do. What are they \ntrying to do? Kill extended unemployment benefits.\n  So I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I am going to repeat my request, because \napparently the majority leader, based on his comments, didn't \nunderstand it.\n  I have an amendment that is about unemployment insurance. I have an \namendment that is germane to the bill. It is not about ObamaCare, not \nabout EPA, not about the Koch brothers. I have an amendment that is a \nproposal contained in President Obama's last two budgets. My amendment \nhas nothing to do with any of the comments and objections he makes. For \nthat reason I am trying to clarify that, and I would again ask \nunanimous consent that my germane amendment proposed by President Obama \nin his last two budgets be in order, and it be in order for me to offer \nmy amendment No. 2931.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I clearly understood the \ndiversion-and-delay tactics of my friend from Louisiana, and I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. VITTER. Well, Mr. President, reclaiming the floor, I think it is \nvery unfortunate. I don't know why it is diversionary to talk about the \nsubstance that is before us in this bill. That is not changing the \nsubject, I would say through the Chair to the majority leader; that is \ntalking about the subject. I don't know why it is delaying anything to \nconsider an amendment during the time set aside for this bill. That is \nnot delaying anything. That is doing the business of the Senate by \nbringing valid ideas to the floor and offering them as an amendment, \nand I don't know why it is Republican obstructionism to have an \namendment that is a proposal contained in President Obama's last two \nbudgets.\n  So again, I would make the point that everything the majority leader \nsaid in objecting to my being even able to present my amendment for a \nvote doesn't apply to my amendment. It is complete nonsense. It is just \ntalking past the substance of this amendment which is about \nunemployment insurance reform and which is a bipartisan proposal and \nwhich is included in the President's last two budgets.\n  This is an important and commonsense reform. It is common sense \nbecause eligibility for the two programs we are talking about is \nmutually exclusive. It is apples and oranges. Disability is designed to \nassist folks who are physically or mentally unable to work for a \nsignificant period of time, sometimes permanently. Unemployment \ninsurance, in contrast, is intended to replace some of the earnings for \nthose individuals who become unemployed and are unable to find work \ntemporarily.\n  It is an oversight, a technical imperfection in the law, the fact \nthat some limited number of folks can double-dip and get both at the \nsame time. This is widely recognized on a bipartisan basis.\n\n[[Page S2046]]\n\nOn the Republican side, of course, I have this amendment. Senator \nCoburn, my colleague from Oklahoma, has had similar proposals. Senator \nPortman, my colleague from Ohio, has had similar proposals.\n  On the Democratic side, there is no higher ranking Democrat I can \npossibly cite than President Obama. The President has included this \nreform--exactly this reform--in his last two budget proposals. I have \nnever heard any articulation from any Democrat or any Member of the \nSenate why this reform doesn't make sense.\n  The majority leader, while objecting to my even being able to present \nthis amendment for a vote, offered no such rationale. He talked past \nit. He talked about the Koch brothers and he talked about EPA and he \ntalked about ObamaCare, instead of talking about my germane, \ncommonsense bipartisan reform amendment to this bill, which has been \nincluded--this proposal--in President Obama's last two budgets.\n  So I find this very unfortunate, but I am going to continue to fight \nfor a vote on this amendment. It will improve the bill, whatever you \nthink about the bill. This will improve it. This will save $1 billion \nover 10 years. This will clear up the double dipping which was never \nintended and contrary to the fundamental different purposes of the last \nof the two programs, and this will advance a proposal that has been \nincluded in President Obama's last two budgets.\n\n  With that, I will return to promote this amendment, but for now I \nyield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n10 minutes as if in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, it has been more than 3 months since 2 \nmillion Americans and nearly 60,000 people in my home State of Ohio and \ntens of thousands of people in the Presiding Officer's State of \nMassachusetts--overwhelmingly most of whom have worked day in and day \nout for most of their lives--have had their unemployment benefits \nexpire simply because the House of Representatives and the Senate have \nfailed to act.\n  This body has tried to act a number of times and a number of times it \nhas been filibustered. We could not get 60 votes to move forward. The \nHouse of Representatives has seemed, frankly, indifferent to these 2 \nmillion people.\n  Think about who these people are. This is about unemployment \ninsurance. It is called insurance for a reason. Insurance means they \npay in when they are working, they get benefits when they are laid off, \nbut they must be seeking work to qualify and earn--and I underscore \nearn--those benefits. They are not given those benefits. They have \nearned them. They have paid into the unemployment insurance program and \nthey get assistance when they lose their jobs.\n  Every day and week we fail in this Congress because of Republican \nfilibusters and cold indifference in the House of Representatives to \nextend these benefits, more Americans slip into poverty. People are not \ngetting rich from unemployment insurance. The average unemployment \ncheck in Massachusetts and Ohio and across this country is about $300, \nwhich helps to keep their head above water, avoid foreclosure, put gas \nin their car, look for work--as they are required to do so they can \nreceive unemployment--and just keep their family going and reduce \npoverty.\n  When they don't get unemployment benefits, they are not spending that \nmoney in their community. When they do get these benefits, they are \nspending money at the local grocery store in Chillicothe, they are \ngoing to the local shoe store in Portsmouth or Gallipolis, they are \ngoing to the car repair shop in Toledo or Lima. They are putting money \nin the economy which generates economic activity which grows jobs.\n  Extending unemployment is not just right for families in Dayton, \nAkron, Springfield, OH, and Springfield, MA, it is right for the \neconomy because it puts money into the economy and helps to create \njobs.\n  Forget about the statistics. Forget about the numbers--60,000 people \nin Ohio and 2 million people across the country--and instead listen to \nwhat this does for individual lives. I have three or four stories from \npeople around my State. Lori from Montgomery County, which is in \nsouthwest Ohio and the Dayton area, writes:\n\n       I have worked my entire life, until I lost my job last \n     summer. I now spend 4-5 hours a day looking for jobs, but the \n     positions in my field are limited.\n       I'm told I'm either over or under qualified.\n       My unemployment benefits aren't much, but it's enough to \n     keep a roof over my head, and allow me to make car payments, \n     so that when I did get a job interview, I have a car to get \n     me there. Please don't let me down.\n\n  Robert from Belmont County, which is on the West Virginia line near \nthe Ohio River in eastern Ohio, writes:\n\n       I lost my job in 2012 when my employer, a steel mill, shut \n     down. I was unemployed for more than a year before finding \n     another position.\n       I was there for two and a half months before being let go \n     due to the down economy--not enough time for a new claim to \n     get me by.\n       I have a family to support and now that the extension is \n     gone, what am I to do until I find a good job to support my \n     family? Do the right thing. Many lives are depending on it.\n\n  The first person said, ``Please don't let me down,'' and the second \nperson from Belmont County said, ``Do the right thing.''\n  Scott from Union County, which is in central Ohio where they are \ndoing a little better overall but still going through tough times, \nwrites:\n\n       I was laid off from my job at the beginning of this year. I \n     had only been there for six months, and it was a godsend for \n     me.\n       I don't have a college degree, but I was given a chance to \n     show I could do this job, even though a degree was required.\n       We went through a round of layoffs in October. My job was \n     saved at the time, but then our company closed its doors in \n     January.\n       Now I have nothing.\n       Zero income. Zero outside help, and a non-existing \n     savings--not because I didn't save, but because I didn't make \n     enough money to save anything the last few years.\n       I joined the military out of high school, and used my GI \n     Bill to put myself through some college. But soon enough, I \n     was just in a mountain of debt from school, and needed to \n     work full-time.\n       I wasn't able to save money because I couldn't afford to \n     pay my student loan debt.\n       While I'm writing you, I'm sitting here watching my son \n     play, and he is so happy. But he doesn't know why his dad is \n     so sad--nor should he ever.\n       I am begging you to get this figured out soon.\n\n  These are veterans and people who have struggled and worked all their \nlives. They are people who have never had it easy, but they do what is \nasked of them. As President Clinton used to say, they play by the \nrules. They take personal responsibility for their lives.\n  The Senate, because of the filibuster, has turned its back on these \nworkers. The House of Representatives, because of its indifference, has \nshrugged these workers off. It is wrong. It is important that this \nCongress--the House and the Senate--pass the extension of unemployment. \nThe President eagerly awaits signing this legislation because it will \nmatter to workers in Middletown, Ravenna, Mansfield, and Shelby, OH. \nThis legislation is important not only to my State but all over this \ncountry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I applaud my colleague from Ohio for his \nstories from his home State on the families who have been dramatically \nimpacted by the broken bridge between a lost job and the next job. \nIndeed, in my home State there are about 26,000 folks who are affected \nin this manner. We can think of it as the space between two jobs, as a \nchasm--a chasm that threatens the success of every family. They are \nhoping to make their payment on their light bill. They are hoping to \nmake their rent payment or their mortgage payment. But they have to \nmake it to that next job, and savings run thin, particularly when \nsavings are very hard to come by when our economy is generating fewer \nand fewer living-wage jobs.\n\n  In the last recession of 2008, 60 percent of the jobs lost were \nliving-wage jobs. But of the jobs we are getting\n\n[[Page S2047]]\n\nback, only 40 percent are living-wage jobs. Indeed, that means millions \nof families have gone from a strong foundation--the ability to raise \nchildren, to buy a modest home, perhaps take an annual vacation, \nperhaps to save a little bit of money to help send their kids to \ncollege--to struggling and chasing minimum wage or near minimum wage \njobs, part-time jobs, and jobs that often have no benefits. All of \nthose wrestling with this situation aren't going to have a big pile of \nsavings to get from one position to the next.\n  That is why, during periods of high unemployment, we have created a \nlonger unemployment insurance bridge to get them successfully to that \nnext job. When people fall into the chasm between one job and the next, \nit is not just the family that is hurt; it is not just the worker who \nis hurt. Our entire society is impacted. It is impacted in several \nways. First we have the situation where people go through foreclosure, \nand that is devastating to the family, devastating to the children, and \ncertainly it also impacts the value of every home on the street. We \nhave the situation of families who lose their home, who lose their \nrental home and become homeless. It isn't just the parents who are \nimpacted. The children are deeply impacted, and they go through a \ntraumatic event. That is certainly a terrible situation to endure and \nmal effects throughout. Indeed, of those 26,000 families in Oregon, \nright now there is a couple sitting at their kitchen table trying to \nfigure out just how many meals they are going to skip in order to make \ntheir next rent payment, or they are struggling with how long they can \ndefer a health care bill while they make their mortgage payment. These \nare tough decisions.\n  This is why we developed a bipartisan agreement under President Bush \nthat during periods of high unemployment, we would have a longer bridge \nto the next job. The logic is very simple. The logic is that during \nperiods of high unemployment, the average time between jobs is longer \nand the chasm is wider, so people need a longer bridge to get there. \nThis is a program that automatically pulls itself back in, retires \nitself, as the unemployment rate drops. As the unemployment rate drops, \nthe number of extra weeks become fewer and fewer. That is why there is \nso much logic behind it. That is why there was no partisan divide.\n  Today we are going to vote, again, on whether to keep this logical, \nbipartisan, self-retiring, critical bridge in place, and I hope we have \na broad bipartisan vote to support it. Then we need to say to the House \nof Representatives: This is not another bill we can lock in the \nbasement and throw away the key. This is a fundamental piece of \nlegislation that affects the welfare of our families, the health of our \neconomy, the strength of our communities, and it merits a vote on the \nfloor of the House of Representatives. It is certainly a reasonable \nexpectation that everyone in America should see where their Congressman \nor their Congresswoman stands on such a vital economic strategy for \nindividual families and for the broader community.\n  So let us not disappoint those 26,000 families in Oregon. Let us not \ndisappoint those 1.7 million families across America that have counted \non problem-solving common sense rather than partisan warfare to address \nthis issue.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn \nhaving voted in the affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  Cloture having been invoked on amendment No. 2874, the motion to \ncommit falls as being inconsistent with cloture.\n  The Chair further announces that amendment Nos. 2878, 2877, and 2876 \nalso fall as they were not in order to be offered and their pendency is \ninconsistent with the Senate's precedents with respect to the offering \nof amendments, their number, degree, and kind.\n  The Republican whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Before we can have a real debate on how to fix the U.S. \neconomy, which is experiencing the slowest recovery following a \nrecession of any time since World War II, we have to agree on what the \nproblem is and what we are actually trying to solve.\n  On this side of the aisle, we believe the problem is a shortage of \nfull-time jobs, and we believe our main economic priority should be to \nfacilitate or to create circumstances under which the private sector \ncan create more full-time jobs. That is why we have offered a series of \namendments to the pending legislation that would help do that. It would \nhelp grow the economy and help get people back to work--not just pay \npeople who are, unfortunately, unemployed but actually help create jobs \nso they can find work and help provide for their families, which is \nwhat the vast majority of people want to do.\n  Currently, we have pending about 70 different amendments from this \nside of the aisle that would actually improve the underlying \nlegislation. Among\n\n[[Page S2048]]\n\nother things, our amendments would repeal job-killing taxes, improve \ncongressional safeguards against overregulation, and restore the \ntraditional 40-hour workweek, which is a particular subject of concern \nto organized labor, which recently sent a letter to the White House and \nsaid that ObamaCare was incentivizing employers to take full-time work \nand make it part-time work. They called it a nightmare.\n  We also need to modernize our work-training programs. I have traveled \nto a number of locations in Texas, for example, where, as a result of \nthe shale gas renaissance, we have had a number of manufacturing \ncompanies move back onshore because of this inexpensive energy supply, \ncreating thousands of new jobs, and there are thousands more to come.\n  Thank goodness our community colleges are working with industry in \nthese areas because what we find is that when people graduate from high \nschool or maybe even college, they don't necessarily have the skills to \nqualify for these good, high-paying jobs. If there is one aspect we \nought to all be able to agree on, it is that we need to modernize our \nwork-training programs so that we can help people gain those skills so \nthey can earn a good income as a result.\n  We also need to expedite natural gas exports, and that is not only \nfor economic reasons and job-creating reasons at home. We have seen \nRussia using natural gas--and the stranglehold it has on Ukraine--as a \nweapon. One of the things we can do to help the people of Ukraine and \nto help our allies in Europe is to provide a long-term source of energy \nthrough another route other than through Russian pipelines.\n\n  We also should approve the Keystone XL Pipeline, which will complete \nthis pipeline from Canada all the way across the United States. The \nterminus would be in southeast Texas, where that oil would be refined \ninto gasoline and jet fuel and create a lot of jobs in the process. \nThen we need to consider proposals that would incentivize American \nbusinesses, small and large, to hire veterans.\n  I have been discussing these amendments all week, and I have been \ncalling on the majority leader to allow these amendments to come to the \nfloor and to provide an opportunity for a vote. As I said, there are \nnow currently more than 70 different amendments and ideas that have \nbeen filed that are just waiting on the majority leader, who is the one \nwho basically has complete discretion over whether or not those votes \nwill actually occur. We have been imploring him to allow a vote on \nthese amendments, but it appears--and I don't know if there is really \nany other conclusion you can draw--the majority leader has a different \npriority. His top priority, it appears, is for show votes on bills that \neither aren't going to go anywhere, because they are not going to be \ntaken up by the House of Representatives, or that really treat the \nsymptom rather than solve the underlying problem.\n  As we read in the New York Times and elsewhere, it is the intention \nof the majority leader and the Democratic leadership in the Senate to \nschedule a series of show votes that basically are designed to change \nthe subject from the failed policies of this administration--notably \nObamaCare. Of course, one of those is going to be to make it easier for \nthe trial bar to file class action lawsuits when it comes to gender pay \ndisparity, something that is already against the law. The majority \nleader and his allies are going to lift the cap on damages and subject \nsmall and large businesses alike to class action lawsuits.\n  You don't have to take my word for it. All you have to do is read the \nNew York Times. Here is what they reported last week:\n\n       The proposals have little chance of passing. But Democrats \n     concede that making new laws is not really the point. Rather, \n     they are trying to force Republicans to vote against them.\n\n  For that matter, the majority leader himself has acknowledged that \nthese ideas were developed in collaboration with the Democratic \nSenatorial Campaign Committee, the political arm of our Democrat \nfriends in the Senate.\n  So it is pretty clear what is happening here. This is not a majority \nleader--or a majority, for that matter--in search of solutions to the \nproblems that plague our country, particularly slow economic growth and \nhigh joblessness, and the highest percentage of people who have dropped \nout of the workforce since World War II. This has nothing to do with \nhelping the American people. What it does have to do with is making \nproposals that would actually make the economy worse.\n  For example, the Congressional Budget Office said the proposed \nminimum wage increase--a 40-percent increase in the minimum wage--would \nlikely destroy \\1/2\\ million to 1 million jobs because the money has to \ncome from somewhere. Small businesses, if they are going to be forced \nto pay 40 percent more for their workforce, are going to have to cut \nsomewhere else, and what they are going to cut is jobs.\n  Needless to say, notwithstanding the fact that we are seeing the \nmajority leader and the majority party engaged in pure political \nposturing, what they are actually proposing is going to make things \nworse, not better.\n  There is also the so-called Paycheck Fairness Act, which really \nshould be called the ``Trial Lawyers Bonanza'' bill. This is nothing \nmore than a gift to the trial bar. As I said earlier, gender-based pay \ndiscrimination was outlawed a half century ago. It is illegal already. \nPresident Obama, more recently, signed something called the Lilly \nLedbetter Fair Pay Act just a few days after taking office in January \nof 2009. Here is what he said at that time. In 2009, he said that the \nLedbetter act ``ensures equal pay for equal work.''\n  If that is true--and I believe it is--then why offer this additional \nlegislation, unless it is purely a political exercise designed to \nposture and perhaps distract people from the things they are upset \nabout, such as ObamaCare, leading into the midterm elections. We are \nnow being told that unless we pass the so-called Paycheck Fairness Act, \nor the ``Trial Lawyer Giveaway,'' employers will be able to \ndiscriminate against women. Well, that is nonsense. That is not true. I \ndon't know how you can say it any more strongly other than to call it \nthe lie that it is.\n  Even before the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act equal pay for equal work \nhas been the law of the land since the 1960s. As the Wall Street \nJournal once observed, the Paycheck Fairness Act should really be \ncalled the ``Trial Lawyer Paycheck Act'' because that is who would \nbenefit from this bill were it to become the law of the land.\n  Of course, as I mentioned a moment ago, the majority leader doesn't \nreally expect this to pass. It is part of this false narrative we have \nheard before, and we are going to hear it again, that somehow this is \nreally about fairness and gender discrimination, when it is about \nnothing of the kind. It is solely about politics. It really is a \ncynical attempt to distract people from what are the most important \nthings we could do as a Senate, which is, again, to create \ncircumstances under which the economy would grow and jobs would be \ncreated by the private sector so people could find work and they could \nprovide for their families. That is what we ought to be doing.\n  Our Democratic friends claim this political agenda they announced \nlast week, in conjunction with the Democratic Senatorial Campaign \nCommittee, is all about giving Americans a fair shot. Yet the majority \nleader is refusing to give them a fair shot at finding a full-time job, \nand he is refusing to give my constituents in Texas--26 million of \nthem--an opportunity to get some of their ideas heard and voted on on \nthe Senate Floor.\n  As I said once, and I will say it again, there are more than 70 \ndifferent amendments that have been filed to this underlying \nlegislation that would actually provide a solution rather than a \npolitical stunt which will do nothing to solve the underlying problem. \nThe purpose of these amendments is to help millions of people who \nremain unemployed or underemployed, including the 3.8 million Americans \nwho have been unemployed for more than 6 months--3.8 million Americans \nout of work for more than 6 months.\n  This legislation does nothing to help those people, other than \nperhaps to help pay them for a period of time they are continuing \nunsuccessfully to find work. There are also 7.2 million Americans who \nare working part-time who would like to work full time.\n  If the majority leader wants to argue our amendments are a bad idea, \nlet him do it. We will have that debate on the\n\n[[Page S2049]]\n\nmerits. If he wants to promote alternative options for growing the \neconomy and creating jobs, we will be happy to consider those and \nperhaps even agree with him on some of them. But to simply refuse to \nallow a vote on these 70-some-odd amendments is a profound insult, not \nto us but to our constituents and the millions of Americans who \ncontinue to suffer through the longest period of high unemployment \nsince the Great Depression.\n  We can do better. We need to do better. The American people deserve \nbetter than this cheap political stunt.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, we have before us a bipartisan piece of \nlegislation designed to provide very limited assistance to millions of \nAmericans who have lost their unemployment compensation benefits. On \nDecember 28, the long-term unemployment insurance benefits terminated. \nAt that point it was 1.3 million Americans; today it is 2.3 million \nAmericans, and it is growing.\n  Since December 28, we have, on a bipartisan basis, been endeavoring \nto bring to this floor for a final vote a 5-month extension, some of \nwhich--in fact, with each passing day more of which--is retroactive \nrather than prospective. This bill is designed to help people.\n  In fact, this bill will provide them the benefits they were receiving \nbased upon their work record because the only way you can receive \nunemployment insurance benefits is to lose a job through no fault of \nyour own and continue to search for a job.\n  These are working Americans. The benefits we are talking about are \nroughly $300 a week. What does that do? For some people it helps them \nkeep their home. It pays the rent. For some others it provides food for \ntheir families. For others it provides them the ability to have a cell \nphone that is plugged in, literally, because they need one when they \nget, they hope, the offer for a job interview or for a job. So contrary \nto doing nothing to help Americans, this does a great deal for people \nwho have earned these benefits through their toil and effort and their \ncontinued efforts to look for jobs.\n  We have an obligation, a great obligation to increase the growth in \nthis country, and to do it in a way that will allow people to find \njobs. In my home State of Rhode Island, there are at least two \napplicants for every job--in many cases, three applicants. There is a \ndisconnect in many cases between the skills they have had over decades \nof work and the skills that employers are looking for today. And we \nhave to address that.\n  But, to prevent this legislation from going through is to deny \nmillions of working Americans the support they need to get through a \nvery difficult period. That is why, on a bipartisan basis, we have come \ntogether. We have 5 months fully paid for. This is a fiscally sound \npiece of legislation which benefits men and women across this country \nbased upon their work record. I don't think there is a more important \nthing we can do at this moment, and to delay it would be a disservice \nto the people.\n  I think something else is important too. When we talk about economic \ngrowth, let us recognize this legislation will help growth in the \nUnited States. There have been estimates if we had a full-year \nextension of the unemployment insurance program it would generate \n200,000 jobs. Those are significant numbers. That is roughly about 1 \nmonth's job growth over the last several years. If we don't do this, \nthen we won't get that growth.\n  So not only is this a fundamentally sound, fair, and thoughtful thing \nto do for millions of American families, it is also good for our \neconomy. It does provide the growth my colleagues are talking about \nwhen they say we have to grow this economy.\n  There is much more that we could do. Many of my Republican \ncolleagues, who have come to provide their insights and support, have \nsuggested longer term ways in which we could deal with the unemployment \ncrisis--better training programs, et cetera. Indeed, we have a \nbipartisan Workforce Investment Act reauthorization that is in the HELP \nCommittee that I hope we can get to the floor quickly because we have \nto reform our overall job training program in this country. As I go out \nand talk to businessmen and women in Rhode Island, they say there is a \ndisconnect between the skill set many people have and the skills they \nneed for their workplace.\n  There is another aspect of this situation. The long-term unemployed \nnumbers in this country today are twice as high as they are typically \nwhen we have ended unemployment benefits previously. We have a \nsignificant problem and a growing problem of the long-term unemployed.\n  Again, we will wait for the data to be conclusive and decisive, but \nmy sense is, going back to Rhode Island, many of these individuals are \nin their middle ages--they are 40 and 50 years old. They have worked \nfor 20 years. They have good work records, but the skills that \nemployers are looking for right now are not immediately those skills \nthat they have. Of course, there are job training options available, \nbut all of these things require support. Again, if you are juggling \nfamily responsibilities and trying to get job training, that $300 a \nweek benefit check you have earned through your previous work is very \nhelpful as you prepare yourself for a new job.\n  This legislation can't be delayed any longer. This is not about some \npolitical demonstration or some political messaging point; this is \nabout getting aid and assistance to 2.3 million Americans today. And \nthat number will grow with each passing day. It is about helping people \nwho earned this benefit through their work.\n  I can't think of anything more important that we can do--and do it in \na timely and prompt manner. That is why I hope we can move forward as \nquickly as possible on a bipartisan basis with fully paid for \nlegislation which is fiscally responsible, which will provide \nassistance for millions of deserving Americans and in addition provide \nfurther stimulus to our economy.\n  A final point. Why does this provide a stimulus to the economy? \nBecause these types of benefits go to a former worker, someone looking \nfor work, and they go right back in the economy. This is not a \nsophisticated tax break that will allow someone to put some money aside \nfor a rainy day. This goes right to the families, right to the \neconomy--to the local grocery store, to the local gas station for the \nrepairs of a car, to pay for daycare that is necessary for children--to \ndo those things that will go right back and stimulate further growth in \nour economy.\n  For reasons both of fundamental fairness and individual recognition \nthat these people deserve a break in a tough economy and the very real \nfact that this dramatically benefits our overall economy, I think we \nhave to move.\n  I am pleased and proud that we have had the support of our colleagues \non both sides of the aisle to move forward procedurally. I hope we can \nfinish this debate promptly, move this over to the House, and then \nbegin to work with the House so they recognize the same reality that on \na bipartisan basis we have recognized here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, yesterday President Obama held an \nevent at the White House to talk about his health care law. The \nPresident said:\n\n       The debate over repealing this law is over--the Affordable \n     Care Act is here to stay.\n\n  That is what President Obama said yesterday. Of course, last October \nPresident Obama said his health care law was ``the law of the land.'' \nThen he went ahead and changed or delayed the law more than 20 times \nafter that--on his own, without coming to Congress. If it is the law of \nthe land, how does he get to change the law of the land 20 times?\n  Back on March 6, President Obama said the Democrats' health care law \nis ``working the way it should.'' Well, if the law is working the way \nit should, why do people in Wyoming keep telling me how bad the law is \nfor them personally?\n  Just the other day I heard from a woman in Rawlins, WY. She wrote:\n\n       My husband has been self-employed at a small truck driving \n     company servicing the oil and gas fields in [Wyoming] for \n     over 13 years. We have always purchased individual healthcare \n     coverage for our family of five. We currently pay $906.87 for \n     that coverage.\n\n\n[[Page S2050]]\n\n\n  She said:\n\n       The lowest priced ACA Bronze plan will increase our premium \n     to $1359 per month, an increase of $452 per month--an amount \n     we cannot currently absorb. This is not affordable. Why is \n     [President] Obama doing this to us?\n\n  That is a good question. Why are Democrats here in Washington doing \nthis to families such as this woman's family in Wyoming? Why does \nPresident Obama think his law is working the way it should?\n  Well, the Senate Democratic majority leader, Senator Reid, said here \non the floor of the Senate back on February 26 that the law is going \ngreat. The majority leader said, ``Despite all the good news, there's \nplenty of horror stories being told.'' He went on to say: ``All are \nuntrue, but they're being told all over America.''\n  ``All are untrue,'' he said here on the floor.\n  The majority leader added that all of the stories were ``made up from \nwhole cloth, lies distorted by the Republicans to grab headlines or \nmake political advertisements.''\n  Why does Senator Reid think this woman in Rawlins, WY, is making up a \nstory out of whole cloth?\n  Remember, the President also said that if you like your insurance, \nyou can keep it. He said that if you like your doctor, you can keep \nyour doctor. He said people's health care costs were going to be $2,500 \nlower by now. So the President has said a lot of things that turned out \nnot to be accurate. Now the President says his health care law is here \nto stay.\n  Given the President's history, I think it is fair to get a second \nopinion. As a doctor who has practiced medicine for 25 years, taking \ncare of families in Wyoming, I come to the floor to tell you that I \nbring my medical experience, along with my colleague's experience, \nSenator Tom Coburn from Oklahoma. He and I have put together a report \nthat looks at some of the promises Democrats have made about the law \nand some of the things Republicans have said about it. The report is \ncalled ``Prognosis.'' It came out April 2014 and is available today on \nSenator Coburn's Web site at www.coburn.senate.gov or on my site at \nwww.barrasso.senate.gov.\n  What we have done is come out with a report going through three \ndifferent previous reports that, as doctors, we have put out watching \nthe health care law as it has been developing. Each of the reports--one \ncalled ``Bad Medicine,'' one called ``Grim Diagnosis,'' and one called \n``Warning: Side Effects''--was released between 2010 and 2012. We grade \nourselves now on how the predictions we have made over the last 4 years \nhave turned out.\n  In the first prediction we made--report No. 1, ``Bad Medicine''--we \nwarned that millions of Americans could lose their health insurance \nplans.\n  The headlines all across the country show that over 5 million \nAmericans did, in fact, get letters that they lost their health \ninsurance plan--health insurance which they liked, which worked for \nthem, something they chose and they lost because the President said it \nwasn't good enough. He said he knew more about what they needed for \nthemselves and their families than they did. So we predicted 4 years \nago that millions would lose their health insurance plans, and millions \ndid.\n  We warned that the law's new mandates would increase health costs and \nobviously increase the cost of insurance. That original diagnosis is \nconfirmed as well.\n  Like the letter I just read from the family in Rawlins, WY, families \nall across Wyoming and all across the country are seeing incredible \nincreases in the cost of their insurance. They are paying more, and in \ntheir opinion they are getting worse insurance--the President said \nbetter; I say worse--because they are having to pay for a lot of things \nthat they don't need, don't want, and will never use. Yet the President \nsays he knows better than they do about what kind of insurance they \nneed and what is best for them and their families. They are also being \nfaced with higher copays, higher deductibles, and higher out-of-pocket \ncosts.\n  We warned additionally that short-term fixes threaten seniors' long-\nterm access to care.\n  That is actually exactly what happened. The health care law took $500 \nbillion out of the Medicare Program--a program to take care of our \nseniors--not to strengthen Medicare, not to help our seniors, but to \nstart a whole new government program for other people. For those 14 \nmillion Americans on Medicare Advantage, a program for which there are \nadvantages--preventive care, coordinated care, things one would want--\nwell, that has been dramatically hurt by the President's decision to \ntake money away from the very popular Medicare Advantage plan.\n  We warned that patients with preexisting conditions would still face \ncare restrictions.\n  I listened to the President's speech. I read editorials written by \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle as recently as last week that \nsaid people with preexisting conditions are all being protected. That \nis not true. We know of patients who because of their condition have \nhad to leave the State in which they live to get specialty care in \nother States. And when they lost their insurance and bought insurance \nthrough the plans of their State, their children with cystic fibrosis \nseeking specialty care in Boston are excluded from doing that under the \nplan because the insurance was bought in the State in which they live \nand the insurance they got did not cover any out-of-State physicians. \nSo children have been hurt by the President's health care law, and we \ncan identify those young victims of the President's health care law.\n  We warned that the individual mandate would fail with the IRS as an \nenforcer.\n  The IRS even admits they don't have a whole mechanism put together to \nmake sure the mandate to fine Americans for not buying a government-\napproved product would be collected by the IRS.\n  We warned that new IRS taxes would harm small businesses.\n  That initial diagnosis is now confirmed. Small businesses are \nimpacted all across the country by additional expenses and costs, \nmaking it much harder for them to provide insurance to their workers. \nMany looking at this are saying that it might be cheaper to pay the \nfine than to do what we would like to do and have done in the past, \nwhich is provide insurance that worked for those employers and their \nemployees but perhaps doesn't meet the President's recommendations of \nwhat many people say is much more insurance than they will ever need, \nwant, use, or can afford.\n  The second report we came out with a number of years ago is called \n``Grim Diagnosis.'' In that, we went through a number of concerns we \nhad about the health care law after the initial report ``Bad \nMedicine.''\n  ``Grim Diagnosis'' provided warnings that the employer mandate would \nlower incomes and result in hundreds of thousands of jobs being lost.\n  We are still watching that one very carefully because we do know that \nwith the employer mandate, there have been stories of businesses with \n50 employees saying: We are going to have to get below 50. We are not \ngoing to hire more people. We have to get below that number.\n  The President is working to maybe make that a higher number, but no \nmatter where that number line is drawn, people are finding that from a \nbusiness standpoint, there are advantages to being below a certain \nnumber of employees and then not having to comply with the expensive \nmandates of the law.\n  We warned that the law included a risky insurance scheme that would \ncost taxpayers dearly.\n  That original diagnosis is confirmed as well with something called \nthe CLASS Act. Folks who looked at it carefully on both sides of the \naisle called it a Ponzi scheme--a Ponzi scheme--that would never work, \ncould not be afforded. They said it was something Bernie Madoff would \neven be proud of. Yet the Democrats forced it into the health care law \nin spite of warnings against it.\n  Our final report was called ``Warning: Side Effects,'' released in \n2012. We started talking about the side effects of the health care law. \nWe warned that the law includes hundreds of billions of dollars of tax \nhikes.\n  Well, that has been confirmed. All one has to do is look at the list \nof new taxes brought on by the health care law. It goes on and on with \none new tax after another. These are taxes on real people that get \npassed on to others if they are applied to a business, totaling\n\n[[Page S2051]]\n\n$1 trillion in gross tax increases over the next 10 years, from 2013 to \n2022.\n  We warned that the new insurance cooperatives would waste taxpayer \ndollars.\n  That is exactly what this report confirms. It goes State by State, \nwhere we see significant wasting of money, as reported in the \nWashington Post and in USA TODAY.\n  We warned that the medical device tax would stifle innovation.\n  That original diagnosis has been confirmed as well. We see the \nmedical device tax, which, when we talked about it as part of a budget \namendment, there was bipartisan support for repealing it. Why aren't we \nvoting to repeal it when it matters, when we could actually get this \nrepealed? The Senate majority leader continues to block a vote on that.\n\n  So I come to the floor, the day after the President held his \n``mission accomplished'' speech at the White House, to say that the \nprognosis for this health care law continues to be grim, the points we \nhave made throughout continue to be true, and the people all across the \ncountry are experiencing it day-to-day.\n  They are experiencing it in their lives. They are experiencing it \nwhen they try to continue health insurance that works for their family. \nThey are paying more out of pocket. Their premiums are higher. They may \nnot be able to keep the doctor they had and liked. They may not be able \nto go to the hospital they had gone to previously.\n  It is interesting that in the State of New Hampshire where there are \n28 hospitals, 10 of them are excluded--10 of the 28 hospitals in the \nState of New Hampshire are excluded--from the insurance being offered \non that State's exchange to be sold in that State. Even the doctor who \nis the chief of staff of one of those hospitals--well, her insurance \ndoes not permit her to go to the very hospital where she is the chief \nof staff. Is this what the Democrats had in mind when they passed this \nhealth care law, people paying more in premiums, people losing their \ndoctors, not having access to the hospitals in their community, higher \ncopays, higher deductibles? That is what the American people are \nfacing.\n  It is time for the President of the United States to acknowledge the \npain that his health care law has caused people across the country. I \nknow he watches the polls, and the polls continue to show that for \nevery one person who says they may have been helped by the health care \nlaw there are more than two people who say they have been harmed.\n  People knew we needed health care reform in this country, and they \nknew the reason. People knew what they wanted. They wanted the care \nthey need from a doctor they choose at lower costs.\n  This health care law has failed to deliver to the American people \nwhat they wanted, what they asked for, and instead is trying to deal \nday-to-day with something the Democrats in this Senate and in the House \nshoved down the throats of the American people.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 30 minutes as if in morning business and to engage in a colloquy \nwith the Senator from Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, I come to the floor again today to talk \nabout good jobs and how we can work together in a responsible and \nbipartisan way to create high-quality and lasting middle-class jobs. \nAll of us hear from our home States about how they want us to work \ntogether to produce for America today and America tomorrow.\n  As someone who worked for 8 years for a manufacturing company in the \nprivate sector before going into public service, I can tell you we can \nwin in manufacturing. We can learn from our competitors, we can \nstrengthen our workforce, we can strengthen our access to foreign \nmarkets, and we can strengthen our access to credit. We can do all of \nit and we can compete and win in advanced manufacturing in the United \nStates.\n  One of the aspects of my own experience in the private sector that \nhas stayed with me is that more of our manufacturing employment was in \nGermany than any other single country, and that often seems unlikely \ngiven that Germany actually has higher labor costs, labor protections, \nenvironmental protections, and in many ways a higher cost of doing \nbusiness than almost any other advanced country. So how is it possible \nthey are so successful? In fact, more than twice the percentage of \ntheir GDP is in manufacturing than is the case in the United States.\n  Why would we fight for manufacturing jobs? Why would we fight to \nemulate Germany's example? Because manufacturing jobs are great jobs. \nAs the Presiding Officer and our colleague from Maine know, \nmanufacturing jobs are high skill, high wage, high benefit, and have a \npositive impact on their surrounding community. They also need \nsomething. They need ongoing R, cutting-edge research, continuous \nimprovement and innovations in order to remain at the cutting edge of \nproductivity.\n  What we are going to talk about on the floor today is a bill that \nlearns from the lessons of our most successful European competitor, \nGermany. Germany has more than 60 manufacturing hubs located all over \ntheir country. These manufacturing hubs are in places where \nuniversities are doing cutting-edge technical research and companies \nare beginning to deploy these new technologies in manufacturing and the \nworkforce that are needed to acquire the skills to be successful in \nthese new areas of manufacturing all work in coordination. That is \nsomething we can, by working in a bipartisan way here in this Senate, \nadvance, and advance rapidly, here in the United States.\n  The Senator from Maine and I are going to talk about a bill--the \nRevitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation Act--which has 14 \ncosponsors and is an indication of its broad base of bipartisan \nsupport. It has long been led by Senators Brown of Ohio and Blunt of \nMissouri, a bipartisan team, and to that they have added a great \ninitial leadership team with Senator Stabenow, Senator Levin, Senator \nReed, and Senator Schumer, all Democrats, as well as Senator Graham, \nSenator Kirk, Senator Collins, Senator Wicker, and Senator Boozman, all \nRepublicans. Most recently our wonderful colleague, Senator Angus King \nof Maine, an Independent, has joined us.\n  This bill has been endorsed by folks ranging from the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers to the U.S. Conference of Mayors to the \nUnited Auto Workers, and many more organizations at the national and \nlocal level, which is another indicator of how diverse its support is \nfrom across the country and many different sectors. This is a bill I \nhave reason to hope can not just get a lot of endorsements from the \nprivate sector and not just a lot of endorsements from cosponsors here \nin the Senate but can actually move through regular order to be taken \nup and considered by the committee of jurisdiction, to be taken up here \non the floor, and actually signed into law by the President of the \nUnited States. I am hopeful that could happen partly because this is \ngood policy.\n  There are already a number of hubs that have been established by \nFederal agencies spending money that has already been authorized and \nappropriated for specific research areas where the Department of Energy \nand the Department of Defense need to do work to develop cutting-edge \nmanufacturing capacity in the United States.\n  I think if this law gets taken up on a bipartisan basis and is \nimproved, refined, and debated in committee and here on the floor, we \nactually have a shot at advancing a process that will be wide open and \nwill allow elements of the Federal Government, in partnership with the \nprivate sector, to leverage cutting-edge research and deploy whole new \ntechnologies across this country.\n  I am excited by it, and I know my colleague is as well. I will \nbriefly state why Senator King is a great colleague\n\n[[Page S2052]]\n\nto join all of us who have served as sponsors on this bill. He has \npreviously worked in the private sector in clean energy. He has \npreviously served as the Governor of the State of Maine and worked \nclosely with the University of Maine and has a sense of how publicly \nfunded research at a cutting-edge university, investment in workforce \nskills, and the deployment of new and innovative technologies in clean \nenergy can work together to grow manufacturing, grow job opportunities, \nand grow our economy.\n  I invite my colleague to address his experience in Maine and why he \nhas joined this broad group of cosponsors on this promising and \nbipartisan manufacturing bill.\n  Mr. KING. I thank my colleague from Delaware for his leadership on \nthis issue. He has been indefatigable. He has been very strong on this \nissue. I think it is one of the most important issues that faces us.\n  I am not an economist; I am a country lawyer from Maine, but one of \nthe things I know about any economy is you can't build an economy by \ntaking in each other's laundry. Somebody somewhere has to make \nsomething, and that is the basis of wealth creation. Somehow in the \n1980s, 1990s, and the early part of this century, we sort of lost sight \nof that and manufacturing took an enormous hit. We lost 32 percent of \nour manufacturing jobs in the decade from 2000 to 2010. We lost 42,000 \nfactories--not people, 42,000 factories. Manufacturing was literally \nwithering away in this country.\n  I think a lot of people sort of wrung their hands and said: Oh, well, \nI guess that is just the way of the world. It is all going to Asia, \nChina, and Mexico. It is going to low-wage countries, and that is just \nthe way it works.\n  The problem is, as my colleague from Delaware pointed out, Germany \nhas gone in the opposite direction, and their country has the same \nstandard of living, the same labor standards, the same employment cost \nlevels, and yet 20 percent of their economy is based upon \nmanufacturing; whereas, it is only 10 or 11 percent in this country. So \nthat tells me it is not impossible. It tells me there is an opportunity \nhere and that we can't just lay back and say: Well, I guess that is \ngoing to go away. Woe is us. That is never the way to seize the future.\n  Why do it? The Senator from Delaware said it: Better pay. In Maine, \nin looking at the data, employees in manufacturing on average make \ntwice as much as employees in other areas--twice as much. There is a \ntremendous difference in pay, and of course a better difference in \nbenefits. There is also a bigger multiplier for manufacturing. \nManufacturing creates more jobs down the line and around a \nmanufacturing facility. It is important for national security.\n  We are in danger of losing our industrial base, which is part of our \nnational security infrastructure. If we can no longer make things--\nwhether it is destroyers at Bath Iron Works or jet airplanes or \nuniforms or boots or other things that are necessary to support our \nnational security apparatus--we are in trouble, and that is a danger to \nour country. That is a national security danger because if we are \ndependent upon other countries that may or may not be our friends for \nessential components of our national security infrastructure, that is a \nvery dangerous and risky place to be. That is not often talked about, \nbut the maintenance of manufacturing jobs in the United States is a \ncritical part of our industrial base and a part of our national \nsecurity strategy.\n  Manufacturing allows for more exporting. It brings money into our \ncountry. Eighty-three percent of the exports from Maine come out of the \nmanufacturing sector, and that is bringing money into our country \nrather than sending it out to other countries.\n  Also, I think it is very important to remember that this is a way of \ndealing with what I think is one of the most serious issues of our \ntime, which is income inequality. It is the widening gap between those \nat the top and those at the bottom, and what is really a concern is the \nstagnation, and, in fact, the decline of the American middle class.\n  Manufacturing was the path into the middle class for our parents and \ngrandparents. The manufacturing resurgence after World War II--by the \nway, part of that resurgence was based upon the GI bill, probably the \ngreatest economic development program ever fostered by any government \nanywhere in the world--which helped to create the middle class is in \ndanger. One of the ways to preserve and strengthen the middle class--\nand to deal with this problem of income inequality--is more \nmanufacturing and more of those good jobs.\n  This is the 100th anniversary of one of the most amazing and \ntransformative actions in American corporate history. The year was 1914 \nwhen Henry Ford doubled the pay of all of his workers. Everybody was \nastonished. His competitors were aghast. The advocates of unbridled \ncapitalism said: How can he do this? Henry Ford was a genius in many \nways. But one of his insights was he wanted his workers to be able to \nbuy his products, and one of the problems in our economy today is a \nlack of demand. The people of the middle class don't have enough income \nto buy the products and it becomes a downward spiral. It is a lack of \ndemand that is truly at the heart of the weakness of the current \neconomy, and it is because people don't have good enough jobs and they \nare not being paid enough.\n\n  Henry Ford realized if he paid his workers more--and, by the way, \nthat munificent sum in 1914 was $5 a day, but it was a doubling of what \nthe rate of pay was everywhere else in American society at that time. \nThat was a huge breakthrough intellectually, economically, and socially \nfor this country.\n  OK. We talked about the losses. There is some good news. In the last \n2\\1/2\\ years we have gained 500,000 jobs. We lost 6 million in that \ndecade, but now we have gained 500,000 back. So something is happening. \nA lot of different things are happening. The low price of natural gas I \nthink is helping to rejuvenate manufacturing. I know it is in Maine. I \nthink there is more innovation happening around the country. People are \nrealizing--I have talked to manufacturers who have been offshore and \nhave come back because they said the offshore factory was a little \ncheaper, the labor costs were less, but the hassle factor was higher, \nand what I have learned is I can control costs, I can control \ntransportation, I can control time limits better if the manufacturing \nis in the United States.\n  So what do we do? What do we do if we want to increase manufacturing? \nWe can't wave a wand here in Washington. We can't say, well, go out and \ncreate jobs. We have to create an atmosphere where we can create jobs.\n  When my little girl Molly, who is not so little anymore, was in the \nthird grade, I used to teach her things with pneumonics. I would say \nthe three Xs or the three Ys or whatever. In this case, if she were \nhere and she were still in the third grade, I would say it is the four \nPs, Molly. It is the four Ps that are going to make this happen. The \nfirst is a plan. Nothing happens without a strategy or a vision or a \nplan. This bill has a vision of how to link innovation and the American \neconomy and manufacturing in such a way as to create and rejuvenate \nthis sector. A plan--we have to start with a plan or a vision.\n  The second P is partnerships, and this bill is based on partnerships. \nNothing good happens without partnerships. It is based upon linking the \nacademic world with the manufacturing world with government; putting \nthose partnerships together, mostly universities and manufacturing, to \ncreate innovation, to create new jobs, to create new ways of building \nwealth. We don't have to look much further than Silicon Valley in \nCalifornia. That is a perfect example of a natural born innovation hub \nbuilt around several knowledge factories: Stanford University, \nUniversity of California, University of San Francisco. Knowledge \nfactories, together with manufacturers, created one of the greatest \nhotbeds--probably the greatest hotbed--of innovation, creativity, and \nnew wealth creation in the history of this country and perhaps in the \nhistory of the world. We want to create these kinds of hubs all over \nthe country, putting together the academic community and the business \ncommunity to develop the capacity for innovation and creativity.\n  I should mention--it is not part of this bill, but the other thing I \nthink we have to do a lot of thinking about is the skills gap. I got a \ncall right after my election from a chamber of commerce director in \nsouthern Maine and\n\n[[Page S2053]]\n\nhe said: Senator, we want you to come down and talk about jobs.\n  I said: Oh, OK. I will. And I was prepared to talk about how to \ncreate jobs and add jobs.\n  He said: No, no, it is not that. The problem is we have 500 jobs and \nwe can't fill them. These are good-paying jobs in manufacturing, and we \ncan't fill them because the people we need aren't available with the \nskills we need. There is a mismatch.\n  I believe one of the things we have to do around here is think hard \nabout all the programs--I think there are something like 59 different \nFederal job training programs--how to integrate them, coordinate them, \nand focus them on business-ready jobs, not 10-years-ago jobs but the \njobs of today. Therefore, I think the coordination and cooperation \nbetween business and the job training infrastructure has to be much \ncloser than it is today.\n  That gets me to S. 1468. I think it is a wonderful idea. One of the \nbest parts of it is that it is bipartisan. This is an idea that is \nsupported--Sherrod Brown and Roy Blunt were the spearheads of it, and \nthen we have people such as Roger Wicker, the Senator from Mississippi, \nand the Senator from Delaware; we have a good bipartisan group from \naround the country geographically and across party lines. This is what \nwe have to do. Why is it so important? Because what drives new \nmanufacturing jobs is innovation.\n  When I was Governor of Maine, somebody gave me a cap and on it it \nsaid ``innovate or die.'' Bill Gates once famously said: Every product \nwe make today is going to be obsolete in 5 years. The only question is \nwhether we make it obsolete or someone else does.\n  Innovation is the heart of this economy. That is why we have to put \ntogether the knowledge factories with the production factories--the \nknowledge factories, the universities, such as the University of Maine, \nthat has the advanced composites lab that has created amazing new ways \nto deal with composites. One of their creations is the bridge and a \nbackpack. The bridge and a backpack is a composite system which I have \nseen in action. They are long tubes made of fiberglass. You spread the \ntubes out, fill them with concrete, mold them into the shape you want, \nand in about 3 or 4 days you have a bridge, and you put the deck over \nit. It is a wonderful system. It came out of the University of Maine \nand now it is being used across the country.\n  The other piece I like about this is that it isn't a government \nprogram. Government is the catalyst, the convener, the pulling together \nof these hubs, and that is, I think, our function. We shouldn't be \ndoing it. We shouldn't be steering it, but we should be launching it, \nand that is what this bill is all about. Does it solve all the problems \nof manufacturing? Of course not. There are dozens of things we have to \ndo in order to support this industry, whether it is tax reform, job \ntraining or innovation hubs and more support for R All of those we \nhave to do, but I think this is one of the most important, and we don't \nhave to guess about it. It works in Germany. They have twice the role \nfor manufacturing in their economy as we do. It works. So let's see \nwhat we can do here with the same idea.\n  I compliment the Senator from Delaware and the others who have led \nthis bill, and I am delighted to be able to tag along. I think this is \na great idea. It truly can make a difference, and I think we will see \nthat difference in the coming years.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Maine for \nsharing his personal experience both as Governor and for his work and \npartnership with the University of Maine and their composites center \nand his understanding of the importance of a modern, skilled workforce \nin order to take advantage of the work we are hoping to catalyze \nthrough this bill.\n  I wish to summarize across three large areas. This bill, if enacted, \nwould take advantage of linkages, leverage, and labor in a way that \nwould grow lasting middle-class jobs. All of us want to work together \nto find a way to give American workers and families a fair shot, to \ngive them a fair shot at the kind of middle-class quality of life that \ndominated over the last 50 years. As my colleague said, it was because \nof the GI bill and its investment in education, it was because of \ninnovation and competitiveness, and it was because of a skilled \nworkforce that we were able to dominate the world in manufacturing for \nmuch of the last 50 years of the last century. If we are to seize this \nmoment and regain our global leadership not just in the productivity \nsector of our manufacturing but also in the base, in the employment of \nour manufacturing, we have to do the sorts of things this bill \nimagines.\n  We have research being done in national labs, in federally funded \nnational labs--fundamental research. That is wonderful. We have applied \nresearch on composites being done at the University of Delaware and at \nthe University of Maine and every other State university that does \nhigher research. We have manufacturers trying to take advantage of new \ntechnologies and new opportunities. This bill will link them all \ntogether to create regional hubs that allow the researchers, the \nprivate sector, and the new employees to all come together.\n  It also, as my colleague mentioned, leverages private sector funds. \nEvery one of the four hubs announced to date is a more than a 1-to-1 \nmatch; 2 or 4 or, in one case, 8-to-1 match of private sector dollars \nto public sector dollars.\n  Last, it invests heavily in training and in skills and making sure \nthe workforce is ready as these new technologies get out there.\n  I wish to describe the reach of some of these linkages and \npartnerships for a moment. Let me take a second and take a walking \ntour, if I could, of the four hubs that have been finalized so far.\n  For example, the one in Youngstown, OH, deals with 3D manufacturing. \nThis is a relatively new, cutting-edge technology that radically alters \nthe scale of early stage manufacturing and what is possible in terms of \nprototyping, and then, I think fairly soon, what is possible in terms \nof customized, unit-by-unit manufacturing. It has enormous promise. But \nif we are going to stay competitive globally in manufacturing, when \nthere is something new invented in the United States, we have to also \nmake sure it is made in the United States. So this is the sort of hub \nthat makes that possible.\n  There are four hubs, and I will mention them briefly: the one in \nOhio, the one in Raleigh, NC, the one in Detroit, and the one in \nChicago. But they don't just engage the universities and the workforce \nand the companies right in that immediate community. They benefit from \nnational networks. For example, General Dynamics and Honeywell are two \nof the very large national footprint firms partnering with the \nYoungstown hub. Universities from Arizona State to Florida State are \ncollaborating in the wide bandgap semiconductor work in Raleigh, NC. \nResearchers from the University of Kentucky, the University of \nTennessee, Notre Dame, and Ohio State are partners with the hub that is \nin Detroit. There are researchers from Boulder, Indiana, Notre Dame, \nLouisville, Iowa, Nebraska, UT, Austin, and Wisconsin that are \npartnering with the hub in Chicago.\n  So what are these hubs? Are they just some diffuse academic teams \nthat share names and a little bit of data with each other? No. If there \nwere, for example, to be a hub in Maine on composites, we would find \nresearchers at the University of Delaware who have done great work in \ncomposites and companies doing work in composites partnering with the \nfundamental research being done, let's say, hypothetically, at the \nUniversity of Maine, and learning about how to deploy that new \ntechnology in ways that would benefit the local workforce and the local \nmanufacturers.\n  That is why there is so much leverage coming out of these linkages. \nThat is why these hubs have been so generative and so powerful in \nGermany's experience. It is a way to harness our Federal investment in \nresearch by the national labs and by State universities with the energy \nof the private sector and the capacity of our manufacturers to \nrelentlessly innovate.\n  We have a very broad menu of bipartisan manufacturing bills that have \nbeen taken up and discussed in this Chamber. This one--this \nmanufacturing hubs bill--has some of the broadest support and I think \nsome of the best reasons for it to be considered in committee and taken \nup on this\n\n[[Page S2054]]\n\nfloor later this spring. It is my real hope our colleagues will join us \nin doing so.\n  Let me yield back to my colleague from Maine.\n  Mr. KING. I like the Senator's suggestion of a hub in Maine involving \ncomposites. Could we write that in the bill? I wouldn't object to that \namendment.\n  Mr. COONS. If there is a footnote that says ``and Delaware.''\n  Mr. KING. I think this is such an important idea, and in my comments \nI outlined how we get here. We start with a vision or a plan which the \nbill entails, and we start with partnerships, which is truly the \nessence of the bill, but there are two more pieces. There are two more \nPs. One is perseverance. Any Member of this body knows about \nperseverance. That is what this place is all about. We have to stick to \nit. We have to not take no for an answer. We have to listen to our \ncolleagues to find out how they feel about the bill and try to form a \nconsensus and then move this bill through.\n  Last Friday was the 100th birthday of Ed Muskie of Maine. Ed Muskie \nwas the father of the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act. Talk about \nperseverance. He spent 2 years, hundreds of hearings, hundreds of hours \nof markup and ended up with that bill passing the Senate unanimously--\nunanimously. That is a monument to perseverance.\n  Normally, I would say those are the three Ps: plan, partnership, and \nperseverance, but I think there is one more, and I am sure my colleague \nfrom Delaware agrees with me.\n  Nothing is going to happen without passion. We have to care about \nthis. The people of America have to care about this. We have to say \nthat this is something we are going to do. We are going to rebuild the \nmanufacturing centers that made this country what it was--a sector that \nmade this country what it was. We are going to have to do it with \npassion and commitment. I believe this bill is an opportunity to \nrestart that process.\n  It will, and as I mentioned earlier, it can change us and provide \nbenefits everywhere from higher wages to better national security to a \nstronger middle class. A plan, a partnership, perseverance, and \npassion--that is what changes the world.\n  Mr. COONS. I thank my colleague for joining me in this colloquy on \nmanufacturing, both broadly and more specifically on this bill. I am \ngrateful for the leadership that Senator Stabenow and Senator Graham, \nas the cochairs of the Senate Manufacturing Caucus, have shown on this \nparticular bill and the passion and the perseverance that Senators \nBrown and Blunt have shown in bringing this great idea into legislative \nform and in advancing it.\n  There are so many other bills that we can and should take up that \nwill bring strength and vitality to the American manufacturing sector. \nBut it is my real hope that S. 1468, the Revitalize American \nManufacturing and Innovation Act will be the next in a series of \nimportant bipartisan manufacturing bills that we will take up to make \nsure we are doing our job to help grow high quality American jobs.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                         Reinstated Amendments\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair was in error in striking down \namendments Nos. 2877 and 2878. Those amendments are reinstated.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I rise to talk a little bit today about \nthe Affordable Care Act and its benefit to America's women. I want to \nthank Senators Murphy, Boxer, and Whitehouse who have organized a few \nof us to come to the floor today. They will be on the floor later this \nafternoon.\n  But with so much discussion in the news about the recent completion \nof the March enrollment period--over 7 million people enrolled in the \nAffordable Care Act through the exchanges--I feel it is a good time to \nlook at some of the benefits of the ACA, but also where there is more \nwork to do.\n  I know the Presiding Officer has been very focused on ``where there \nis more work to do.'' I applaud the Presiding Officer for that. I will \ntalk about some of those issues as well. But first, let me start with a \ncouple of Virginia stories because we hear stories from our \nconstituents about the Affordable Care Act.\n  There is a 27-year-old woman in Charlottesville who was diagnosed \nwith uterine cancer. Before the ACA, her previous insurance plan \nrefused to cover her surgery because cancer was a preexisting \ncondition. She is now enrolled in a health plan under the ACA, and her \ndoctor and hospital where she is planning the surgery were confirmed to \nbe in the provider network.\n  In Alexandria, VA, there is a woman by the name of Aqualyn Laury. She \nis 43 years old. She suffered a stroke and a heart attack at a young \nage and had been on a preexisting condition insurance plan that was \nextremely expensive for some time. With her coverage scheduled to end, \nAqualyn recently enrolled in coverage through the health insurance \nmarketplace. She found a plan through the marketplace with a reputable \ncompany with a premium of approximately $245 a month, with copays and \ndeductibles that were easy to understand.\n  Angelette Harrell from Norfolk was able to purchase a plan on the \nexchange. Now, she had a problem with ACA because she could not work \nthe Web site. But she did not give up. She called the phone number. She \nwas able to find a plan that is $85 a month with a tax credit. She \nworks in a care facility for adults with autism. She says she could not \nafford a plan that would have been $280 a month without the tax credit. \nBecause she is under 200 percent of the poverty level, she gets a \ncredit, and she gets a plan for $85 a month. That makes her a more \nreliable employee. She said: ``It felt great. I finally got insured.''\n  She was able to enroll. I will tell a story about another great \nVirginia woman, my wife, and her experience with the Affordable Care \nAct. We had to buy insurance on the open market for the first time as a \nfamily in the summer of 2012. Like any good husband who wants to get \nsomething done right, I asked my wife to do it.\n  My wife comparison shopped with a couple of insurance companies. Two \ninsurance companies told my wife: We can give you insurance, but we can \nonly give you insurance for four of your five family members because of \npreexisting conditions--one because of me and one because of one of my \nkids. We have to be about the healthiest family in the United States. \nThe only hospitalizations our family of five have ever had are the \nthree times for child birth for my wife.\n  Yet insurance companies told her when she called in that we--boy, I \ntell you, do not tell my wife we can insure four of your five family \nmembers--an important safety tip. They told her that. She said: That is \nnow against the law.\n  The company said: No, it is not. This is what we do.\n  Well, talk to your supervisor and call me back. It is against the \nlaw.\n  The company had to call back in both instances within a few hours and \nsay: You are right. It is against the law. Here is a quote for your \nentire family.\n  The ACA is helping women and families in all circumstances, people \nwho are working in low-income jobs and cannot afford insurance or \npeople who are well off like me but need protection from the former \npractice of denying people for preexisting conditions.\n  Here are some ways the ACA works for women in particular. The law \neliminates the ability of insurers to charge higher rates due to \ngender. Do you know that the unfair practice of charging women more, a \ngender rating system, was resulting in women in this country paying $1 \nbillion more in annual premiums than men prior to the passing of the \nACA. That is now illegal. Nearly 30 million women are receiving free \ncoverage for comprehensive women's preventive services, including \ndiabetes, cancer screening, contraception, and family planning. That is \nan important benefit for women.\n  Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, both women and men are free from \nlifetime annual limits on insurance coverage in 10 essential health \nbenefits, like hospital visits and prescription drugs. It is not only \nabout health, the ACA is also helping the financial health of women and \nfamilies. Insurance companies under the ACA are now subject to a \nnational rate review provision if they want to increase premiums higher \nthan 10 percent. In 2012 alone, those rate reviews saved 6.8 million \nAmericans an estimated $1.2 billion in premiums just in 1 year.\n\n[[Page S2055]]\n\n  Insurance companies are also required to spend their premium dollars \nin a smart way. They have to spend at least 80 percent of premium \ndollars on patient care and quality improvement. That is at least 85 \npercent for large insurers. In 2013--just in calendar year 2013--8.5 \nmillion Americans received rebates averaging $100 per family because of \nthis particular provision.\n  An estimated 3.1 million young Americans are able to stay on family \npolicies--that is also affecting my family in a positive way--up until \nage 26. Families with incomes between 100 and 400 percent of the \npoverty line are eligible for tax credits. So as an example, a family \nof four in Virginia making $50,000 can access a health plan with \npremiums as low as $48 a month--health care for your family for less \nthan your cell phone bill, for less than your cable bill. This is \nremarkable. Plans are required to limit family's out-of-pocket health \ncare costs to less than $12,700 a year.\n  Like the Presiding Officer, I am a fixer; I am not a repealer. I \nthink there are a lot of fixings that are still needed in the \nAffordable Care Act and, frankly, in our health care system generally, \nnot just in the ACA. There is more that we can do to make the ACA work \nbetter for women and families.\n  Medicaid expansion is an example, a critical step that my State, \nVirginia, has yet to take. Without Medicaid expansion, uninsured women \nwill face a coverage gap. With Medicaid expansion, over 400,000 \nVirginians will receive health care coverage. The ACA was designed to \nprovide subsidies and tax credits to individuals and families who are \nmaking between 138 and 400 percent of the poverty level. But without \nMedicaid expansion, it is these families--working people--who remain \nuninsured.\n  We also have to work on some proposals to continue to improve \naffordability and choice for all consumers. The Presiding Officer has \nled an effort with others to put a number of positive reforms on the \ntable. Let me mention a couple that I am very excited about: The \nExpanded Consumer Choice Act, S. 1729, would create a new tier of \ncoverage, copper plans, and would give people shopping for health \ninsurance more options to meet their family's needs.\n  Everybody's financial and health situation is different. So more \noptions are great because that gives people more ability to meet their \nparticular needs. That is a very important piece of legislation. The \nPresiding Officer played a leadership role in it.\n  I supported expanding the small business tax credit to incentivize \nmore businesses to participate in the tax credit program, to make it \neasier to access and easier for the small businesses to use. One I am \nparticularly focused on is that we need to close the family glitch \nloophole. That is not a technical term, the family glitch loophole. The \nAffordable Care Act says an employee is eligible for subsidized health \ncoverage through the new exchanges if their employer does not offer \n``affordable coverage'', which is defined as more than 9.5 percent of \nthe employee's household income.\n  But the way the law is written, the affordability definition only \napplies to the price for the employee, not for the family coverage that \nan employer may offer. So if an employer does not offer affordable \nfamily coverage, there is no eligibility for a subsidy for that \nparticular very important coverage, since most people's families are \ncovered through their employer plan. I think that is an important thing \nwe should fix.\n  So look. There are plenty of things to fix. There are plenty of \nthings about our health care system outside of the Affordable Care Act \nthat we ought to be focusing on and fixing. But repealing the \nAffordable Care Act, as some colleagues in this body and in the House \ncontinue to advocate, would mean turning back on all of these advances: \nLetting women be discriminated against because of gender, letting \nfamilies be turned away because of preexisting conditions, saying to \nfolks: Do not worry, you are not going to get a rebate; we can charge \nwhatever premium we want.\n  The last thing we need to do is repeal the ACA or to go into the \nhomes of nearly 10 million Americans who have received coverage and \nyank that coverage back from them and put them back out into the \nwilderness of the individual market where they were not protected \nbefore. What we need to do is to be embrace the good and embrace the \nfixes to make it better. That is what I certainly intend to do working \nwith my colleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. KING. Madam President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator \nfrom Virginia. I think they were timely and important. I wanted to add \none note. The Senator and I were in a hearing yesterday in the Budget \nCommittee with three eminent economists--one was a Noble Prize winner--\ntalking about income inequality and the status of our economy and where \nwe are going.\n  But there was one aspect of the Affordable Care Act that came up in a \ndiscussion that really has gotten essentially no play whatsoever, no \ndiscussion in the press or in the media. I think in the long run it may \nturn out to be one of the most important aspects of the Affordable Care \nAct. It came home to me 2 weeks ago. Every Wednesday morning I have a \ncoffee in my office here in the Senate office building for anybody from \nMaine that happens to be in town, whatever reason they are here, \nwhether they are touring or have business in Washington. They can come \nin and have some blueberry muffins and some Maine coffee.\n  I met a couple there. The woman, in talking to us--she was down \ntouring and everything. She said: By the way, thanks for supporting the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  I said: Oh, well, that is great. I appreciate that. Why do you say \nthat?\n  She said: Because I have been in a job for a number of years that I \ndo not like. But I could not leave it because it was how I got my \nhealth insurance. My husband does not have health insurance. So I had \nto stay in the job in order to keep the health insurance. She said: Now \nunder the Affordable Care Act, I have an option to get health insurance \nat a reasonable price so I can leave this job and start my own \nbusiness.\n  After I had this discussion, I did a little research. It turns out \nthere is an economic term for this. It is called job lock. All over the \ncountry there are thousands, perhaps even millions, of people who are \nlocked into a job where they are not feeling very appreciated, where \nthey are not really enjoying it, where they are not expressing their \nproductivity and their talents fully because they could not leave their \ninsurance.\n  Now they can. There is a lot of talk around here about job creators. \nThe job creators are the people that start businesses, the \nentrepreneurs. Those are the job creators. This is going to lead to an \nexplosion of new businesses, of people who do not have to stay in the \njob that they are in simply because of their health insurance but have \nthe option to go out and start a business of their own because they can \nget their health insurance at a reasonable price through the Affordable \nCare Act.\n  So there is a lot to discuss about the Affordable Care Act. But this \nis one of the aspects of it that has been underappreciated. As the \nyears go on, we are going to see a decrease in people uninsured--which \nwe are already starting to see--and we are going to see an increase in \nsmall businesses because people no longer have to stay in their jobs \nsimply to maintain their insurance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. HATCH. I rise to speak once again about the process we have been \nfollowing in the Senate when it comes to major pieces of legislation.\n  The Senate has been called the world's greatest deliberative body. \nHowever, if you look at how it operates these days, I don't think \nanyone would say that anymore unless they were being sarcastic. We no \nlonger have real debate. Most bills don't go through committee, where \nthey can be refined and improved.\n  When the Senate Democratic leadership decides to bring a bill to the \nfloor, far more often than not we are blocked from offering any \namendments. The unemployment insurance legislation before us today is a \ngood example. Republicans have filed dozens of amendments to this bill. \nSome of them would definitely improve the UI legislation. Others would \naddress the underlying\n\n[[Page S2056]]\n\nproblems that have led some to call for another extension of Federal \nunemployment benefits--namely, the stagnant growth in our economy and \njobs. Yet it appears that none of these amendments will get a vote \nbecause the Senate Democratic leadership has decided it is more \nimportant to protect their Members from having to take difficult votes \nthan it is to actually legislate.\n  I filed several amendments. Two of them in particular would help to \ncreate jobs and prevent further job losses. One of those amendments \nwould repeal the ObamaCare tax on medical devices. We had 79 votes for \nthat. Yet we can't get a vehicle that will put it through. The House \nwill overwhelmingly vote for it. Yet we can't even get time on the \nfloor to take care of it. That shouldn't even be considered \ncontroversial. Indeed, a large majority of Senators have already voted \nin favor of repealing this job-killing tax and protecting an important \nAmerican industry--I should say important American industries because \nthere are a lot of industries in this area. Repeal of the medical \ndevice tax has bipartisan support in both the House and the Senate, as \nI have mentioned.\n  I have another amendment that would repeal the ObamaCare employer \nmandate. On the face of this, this may seem more controversial, but it \nshouldn't be. After all, the Obama administration has already delayed \nthe mandate for 2 years. If the mandate is so harmful that the \nadministration is afraid to let it go into effect, why don't we simply \ndo away with it altogether and ensure that it doesn't kill any more \njobs?\n  These are reasonable amendments. They deserve a vote. Therefore, I \nask unanimous consent that it be in order for me to offer my amendment \nNo. 2905.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, reserving my right to object, the \nunderlying emergency bipartisan legislation is critical to helping 2.7 \nmillion Americans, and I would hope we could expeditiously move to that \nlegislation. Therefore, I would object to the unanimous consent request \nby the distinguished Senator from Utah with respect to his amendment \nNo. 2905.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HATCH. You can imagine how disappointed I am in that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be in order for me to offer my \namendment No. 2906.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, the same logic--given the emergency nature \nof the legislation before us, I would urge immediate action. Therefore, \nI would object to the senior Senator's unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, the Senate didn't used to operate this \nway.\n  I have been to the floor many times over the past few years to talk \nabout the deterioration of the Senate procedures under the current \nmajority and to call for a return to the deliberative traditions of \nthis Chamber. Many of my colleagues on this side of the aisle have done \nthe same. Sadly, it appears our calls have fallen on deaf ears.\n  I have been in the Senate a long time, and I have never seen it worse \nthan it is right now. There have been some very rough times in the \nSenate over the years, but I have never seen it worse. Over the past \nnumber of years, the majority has called up a bill and then immediately \nfiled cloture as if we were filibustering, when we don't have any \nintention to filibuster. All we want is to be able to call up \namendments. But, in addition to filing cloture, the majority will fill \nthe tree, making impossible for anyone to call up an amendment.\n  Frankly, this is not the way to run the Senate.\n  All I can say is that the Senate is not being run the way it should \nbe run.\n  I have no objection to filling the tree after a full and extended \ndebate when people have an opportunity to bring up their amendments, \nfull-blooded Senators here on the floor, who have the right to bring up \nthose amendments.\n  I have no problem with amendments that I totally disagree with being \nbrought up, but you can't even do that most of the time on these bills \nunless, basically, the leadership on the Democratic side approves. \nUntil recently, this body has always had the position that we can call \nup germane and nongermane amendments. That is what makes this body \ngreat. It is what has given it such prestige over the years. Now, with \nit being run this way, we've just become a rubberstamp for the \nleadership. That can work both ways. I think it is a bad thing to do. \nHowever, the principle has been started and the precedent has been set.\n  I lament this because I have been here long enough to see some of the \ngreatest debates in the history of the Senate done right here on this \nfloor. Some were initiated by Democrats who wanted their right to be \nable to bring up everything and to really have it debated--whether it \nwas germane or nongermane--and assert their rights on the floor. Others \nwere brought up by Republicans filing amendments that Democrats didn't \nlike. But the Democratic leadership in the past acknowledged that, my \ngosh, you have the right to do that in the most deliberative body in \nthe world. But we have made it anything but the most deliberative body \nin the world with this type of procedure.\n  It is my hope that the Republicans will be able to take over the \nSenate in 2014. Perhaps that won't happen, but I would like to see it \nhappen. If it does, I think my friends on the other side are going to \nfeel very badly if this same type of maneuvering is done to prevent \nthem from bringing up the amendments they would like to bring up. But, \nI personally believe that, with Republicans in the majority, we would \nget back to the regular order that the rules were before these types of \nshenanigans took place.\n  This is important stuff, and there is a lot of concern on our side \nregarding how the Senate is currently being run. As the most senior \nRepublican in this body, I understand those feelings. I have them too.\n  It is wrong, certainly not right, and we need to change this. We need \nto make it back to the most deliberative body in the world. Should we \ndo that, I think everybody here will breathe a sigh of relief and say: \nMy gosh, each side will have these rights restored that have been so \ndistorted during the last number of years.\n  I am sorry I couldn't get these two amendments. One of them was the \nmedical device tax repeal. We brought it up before during the debate \nover the budget. Seventy-nine of our colleagues--79 of us--voted for \nthat amendment. It was a bipartisan vote, a vote that had tremendous \nleadership on the Democratic side through the distinguished Senator \nfrom Minnesota, Senator Klobuchar, who has been a wonderful leader on \nthat issue. If it wasn't bipartisan, maybe I would understand it, but \nit is not only bipartisan, it is crucial to all of the medical device \ncompanies throughout the United States that have set the standard for \nthe whole world.\n  We are going to get that passed sooner or later, but in the meantime \nwe are having medical device companies leaving the United States \nbecause of that stupid gross tax on gross sales, if you can believe it. \nThere is only one reason it was put into the health care legislation, \nand that was because they needed about $30 billion--with a ``b''--for \nObamaCare. It was basically a phony approach to come up with $30 \nbillion that has deliberately hurt one of the greatest budding \nindustries in America.\n  I can't think of a more stupid tax than one that taxes the gross \nsales of these companies. That is a dangerous, debilitating, \ndisgusting, wrongful tax. Yet we can't even get a vehicle over here to \nput it on--the other body would pass it quickly--so that we can get rid \nof it.\n  All I can say is that I am very disappointed, but I do understand how \nthis body works.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S2057]]\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, the numbers are in--over 7 million \nAmericans have enrolled through the health exchanges around the Nation.\n  When we passed the Affordable Care Act 4 years ago, projections were \nthat we would hit the 7 million mark of enrollees at the close of the \nfirst year of enrollment. We have exceeded those numbers. We have \nexceeded those numbers even though we had a very rough rollout of the \nexchanges and people were frustrated when they couldn't get information \nas quickly as they wanted. But Americans wanted insurance, and they \nknew they could get affordable coverage, so they stuck with it and now \nwe know that, in fact, over 7 million have enrolled.\n  When we see the final numbers, those numbers are going to go up \nbecause there were a lot of people in the process of signing up online \non March 31 and the processing has not been completed. So we will see \nmore. Plus, we have the Medicaid expansion, which is going to bring \nmillions more with health insurance coverage than we had before.\n  Over the last 4 years we have seen incredible progress and help going \nout to all Americans with their health coverage and their health costs. \nNo longer do we have preexisting conditions. A family who has a child \nwith asthma doesn't have to worry whether that asthma will be \nconsidered a preexisting condition to full coverage. A woman does not \nhave to worry about having a child being a preexisting condition to \nfull coverage. Parents can keep their adult children on their insurance \npolicies until the age of 26. There are no longer any caps on \ninsurance. Many Americans thought they had insurance coverage only to \ngo through a serious illness and find their insurance had a cap that \ndid not cover all the expenses. No longer do families have to worry \nabout being forced into bankruptcy because of an illness or an injury.\n  Our seniors now have much stronger coverage under Medicare, with \npreventive care covered without any deductibles. Prescription drug \ncoverage is now more complete with that so-called doughnut hole--that \ncoverage gap--being filled. And the solvency of the Medicare trust fund \nhas been extended by a decade.\n  Small business owners have a choice of the types of plans they want. \nThey do not have to worry about one person in their employment getting \nsick during the year and causing an astronomical increase in their \npremiums. They also have help and affordability in paying for their \nhealth insurance for their employees.\n  Community health centers have been expanded and offer such coverage \nas prenatal care. In my own State of Maryland we are seeing the low \nbirth weight baby numbers declining and infant mortality rates going \ndown. We are now providing more pediatric dental services within the \ncommunity. That is all as a result of the Affordable Care Act.\n  So we now have passed the March 31 date and the first year of \nenrollment. Many Americans now have affordable quality health care and \na choice. They have a good product at a reasonable cost.\n  Everybody hears the numbers, but I want to go through a few--and I \nhave literally hundreds--of the letters I have received from real \npeople whose real lives have been affected. They are one of those 7.1 \nmillion people, and we could read millions of accounts just like this. \nThis is from Dr. Michael L. of Cecil County in a letter to the \nBaltimore Sun. He said:\n\n       My wife and I would like to thank President Barack Obama \n     for helping us save almost $4,000 a year on health care. I am \n     61 years old with a preexisting condition of asthma, which is \n     under control with medication. Yet before the Affordable Care \n     Act, my insurance company felt it necessary to charge me 25 \n     percent more for my insurance coverage. I'm sure there are \n     many others like myself with preexisting conditions who will \n     see a savings on their coverage. The public should know that \n     since Fox News and the GOP would have us believe ObamaCare \n     helps no one and will cost everyone more.\n\n  This is from Colleen F. of Anne Arundel County, and she posted on our \nFacebook.\n\n       Senator--I am 26 years old and have been on COBRA paying \n     $570 a month for coverage because of a pre-existing \n     condition--asthma. I want to thank you for fighting for the \n     ACA!! I applied recently . . . and was accepted into the \n     program. I now pay $243 a month with a $500 deductible! Thank \n     you thank you thank you! Affordable health care is a human \n     right--thank you for fighting on my behalf!\n\n  Kelly ``M'' wrote:\n\n       I have a new plan. I haven't had insurance for years. When \n     I applied for insurance before, I was denied for pre-existing \n     conditions, even for plans with huge deductibles. I signed up \n     on the Maryland Healthcare Exchange back in October, and by \n     January 1st, I was holding an insurance card from Carefirst \n     Blueshield and have already had my first doctor's \n     appointment. It works. I am proof. And I'm so grateful that I \n     can take care of myself with dignity without having to go to \n     the ER whenever I'm sick or have to spend half my paycheck at \n     an urgent care center. I can do all of the preventative \n     measures that I have been putting off, and get back on the \n     road to health. It's a good feeling.\n\n  Pam S. of Frederick County, MD, wrote:\n\n       My daughter and I met with a Navigator from the ``Door to \n     HealthCare'' . . . to discuss applying for health care. We \n     had been having problems with the enrollment process. I had \n     been paying for a separate plan for her and now she is paying \n     $55 less per month. Now my daughter gets to have a \n     comprehensive plan, cheaper than before and without any \n     interruption on her coverage. Thank you!\n\n  Ryan, from Prince George's County, has aged out of her parents' \ninsurance. Ryan was suffering from asthma and a sinus infection, but \nshe was unable to afford a doctor's visit on her own. After attending a \nlocal Affordable Care Act information session, she logged onto the \nMaryland Health Benefit Exchange and was able to go through the entire \nprocess and pick an affordable health plan. She is now insured and able \nto get the treatment she needs.\n  Ryan is 26 years old. Those under 26 can be on their parents' policy. \nWe talk about young people who think they will never need insurance. I \nwas in downtown Baltimore over the weekend at a fair where we were \nenrolling people in the Affordable Care Act. I saw many people of \nRyan's age--young people over 26 years of age, who were there to find \nout whether this was right for them. When they left, they held an \ninsurance card. They had enrolled because they found out how reasonable \nthe price was for a young person to get comprehensive coverage.\n  I have quite a few more, and maybe on a later date I will come back \nand read some of the other letters I have received. But the point I \nwant to bring up is we have fundamentally changed the health care \nsystem from a system that was basically a sick system--only if you got \nsick, figured out how to pay your bills, maybe you went through \nbankruptcy--to a health care system where we keep people healthy, where \nwe provide for comprehensive preventive health care so people can stay \nout of emergency rooms and hospitals.\n  Yes, we have benefited those who had no health insurance. Millions of \npeople now have coverage who didn't have coverage before the Affordable \nCare Act. We have brought them into the system. They don't have to fear \nbankruptcy. They can take care of themselves, and they can do it in a \nmore cost-effective way for all of us.\n  We have helped our seniors. No question about it. They now have more \ncomprehensive benefits, and they have a system that is on a more stable \nfinancial footing.\n  But we also have helped those who already had insurance. We have \nhelped them by giving them a better product, by making sure the \npremiums insurance companies charge are used for patients' benefits and \nnot excessive profits. They must spend 80 to 85 percent; otherwise, \nthey have to give a rebate.\n  We have gotten people out of the emergency room. I was asked on C-\nSPAN today: Well, aren't we helping the providers? After all, people \nwho go to hospitals now are more likely to pay their bills. Absolutely \nright. But guess who paid for that uncompensated care. Those of us who \nhad insurance. Our premiums were higher as a result of people not \npaying their bills. Well, now they are going to be paying their bills. \nFirst of all, they are going to stay out of the hospital which will \nsave us all money. But if they need to be in the hospital, they will \nhave the insurance coverage to pay for it.\n  The Affordable Care Act has worked for all of us by bringing down the \ngrowth rate of health care costs, by making the system more efficient. \nToday I think we can acknowledge the fundamentals are sound. People are \ntaking advantage of it. We hope, as we go forward, more and more will.\n\n[[Page S2058]]\n\n  One final point. When Medicare Part D was passed and we projected the \nnumber of seniors who would take advantage of it, we hit about 70 \npercent of our projection in the first year. On the Affordable Care Act \nand the health exchanges, we are over 100 percent. This program is \nworking. People know it. The more they know about it, the more they \nlike what they see.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I rise today to speak about a \ncritical disaster relief bill I recently introduced here in the Senate.\n  In the West, we have a saying that ``Mother Nature bats last.'' For \nmillions of Americans, that saying is a reminder that often entire \ncommunities are at the mercy of the raw force of nature and natural \ndisasters. Sadly, we are reminded of this truism every year with \nwildfires in the West, hurricanes in the South, and ice storms along \nthe Atlantic seaboard. The devastating and tragic mudslides that have \nrecently devastated Oso, WA, are the latest example.\n  First, and most importantly, I wish to express my deepest and most \nheartfelt condolences to the families of the victims of this tragedy in \nWashington State. I assure the people of Washington that Coloradans \nstand ready to assist in whatever way we can with a recovery process we \nknow all too well ourselves. We are all in this together.\n  In times of disasters such as these, I believe there are no Democrats \nor Republicans. We put aside partisan divides to unite in the face of \ntragedy. When confronted by these dire situations, we stand united to \nsupport our fellow Americans who have been shaken by the destructive \nforces of Mother Nature.\n  When the Northeast was rocked by Superstorm Sandy in 2012, a majority \nof the Congress stood together to fund relief and recovery efforts, not \nbecause it benefited their State or because they expected anything in \nreturn, but because it was simply the right thing to do. Similarly, \nwhen Hurricane Katrina devastated the gulf coast in 2005, we united to \nsupport our fellow Americans who lost their homes and livelihoods in \nthe hurricane and its aftermath. And when ice jams just last year \ncaused the Yukon River to spill its banks, flooding Galena, AK, and the \nsurrounding towns, Congress stood as one to provide aid and assistance \nfor those in need.\n  My State too has felt the pain of destructive and unprecedented \nnatural disasters in recent years. In fact, many parts of Colorado are \nstill reeling from the September 2013 floods that resulted in 10 \ndeaths, washed away homes and businesses, and literally redrew the map \nacross parts of my State. In my travels to places such as Evans, \nJamestown, and Estes Park, I witnessed firsthand how thousands were \nimpacted by this disaster, which spanned 200 square miles and 15 \ncounties.\n  Fortunately, in spite of a destructive and partisan government \nshutdown that forced all of us to scramble just days after the \nflooding, many of the 18,000 evacuees in my State have returned home \nand are working on rebuilding their lives and their communities. This \nis thanks to the assistance from Federal and State agencies, including \nimportant relief funding made possible by the Superstorm Sandy relief \npackage we passed here in Congress in a bipartisan manner.\n  In sum, we in Colorado are on the road to recovery thanks to the \ntremendous efforts of thousands of people, including many of our \ncolleagues here in the Senate. But as my colleagues who have dealt with \ntheir own natural disasters know all too well, the initial relief \nefforts are only the first step.\n  Looking ahead over the next couple of months, Colorado--like many \nother Western States--may be facing another round of devastating \nfloods, wildfires, and mudslides. Why? Colorado, like Washington, has \nreceived an above-average snowpack this year. We have more snow than \nnormal and we are expecting 127 percent of average snowmelt this \nspring. So when we combine this increased snowpack and the impending \nspring runoff with streambeds still jammed full of debris, crumbling \nriverbanks, and waterways that the flood rerouted out of their original \npath, Colorado still has a recipe for disaster on our hands.\n  I will share a photograph of what happened in one of our communities. \nWe can see the culvert washed out, the vehicles embedded in the cobbles \nand sand and boulders of the riverbed. The riverbed itself was \ncompletely rerouted during the flooding when it took out the road in \nthat particular area. The good news is, as we look at the potential for \nadditional disaster, we have the power here in Congress to confront the \ndisaster before it has a chance to occur.\n  I wish to speak to the history of what Congress did. Congress \nrecognized the importance of stabilizing waterbanks, preventing soil \nerosion, and clearing debris from waterways back in 1978 through the \nAgricultural Credit Act. As part of that important law, Congress \nauthorized the Emergency Watershed Protection Program--or EWP for \nshort. As many of my colleagues know well, EWP provides critical \ndisaster relief assistance for families and communities which have \nsuffered severe damages from flood, fire, drought, or other natural \ndisasters.\n  The EWP Program focuses on funding critical emergency recovery \nmeasures for runoff mitigation and erosion prevention that will relieve \nimminent hazards to life and property presented by natural disasters. \nProtecting and repairing these watersheds, wherever they may be, is \ncritical in preventing the type of erosion that leads to massive \nmudslides and future disasters.\n  Unfortunately, even though our country is rocked by these natural \ndisasters every year, the critical EWP Program does not receive \nconsistent funding. The sporadic and inconsistent way we fund it--via \nad hoc supplemental bills--has created a backlog in need of over $120 \nmillion nationally.\n  For my colleagues in the Chamber who may not immediately recognize \nthe importance of EWP and the program attached to it, let me make clear \nthat there are 14 States which have projects left unfunded because of \nthis backlog, meaning there are up to 28 Senators who could see relief \nin their home States if we pass this bill.\n  This backlog is unacceptable. It is preventing us from funding dozens \nof projects that can help reduce the frequency and severity of \nmudslides, projects that can protect our watersheds, and projects that \ncan save lives.\n  So with this in mind, I rise today to ask this Congress to come \ntogether yet again and pass legislation, which I introduced last week, \nsupporting a more permanent funding stream for the EWP Program. I have \nintroduced the bill with my home State colleague, Senator Bennet, and \nit has been cosponsored by the senior Senator from Washington, Patty \nMurray.\n  It will not cost a dime, but it will finally change the way we \nstructurally fund the EWP Program by creating a common, unified account \nto provide support to families and communities around the country.\n  This commonsense legislation would also free up dollars that have \nalready been appropriated in the past but have not been used. Unlocking \nthese dollars will not create additional spending but will infuse this \nnewly created account with seed funding to begin clearing out the \nbacklog and helping States such as Colorado finance critical projects \nthat can save lives.\n  Moving forward, my bill sets up a system where appropriators and \nStates impacted in the future can ensure that every dollar made \navailable to the EWP Program is used when needed, and put back into \nthis important, permanent fund when it is not, reducing the threat and \nthe cost of future disasters.\n  As an avid outdoorsman, I am well aware of the dangers presented by \nthe forces of nature. I have been a long-time supporter of EWP and its \nvital relief efforts. The importance of this program was only further \nemphasized to me last September when boulders, water, and debris came \nroaring through Eldorado Canyon, which is just a short mile from my \nhome, and there were scenes like this as well near my home.\n  It has become very clear that every moment we spend trying to piece \ntogether ad hoc funding for this program every year--after these \ndisasters have already occurred--is another moment that could be spent \nrebuilding the homes and the livelihoods of Americans who have been \nstruck by Mother Nature.\n  Americans should not be forced to wonder or worry about partisan \ndivides undermining their ability to access\n\n[[Page S2059]]\n\ncritical resources and services. They shouldn't have to face the \nuncertainty of whether Congress will pass supplemental funding to \nsupport their families and communities after a devastating event such \nas the one we see here that forever changes their lives. And they \ncertainly shouldn't have to wait for Congress in order to access \nessential and proven services from the EWP Program when a disaster \nleaves their homes and communities in shambles. Unfortunately, some in \nthis Congress have shown that they are incapable of rising above \npartisan posturing to help those in need. The reckless partisanship of \nthese individuals nearly prevented us from passing a bill to help the \nstorm-ravaged States affected by Hurricane Sandy and kept the \ngovernment shut down 16 days, even as we in Colorado were struggling to \ntake the important first steps toward recovering from our historic fall \nflooding.\n\n  We cannot let funding as critical as EWP be subjected to this kind of \nrancor, which is why my bill is so important. That is why it is long \npast time EWP receives a solid, dependable funding stream. I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in supporting this legislation, and I look \nforward to working with Senate appropriators to actively finance this \nfund for years to come.\n  With the funding structure created by my bill in place, communities \naround the country that have been knocked off their feet by brutal and \nunanticipated disasters will be able to count on this program to \nimmediately help them get back up and onto the road to recovery. This \nis not only responsible to do, it is right to do.\n  I wish to briefly touch on a slightly different topic but one that is \nalso very important specifically to Colorado; that is, the national \nsecurity, economic, and job-boosting potential of exporting liquid \nnatural gas or LNG.\n  This is a topic which I and many Senators from both sides of the \naisle have been talking about over the recent weeks, particularly in \nlight of the ongoing crisis in Ukraine and Russia's use of its natural \ngas exports as a weapon. Russian aggression and its incursion into the \nCrimean peninsula illustrates precisely the reason we cannot wait any \nlonger to responsibly develop our natural gas reserves and to export \nthis resource abroad.\n  Unfortunately, new facilities to export LNG are on hold right now \nwaiting for approval at the U.S. Department of Energy. While the \nDepartment of Energy approval is only one step in a complex process to \nconstruct a new export facility--a process that includes environmental \naccess and public input--it has become an unacceptable logjam. That is \nwhy I introduced a bill a few weeks ago that would break the logjam and \npave the way for approval of LNG exports to World Trade Organization \nnations, in effect approving the pending applications in the queue.\n  My bill is bipartisan and bicameral, and it would send a signal to \ninternational markets that the days of Russia's monopolistic \nstranglehold on energy supplies is waning. My bill would pave the way \nfor more American jobs and provide a shot in the arm to our economy. \nThat is why I was disappointed to learn that several of my colleagues \nhave decided that another political vote is more important than good \npolicy and decided to push an LNG amendment tied to the approval of the \ncontroversial Keystone XL Pipeline.\n  I voted against both Republican and Democratic Keystone Pipeline \namendments because I believe these political votes by both sides only \nset back progress on the real review process. Tying good LNG policy to \na political vote about an unrelated topic doesn't lead to progress on \neither issue. Instead, it shows the political motivations of those who \nare deciding to go this route.\n  My friend from Wyoming, Senator Barrasso, has a strong bill that \nwould open LNG exports to a targeted group of countries in Europe, \nwhich he tried to attach to the Ukraine aid bill. I agreed with that \neffort. He also filed my bill, which opens LNG more broadly, as an \namendment to that same legislation during the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee markup. Both of these approaches have bipartisan support, \nboth of them would make a difference, and both of them are worthy of \nconsideration.\n  So I invite all of us who want to get something done to abandon \nelection or political gains and focus on what matters. We can leverage \nour natural resources to promote global security, create jobs, and \nprevent power-hungry leaders such as Putin from using energy supplies \nas a weapon. Let's get this done and work together to find a real way \nforward, and let's have a vote.\n  Madam President, thank you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I see Senator Blunt. I ask unanimous \nconsent that at the conclusion of Senator Blunt's remarks, I be \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in \norder for me to offer my amendment on this bill, No. 2885.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, because of the emergency nature of the \nunderlying bipartisan bill to aid about 2.7 million Americans, I would \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, let me talk about why I think we should \nhave this and other amendments on this bill.\n  My friend from Colorado just talked about an amendment that he said \nhe supported last week. Of course, none of us got to support it on the \nUkrainian bill because it wasn't allowed to come up, just like on this \nissue of talking about unemployment extension or the other things that \nour friends on the other side have announced in a pretty aggressive way \nthat they intend to bring up because they just hope to have a political \nissue rather than a process that will actually work.\n  I believe we should have these energy amendments such as the one I am \nproposing on this bill because getting people back to work and being \nconcerned about people's take-home pay, being concerned about what \npeople get to keep of what they earn is an important part of this whole \nprocess.\n  So the amendment my friend objected to would be an amendment that \nwould make it very difficult--it would establish another hurdle before \nanyone could have a carbon tax. This amendment is similar to the one I \noffered during the budget debate this year, and 53 of my colleagues \nsupported it, so a majority of the Members of the Senate are for this \nbut just not the majority it would take in the Senate to get it done.\n  A carbon tax would force families to pay more at the pump. What is a \ncarbon tax? It is a tax on fuels that have some carbon component, and \nthat means fuels such as gasoline, coal-based electricity, and other \nfossil fuels. For this component, you would have to pay more at the gas \npump, you would have to pay more for your heating, more for your \ncooling, more for virtually every product we make in America.\n  The energy bill, the utility bill is a big component of what we make \nin the country today, and it could be one of our huge advantages in \nmanufacturing and job creation, but we are headed in a direction with \nour view of energy that is not the most focused on more American energy \nand that doesn't take advantage of the moment we could be in.\n  Areas where I live in Missouri, people in the South and Midwest--\nfrankly, from about the middle of Pennsylvania to the western edge of \nWyoming--are heavily dependent on coal for electricity. About 50 \npercent of all the electricity in that vast majority of the land mass \nof America is from coal. Eighty-two percent of the electricity produced \nin Missouri is from coal. There are at least five States that have a \nhigher dependency on coal than we do. If we had a cap-and-trade bill, \nthe estimates are that our bill would have gone up about 40 percent \nsince 2013.\n  A carbon tax is disproportionately impactful on people who are \nstruggling to get by. If you want to really do things that impact the \nvulnerable in our society, make the utility bill higher. If you want to \nreally do things that impact the vulnerable in our society who are \nlooking for work, make it harder to put those jobs in the United States \nof America.\n\n[[Page S2060]]\n\n  About 40 million U.S. households that currently earn less than \n$30,000 per year spend almost 20 percent of their income already on \nenergy. Why would we want that percentage to be higher. What you make \nis not nearly as important as what you are able to use to advance your \nfamily. If the utility bill is 30 percent of what you make or 40 \npercent of what you make instead of 20 percent, obviously the other \nthings you would have done with that money could not have been, done.\n  These are the households that can least afford to have the new \nenergy-efficient refrigerators. These are the last households to get \nthe better windows, the last houses to get more insulation in the \nceiling and the walls, the first houses where people have to think \nabout, What room do we shut off this winter because we cannot use all \nthe rooms in the house in the way we would like to? It would be nice to \nbe able to fill up your tank rather than stand at the gas pump and \nwonder, Can I possibly afford to put more gas in than that pump has \nalready shown on prices that are already too high.\n  There are lots of amendments on this bill about energy, none of \nwhich, I am told, will be allowed, and I think that is a tragedy.\n  A 2013 study by the National Association of Manufacturers found that \nthe overall effect of a carbon tax on American jobs would be \nstaggering, with a loss of worker income equivalent to about $13 \nmillion and 1.5 million jobs. Why would we want to take that out of our \neconomy when we can not only keep it there, but by enhancing more \nAmerican energy, we could expand it?\n  The utility bill is an increasingly important part of job creation. \nEnergy-sensitive industries such as chemicals, auto manufacturing, iron \nand steel manufacturing, cement, mining, and refining sectors are the \nhardest hit by a carbon tax, and these sectors would see a big drop in \ntheir manufacturing output.\n  So if we had the kind of debate we ought to have, it would be a \ndebate about how we get people back to work rather than how we continue \nto extend benefits in a policy that was never intended to have never-\nending benefits. This system doesn't work. It doesn't work for people \nwho pay into the system or draw out of the system if we abuse it.\n  I think we all know this is not the debate we should be having this \nweek, and I would like to see us have a debate on how we could improve \nthe economy while we deal with this so-called immediate need that we \nare talking about on the floor instead of the things we ought to be \ntalking about.\n  I wish to talk for a few minutes about the announcements yesterday \nabout how many people have signed up for the President's health care \nplan. As I said when the Web site wouldn't work, it is not about \nwhether the Web site works. Frankly, it is not even about how many \npeople sign up. This is about whether this is the right direction for \nus to go as a country. Is this health care more affordable, and will \nmore people be insured, and will the people who are insured be insured \nwith policies they can afford and coverage they want?\n  The President, of course, and everybody understands the Web site had \nits problems. I think we would be really remiss if we decided--if \nmaking the Web site work was the test of the program or, frankly, \nmaking people sign up was the test of the program.\n  This debate is not over. It shouldn't be over. We need to continue to \nlook for ways to try to make this work better because I certainly \ncontinue to hear from Missourians who tell me that the course they are \non is hurting their families, hurting their job opportunities.\n  The law of unintended consequences appears to be the law here that is \nmost likely to be applied, the unintended consequences of people who \nare going to work part time, the unintended consequences of people who \nare looking at a job that used to be a full-time job but now the \ngovernment said: You don't have to provide benefits unless somebody \nworks 30 hours a week. I guess what the government really said was that \nyou have to provide benefits when they do work 30 hours a week. But \npeople immediately look at that and the society adjusts to that \ngovernment determination. So suddenly people are working 28 and 29 and \n20 hours without benefits where they might have been working those same \nhours before with some level of benefits or might have--more \nimportantly for their families--been working full time before.\n  We are going to continue to talk about this law and how it serves \npeople. Let me give a couple of quick examples as I conclude this \nmorning.\n  I had a person in the office this morning who was here for another \npurpose. He is a radiologist from Cape Girardeau, MO, and he said he \nreceived notice that his insurance was going to go up $500 a month for \nthe same coverage until the President made the decision to suspend the \nlaw, which is a totally different debate topic, whether the President \ncan do that. But when the President suspended the application of this \nlaw, which everybody is supposed to be so excited about, they were able \nto keep the policy they had for another year, and it was $500 a month \nless--$6,000 a year less for that family.\n  Here is some information I got today from Sherry in Shelbyville, MO, \nwho said that her 18-year-old son has had cerebral palsy his whole \nlife. They had a medicine that works that allows him to deal with this. \nLast year a 3-month supply of this particular medicine went from $125 \nto $1,086--almost a $1,000 increase. But that may or may not be \nimpacted by what is happening with overall health care policies. What \nwas impacted this year was her family's deductible. Their deductible \nwent from $500 to $5,000. They were paying $500 on a 3-month supply of \nmedicine. A 1-year supply of that medicine cost a little over $4,000. \nThey were paying $500 of that, and now they are paying all of that.\n\n  Her view--which would be the view of most working families--is: We \nhad insurance we could afford, we had insurance that met our needs, and \nnow we are paying $3,500 more than we were paying. For almost any \nfamily, $300 a month makes a big difference. It particularly makes a \ndifference for families who are struggling and already dealing with a \nhealth problem.\n  Pete from Jackson, MO, receives health care benefits through his \nemployer, but his wife and two children had health insurance through an \nindependent carrier. His wife and children's plan will be dropped \nNovember 30 of this year. Their new plan will cost $1,200 per month \ninstead of $530 for similar coverage they have right now.\n  By the way, these are just a few of the letters from the top of the \nlist. If I had more time, I could certainly read more letters.\n  I have a letter from Greg who is from St. Joseph. His out-of-pocket \nexpenses went from $2,500 per year to $10,000 per year. He is paying \nthat by going into his 401(k) retirement plan. If anybody thinks Greg \nand his family are better off from this new change in the law by paying \n$10,000 out of pocket instead of the $2,500 out of pocket--and he is \nhaving to dip into his retirement plan to help pay for his health \ninsurance--I would like to hear from them.\n  There are people who had insurance before this new law, and although \nthey have insurance now through the exchange, they just happen to be \npaying in many cases a lot more and have a deductible that is a lot \nhigher. I think that would be a great debate for us to have on the \nfloor now that we know, as a country, what is at stake.\n  What do we do to be sure the best health care system in the world \nworks better for everybody? How do we make changes so that those who \nare outside of the system have a better chance to be a part of that \nsystem rather than penalizing everybody who had insurance they thought \nwas working for them?\n  I yield the floor to my friend from Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I rise today to discuss the underlying \nlegislation, which is so critical. It is an emergency. On December 28, \nwe stopped extending unemployment benefits for at that point 1.3 \nmillion Americans. These are individuals who were working and who are \nlooking for work, since that is the only way you can collect these \nbenefits.\n  Since that time, they have been without the very modest support that \nemergency unemployment insurance provides. It provides about $300 a \nweek. We are trying, on a bipartisan basis, to\n\n[[Page S2061]]\n\nmove this legislation through this body and get it to the House so \nthese people can get some help and support as they continue to look for \nwork.\n  This legislation will support a program that is vital to 2.7 million \nAmericans, and it is a bipartisan compromise. This is not something \nthat is being jammed through exclusively at the will of the majority. \nThis has been an effort that began months ago. First we worked with \nSenator Heller and then other colleagues--Senator Collins, Senator \nMurkowski, Senator Portman, and Senator Kirk.\n  We listened to their suggestions and incorporated them so we could \nmove forward on a bipartisan basis as we have done on so many different \ntopics. We would like to have a vote, move it to the House, and have it \nsigned by the President so we can get the relief, support, and \nassistance to these Americans. Again, I have to emphasize that they are \nonly qualified for this program because they lost their jobs through no \nfault of their own, and they are continuing to look for work in a very \ndifficult economy.\n  The one other thing I wanted to mention, which is very important, is \nwe are building on significant changes to the unemployment compensation \nlaws that were passed in 2012. At that time the chairman of the Ways \nand Means Committee in the House of Representatives, Chairman Dave Camp \nof Michigan, described these as historic reforms. Our goal, as I said \nmany times during the past few weeks and months, and prior to and since \nthe ending of these benefits on December 28, is to find a path forward \nto a rather straightforward extension of the benefits. Again, this is a \ntemporary extension. It is a 5-month total window, but with each day \nmore of it is retroactive. The reason we wanted to look for a very \nstraightforward proposal is that, first, it would recognize the \nimportant changes and reforms that were made in 2012. Many of the ideas \nI have seen and heard discussed around here actually were considered \nthoughtfully in 2012 and incorporated in many cases--not all cases--\ninto the legislation.\n  The other thing we want to do is make this as administratively \nfeasible as possible to implement by the State agencies. Adding \nsignificant changes, such as adding a training component that didn't \nexist before, not only complicated the implementation, but when you \nstop and step back, it usually costs money.\n  One of the underlying premises, particularly from my colleagues who \nworked with us from the Republican side, is that this whole effort has \nto be fully funded. This bill is fully offset during this ten year \nbudgetary window. This is paid for, it incorporates the ideas and \nsuggestions from my colleagues on the other side, and it is now time to \nmove for passage.\n  I recognize there are many issues we could deal with in the Senate. \nMany of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle have come to us with \ntheir issues. But to do that would undercut the ability to, in timely \nmanner,--today or I hope tomorrow, but certainly this week--pass this \nlegislation and move forward.\n  Millions of Americans are facing a crisis. They are out of work and \nlooking for a job. In my State there are probably two applicants for \nevery job, and in many cases there are probably three or four \napplicants for every job. We also recognize this is a long-term \nunemployed population that is different in some respects than previous \nepisodes of unemployment. There are indications and suggestions that \nthey are older on average. They are also facing a situation where the \neconomy has been very difficult for many years.\n  Many of them are homeowners who can't sell their house because of the \nmarket so they can't move to an area where there is work. Many of them, \nparticularly if they are middle-aged, have responsibilities to mothers \nand fathers who may have health issues, and children they have to \nsupport. The overall situation is that these individuals are facing a \nvery difficult challenge.\n  There is a very thoughtful paper by the former chair of the \nPresident's Council of Economic Advisers, Alan Krueger, and his \ncolleagues. They described the difficulty of these unemployed Americans \nin this economy, particularly for the long-term unemployed.\n  We have seen periods of significant unemployment. I can recall the \n1980s, when unemployment hit 10 percent, but normally there is a \nrelatively fast response once the right fiscal and monetary policies \nare put in place. Some of that was because of the mobility of the \nAmerican people back then, contrasted to people who are now tied to \ntheir home because they can't sell it, and some of it is due to the \nrelative age of the unemployed back then where the mobility was not as \nmuch of a factor as it is today.\n  We are trying to help these people who have, in many cases, worked \nfor decades and now for the first time find themselves in a very \ndifficult situation.\n  If you look overall, there are 10.4 million Americans who are out of \nwork but are looking for that job--for that fair shot--so they have a \nchance to move on and be a part of the American economy. Extending \nemergency unemployment benefits to these 2.7 million people is just one \npart of the efforts we have to undertake. No one should be under the \nimpression that this is a solution. No. This is just a response to the \nincredible need of these very worthwhile Americans who are looking for \nwork.\n  I do note that this aid is very targeted. I cannot repeat it enough. \nThere is this sort of notion out there that this is sort of a giveaway \nto people who are undeserving. Well, the benefits are targeted to \npeople who meet very specific criteria and, most importantly, they have \nto have an adequate work history to be eligible for unemployment \ninsurance in the first place. They have to be workers. We are trying to \nhelp workers. They have to have lost their job through no fault of \ntheir own--they were laid off. It is not as though they didn't like \ntheir job and left, or had problems in the workplace and were not \nfitting in. These are people who want to work, and they were told they \ncannot work any longer. They were downsized, they were outsourced--all \nthe 10K euphemisms for saying, ``We don't need you anymore.'' Well, \nthey are important people who want to work, and they have to actively \nlook for work in order to qualify for benefits. This is not an open-\nended benefit to individuals who have no end in sight. They are either \ngoing to find a job or exhaust these benefits.\n  One of the reforms we did in 2012, frankly, was to shrink the period \nof time. Previous to 2012, there were 73 weeks of emergency extended \nbenefits. We shrunk that down to 47 weeks. So this notion that this is \nan unending, indefinite, long-term benefit to people who don't earn it \nis completely incorrect.\n  This program has been in effect for a very long time. Indeed, some \nform of it has been put in place since 2008 when George W. Bush was the \nPresident, when we first started seeing the signs of increasing \nunemployment. This was in conjunction with the near collapse of many \nfinancial institutions, in 2007 and 2008. The housing market was \nliterally coming off the tracks. The consequences for the American \neconomy at that time were probably the most severe since the Great \nDepression. One of the ways we have been dealing with these issues \nbegan with President Bush, and continuing now with President Obama, is \nemergency unemployment compensation benefits for Americans.\n  I think we have to look at and be conscious of all of the facts and \ndata. We are also at a point where we have to recognize there are two \nprograms. There is a State program, which covers the first 26 weeks, \nand then there is the emergency Federal unemployment benefits program.\n  This emergency program, in some respects, is becoming much more \ncritical, because what we find now is that the long-term unemployed are \nprobably twice the number you would typically associate with an economy \nsuch as ours at the present moment. We have unemployment rates that \nrange from the high--unfortunately Rhode Island is at 9 percent--to the \nvery low. There are some States because of the commodities--\nparticularly energy commodities--that virtually have no unemployment.\n  At this point we should not see the kind of long-term unemployed we \nare seeing. The Federal program--not the State program, which is the \nfirst 26 weeks--is going to help these people\n\n[[Page S2062]]\n\nwho are particularly struggling. It is a targeted program--very much \ntargeted--but it has an outsized impact. Not only are the workers who \nare receiving this very modest weekly stipend of roughly $300 a week \nable to pay for essentials, but it has a very positive effect on our \noverall economy.\n  All of my colleagues are here today saying, listen, not only do we \nhave to help these people, but more importantly, we have to grow this \neconomy. Well, by the way, the legislation we are proposing does \nboth. These emergency benefits have been repeatedly analyzed by \neconomists, and they have been determined to provide a significantly \ngreater bang for the buck than many other programs being talked about \ntoday on the floor that are being suggested as alternatives or \ncomplements to what we are talking about. That is why the Congressional \nBudget Office, in a very modest and conservative analysis, projected \nthat if we fail to extend these emergency benefits through 2014--\nthrough the whole year--it would cost our economy 200,000 jobs. So \nthose people who are opposing these benefits are basically saying we \nare not interested in at least part of these 200,000 jobs.\n\n  It is not, as they often say, rocket science. What happens to this \nmoney is it goes to a family who desperately needs it immediately to \nrepair the car, to buy groceries, to take care of the necessities of \nlife. So this money is not going to be put aside for a rainy day. It is \nnot going to be exported overseas for a venture some place. It is going \nto be used locally in the economy--at the grocery store, at the service \nstation, at the dry cleaners, and to pay for the cell phone so a person \ncan stay in touch to see if they get that job and if they are offered a \njob. That effect of immediately putting money in the economy \nimmediately generates more economic activity. It is the fact that at \nthe local coffee shop a person will come in and get a cup of coffee and \nmaybe be able to afford something else too. That goes to the ability of \nthat local coffee shop to keep some more people on to work the \ncounters. It has a cumulative effect.\n  The economists have measured it, and it is much more than the dollars \nwe are putting into it. It has a multiplier effect. So what we are \ndoing is not only providing the necessary support for these deserving \nfamilies; we are providing an injection of economic activity into our \neconomy--precisely what all of my colleagues are saying we have to do. \nLet's do it. We can do it. We are very close. On a bipartisan basis, we \nare hopefully hours away, I hope, from getting this done, and then \nsending it over to the House.\n  Then, we need to ask our colleagues on the other side of the Capitol \nto consider not only the bipartisan nature of this bill but also the \nfact that it not only provides economic stimulus, but it also is \nfiscally responsible. We have paid for these efforts. That was insisted \nupon, and we have certainly acceded to that request by so many of our \ncolleagues.\n  Now, with respect to reforms of the temporary program, and even the \npermanent State program, as I said before, we made significant reforms \nin 2012. I was a member of the conference committee, at the request of \nthe chairman of the Senate Finance Committee to participate, \nparticularly in the deliberations about the unemployment insurance \ncompensation program. These 2012 reforms go a long way to make the \nsystem better. Can we make more improvements? Of course. Can we shift \nto a related but an important topic, which is job training, through the \nWorkforce Investment Act? Yes, we can, and we should. But we shouldn't \nhold this legislation hostage to training improvements and to \nadditional reform.\n  One of the reforms which we worked to enhance in the bill before us \ntoday, which was implemented in 2012, is the Reemployment Service and \nReemployment Eligibility Assessment, or the RES and REA. I have to \nthank Senator Collins, particularly. She was insistent that we provide \na way to better link up individuals looking for work and the jobs that \nare available. This is a mechanism that does this. This is an evidence-\nbased reform that has been successful in getting individuals back to \nwork sooner. It also helps to ensure individuals are receiving the \nproper benefit. It addresses one of the major concerns we received from \nthe House Ways and Means Committee Republicans with respect to \noverpayments. Essentially, what it does is it requires--there is one \nassessment in the program right now--a second assessment at a certain \nperiod during the extended benefits. So an individual would have to \ncome in and essentially be counseled. They would also verify the person \nis searching for work, that the benefits are appropriate, and also give \nthe kind of counseling and assistance and help that is shown by \nevidence to be effective in linking job seekers to jobs. We are very \ncommitted to this improvement. This is one of the improvements we put \ninto the legislation. We have provided the funding for State agencies \nto take care of it.\n  So this is something we think is going to be a direct beneficial \nsolution to a legitimate issue raised by so many. How do we connect \nthose who are unemployed today with the jobs that are out there?\n  I will say something else, too, about this. There has been some \nsuggestion that there are a lot of overpayments in the system and that \npeople are really getting more than they should. Well RESs and REAs \nplay an important program integrity role, not just providing counsel to \nthe individual. They also have to ensure that the people are, in fact, \nactively seeking work. This legislation is saying these individuals \nhave to physically come to the State agency, not just at the first \ntier, when they start it, but at the third tier--that is the way we \nbreak it up--several weeks into the process of emergency unemployment \nbenefits. Doing that--their physical presence in the office, talking to \na counselor--helps the system be more legitimate, and it helps the \naccountability because the individual State counselor will be able to \ncheck on how faithful they are to the program and how consistent their \nbenefits are. That double check is part of the legislation which I \nthink will be effective and efficient. We want both effectiveness and \nefficiency. As I indicated before, it is fully paid for, so it is not \nan additional burden to States.\n  In the 2012 reforms, we also included my work-sharing initiative. \nThis is critical. I have heard from so many companies in Rhode Island \nthat before the 2012 legislation, there were a few States--Rhode Island \nwas one--that were actually doing something very creative. They said \nthat instead of laying a person off totally, if you keep the person \nemployed for a certain number of days and provide their benefits, we \nwill pay for the one or two days they don't work. It is a partial \npayment. That has been able to allow companies to really keep their \ncore group of workers together. Instead of throwing someone out and \nsaying they are sorry, as well as losing their expertise and losing \ntheir skills, they have been able to keep their operation moving. It is \na smart way of doing it. It has been very successful in Rhode Island, \nand it is now a national option. That is because of an initiative from \n2012 that was a good reform and a smart, efficient way to use the \ntaxpayers' dollars.\n  With respect to work search generally, the 2012 reforms for the first \ntime created a uniform standard for both the State-based program and \nthe temporary emergency program to ensure that States require that in \norder to be eligible, individuals need to be ``able, available, and \nactively seek[ing] work.'' We also passed a reform to better recover \nimproper payments by requiring States to offset their current State \nbenefits in order to recover overpayments owed to other States and the \nFederal Government. So program integrity, program efficiency, and \nprogram effectiveness were significantly embodied in the 2012 \namendments.\n\n  We are looking at a program that just 2 years ago has been \nsignificantly reformed--in fact, as I said, according to the chairman \nof the Republican Ways and Means Committee, historically reformed. So \nthis program is one that we can support and we should support.\n  Back in 2012 we also provided up to 10 demonstration projects in \nStates that could be granted waivers on their State-based unemployment \ninsurance program if they could come up with proposals that would \nimprove the effectiveness of their reemployment efforts. This was an \nopportunity to give the States flexibility, to test out new ideas. Some \nof the new ideas my colleagues have shared with me--we\n\n[[Page S2063]]\n\nshould do this or that--the States--at least 10 States--have that \nopportunity to apply today to do that. I don't think we need to \nreinvent that opportunity in this legislation since it is on an \nemergency, short-term basis. That authority sunsets at the end of 2015. \nBut it is very telling, because since 2012, 10 States have had the \noption, but no States have taken up these proposals. So many of the \ngood ideas my colleagues have suggested haven't passed muster at the \nState level. One would think if they were that compelling, if they were \nthat efficient, that affordable, that one State, at least, would have \ntaken the option, out of 10 available, to try these proposals.\n  The 2012 reforms also allowed States to drug screen and test \nindividuals if they were terminated from prior employment for drug use \nor if they were applying for work for which passing a drug test was a \nstandard eligibility requirement. I mention this because we have \npersistently heard proposals--particularly from the other side of the \nCapitol--oh, we have a drug test proposal, et cetera. Guess what. \nStates already have the option to do that now. So it is not a reason to \nstop today and say we have to fix this problem.\n  I think this whole issue of drug testing, though, deserves a further \ncomment. It is somewhat of a presumption that people who are applying \nfor these benefits somehow are more susceptible to drug dependency, and \nthat is not accurate. In fact, reflecting back to my previous comments, \nthere are so many people now, particularly the longer term unemployed, \nwho are middle-aged colleagues or slightly younger than I am, who have \nspent 20 or 35 years working, et cetera. They are not the typical \nperson who one would suspect of that. But when we looked at data from \nthe TANF realm--there were related arguments for testing in TANF--it \nturns out that individuals who are tested in these TANF programs, which \nis a welfare program, actually show an average of slightly less drug \nusage than the average American. So this whole drug issue has to be \ndisabused. But, for the record, there are in the 2012 reforms, \nopportunities for States if they feel so compelled to exercise some of \nthese options.\n  So the record demonstrates clearly that we have made extensive \nreforms. Additionally, as I said, in this legislation, we are requiring \na second assessment process which I think is going to be very efficient \nand very effective.\n  This raises the final point. We have tried to keep this very simple. \nEven so, the State administrators came forward with a letter saying: \nThis is going to be very difficult for us. The letter was refuted point \nby point by the Secretary of Labor, Tom Perez. Secretary Perez was the \nformer director of these programs for the State of Maryland. He knows \nbetter than anyone what it takes to make these programs work. He has \ncommitted that the Department of Labor not only will--but can--be sure \nthat these programs, as we have written them today, will be fully and \neffectively implemented.\n  So I hope my colleagues really come together. I thank my colleagues \nwho already have joined together to get this legislation moving. Time \nis literally ticking. This is a 5-month bill. This is not a long-term, \nindefinite bill. The clock is ticking, so that every day more benefits \nare retroactive than prospective. We want to give people the chance. \nThey have worked for it all of their lives--many of them--and now, in \nmany cases, this is the first time they have really struggled.\n  With that, I yield the floor because I see my colleague, the Senator \nfrom Kansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. I ask unanimous consent that it may be in order for me to \noffer an amendment that has been designated No. 2911.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, reserving the right to object, and not \nelaborating much further than the comments I already made, but in order \nto get this bipartisan emergency legislation completed which will \naffect 2.7 million Americans, I would respectfully object to my \ncolleague's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. Madam President, we were here last evening on this topic \nfor consideration by the Senate. The amendment I was offering that the \nSenator from Rhode Island has objected to in my view is one of the many \namendments that could be considered in this legislation--certainly \nshould be considered by this Senate. While I am certainly interested \nand willing to have a discussion about the extension of unemployment \nbenefits, it seems to me that this Senate ought also to be looking at \nissues that would reduce the chances that individual Americans--workers \nacross the country--need that extension. We ought to be doing the \nthings we are not doing here in the Senate. In fact, in my view, this \nSenate and this President have done nothing to increase the \nopportunities for Americans to keep their jobs, to increase their \nemployment opportunities, to get a higher wage, to expand their \neconomic opportunity in this country.\n  The amendment I was offering, which has been objected to, is one of \nthose many examples of legislation that, once again, gets ignored on \nthe Senate floor. It is not considered by any committee and is not \nallowed to be made in order.\n  Again, the process in the Senate has broken down so that individual \nSenators who have good ideas, at least who believe they have good ideas \nabout how we can make life better for Americans, are not being enabled \nthe opportunity to offer those amendments for consideration by the \nSenate.\n  In fact, there have now been 70 amendments offered to this \nlegislation. It appears that none of those 70 will be considered while \nwe consider this issue of extension of unemployment benefits. The \namendment would, in my view, increase the opportunity for every \nAmerican to find a better job.\n  We know that if we are going to increase economic activity, create \njobs in this country, the statistics show, the facts show, academic and \nreal-life experiences demonstrate that entrepreneurs--individuals who \nhave a dream to start a business, who work in their garage or their \nbackyard or their barn, decide that they have something they can \ncontribute to the consumer in this country and they pursue that dream--\nhave the best opportunity that we have in this country to create jobs \nfor other Americans.\n  So the amendment I offered would be legislation called Startup Act \n3.0. This is not just the Senator from Kansas or not just a Republican \nSenator in the Senate offering this amendment, it is a bipartisan \namendment offered by me and one of my Democratic colleagues, but the \nunderlying legislation actually has more Democratic sponsors than it \nhas Republican sponsors. Again, it is the kind of thing that one would \nexpect some consideration in the Senate.\n  Unfortunately, this legislation was offered 3 years ago, shortly \nafter I came to the Senate. So my frustration is not that just this \nopportunity today is being denied me and my colleagues who support the \nconcept of promoting entrepreneurship, but it has been denied for \ncertainly more than 2 years, almost 3 years, when we have facts, \nacademicians who tell us these are exactly the kind of things that \nwould increase the chances that Americans are better off today and in \nthe future.\n  This legislation deals with the regulatory environment, the Tax Code, \naccess to capital, federally funded research put into the hands of the \nprivate sector more quickly, the opportunity for Americans to better \ncompete in the battle for global talent, all things that are just \ncommon sense and my guess is would be agreed to. If we would ever have \na vote on the Senate floor about this concept, I would not be surprised \nthat overwhelmingly my colleagues would support this.\n  There is nothing in here that is a partisan issue. There is nothing \nin here that is significantly controversial. We can argue or debate the \ndetails, we can improve this legislation, but we are never given the \nchance to pursue that goal. It is certainly disappointing to me that \nonce again legislation that would address the underlying problems we \nface in this country, the inability of Americans to keep jobs, improve \ntheir job circumstance, and create a brighter future for the next \ngeneration of Americans, is something this Senate, for the last 3 \nyears, has determined does not\n\n[[Page S2064]]\n\nhave merit for even consideration, either in a committee or on the \nSenate floor.\n  For those who are interested in the details of this legislation, I \nwould refer them to my remarks on the Senate floor last evening.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I rise to try to advance important \nlegislation to fully authorize 27 Veterans Affairs clinics around the \ncountry in 18 different States, in communities that desperately need \nthese facilities for our veterans, including two in Louisiana, \nLafayette and Lake Charles.\n  These clinics have been on the books, planned for, approved for quite \na while. Unfortunately, they ran into several bureaucratic glitches and \nhurdles. In the case of our two clinics in Louisiana, the first thing \nwas a flatout mistake, a screwup at the VA, which they fully admit to. \nThey made some errors in the contract letting process. Because of that, \nthey had to stop that entire bidding process and back up and start all \nover.\n  That basically cost us 1 year in terms of those vital community-based \nclinics in Lafayette and Lake Charles. Then, as they were into that \nyear of delay, out of the blue the Congressional Budget Office decided \nto score these sorts of clinics in a different way than they ever did \nbefore. That created a scoring issue with regard to all 27 of these \nclinics in 18 States.\n  On a bipartisan basis, a number of us went to work on that issue to \nclear that up. We have solved that issue, and the House has put a bill \ntogether with strong bipartisan support--virtually unanimous support--\nand has passed the bill that resolved that issue.\n  It came to the Senate. I reached out to all of my colleagues. There \nwere a few concerns, and I addressed those concerns proactively by \nfinding savings in other parts of the budget to off-balance, counteract \nany possible costs of this bill, and so we added that amendment to that \nproposal. Through all of that hard work, we have addressed all of the \nsubstantive concerns with moving forward on these 27 clinics.\n  I have been trying to pass this bill with an amendment at the desk so \nthat these 27 clinics can move forward as expeditiously as possible. As \nI said, every substantive concern about this bill, as it would be \namended, has been met--everybody's concerns, conservatives, moderates, \nliberals.\n  The only objection to the bill now is from the distinguished Senator \nfrom Vermont, who, quite frankly, wants to hold it hostage, wants to \nobject to it, simply to try to advance his much broader veterans bill \nwhich he brought to the floor and was unsuccessful in passing several \nweeks ago. While I appreciate the Senator's passion on this issue--I \nappreciate his legislation and his focus on it--the problem is that \nlegislation does have many Senators with concerns about it, including \nme. Forty-three Senators, forty-three percent of the overall Senate, 43 \nout of 100, have serious, substantive concerns with that much broader \nbill.\n  In contrast to that, no one in the Senate has substantive concerns \nwith my narrower bill with regard to 27 VA clinics around the country.\n  I simply suggest that we agree on important matters we can agree on; \nwe use that to begin to build consensus to move forward constructively, \ndo what we can agree on, and continue to work on that on which there is \nsome disagreement.\n  In that spirit, I come to the floor again to ask unanimous consent \nthat the Veterans' Affairs Committee be discharged from further \nconsideration of the narrow veterans clinics bill I was referring to, \nH.R. 3521, and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration; that \nmy amendment, which is at the desk, which I also referred to, be agreed \nto; that the bill, as amended, be read a third time and passed, and the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Reserving the right to object, I thank my colleague from \nLouisiana for coming to the floor today to talk about, in fact, an \nimportant issue.\n  Before I respond to him directly, I did want to comment he is right, \nthere were 43 Members of the Senate who voted against what is regarded \nas the most comprehensive veterans legislation to have been introduced \nin several decades, legislation that was supported by virtually every \nveterans organization in the country, including the American Legion, \nVeterans of Foreign Wars, the Disabled American Veterans, Vietnam \nVeterans of America, the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, the \nGold Star Wives, and dozens and dozens of other veterans organizations.\n  If I might point out that while my colleague from Louisiana is, of \ncourse, right that there were 43 Senators who voted no, he neglected to \nmention that there were 56 Senators who voted yes. There was one \nSenator who was absent on that day who would have voted yes.\n  We are now at the stage where we have 57 Senators, which I would \nsuggest to my colleague from Louisiana is significantly more than 43 \npercent, it is 57 percent.\n  If we could have the cooperation--and I hope we can maybe make some \nprogress right here, now, from my colleague from Louisiana who has \nshown interest in veterans issues--do you know what, we can do \nsomething that millions and millions of veterans and their families \nwant us to do.\n  If my colleague from Louisiana would allow me, I would like to quote \nfrom what the Disabled American Veterans, the DAV, has to say about \nthis legislation--which, unfortunately my colleague from Louisiana \nvoted against. He was one of the 43 who voted against it.\n  DAV says:\n\n       This massive omnibus bill, unprecedented in our modern \n     experience, would create, expand, advance, and extend a \n     number of VA benefits, services and programs that are \n     important to the DAV and to our members. For example, \n     responding to a call from DAV as a leading veterans \n     organization, it would create a comprehensive family \n     caregiver support program for all generations of severely \n     wounded, injured and ill veterans. Also, the bill would \n     authorize advance appropriations for VA's mandatory funding \n     accounts to ensure that in any government shutdown \n     environment in the future, veterans benefits payments would \n     not be delayed or put in jeopardy. This measure would also \n     provide additional financial support to survivors of \n     servicemembers who die in the line of duty, as well as \n     expanded access for them to GI Bill educational benefits. A \n     two-plus year stalemate in VA's authority to lease facilities \n     for health care treatment and other purposes would be solved \n     by this bill . . .\n\n  --which, of course, is what the Senator from Louisiana is referring \nto. Then they continue:\n\n       . . . These are but a few of the myriad provisions of this \n     bill that would improve the lives, health, and prospects of \n     veterans--especially the wounded, injured and ill--and their \n     loved ones.\n\n  That is the DAV. I ask my colleague from Louisiana--you are raising \nan important issue, and I agree with you. But what I cannot do is take \nthis issue over here, separate it, and that issue over here, because \ntomorrow there will be somebody else coming and saying: You know, \nSenator Sanders, I want you to move forward on this. Then the next day \nsomebody else comes forward and says: I want to move forward on that.\n  We have a comprehensive piece of legislation, supported by millions \nof veterans, and supported by 57 Members of the Senate. I ask my \ncolleague from Louisiana--who is concerned about veterans' issues--work \nwith us, support us, give us the three Republican votes we need. We had \n55, 54 Members of the Democratic Caucus. We only had two Republican \nvotes. Help me get three more votes. You will get these facilities in \nLouisiana, we will get these facilities all over the country, but we \nwill also address many of the major crises facing the veterans \ncommunity.\n  With that, Madam President, I would object to my colleague's \nproposal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Reclaiming the floor and reclaiming the time, I find this \napproach very unfortunate. To follow through on the scenario the \nSenator from Vermont himself laid out, yes, we can find agreement here \non the floor,\n\n[[Page S2065]]\n\nbut then, ``Katy, bar the door.'' That might lead to our finding \nagreement on other important matters that can help veterans, and we \nmight be moving forward in this area and that area and the other one. \nGod forbid that we make progress to help veterans and actually get \nsomething done versus having a hostage standoff. God forbid. I think \nthe more productive way of working together is to agree on what we can \nagree on and keep talking about those areas where we have disagreement.\n  In fact, in the past Senator Sanders has endorsed that approach in \nthe area of veterans affairs. He has said, in the past, working on \nanother issue in November of 2013:\n\n       I'm happy to tell you that I think that was a concern of \n     his . . .\n\n  This was referring to another Senator. He continues:\n\n       . . . we got that UC'd last night. So we moved that pretty \n     quickly, and I want to try to do those things, where we have \n     agreement, let's move it.\n\n  He agreed on a small focus bill where we did have agreement. He said, \nlet's do that by unanimous consent, let's agree where we can agree and \nbe constructive and move on. He said, ``I want to try to do those \nthings where we have agreement, let's move it.''\n  Well, I would say to Senator Sanders, through the Chair, we have \nagreement. This is an important matter. Twenty-seven clinics isn't the \nworld, but it is an important matter that affects hundreds of thousands \nof veterans in 18 States, including in my Louisiana communities of \nLafayette and Lake Charles. We have agreement, so let's move it. I \nagree with that approach. I think that is a constructive approach \nversus saying: I have majority support, but not the 60 required, so I \nam holding everything else veterans-related hostage, I am not agreeing \nto anything else.\n  I don't think that is a constructive approach. I don't think that \nreflects the spirit of the American people who want us to try to reach \nagreement where we can reach agreement. I don't think that is a \nconstructive way to build goodwill and to build consensus.\n  I would urge my colleague, with all due respect, to reconsider. Let's \nagree where we can agree, where we have agreement. Let's move forward \nwhere we have agreement. Let's move it.\n  This isn't the world, but it is meaningful, it is significant, and it \ndoes not relieve any pressure in terms of the broader veterans \ndiscussion regarding the Sanders bill or the Burr alternative or \nanything else. Those bills are so much massively larger that these 27 \nclinics, being done separately, do not change the discussion or the \ndynamics of this in any way, shape, or form.\n  I would urge my colleague to reconsider. I would urge my colleague \nfrom Louisiana, Senator Landrieu, to urge Senator Sanders to \nreconsider, something she has not done to date. A lot of us are waiting \nfor her support of these important community-based clinics in Lafayette \nand Lake Charles. She hasn't been on the floor. I urge her to join me \non the floor to get this done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. First, I would tell you that--two things in terms of \nSenator Landrieu. She has, in fact, spoken to me on numerous occasions \nabout her concerns about this issue but, more importantly, she has \nshown a willingness to stand for all veterans in this country, and she \nvoted for the legislation supported by the American Legion, the DAV, \nand the Vietnam Veterans of America and virtually every veterans \norganization. So I thank Senator Landrieu very much for her support for \ncomprehensive legislation that would benefit millions and millions of \nAmericans.\n  Essentially, what the Senator from Louisiana is saying is let's work \ntogether. I agree with him, let us work together. I have 57 votes for \nthis piece of legislation. Right now, I ask my friend from Louisiana, \nwork with us. What are your objections at a time when we have given \nhuge tax breaks to billionaires and millionaires, and when one out of \nfour corporations in this country doesn't pay a nickel in Federal \nincome taxes. Does my colleague from Louisiana think that in this \ncountry we should not take care of the men and women who have put their \nlives on the line to defend this country?\n  I am prepared, my staff is prepared, to sit down and hear the \nSenator's objections. I am not sure what his objections are. He hasn't \ntold me. Is the Senator opposed to an expansion of the caregivers \nprogram? Is he? So that 70-year-old women who have been taking care of \ntheir husbands who lost their legs in Vietnam get a modest bit of help? \nIs that an objection the Senator has? Is the Senator objecting to the \nfact that maybe we provide dental care to some veterans whose teeth are \nrotting in their mouths? Is the Senator objecting to advance \nappropriations so we are not in a situation where if we have another \ngovernment shutdown, disabled vets will not get the checks they need? \nIs the Senator objecting to the fact that right now we have young \nveterans who are trying to go to college through the GI bill but can't \nget in-State tuition? Is the Senator objecting to that? Is the Senator \nobjecting to helping veterans find jobs in an economy where it is very \nhard to do so?\n  I am not quite sure what the Senator's objection is. Tell me. Tell me \nnow or sit down with my staff and me, and maybe we can work it out and \ndo something of real significance for the veterans of this country.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nthe consideration of Calendar No. 297, S. 1950; that a Sanders \nsubstitute amendment, the text of S. 1982, the Comprehensive Veterans \nHealth and Benefits and Military Pay Restoration Act, be agreed to; the \nbill, as amended, be read a third time and passed; and the motions to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, with no \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Reserving the right to object, I would again point out \nthat I am not only going to object to this, there are 43 Senators who \nhave serious substantive concerns with this very broad and expansive \nbill, and those concerns and objections have been laid out. They have \nbeen laid out by my staff, in meetings with the staff of the Senator \nfrom Vermont, and they have been laid out by the Republican ranking \nmember on the committee, Senator Burr. I share the general concerns of \nSenator Burr about the bill. So if the distinguished Senator from \nVermont doesn't understand those concerns, quite frankly he hasn't been \nlistening very hard. We have laid them out, and they are shared by 43 \nSenators, versus a bill, as amended at the desk, with no objections to \nits substance--none, 100 to 0. Big difference. Big difference.\n  So on behalf of the total of 43 Senators, I do object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, retaining the floor, I would also ask \nthe distinguished Senator from Vermont through the Chair--because he \nmentioned Senator Landrieu--has Senator Landrieu asked him to remove \nhis objection to this bill so we can get a clinic in Lafayette and Lake \nCharles, No. 1; and No. 2, all those veterans groups he mentioned, do \nthey oppose moving forward with this bill as it would be amended at the \ndesk? Do they publicly oppose moving forward with those 27 veterans \nclinics?\n  I would ask those two very important, pertinent questions of the \nSenator from Vermont through the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I believe at this point--please correct \nme if I am wrong--that I control the floor; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SANDERS. While my friend from Louisiana is still here, let me \nanswer yes in response to his question. Senator Landrieu has asked me, \nvery forcefully, to move forward on this provision on more than one \noccasion, and my response to Senator Landrieu, who voted for the \ncomprehensive legislation, unlike Senator Vitter, is the same.\n  Secondly, what the veterans organizations of this country want is for \nthe Congress to recognize the very serious problems facing the veterans \ncommunity. What I can tell my colleague from Louisiana is that to the \nbest of my knowledge the veterans organizations have been to my \ncolleague's office, and we are trying to get some specific objections \nas to why he is not supporting this legislation and we have not gotten \nthat.\n\n[[Page S2066]]\n\n  So I would ask my colleague from Louisiana to come forward and tell \nme what he disagrees with, which he has not done yet, and I look \nforward to working with him. I agree we have to work together. I am \noffering him that opportunity to tell me what he doesn't like. Let's \nget a piece of legislation the veterans of this country need and want \nand that we will be proud of.\n  With that, I believe I have the floor; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is correct.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 53 minutes \nremaining in his postcloture time.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I will tell my colleague from Louisiana that I don't \nintend to be addressing this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, in that case, I ask unanimous consent to \nwrap up this discussion in about 45 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. I thank my colleague.\n  Again, Madam President, I think this is very important. I agree with \nwhat Senator Sanders said last November--where we have agreement, let's \nmove it. We have agreement about these 27 clinics, 18 States, including \nLafayette and Lake Charles. Let's move it.\n  I didn't hear him say that any of those veterans organizations he \ncontinually cites oppose this because they do not. They take the \ncommonsense approach the huge majority of Americans take: Where there \nis agreement and we can constructively move forward for veterans, let's \ndo it and let's build on that.\n  Finally, if Senator Landrieu has forcefully asked the Senator to \nremove his objection to this, apparently she has not been very \neffective. I think that is very unfortunate because veterans in \nLouisiana are suffering today. They have been waiting for this. They \nhave been waiting for years for this, and they still wait, even though \nthere is no substantive disagreement with this bill.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, it is not my intention to get involved \nin Louisiana politics, but just let me say that Senator Landrieu has \nvoted for this legislation, she has been a champion of veterans rights, \nand I look forward to continuing to work with her on comprehensive \nlegislation that will benefit all of the veterans of Louisiana and \nthose in the other 49 States.\n  Madam President, I wish to change subjects, if I might, and I wish to \ntouch upon an issue which I believe is far and away the most \nsignificant issue facing the American people; that is, a struggle not \njust to make sure we can preserve and expand the vitally important \nprograms that are life or death to tens of millions of working-class \nand middle-class families--programs such as Social Security and \nMedicare and Medicaid. The issue we are discussing now is not just \nwhether we must create the millions and millions of jobs that we need. \nReal unemployment is not 6.8 percent. It is close to 12 percent and \nyouth unemployment is close to 20 percent. We have to create millions \nof jobs for our young people and for working families around this \ncountry.\n  We have made some progress with the Affordable Care Act, announced \njust yesterday. About 10 million more Americans will have access to \nhealth care who formerly did not, but we have to go further. We have to \njoin the rest of the industrialized world, all of which have stated--\nevery country has stated--that health care must be a right and not a \nprivilege. When we do that through a Medicare-for-all, single-payer \nprogram, we can do it much more cost-effectively and end the absurdity \nof the United States spending almost twice as much per capita on health \ncare as do the people of any other nation.\n  All of those issues, and education and climate change, are all \nenormously important for the future of this Nation. But the issue that \nis even more important than all of those is whether we can prevent this \ncountry from moving to an oligarchic form of society in which virtually \nall economic and political power rests with a handful of billionaire \nfamilies.\n  I know we don't talk about it too much. Most people don't raise that \nissue. Certainly we don't see it in the corporate media. That is the \nreality. Right now in America we have, by far, the most unequal \ndistribution of wealth and income of any major country on Earth.\n  What we are looking at is the top 1 percent owns 38 percent of the \nfinancial wealth of America. I have very little doubt the overwhelming \nmajority of Americans have no idea what the bottom 60 percent looks \nlike. The top 1 percent owns 38 percent of the wealth of America, and \nthe bottom 60 percent owns all of 2.3 percent. That gap between the \nvery rich and everybody else is growing wider and wider. We have one \nfamily--one family--the Walton family, who owns Walmart, that owns more \nwealth than the bottom 40 percent of the American people.\n  In terms of income, the situation is equally bad. In the last number \nof years since the Wall Street collapse, 95 percent of all new income \nhas gone to the top 1 percent.\n  So we have an economic situation where the middle class is \ndisappearing, and more people are living in poverty than at any time in \nthe history of the United States. We have 22 percent of our kids living \nin poverty, the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major country \non Earth. All the while the middle class disappears, more and more \npeople are living in poverty, people on top are doing phenomenally \nwell. Almost all new income goes to the top 1 percent.\n  It is not just a growing disparity in terms of income and wealth--\nthat is enormously important--but it is what is happening to the \npolitical foundations of America. What we are now seeing as a result of \nCitizens United--and we are going to see it more as a result of the \ndisastrous Supreme Court decision of today in McCutcheon--will enable \nthe billionaire class to play an even more prominent role in terms of \nour political process.\n  The Koch brothers are worth about $80 billion--$80 billion. They are \nthe second wealthiest family in America. Working with other \nbillionaires, such as Sheldon Adelson, the Kochs are prepared to spend \nan unlimited sum of money to create an America shaped by their \nrightwing extremist views--and I mean unlimited.\n  If your income went up, Madam President--and I know our Presiding \nOfficer is not quite there in this status--from $68 billion to $80 \nbillion in 1 year--a $12 billion increase in your wealth--and you \nbelieved passionately, as the Koch brothers do, in this rightwing \nagenda, why would you hesitate in spending $1 billion, $2 billion on \nthe political process? Last year, both Barack Obama and Mitt Romney \nspent a little more than $1 billion for their entire campaigns. These \nguys can take out their checkbook tomorrow and write that check and it \nwill be one-twelfth of what their increased wealth was in 1 year. It \ndoesn't mean anything to them. It is 50 bucks to you; it is $1 billion \nto them.\n  So we have to be very careful that we do not allow this great \ncountry, where people fought and died to protect American democracy, \nbecome a plutocracy or an oligarchy, and that, frankly, is the \ndirection in which we are moving.\n  I suspect that many of our fellow Americans saw a spectacle in Las \nVegas--and this was not the usual Las Vegas spectacle, with the great \nshows they have there--this was the Sheldon Adelson spectacle. This is \nwhat the spectacle was just last weekend. Sheldon Adelson said to \nprospective Republican candidates for President: Why don't you come on \ndown to Las Vegas and tell me what you could do for me because I am \nonly worth $20 billion. I am only the largest gambling mogul in the \nentire world. But $20 billion isn't enough, so I want you to come to \nLas Vegas and tell me what favors you can give me if you happen to be \nelected President and, by the way, if you sound the right note--if you \nkind of do what I like--I may put a few hundred million into your \ncampaign. Maybe if I am feeling good, I will throw $1 billion into your \ncampaign.\n  The media has dubbed this the Adelson primary. What primaries \ngenerally are about are hundreds of thousands of Republicans getting \ntogether\n\n[[Page S2067]]\n\nand they vote on whom they want their candidate to be in a State--\nDemocrats do the same--and candidates make an appeal to ordinary people \nto get votes. Some of us are old-fashioned and we kind of see that as \ndemocracy.\n  I come from a State which proudly has town meetings. I have held \nhundreds of town meetings in my State. I know it is old-fashioned. I \nknow it is getting out of step, but I actually listen to what people \nhave to say. They walk in the door free, occasionally we actually even \nserve some lunch, and they don't have to be a billionaire to ask me a \nquestion. I answer questions and I talk to people. I understand that is \nold-fashioned, not the way we do it anymore.\n  The way we do it now is the Adelson way: walk in the door and I will \ngive you hundreds of millions of dollars or come to a campaign \nfundraiser, and if you make the largest contributions--tens of \nthousands of dollars--I will listen to you.\n  We have to turn this thing around, because if we don't, we are going \nto end up in a situation where not only the economy of this country is \ngoing to be controlled by a handful of billionaires and large \nmultinational corporations, but we are going to be living in a country \nwhere the political process is controlled.\n  Somebody mentioned to me--and I don't know, maybe I will introduce \nthis legislation. We all know what NASCAR is. These guys who drive the \nracing cars have on their coats they are being sponsored by this or \nthat oil company or this or that tire company. Maybe we should \nintroduce that concept in the Senate. You could have a patch on your \njacket that says: I am sponsored by the Koch brothers. Eighty-seven \npercent of my funding comes from the Koch brothers.\n  Maybe we will give you a special jacket, and then you have the \nAdelson guy or this person or that person. But it might tell the \nAmerican people why we continue as a body to give more tax breaks to \nbillionaires and yet we are having a heck of a tough time raising the \nminimum wage to $10.10 an hour. It might tell the American people why \nwe do nothing to close corporate loopholes, but we are having a hard \ntime addressing pay equity in America so women get the same wages that \nmen do.\n  I think when we talk about issues such as campaign finance, a lot of \nAmericans say: Well, yes, it is a problem, but it doesn't really relate \nto me.\n  Let me suggest that it absolutely does relate to every man, woman, \nand child. It is imperative people understand what the agenda is--the \nKoch brothers, for example. These are people who have been very clear \nthat they want massive cuts in Social Security or the privatization of \nSocial Security. They want massive cuts in Medicare or the \nvoucherization of Medicare, and massive cuts in Medicaid. As some of \nthe largest polluters in America in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, \nthe Koch brothers want to crack down on the ability of the EPA to \nregulate pollution. These guys want to cut back on funds for education \nso our kids can afford to go to college.\n  So if we think the issue of campaign finance does not relate to our \nlives, we are very mistaken. We are moving toward a situation where \npeople with huge sums of money are going to spend unlimited amounts to \nelect candidates who reflect an extreme rightwing agenda which will \nmake the wealthiest people in this country even richer while continuing \nthe attacks against the middle class and working families in this \ncountry.\n  I will conclude by saying this--and I mean this quite honestly. As \nsomebody who grew up in a family that didn't have a lot of money and as \nsomebody who represents the great State of Vermont, where people \nconstantly tell me they ask for so little, I have heard veterans say: I \ndon't want to use the VA because another veteran really may need it \nmore. I don't need this program and somebody else may need it more.\n  I don't understand how people worth $80 billion are spending huge \nsums of money to become even richer. They are doing it by trying to \nattack life-and-death programs for the elderly. Why would somebody want \nto cut Social Security when they are worth $80 billion and have more \nmoney than they can dream of for retirement? Why would somebody want to \ndo that when they are worth billions and have the best health care in \nthe world? Why do they want to make massive cuts in Medicare or \nMedicaid? What motivates somebody with so much money to go to war \nagainst working families and the middle class?\n  I frankly don't understand it. I can only think that this has to do \nwith power--the drive for more and more power, the thrill it must be to \ntell candidates: Do you want my support? This is what you have to do.\n  But I think this is just a huge issue that we as a nation have got to \naddress. Too many people have given up their lives fighting for \nAmerican democracy to see this great Nation be converted into a \nplutocracy or an oligarchy. We must not allow that to happen.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, can you tell us the order of business \npending on the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is considering H.R. 3979.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 minutes in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I start by commending my colleague from \nVermont.\n  What happened today across the street at the Supreme Court will be \nlost on most Americans. They can't understand why they should even care \nabout it.\n  The Supreme Court was asked whether it was proper under the law to \nlimit the number of Federal campaigns and the total dollars an \nindividual can give to candidates. To no one's surprise, the Supreme \nCourt said there should be no limitation. People can give as much money \nas they want to as many Federal candidates they want with no \nlimitation.\n  Most Americans will say: So what? You know, these politicians run \nagainst one another. During the campaign both sides spend too much \nmoney. I am sick and tired of their ads. I don't care how you pay for \nit; it is all bad.\n  But I have to say, Senator Sanders put his finger on it. What is at \nissue here is not just how we finance campaigns. It is who we elect. \nWhat we are faced with is a Supreme Court across the street which \ncelebrates oligarchs. They happen to believe that the wealthiest people \nin America deserve the strongest voice in American politics. I couldn't \ndisagree more.\n  Sadly, many of us are caught up in this system of campaign financing \nwhere we literally have to raise millions of dollars to run for \nelection and reelection. In my State multimillionaires are running for \nthe highest offices against what I consider to be mere mortals--those \nof us who aren't in the multimillionaire class--trying to compete with \nthem, always wondering if tomorrow the Koch brothers--with an $80 \nbillion net worth--will say: Spend $10 million there; spend $20 million \nthere.\n  I say to my friend from Vermont, as best we can count, in the last \nelection cycle the Koch brothers--not to be confused with the soft \ndrink--spent over $250 million in ad campaigns. I think the figure, \nfrankly, is much higher, and the suggestion is they are going to double \nthat spending this time. They have already spent $10 million in the \nState of North Carolina with negative television advertising for 12 \nmonths against the Democratic incumbent Senator Kay Hagan, trying to \nbeat her down, so they can defeat her in November.\n  Make no mistake. There is a lot of money being spent on both sides. \nBut Sheldon Adelson, who--as the Senator from Vermont said--runs one of \nthe biggest gambling operations and maybe is the wealthiest man when it \ncomes to that in the United States, maybe in the world, has become a \nplayer. Can you imagine if those who want to run for the Republican \nnomination for President come hat in hand, land at the Las Vegas \nairport, walk into a room and see if they can say something that \nappeals to this man who is worth billions of dollars? Last time he fell \nin love with Newt Gingrich, and he was going to make Newt Gingrich \nPresident. People in many of the Republican primaries saw it \ndifferently. Well, this\n\n[[Page S2068]]\n\ntime he wants to pick another horse to run.\n  Why are the richest people in America so intent on owning our \npolitical process? Because they have an agenda. It isn't just because \nthey love the Constitution. They have an agenda--an agenda which makes \nthe Tax Code work for them, an agenda which makes sure that government \nspending and things that aren't priorities for them are reduced.\n  We saw some of that yesterday, when Congressman Paul Ryan in the \nHouse of Representatives introduced his budget, his vision of what \nAmerica should look like. What is it? It is a budget amendment \nwhich cuts back on some basic things. One thing the Ryan budget cuts \nback on that everybody listening to this debate ought to take note of \nis domestic discretionary spending for medical research--seriously.\n\n  Today happens to be World Autism Awareness Day. Do you know a family \nwith an autistic child? Do you have any idea what they are going \nthrough? I know a few. Sadly, the number of people suffering from \nautism and the autism spectrum disorder seems to be growing by the day. \nWe look at these families struggling to give their son or daughter a \nchance and think: If we only knew a little bit more about this disease, \nif we only knew a little bit more about the human brain, if we only \ncould see this coming and do something to avoid it, if we could find a \nway to treat it, what a difference it would make for all of these \nfamilies on World Autism Awareness Day. But the answer from Congressman \nRyan is to cut back on medical research. That is not the answer. It is \nnot the answer for any of us.\n  God forbid we go to the doctor's office tomorrow with a child, and \nthe doctor says something awful has happened. But the first question we \nwould ask the doctor is: Is there something you can do? Is there a \nmedicine? Is there a procedure?\n  How many families have been in that position where they have asked \nthat physician, praying to God that the answer is yes? The answer will \nnot be yes when we cut back on medical research. The answer is going to \nbe no.\n  That is why we have to really reflect on our priorities--not only in \nCongress but in elections. If we are going to let people take over the \nAmerican political scene through the Citizens United case across the \nstreet or the McCutcheon case which was decided today, we are going to \nturn our government over to people who are totally out of touch with \nthe reality of American families and American working families. That \nwould be a serious mistake.\n  While we are on the subject, these are the first people in line who \nwant to eliminate the Affordable Care Act. I was in the Rose Garden \nyesterday, invited by the President with a large group to celebrate the \nannouncement that more than 7.1 million Americans have now enrolled by \nthe deadline under the Affordable Care Act, and more than 3 million \nyoung people, fresh out of college, looking for jobs are covered by \ntheir mom and dad's health insurance while they are looking for work. \nThen add another 8 million people across America who now have health \ninsurance protection through Medicaid--meaning their income is so low \nthat they qualify for this basic health insurance. Add those numbers \nup, and they come to somewhere in the range of 15 million to 18 million \npeople who benefited by the Affordable Care Act--people, who until they \nhad this opportunity, some of them, many of them had no insurance. I \nhave met them. I have met them across my State. I have met those in \ndownstate Illinois who worked all their lives. They are 62 years old.\n  A friend of mine never had health insurance one day in her life, \nnever missed a day of work in her life. Now she has the protection of \nhealth insurance at age 62 for the first time--and thank God she does. \nShe has just been diagnosed with diabetes. She has a chance now because \nshe has health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. So what is the \nresponse from the other side? Repeal it. Get rid of it. We don't need \nit. It is a waste--too much government.\n  We are not going back. We're not repealing. We can make it better, \nand we ought to do it on a bipartisan basis. But we are not repealing \nthe Affordable Care Act.\n  What would repealing the Affordable Care Act mean to the rest of us \nwho have health insurance? The Affordable Care Act guarantees that if \nyou have a child or a spouse with a medical condition--a medical \nhistory of asthma, diabetes, survived cancer--you cannot be \ndiscriminated against when you buy health insurance. What we are \ntalking about here is giving families a fair shot at affordable health \ninsurance--giving them a fair shot even if their child is born with a \nserious medical issue.\n  Secondly, the Affordable Care Act says: When you sell me a health \ninsurance policy, it ought to be worth something when I need it. They \nused to sell these policies and put limits on them. God forbid tomorrow \nyou are diagnosed with cancer and facing radiation therapy, \nchemotherapy, surgery, and hospitalizations. But there is a limit on \nyour policy, and pretty soon you bust through the limit, and now it is \nall coming out of your meager savings. That is the number one reason \npeople declare personal bankruptcy in America--health bills. The \nAffordable Care Act puts an end to that and says that your health \ninsurance policy has to be there in an amount when you need it.\n  The third thing it says is if you are a senior citizen getting \nprescription drugs--there used to be something called the doughnut \nhole. It was a crazy thing. You couldn't even explain it. I pay for \nprescriptions--no, wait a minute. I don't pay for prescription drugs \nfor the first 3 months, and then I pay for them for 4 months, and then \nthe government pays for them. It was called the doughnut hole. It made \nno sense at all. We closed the doughnut hole, saying to seniors: We are \ngoing to make sure that your prescription drugs are covered and you \ndon't have to pay out of pocket, and you can get that annual checkup \nthat you need to stay healthy. Those who want to repeal the Affordable \nCare Act want to do away with that, and that is just plain wrong.\n  As I mentioned earlier, if you happen to be a family with a child \nunder the age of 26, you can keep that child on your health insurance \nplan while they are finishing college and looking for a job, maybe \ngetting that first job. It may not be the best, may not have benefits. \nThey are still covered under your policy.\n  Have you as a parent ever called your 24-year-old daughter and asked \nher, as I have: Jenny, do you have health insurance?\n  No, Dad. I'm fine. Don't worry about me.\n  Right. I will stay up all night worrying about you.\n  You don't have to do that anymore under the Affordable Care Act. \nThose who want to repeal it want to go back to those days where young \npeople fresh out of college had no health insurance protection. We are \nnot going back. We can make this bill stronger and better, and I will \nwork to do it. But for the millions of Americans who now have a chance \nat affordable, accessible health insurance, we are not turning the \nclock back.\n  There is one other thing worth mentioning. Not only are millions now \non health insurance, the good news is for the last 5 years since we \npassed this bill, the rate of increase in costs for health insurance \nhas been going down--yes, going down. Not as fast as we want it to, but \nit used to be trending up in a way we couldn't even manage or \ncontrol. Now we are moving in the right direction in terms of health \ncare costs. So for those who come to the floor of the Senate or the \nfloor of the House growling and whining about the Affordable Care Act, \nthe good news is that this debate is over in America. The Affordable \nCare Act is here to stay.\n\n  We could make it better. We should work to make it better. We should \ndo it on a bipartisan basis. But there are 18 million reasons why we \nare not going to repeal the Affordable Care Act--18 million Americans \nthat have peace of mind with health insurance because of this law.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Booker). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. FLAKE. I ask unanimous consent to offer my amendment No. 2935.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, in order to \nkeep this bipartisan emergency legislation\n\n[[Page S2069]]\n\npending on the floor and to benefit 2.7 million Americans, I \nrespectfully object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted \nto speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I think it is unfortunate that we are not allowing amendments to be \noffered here for extending unemployment benefits. The least we ought to \ndo is make it easier to find a job. Unfortunately, there is no room in \nthe legislation to do that.\n  I would like to talk about one area where we could offer some help \nand relief. Hearing some of the discussion over the past few minutes in \nthis Chamber, it seems that this Chamber has become an echo chamber for \nhappy talk about the Affordable Care Act. Unfortunately, for those who \ntalk about figures--enrollment figures and whatever--we seem to forget \nabout the number of people who had their health care canceled, who may \nhave been able to pick up new coverage under the Affordable Care Act, \nbut it is hardly--hardly--affordable. In fact, in most cases the cost \nhas gone up significantly.\n  So I am here today to join a number of my colleagues who are seeking \nto offer amendments to this legislation, to make it easier for those \nwho don't have jobs and who cannot easily access jobs. As we all know, \nthe ACA or Affordable Care Act placed requirements on what new plans \nare mandated to cover, including coverage of things--I think they named \n10 essential health care benefits, essential being used loosely--like \npediatric dentistry, maternity care, mental health.\n  We have all heard stories of those squeezed by the ACA's new mandates \nand regulations. For many, if it isn't higher premiums, it is higher \ndeductibles, increased copays or even greater out-of-pocket costs. That \nis the case for most but not all. I think all of us should freely \nacknowledge that some people have been able to buy more affordable \ncare, but I think those examples are overshadowed completely by those \nwho are facing higher costs.\n  The Wall Street Journal noted in a March 22 article--they cited an \neHealth report--that the average premium for an individual health plan \nthat meets ACA requirements was $274 a month, up 39 percent from last \nyear, before the ACA provisions took effect. The same article reported \nthat family plans averaged $663 a month, a 56 percent increase from \nlast year. These facts have real world implications and have a bearing \non both a family's financial realities as well as their employment.\n  For instance, I previously referenced a case of Leanne from Eager, \nAZ. Her family is facing what she calls ``sky-high'' rates now. This is \nthanks to the Affordable Care Act. If that isn't bad enough, it looks \nas if she and her husband will have to put off buying their parents' \nbusiness.\n  In January I introduced the ReLIEF Act as a response to the \nadministration's announcement that those facing health cancellations \ndue to the ACA will be able to enroll in catastrophic coverage. The \nrelief act would allow health insurance providers to provide \ncatastrophic coverage to everyone and would deem these plans as meeting \nthe minimal essential coverage requirement. The bottom line is, if we \nare going to delay benefits, delay mandates on the Affordable Care Act \nor delay implementation of certain parts of the Affordable Care Act for \nsome, we ought to do it for everyone. I get a real kick out of hearing \neverybody reference the happy talk about the Affordable Care Act, but \nthe reality is that much of it has been delayed or postponed or \nchanged. If there are no problems with it, why do we keep doing that? \nIf we are doing that for some, why don't we delay the mandates for \neveryone or allow others to buy more affordable coverage by giving some \nrelief on these mandates?\n  This ReLIEF Act that I have introduced will allow health providers to \noffer catastrophic plans that may cost a lot less, that families used \nto be able to access and simply no longer can because too few insurance \ncompanies will offer them because at a certain point they will have to \noffer compliant plans that are much more expensive. My goal is to \nprovide affordable insurance options and to give individuals who don't \nneed or don't want more extensive coverage options to purchase these \nplans.\n  I applied the relief act to this bill as an amendment. I hope to \nbring that up. That was the purpose of the unanimous consent request \nthat was just rejected. Unfortunately, it appears that very few, if \nany, amendments will be allowed to this legislation. I think that is \nunfortunate.\n  If we are concerned about the unemployed, as I know we all are, then \nwe ought to at least offer them alternatives, offer them ways to more \neasily find employment to give them some more relief.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I come to speak about the economy in \nterms of wages, but I do want to respond to the last discussion in \nterms of health care for a moment. Part of the fair shot is to make \nsure they have a fair shot that they need for their families, and thank \ngoodness, under the Affordable Care Act, now folks are going to get \nwhat they are paying for. They cannot just get dropped if they get sick \nor if their child has juvenile diabetes or they have heart disease or \nsome other condition. They are going to be able to know they can get \ninsurance without preexisting conditions.\n  But it is also going to be incredibly important moving forward for \nwomen. As the author of the provision to improve maternity care, I do \nwant to say to my friend who just spoke that prior to health reform, \nabout 60 percent of the plans in the private market wouldn't provide \nmaternity care for women, amazingly. Being a woman was viewed as a \npreexisting condition because you might be of childbearing age or maybe \nyou are not.\n  I remember hearing from one young couple where the husband couldn't \nget insurance because his wife was of childbearing age. They couldn't \nget maternity care. This is not true anymore--not true anymore. Thank \ngoodness for the comprehensive care that our friends on the other side \ncall regulations on insurance companies--and actually that regulation \nis a requirement--so that women can get maternity care, and there is a \nrequirement that we treat mental health and physical health the same in \nterms of insurance, which by the way affects 1 out of 4 people in our \ncountry. I think that it is a good thing.\n  We can always improve on it, and we will, to make it better, listen \nto the concerns and do what needs to be done to make it work better. \nBut I think that families now have a fair shot to get health care \ncoverage and not as parents go to bed at night worrying about whether \ntheir kids are going to get sick. It is a good thing, and we will move \nforward in a positive way.\n  Mr. President, let me tell you now about a business owner who said \nthe minimum wage wasn't good enough--wasn't good enough--and his \nemployees needed more. So he doubled everybody's wages. He doubled \neverybody's wages, and people thought he was crazy. He was shunned by \nthe business community. People said he would go bankrupt. His name was \nHenry Ford--Henry Ford. Because of his decision to pay his workers $5 a \nday, which was unheard of 100 years ago, he became one of the richest \nmen in America.\n  When he first announced a $5 workday, not everybody was happy. \nEconomists had a fit. Ford's competitors were furious. The Wall Street \nelite were calling the $5 day ``an economic crime.'' They said Ford \nwouldn't be competitive in the economy anymore. They questioned his \njudgment and his business sense.\n  They were wrong. His decision to pay his workers $5 a day not only \nwas a brilliant business decision, it created the middle class of this \ncountry. We are very proud in Michigan that it started with us.\n  A hundred years ago $5 a day was a lot of money. A loaf of bread cost \n6 cents. A gallon of milk cost about 35 cents. At 3 a.m., the day after \nHenry Ford made his announcement, a bitterly cold day in Detroit, \nsomething started to happen on Woodward Avenue.\n  Picture it. In the middle of a cold night--and we have a lot of cold \nnights in Michigan--people all around Detroit\n\n[[Page S2070]]\n\nat 3 o'clock in the morning began walking through the snow-covered \nstreets to Woodward and Manchester, the site of Ford's Highland Park \nplant. A line was forming, getting longer every minute. Tens and then \nhundreds and then thousands of people were getting in line. Traffic \ncame to a standstill. There were too many people in the road for the \ncars to get by.\n  The hours passed. The lines got longer. By 10 a.m. there were 12,000 \npeople standing in line waiting in the freezing cold for the chance to \nget one of those jobs--one of those $5-a-day jobs that Henry Ford was \noffering, to be able to work hard, get that job, and build a better \nlife. They were just looking for a fair shot to get ahead, like the \nmillions of workers today who work 40 hours a week, such as the single \nmom who scrubs floors and works 40 hours a week and is still living in \npoverty, and the millions of other Americans still looking for work. \nLike most Americans and like those Ford workers 100 years ago, they \njust want a shot to work hard and play by the rules and be able to get \nahead with their family.\n  Henry Ford knew that when his workers had money in their pocket, when \nthey had enough money to put food on the table, when they were caught \nup on their bills, it meant they could afford to buy one of those cars \nthey were building at the plant.\n  In fact, that is what he said when folks called him crazy. He said, \n``I want to make sure I got somebody who can afford to buy my car.''\n  For families in 1914, a job in the Ford factory was a ticket to the \nmiddle class, and that is still true today. Henry Ford knew that paying \na higher wage would mean happier workers and lower turnover, instead of \nworkers who were frustrated about not being able to make ends meet. \nHenry Ford had workers who were proud to work for him. This meant \ngreater productivity and greater profits because if the workers could \nmake more cars he could sell more cars. If they could sell more cars, \nthey could make more cars, so this was a win-win situation.\n\n  Henry Ford made more money than he had ever dreamed of, and his \nworkers made more money than they had ever dreamed of. The effect this \nnew wage had on Ford's employees went deeper than their wallets. In the \nfirst 3 weeks after the raise began, more than 50 of his employees \napplied for marriage licenses because they said they could now afford \nto get married and start a family. A lot of folks talk about the \nimportance of starting a family. Having money in your pocket to be able \nto get started in life is a pretty big deal.\n  When the workers made enough money to live on, they were able to \nspread the wealth. Their local grocery stores, restaurants, and \nhardware stores and others also benefited from the increase in wages, \nwhich was reflected all around the neighborhood and the plant in 1914. \nA sandwich cart operator near the plant was interviewed about the new \nwages by the Detroit News in February of 1914, and he said: ``I'm for \nthis raise in wages. I sell nearly twice as much as I did a month \nago.'' Those who sold food and goods, such as hats, scarves, and gloves \nnear the plant said the same thing. One vendor said that if things kept \ngoing like this, he would have to hire a new employee to help out with \nthe new business.\n  It is simple: When workers have more money in their pockets, they \nhave more money to spend at businesses both large and small. When \nbusinesses have more customers, they can pay their workers better and \nhire more of them. When the workers have more money in their pocket, \nthey can go out and buy more things, and that is called the demand part \nof the economy.\n  Our colleagues are always talking about the supply side. They like to \nsay: Let's just give it to the top and it will trickle down. Most \npeople in Michigan are still holding their breath waiting for it to \ntrickle down. We know if you put it in the pocket of workers--people \nwho are, frankly, fighting to hold on to stay in the middle class or \nworking to get into the middle class--you create the demand side of the \neconomy.\n  As Henry Ford found out, things started turning. This kind of \nvirtuous cycle that Henry Ford helped create in Michigan and in America \n100 years ago is what we need to do today to restore our economy. We \ncan't do that with a minimum wage that has lost most of its value in \nthe past few decades.\n  Those Ford workers worked hard, saved their money, bought homes, \nbuilt communities, and gave their children opportunities, such as being \nable to go to college. In Michigan, you can buy a little cottage up \nnorth where you can have a boat, a snowmobile, or be able to go out \nhunting on the weekends and enjoy life--that is the middle class.\n  Because of what was done by doubling people's wages--when everyone \nsaid Henry Ford was crazy--created the middle class of this country. \nBut today everything the middle class worked for--what they built with \ntheir bare hands, elbow grease, and blood, sweat, and tears--is at \nrisk. The Federal minimum wage has been stuck at $7.25 for nearly 5 \nyears. That single mom with two kids working for minimum wage today \nearns about $15,000 a year, which is $4,000 below the poverty line. \nThat is not right, if you work 40 hours a week and make less than the \npoverty level. That is not how we built the middle class 100 years ago, \nand it is certainly not how we are going to grow it today.\n  Too many Americans rightly feel they are trapped in a rigged game \nwhere heads, the wealthy win, and tails, the rest of us lose. What we \nneed is an economy that gives everybody a fair shot. That is what we \nare fighting for, that is what we believe in, and that is what we are \npromoting in everything we are doing. We want a fair shot and a fair \neconomy for everybody--not a free shot but a fair shot for everybody \nwho works hard. Being rewarded for your hard work is what makes this \ncountry great. You can take a good idea, you can work hard, you can \nbuild a better life, and that is the American dream.\n  Today there is less opportunity for people who do that, \nunfortunately. People need to have a chance to build something--to \nbuild a career, a company, and a future--or we will fall behind the \nrest of the world. They need a fair shot. They deserve a fair shot. The \nmiddle class we built over the last 100 years could cease to exist if \nwe don't act together and understand what drives the economy.\n  To turn things around, we need to make sure people can get jobs that \npay a fair wage just as we had 100 years ago. Let's talk about what \nthat means. We can start by raising the minimum wage. What is appalling \nto me today is that the $5 a day Henry Ford paid his workers for 8 \nhours of work is the equivalent of $14.67 an hour. If we did what Henry \nFord did 100 years ago by paying $5 to his employees to help drive the \neconomy and create the middle class, employees today would have to be \npaid about $14.67 an hour.\n  Think about that for a minute. The millions of Americans across this \ncountry who are working today for a minimum wage are only making the \nequivalent of half of what Henry Ford paid his workers 100 years ago. \nMeanwhile, the average CEO in this country today now makes as much as \nthe wages of 933 minimum wage workers combined. I could not fit quite \nthat many people in here, but imagine 933 people--all working 40 hours \na week, making minimum wage, and maybe working 2 or 3 jobs--combined \nequals the average salary of a CEO.\n  We are going to move this country and working-class people forward \nagain if we understand that people need a fair shot to get ahead and we \ndo something about it. That is why we are going to vote soon on the \nFair Minimum Wage Act which does just what it says. It makes sure all \nof our workers are getting paid a fair wage. An hourly wage of $10.10--\nnot even as much as I was talking about with Henry Ford--is the right \nnumber because it gets people out of poverty. That is the number that \ngets people out of poverty.\n  Some places across the country are seeking a minimum wage hike that \nis higher than that, while too many States are stuck at $7.25 an hour, \nwhich is the national average. The bill before us in the Senate strikes \nthe right balance by raising the minimum wage to the point where people \nare above the poverty line and have a fair shot to get ahead. If it \nmade sense for Henry Ford in 1914, it makes sense for us today in 2014. \nThe American people know this, and that is why raising the minimum wage \nenjoys broad bipartisan public support. If the public were voting, this \nwould be done.\n  Democrats, Republicans, and Independents understand that it makes\n\n[[Page S2071]]\n\nsense, just as Henry Ford realized it 100 years ago. If families are \nmaking more money, it is better for everybody in the economy, and it is \nbetter for taxpayers. All of us, as taxpayers, know that higher \nsalaries mean we are not spending so much money on food assistance. If \nwe can get $10.10 an hour, we are saving money on SNAP and people will \nnot need or qualify for food assistance anymore. That is the way to cut \nthe food assistance budget the right way. We need to give people access \nto work that pays above poverty line. Give people a handhold on the \nladder to opportunity.\n  This is about the future of our country. If we want to continue to be \na world leader, we have to make sure everybody has a fair shot at a \ngood education, to get a good job, start a business, and make enough \nmoney. When they can do that, they will be able to support their \nfamily.\n  Nobody who works 40 hours week should live in poverty. Yet that is \nexactly what is happening today. We can change that. We can do what \nHenry Ford did. This man became one of the wealthiest men in the world \nby lifting people up and giving them a fair shot with a fair wage. I \nhope that in a few days we will do that. The American people get it, \nand I hope we will too.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I ask to speak in morning business for \nup to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, this morning the Supreme Court \nannounced its decision in the McCutcheon v. Federal Election \nCommission, the latest in a series of rulings that have done away with \nany meaningful limits on money in politics. Since the Supreme Court \nissued its ruling in Citizens United in 2010, we have witnessed the \nsystematic unraveling of our Nation's campaign finance laws.\n  I am sure this is a cause for celebration for some--the superwealthy \nand well-funded corporate interests--because, after all, these rulings \ngive them more influence, more access, and more power, as if they need \nit. Then there is everybody else--the everyday folks in Minnesota and \naround the country who don't have the luxury of pouring millions of \ndollars into political campaigns.\n  There is the senior on a fixed income who gives $25 to a candidate \nshe likes--maybe someone fighting to contain the cost of prescription \ndrugs. That $25 donation is real money for that senior, but it is \nnothing compared to the $25 million the pharmaceutical industry can now \nspend to elect the other candidate.\n  There is the middle-class mom who has just enough money to buy her \nkids' school clothes, but surely doesn't have enough money left over to \nbuy an election too.\n  There is the small business owner in the suburbs who is so concerned \nabout making payroll that she cannot even begin to think about making a \nhuge campaign contribution.\n  Our democracy can't function the way it is supposed to when these \nvoices are drowned out by a flood of corporate money, so for those who \nbelieve the measure of democracy's strength is in votes cast, not \ndollars spent, well, for us there is nothing to celebrate today.\n  Citizens United was, in my view, one of the worst decisions in the \nhistory of the Supreme Court. By a 5-4 margin, the Court ruled that \ncorporations have a constitutional right to spend as much money as they \nwant to influence elections. If Big Oil wants to spend millions of \ndollars to attack the guy who is advocating for more renewable fuels, \nthe Supreme Court says: Sure. Go ahead. If huge corporations want to \nrun endless radio ads against a candidate who promises to raise the \nminimum wage, the Supreme Court says: Fine. Go ahead. If the Wall \nStreet banks want to pour money into a campaign to undo consumer \nprotection laws, the Supreme Court says that is their constitutional \nright so there is not much you can do about it. That is the way the \nCourt sees it, but it is not the way I see it and it is not the way \nmost Minnesotans see it either.\n  I think we should be able to say: Enough is enough. There is too much \ncorporate money in politics and some reasonable limits on campaign \nspending are not just appropriate, they are necessary. Really, that is \nwhat Citizens United is all about--the case that got us into this mess. \nIt sort of came down to the question: Can we, the people, place any \nreal limit on the amount of money corporations can spend on elections? \nThe answer should have been, yes, of course we can, but five Supreme \nCourt Justices said: No, we can't. Their logic was literally \nunprecedented.\n  To reach the result it did, the Supreme Court had to overturn the \ncase Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce. The decision had been on \nthe books for 20 years. Overturning Austin wasn't some minor technical \nchange to the law; it was a radical shift, an exercise in pro-corporate \njudicial activism. Just compare what the Court said about campaign \nexpenditures in Austin to what it said 20 years later in Citizens \nUnited. In Austin, the Court refused to strike down a Michigan law that \nlimited corporate spending on elections. The Court explained that the \nlawsuit served a ``compelling interest''--namely, preventing \ncorporations from gaining an unfair advantage in the political system. \nThe Austin Court said that ``corporate wealth can unfairly influence \nelections.'' Those were the Supreme Court's words in 1990, that \n``corporate wealth can unfairly influence elections.'' The Court \nexplained that campaign finance laws prevent ``the corrosive and \ndistorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are \naccumulated with the help of the corporate form.'' In other words, \nthere is good reason--no, a compelling reason--to be worried about \nunlimited corporate money in politics.\n\n  Had today's Supreme Court followed the precedent, Citizens United \nwould have been an easy case. I mean, I would have written the opinion \nin a couple of minutes. It would have gone something like this: Laws \nlimiting corporate campaign expenditures are constitutional. See Austin \nv. Michigan Chamber of Commerce. The end.\n  Of course, that is not the opinion the Court wrote in Citizens \nUnited. The Court's opinion was a lot longer and a lot worse.\n  Here is the one phrase that sums up the Citizens United decision: \n``We now conclude that independent expenditures, including those made \nby corporations, do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of \ncorruption.'' The majority of the Court told us that there is no reason \nat all to be worried about unlimited corporate money in politics \nanymore, that it does not give rise even to the appearance of \ncorruption. And, the logic goes, since there is no reason to be \nconcerned about it, there is no constitutional basis to regulate it. \nThat is what the Court tells us, but we know better. The Court's \nanalysis not only is disconnected from precedent, it is disconnected \nfrom reality.\n  The Minnesota League of Women Voters recently issued a report in \nwhich it concluded that ``the influence of money in politics represents \na dangerous threat to the health of our democracy in Minnesota and \nnationally.'' That is the Minnesota League of Women Voters. That sounds \nright to me because here is the thing: In our democracy, everyone is \nsupposed to have an equal say regardless of his or her wealth. The guy \nin the assembly line gets as many votes as the CEO--one. You don't get \nextra votes just because you have extra money or greater say because of \ngreater wealth. It doesn't work that way--or shouldn't.\n  Citizens United turned the whole thing on its head and basically said \nthat those among us with the most money get the most influence, and not \nonly that, there is no limit to the amount of money the wealthy can \nspend or the amount of influence they can buy. I think that is \ninherently corrupting.\n  Unfortunately, Citizens United was just the beginning of the story, \nand in the years since we have seen courts across the country strike \ndown campaign finance laws, ushering in what are known as super PACs--\nwealthy groups that can raise and spend unlimited money to influence \nelections.\n  Today, in McCutcheon, the Court took Citizens United a step further, \nstriking down a law that limited the amount of money people could give \ndirectly to candidates and political parties. In doing so, the Court \noverturned a key holding from Buckley v. Valeo, a case from 1976. Until \ntoday, the law said that direct contributions to candidates, parties, \nand certain PACs\n\n[[Page S2072]]\n\ncould not exceed about $125,000 in the aggregate per election cycle. \nThe law was intended to stem the tide of money in politics and maintain \nthe integrity of our public institutions. But as of this morning, that \nlaw has been taken off the books at the Supreme Court's direction.\n  As Justice Breyer explained in his dissenting opinion in McCutcheon \ntoday, ``Taken together with Citizens United, today's decision \neviscerates our Nation's campaign finance laws, leaving a remnant \nincapable of dealing with the grave problems of democratic legitimacy \nthat those laws were intended to resolve.'' He is right.\n  Changing law has real consequences. What happens when we get rid of \nthe speed limit? People with fast cars drive faster--as fast as they \nwant to drive. What happens when we get rid of campaign finance limits? \nWell, special interests with a lot of money spend more of it on \npolitics--as much as they want to spend. That is not a theory; it is \nempirical fact. According to data collected by the Center for \nResponsive Politics, spending by outside groups more than tripled from \n2008 to 2012, with overall outside spending topping $1 billion--billion \nwith a ``b''--for the first time in history. Where is the new money \ncoming from? Well, in most cases we don't know. More on that a little \nlater. What we do know is pretty much what one would expect. According \nto one study, 60 percent of super PACS' funding in the 2012 election \ncycle came from just 132 donors, each donating at least $1 million. So \nwe have a relatively small group of superwealthy people accounting for \nmost of the money.\n  Remember when the Citizens United court decision assured us that all \nof this new money in politics is OK, that we shouldn't be worried about \nit, that it ``will not cause the electorate to lose faith in our \ndemocracy''? Wow, were they wrong. People are losing faith in our \ndemocracy, and can we blame them?\n  The system is broken, and we need to fix it. There are a number of \ngood proposals out there, and I wish to use this opportunity to mention \nthree of them: disclosure, public financing, and a constitutional \namendment.\n  First, we need greater disclosure. The problem in the post-Citizens \nUnited world isn't just that there is now unlimited money in politics, \nit is also that we have no idea where that money is coming from. \nBillionaires and big corporations want to influence elections by giving \nunlimited money to super PACs, but they don't want anyone to know they \nare the ones pulling the strings, so they do something that looks a lot \nlike money laundering--except that it is perfectly legal.\n  Let's say there are a bunch of corporations and billionaires out \nthere who want to preserve indefensible tax loopholes that really only \nhelp their bottom lines. Their allies form a super PAC with a mission \nto do just that--preserve their big tax breaks. Now, a super PAC needs \na name. ``Americans for Indefensible Tax Loopholes'' probably doesn't \nachieve their end, so the super PAC decides to go with something such \nas ``Americans for a Better Tax Code.'' After all, who could be against \nthat? Remember, the corporations or the billionaires who are behind \nthis whole thing don't want their fingerprints on this, so they pass \ntheir money through shell corporations before it ends up in the super \nPAC. That way the actual donors don't show up on the Federal disclosure \nforms. So now the TV is flooded with attack ads and something like \n``paid for by Americans for a Better Tax Code,'' but nobody has any \nidea who is actually behind the advertisement and there is no good way \nto find out.\n\n  But hang on. It gets worse. In addition to all of the secret money \nbeing spent by these super PACs, there are a bunch of nonprofit \norganizations that are using a glitch in the Tax Code to keep all of \ntheir campaign activities secret. These groups, liberal or \nconservative, don't have to disclose a single penny. Combine them with \nthe super PACs, and we have a lot of money and very little information. \nVoters aren't just being flooded, they are being blindfolded too.\n  We have a bill called the DISCLOSE Act that would go a long way \ntoward fixing this problem. It would put in place a clear set of rules \nrequiring disclosure whenever anyone spends more than $10,000 to \ninfluence an election, even when that money is being funneled through \nback channels. The idea is pretty simple: If someone is going to spend \nthat kind of money to influence elections, people should know about it \nso they can make informed decisions and effectively evaluate what a \ncandidate has to say. This is all about transparency and \naccountability.\n  All of us should be able to get behind that. Indeed, most of us \nalready have. The last version of the DISCLOSE Act had support from a \nmajority of Senators, and I am proud to have been one of the bill's \ncosponsors. Several of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nhave spoken enthusiastically about greater disclosure. They have said \nthings such as ``sunshine is the greatest disinfectant.'' Even the \nSupreme Court has endorsed disclosure laws in both Citizens United and \nin today's decision. Poll after poll shows that the vast majority of \nAmericans support greater transparency in campaign financing.\n  This is a basic step we should be able to take pretty easily--or one \nwould think so. It turns out that one would be wrong. In July 2012 we \nbrought the DISCLOSE Act to the Senate floor and Republicans blocked \nit. The bill died before it could get an up-or-down vote. But we are \nnot going to give up on it. I will continue to work with my colleagues \nto make the campaign finance system more transparent.\n  Here is another thing we can do: Fundamentally change the way \ncandidates finance their campaigns. Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois \nrecently reintroduced the Fair Elections Now Act, which basically says \nthat candidates who refuse to accept contributions of more than $150 \nwill be eligible for public financing of their campaigns. This would \nlevel the playing field. Instead of campaigns that are funded by a \nhandful of wealthy donors, we will have citizen-funded grassroots \ncampaigns where candidates focus their attention on people who donate \n$5, $10, $50, up to $150. We will restore power to that senior who \nmakes the $25 donation.\n  I have cosponsored the Fair Elections Now Act in the past, and I am \nproud to cosponsor it again in this Congress. This isn't going to solve \nall of the problems created by Citizens United and McCutcheon, but it \nis a step in the right direction.\n  Finally, there is something else we can do, and honestly it is the \none thing we most need to do if we are going to repair all the damage \nthe Supreme Court has done; that is, amend the Constitution to reverse \nthe Citizens United and McCutcheon decisions.\n  Let me be clear. Amending the Constitution is not something I take \nlightly. I think it should be done only in extraordinary circumstances. \nBut the Supreme Court's decisions present us with one of those \nsituations because they erode the very foundation of our democracy.\n  I know what my colleagues are thinking: Constitutional amendments are \nreally hard to come by. They require agreement by two-thirds of both \nChambers of Congress, and they have to be ratified by at least three-\nquarters of the States.\n  It is no wonder that constitutional amendments have been so rare in \nour history.\n  Just because a constitutional amendment takes a long time to \naccomplish doesn't mean it is not worth trying. It took a long time--\nmuch longer than it should have--to enshrine women's suffrage into the \nConstitution, but it got done because it would have been an affront to \nour democracy had it been otherwise.\n  These things take time and patience and persistence and perseverance, \nbut they happen. In fact, there is already momentum building. I am \nproud to cosponsor a constitutional amendment that has been proposed \nhere in the Senate that would restore legal authority to the people to \nregulate campaign finance. The States are moving in the right direction \ntoo. According to Public Citizen, 16 States have already called for a \nconstitutional amendment. I believe it is time for us to answer the \ncall.\n\n  Mr. President, thank you. I yield the floor for the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  Yesterday, the administration announced that 7.1 million people had\n\n[[Page S2073]]\n\nsigned up for private health care all across the country in exchanges \nthat range from the national exchange down to the State-based \nexchanges. Many of those who signed up are women who are enjoying new \nbenefits and new protections under the health care law. So I wanted to \ncome down to the floor, as Senator Kaine did earlier today, as Senator \nBoxer will in a few moments, to talk about why women all across this \ncountry have a completely different health care experience today under \nthe Affordable Care Act and why they have no interest in going back to \nthe days before the Affordable Care Act, and to talk also about what it \nmeans to have 7 million people all across this country who now have \naccess to private health care insurance who did not have it before.\n  The story for women all across this country, as Senator Boxer will \ntalk about in far more articulate terms than I can, is pretty stunning. \nMr. President, 8.7 million women will gain maternity coverage in 2014; \n8.7 million women did not have maternity coverage either because they \ndid not have coverage to begin with or because they had a plan that did \nnot provide maternity coverage. The health care law says if you buy \ninsurance, we are going to expect that insurance has just a basic, \ncommonsense level of benefits, and I think every American would agree \nwith the fact that insurance for a woman should probably cover what for \nmany women will be the most expensive intersection with the health care \nsystem they have in their life: And that is when they get pregnant. For \nfamilies across the country, getting pregnant can bankrupt a family if \nthey do not have maternity coverage. That changes with the Affordable \nCare Act.\n  Twenty seven million women can receive lifesaving preventive care \nwithout copays all across this country. A copay for many people is just \n$5 or $10. But for some cancer screenings, it can be a significant \namount of money, running more than $100. For low-income women, who are \nthe primary breadwinner for their family, who are perhaps only making \nabout $25,000 a year, that is a barrier for them in seeking this basic \npreventive care, seeking care that could catch a cancer when it can be \ntreated before it becomes a killer. Because of the Affordable Care Act, \n27 million women now can receive lifesaving preventive care.\n  But maybe the most important statistic for women is this one: zero. \nZero women can be charged more just for being a woman. The reality was, \nas Senator Boxer will talk about, if you were a woman in this country, \nyou were sometimes paying 50 percent more simply because insurance \ncompanies believed in many cases that being a woman constituted a \npreexisting condition.\n  So we have 7.1 million people who are now on these private exchanges. \nMany of them are women who are already enjoying the benefits of the \nAffordable Care Act but now are going to be able to get lifesaving \ntreatment because of the ACA.\n  There were a lot of people who said this day was not going to happen. \nThere were a lot of naysayers out there who said there was no way we \nwere ever going to be able to hit the 7 million mark.\n  It is kind of interesting to look back now on all of the folks who \npredicted catastrophe for the Affordable Care Act who have been proven \nwrong. Before I yield the floor for Senator Boxer, I want to go through \na couple of these statements.\n  A lot of people in the House of Representatives have spent the \nmajority of the last several years trying to destroy the Affordable \nCare Act. I was a Member of that body, and I probably was down on the \nfloor of the House of Representatives for about 40 different votes to \nrepeal all or part of the Affordable Care Act. I think we are now at \nabout 50 or 51 votes.\n  But when the Web site ran into some troubles in the beginning of the \nyear, they all went down to the floor and went on the cable news \nnetworks and said this was an example of how bad this law is and there \nis no way to fix the law, there is no way to fix the Web site.\n  Representative Bill Johnson of Ohio said this:\n\n       This may be the most stunning example of overpromising and \n     under delivering in recent U.S. history. Based on my review, \n     the problems with the Healthcare.gov website are \n     catastrophic.\n\n  That is a bit of hyperbole to suggest that the problems with the Web \nsite were the most stunning example ever in recent U.S. history of \noverpromising and underdelivering. But, of course, the Web site \nproblems were fixed. They were fixed within a few months such that we \nhave actually gone straight through the CBO's estimate--after the Web \nsite troubles--of 6 million people enrolling and we now have 7 million \npeople enrolling.\n  But as early as this month, Republicans and mass media sources were \ntelling us there was no way we were going to hit 7 million or 6 \nmillion. An Associated Press article said:\n\n       . . . the White House needs something close to a miracle to \n     meet its goal of enrolling 6 million people by the end of \n     this month. With open enrollment ending March 31, that means \n     to meet the goal, another 1.8 million people would have to \n     sign up during the month. . . . That's way above the daily \n     averages for January and February. . . . The math seems to be \n     going against the administration.\n\n  Well, what the Associated Press did not get is that there is \ndesperation out on the streets. People who have not had insurance for \nyears, if not decades, well, they might have taken their time to price \nout the right plan for themselves. Some of them might have simply \nwaited until the last minute. But the reality is, the demand there is, \nfrankly, almost insatiable, such that the Web site actually came down \nfor a portion of time on the 31st because so many people were going to \nit. The number eventually eclipsed even the CBO's rosiest estimate of \nenrollment.\n  Bill Kristol said this:\n\n       If the exchanges are permitted to go into effect . . . \n     there will be error, fraud, inefficiency, arbitrariness, and \n     privacy violations aplenty. . . . Just as economic shortages \n     were endemic to Soviet central planning, the coming Obamacare \n     train wreck is endemic to big government liberalism.\n\n  Well, the exchanges are working pretty well, such that we broke \nthrough the 7 million barrier. In my State of Connecticut, which has \nrun a really good exchange, we are coming close to doubling our \nexpected enrollment. Senator Boxer will talk about her numbers in \nCalifornia. But when you actually work to implement the health care \nlaw, rather than work to undermine it, as several States are, the \nexchanges work very well.\n  So then they turned and said: Well, yes, lots of people are signing \nup, and, yes, the exchanges seem to be working, but the wrong people \nare signing up. So one conservative scholar said:\n\n       They have thrown the entire health-care system into \n     unprecedented chaos for a population--\n\n  The uninsured--\n\n     that is, it seems, staying as far away from it as possible. \n     Little has been fixed. . . .\n\n  Well, Kentucky, just in the first 6 months of implementation, has \nreduced its uninsured population by 40 percent. The RAND Corporation \nsaid that 9 million Americans who had no health insurance now have \nhealth insurance. The reality is that people without insurance are \nsigning up for the new health care law. Why? Because they can afford it \nand they desperately need it.\n  The fact is Republicans are going to continue to attack this law, and \nthey are going to continue to change their arguments, they are going to \ncontinue to be shifting in the messages they send to the American \npeople because every time they tell us that something is wrong, they \nare wrong.\n  Now they have said--do you know what--that 7 million figure, well, \nthat just cannot be right. They are cooking the books. That cannot be \nright. There has to be something wrong with the methodology. Well, it \nis not just the Obama administration that says it is 7 million; it is \nindependent analysts who say it is 7 million. And guess what. By the \nend of the year it could be 8 million once people who have had life-\nchanging events sign up for care, once we incorporate all the State \nnumbers.\n  Nobody is cooking the books. The uninsured are not staying away. The \nexchanges are not catastrophic. The Web site is not unfixable. All of \nthese things have been proven untrue. Yet we still have people come \ndown to the floor and tell us why this thing cannot work.\n  I listened to one of my colleagues come down to the floor earlier \ntoday and tell a story about a family in Wyoming. I do not know the \nspecifics of the\n\n[[Page S2074]]\n\nfamily there. But let's talk about families in a State like Wyoming \nthat is on a Federal exchange--the real story of the options that are \nout there for families out there.\n  I think my friend from Wyoming was talking about a family of five. \nAgain, I cannot know all of the specifics of that family. But let's say \nthat family of five in Carbon County, WY, was making $100,000 a year--\nwhich would be about twice the average salary in that State and across \nthe country. Well, that family of five making $100,000 a year would \nqualify for a $677 per month tax credit. A bronze plan would be about \n$550 to $750 per month. That is about 40 percent cheaper than a lot of \nprivate plans that may be available today.\n  Now let's say that family is actually making the median income in \nWyoming, which is around $56,000. Well, if you are making $56,000, and \nyou are a family of five in Wyoming, all your kids will qualify for \nMedicaid, which is virtually free, and the parents would qualify for a \ntax credit of $528 per month. A bronze plan could be as cheap as $171 \nper month.\n  That is the reality. That is affordable for a family of five making \nthe median income. That is affordable. I understand people are having \nstories that do not match up with the 7 million people who have signed \nup for these plans over the past several months. I get that there is \nbad news out there. But there is a lot of good news out there as well. \nThere are a lot of people who could not afford to buy a health \ninsurance plan, who now can finally afford health care.\n  That is why Senator Boxer and myself and Senator Stabenow and Senator \nWhitehouse and so many others have been coming down to the floor to \ntalk about the fact that the Affordable Care Act is working. And for \nall of the naysayers, for all of the people who have predicted that \nthis law could not work, well, the example has been set: 7 million \npeople and counting signed up for health care exchanges all across this \ncountry--never mind all of the people who have gotten access to \nMedicaid, never mind all the people who have been able to stay on their \nparents' plan. We do not know what the overall number right now will be \nof people who have qualified for health care under the exchanges, \nMedicaid, and the provisions allowing people to stay on their plans. \nBut this number could be 25 million by the time the year is out.\n  So I am thrilled to see the success of the Affordable Care Act and \nthe number from yesterday. I am thrilled to see the life-changing \nbenefits for women all across the country. I am pleased to be joined \nhere on the floor by my colleague, Senator Boxer.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, what is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is postcloture on H.R. 3979 and a \nperfecting amendment thereto.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Do I need to ask permission to speak on health care?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator does need consent.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would so ask.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you so much, Mr. President.\n  I want to say a big thank you to Senator Murphy because he has been a \ngreat leader on this issue. He and I are coming from States where \npeople are signing up and signing up and surpassing the goals. The \nstories are incredibly heartwarming and wonderful and are being told on \nthe radio and being told on TV. The truth is coming out about the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  All of the scares aside, we see now it is working. Why is it working? \nBecause there was a very simple premise when we passed this bill 4 \nyears ago; and that was, people deserve a fair shot at affordable \nhealth care. That is all it was. They deserve a fair shot at getting \naffordable health care. They deserve affordable health care. They \ndeserve to be free from discrimination by the insurance companies.\n  So I am so pleased Senator Murphy has taken it upon himself to \norganize a few of us so we do not allow misinformation and lies to be \nspread about the Affordable Care Act.\n  What I loved about President Obama's speech yesterday at the Rose \nGarden was that he is so open about it. He said: Yes, we had a flawed \nrollout. We lost time. That was bad. And, yes, no bill is perfect. I \nthink it was our colleague Angus King who said it the best. He said: \nThe most perfect document in the world is the Constitution, and it has \nbeen amended 27 times. So is any bill perfect? Is any document perfect? \nOf course not. But I am here to say, given the facts--not the made-up \nstuff--given the facts, I am so proud I was able to vote for the \nAffordable Care Act. I am so proud of that. And I am sad that not one \nRepublican joined us in that vote--not one of them, not one of them.\n  When you go back to 4 years ago, we saw that millions of our citizens \nwere uninsured because they could not afford insurance; or they were \nuninsured because their insurance company walked out on them when they \nwere sick; or there were annual limits on their plans, and they simply \nwent over that annual limit and they went broke and they could not \nafford insurance. Some had lifetime caps. And it sounded like a lot: \nOh, you have a cap of a quarter of a million dollars. But then when you \nget cancer, that cap is reached a heck of a lot faster than you \nthought.\n  So we had kids kicked off their parents' health insurance at 18, 19 \nyears old.\n  We had people with asthma, diabetes, cancer who could not get \ninsurance until the Affordable Care Act passed. Being a woman was \nconsidered a preexisting condition. If you were a victim of domestic \nviolence, forget it. The insurance company wanted no part of your risk. \nSo Democrats took action--took action.\n  All the Republicans can do is come down here and say: Oh, here is one \nconstituent's story. For every one constituent's story that they tell, \nNo. 1, doublecheck the facts because sometimes we look at the facts and \nthey are not exactly what they say. But I can give 100 stories to their \n1 of people finally getting health care.\n  By the way, we can fix this law any day of the week with the help of \nthe Republicans if they have an issue they think needs to be addressed. \nBut their answer is: repeal, repeal, repeal. Why would they want to \nrepeal a law that is helping, I will tell you, over 100 million \nAmericans, not 7 million--7 million who are on the exchange--but I will \nshow you more than 100 million of our people are getting preventive \ncare, free cancer screenings, immunizations, contraception.\n  It has made a big difference in their lives. It is making a big \ndifference that kids can stay on their parents' policies. Why do they \nwant to repeal a law that does that, that gives us a patients' bill of \nrights, so insurance companies cannot look at you when you are sick, in \nyour darkest moment and say: Senator or friend or Mr. Jones or Mrs. \nSmith, I am so sorry to tell you that you are not getting any more \ncoverage because we just learned you had diabetes. You did not tell us. \nYou did not mention it. You are out.\n  I do not know why Republicans want to take that away from people, but \nthen again history is repeating itself. I tell my friends--I have so \nmany friends on the other side of the aisle. We just see the world \ndifferently. When we go back to Medicare, you should see what the \nRepublicans said in this Senate about Medicare: Socialism, let it \nwither on the vine.\n  Bob Dole was here. He was so proud he voted against it. He led the \ncharge. ``It is terrible.'' Now you have tea party members come with \nsigns to rallies that say, ``Don't touch my Medicare.'' They love their \nMedicare. They do not understand it is a government program, Medicare. \nThe government is the insurer. Of course, Paul Ryan wants to end it in \nhis budget. So I guess nothing changes; it all stays the same. They \nhated Medicare. They still hate it. They wanted it to wither on the \nvine. They totally destroy it in Ryan's budget.\n  Social Security. You should see what they said about Social Security. \nIt was an abomination. That is what they said. So nothing changes. We \nhave different people in different clothes. I look a little different \nthan the Democrats in the old days. There were no women here for \nstarters. My colleague is very handsome. He had some predecessors that \nlooked good, but they all say the same thing: Government should not be \ninvolved in any of this. It will all be great. You know what. I\n\n[[Page S2075]]\n\nwish they were right. I wish they were right.\n  My husband developed a small business. He managed to pay health care \nfor his people. He was proud to do it. But you know not every business \nis fair and just and right. So, yes, once in a while we have to say \nlet's all work together to make sure people are covered. When I was a \nlittle kid, my mother used to tell me all the time: Without your health \ncare, you have nothing. If you are sick, you got nothing.\n  I used to say: Oh, God, I am so tired of hearing that. I remember she \nused to say: You see that beautiful actress over there? She has \neverything, but she got sick so she has nothing. Your health is \neverything, she told me. You have to protect your health. She was \nright.\n  How do you protect your health and the health of your family? By \ngetting preventive care so you can catch something early. If you do not \nhave insurance, you do not get that preventive care. You are in \ntrouble. If something happens and you are in an automobile accident and \nyou thought you were an invincible young person and nothing would \nhappen to you and suddenly you find yourself with broken bones and \neverything else, including a broken heart, and you have no health \ninsurance, you can go bankrupt. People did, because it was so hard to \nget affordable insurance before the Affordable Care Act.\n  So what you are hearing and will continue to hear are scare tactics, \nstories. I am here to tell you--and I want to say it very clearly--\nabout the millions and millions of Americans who understand that the \nAffordable Care Act is working for them.\n  Yesterday was a historic day. They said: Never would you get 7 \nmillion people to sign up for private insurance on the exchanges--\nnever. It happened. Why? Because this is a product people need, health \ninsurance that is affordable. But that number is the tip of the \niceberg. I will prove it.\n  Medicaid; that is, insurance for the poorest working people. We \nexpanded it. We let more people qualify: 4.5 million Americans \npreviously uninsured now have coverage through Medicaid. So let's do \nthe math. There are 7 million on the exchanges--7.1; 4.5 million on \nMedicaid who did not have it before; 3 million young adults are able to \nstay on their parents' plan who were not able to do that before. How \nabout this? Eight million senior citizens who have saved billions of \ndollars because of the fix in the Affordable Care Act that says they \nget more help paying for their prescriptions.\n  That adds up to, drum roll, 22.6 million Americans with those very \nimportant benefits, but then here is the other thing. One hundred \nmillion Americans are now getting help with preventive services that \nthey used to have to pay for: immunizations, mammograms, vaccines, \nannual exams, and other lifesaving preventive care.\n  We are talking about millions and millions. Even with private health \ncare now, you can have no annual limit, no lifetime limit. They cannot \nbe turned away for preexisting conditions. Your insurance company \ncannot break out on them just when they are needing them. So that is \nalmost everyone in the country who is benefiting from the law.\n  Let me tell you about California. We are the biggest State in the \nUnion, 38 million strong. Covered California is the way we set up our \nexchange. It is coveredCA.com. Peter Lee is the head of that. I wish to \nthank Peter Lee today--he does not know I am doing this--for his \nextraordinary leadership.\n  Here is what happened. We exceeded our State's goal for enrollment \nthrough Covered California by not 100,000 people, not 200,000 people, \nnot 300,000 or 400,000, but by 500,000 people we exceeded our goal. \nThat is bigger than some States. Can you believe it? Half a million \npeople, more than we expected.\n  I am sure Senator Thune is shocked by this. This is a fact. We \nexpected to have 700,000 sign up. Instead we had 1.2 million. That does \nnot even include all of those who signed up on Monday or who were still \nin the process of completing enrollment.\n  We are going to hear a lot of stories about families who are paying \nwhat they think is too much--and I want to work with everybody to make \nthis law better, believe me--but listen to a couple of my constituents. \nJulie Mims from Sacramento said:\n\n       We no longer have to worry about being ruined physically \n     and financially by a serious health issue. . . . We enrolled \n     in a Bronze 60 plan that will cost us $2 a month.\n\n  This is a working woman who is getting the help she needs to have a \ndecent--decent--health care policy.\n  Then there is Rebecca Tasker. She runs a small construction business \nin San Diego with her husband. They are saving $1,000 a month. They are \nsaving $12,000 a year that they can spend on their family. They can \nspend that in their community boosting this economy.\n  She said, ``These savings will help our company grow and might allow \nus to be able to hire our first employee this year.''\n  So here is a small businesswoman who had to spend so much on health \ncare, and now because of the Affordable Care Act she is able to save \n$1,000 a month and possibly hire her first employee. Have you heard of \nsomething called job lock? Before the Affordable Care Act, people said: \nI do not want to leave my job because I have health care. I am scared \nto go out on my own. I would not be able to get it. I would not be able \nto afford it. That is why we set up the exchanges. It is freeing people \nto move out of a job that maybe they think is a dead-end and start \ntheir own business.\n  Here is a woman who is going to be able to hire her first employee \nwith the money she is saving. There are hundreds more stories. I will \nbe coming to talk about those in the coming days and weeks. Stunningly, \nHouse Republicans keep bragging about their never-ending efforts to \ntake health care away from millions of Americans.\n  Do you know the House has voted not once, not twice but more than 50 \ntimes to repeal the Affordable Care Act. They are doing it again. If \nthey had spent as much energy working with us to make the law better, \nwhich the President said he is open to, we are open to, just like we \nworked with them on Medicare Part D when they carried that. We worked \nwith them to make it better.\n  Can you imagine, we would be standing here talking about even more \nmillions of people. I have to say and this--I know it might be viewed \nas controversial, but because this law helps women so much with \nmammography, with vaccines, with birth control, with the end of \ndiscrimination based on gender, with an end of discrimination if you \nhave been the victim of violence, with the end of discrimination \nbecause you could carry a child and have a pregnancy and want coverage, \nthis Affordable Care Act helps women.\n  So I am going to say this: When you vote 50 times to repeal a law \nthat benefits women, you are voting against women. So you can say all \nyou want to become--and I know Speaker Boehner said: I want to become \nmore sensitive to women. I have an idea: Stop trying to take away \nhealth care from women and their families and then you will see women \nfeel much better about you.\n  Women are smart. They know who is on their side. They know who wants \nto give them a fair shot. But it is not people who want to take away \ntheir health care. That is what you say day in and day out. Remember, \nunder the Affordable Care Act, many women were denied health insurance \nbecause of preexisting illnesses such as breast cancer, depression or, \nagain, even being a victim of domestic violence. They were charged more \nthan men. Let us be clear. Now we are guaranteed access to free \npreventive care and maternity care. Women are now paying zero dollars \nfor a checkup--zero. This is it. Zero dollars to get a test to check \nfor cervical cancer, zero dollars for a mammogram, zero dollars for \nFDA-approved contraception. Why do the Republicans want to repeal this \nlaw and take away mammograms, take away tests for cervical cancer, and \ntake away checkups and FDA-approved contraception? Why?\n  At the same time, they say they do not understand why women do not \ngravitate to their party. I have to say, we should be celebrating this \nlaw--yes, fixing it where it needs to be fixed. But I think if \nRepublicans would join with us and say let's work together to make this \na better plan--if you have someone who cannot find their doctor in \ntheir plan, let's try to work together to fix it. If you have someone \nwho you think deserves a subsidy, let's work together and try to fix \nit.\n\n[[Page S2076]]\n\n  But let's remember, folks, I just pointed out the millions of people \nwho are benefiting.\n  House Speaker Boehner called the Affordable Care Act a ``rolling \ncalamity.'' House Majority Whip McCarthy said the enrollment numbers \nwould be ``staggeringly low.'' Several GOP Members tweeted excitedly \nabout how enrollments in their States wouldn't even fill a football \nstadium to capacity, and former Gov. Mike Huckabee said: ``You've got \nmore people wanting to go moose hunting in New Hampshire than want \nObamacare.''\n  Wrong. Really wrong--really, really wrong.\n  It is time for Republicans to look at the facts. It is time for the \nGOP to accept the reality that this law is helping millions of people: \nseniors, women, men, students, children--all Americans.\n  It is time to recognize that one of the biggest problems facing our \ncountry before the Affordable Care Act was a lack of affordable \ninsurance and millions of people are gaining the benefits.\n  So we are not going to go back to the days when our people were \ndenied health care, where an insurance company would walk out on you, \nwhere you brought in a child with asthma when they were wheezing and \nthe insurance company said: Get out. We can't insure that child.\n  I have seen the tears before the ACA when people were forced into \nbankruptcy because they had no insurance, and I have seen the tears of \njoy since the ACA.\n  So we will listen to our colleagues tell their tale of horrors, and \nthat is fine. They have every right. I respect them. But remember, as \nwe hear these stories, go back and make sure that is exactly what you \nthought you heard and then ask them what is their plan. How do they \nwant to help women and their families and their children?\n  So far, we haven't heard much. All we have heard about is repeal, \nrepeal, repeal. That is not a policy. Repealing the Affordable Care Act \nwill hurt Americans and not just a few but many millions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I ask unanimous consent to engage in a colloquy with a \nnumber of my colleagues for up to 45 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, before I start, I noted that the Senator \nfrom Connecticut came to the floor in an attempt to debunk a letter \nfrom one of my constituents to me, a family from Rawlins, WY, whom I \ntalked about earlier on the floor.\n  It seems the Senator is making the same argument the majority leader \nSenator Reid has made time and time again that these letters are made \nup. That is what seems to be the case. Is that what the Senator from \nConnecticut is saying? These are letters, these are emails, these are \nnews articles that are out there coming from our constituents and \ncoming from our home States.\n  This was all supposed to be about affordable care. Care and \naffordability were the keystones of this entire piece of legislation.\n  So I heard the Senator from California talking about people being \ndenied care. It is happening now because of the health care law--\nbecause of the health care law people are being denied care.\n  Let me reference where my colleague from Connecticut comes from. The \nState of Connecticut, the Hartford Courant, a major newspaper in the \nState of Connecticut, has a report that came out March 17 of this year, \njust a couple of weeks ago: ``Connecticut Is Less Competitive After \nFederal Health Care Reform.''\n  I heard the Senator from California saying there are people who have \nbeen helped, and I believe that, but for every one person who has been \nhelped, I believe many have been harmed as a result of the law.\n  Let me tell you what our friends from the Hartford Courant wrote:\n\n       The individual health insurance market is less competitive \n     in Connecticut since the implementation of the Affordable \n     Care Act, sometimes called Obamacare, the Kaiser Family \n     Foundation said in a report released Monday.\n       Of the seven States to release enrollment data by insurer, \n     Connecticut and Washington had fewer options--\n\n  Fewer options, not more options, as the President of the United \nStates has claimed--fewer options. The article continues--\n\n     for people buying health plans on the individual market, \n     according to Kaiser foundation, a non-profit health policy \n     research organization.\n       California and New York, the largest States in the study, \n     each has a more competitive insurance market today compared \n     to 2012, Kaiser found.\n\n  But Connecticut, the State where my colleague had questioned where \nthe woman from Wyoming comes from, is less competitive. The article \ncontinues:\n\n       In 2012, Connecticut's individual health-insurance market \n     was more evenly distributed among a number of insurers.\n\n  They list Aetna, WellPoint/Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, \nUnitedHealth Group, EmblemHealth/ConnectiCare. It says:\n\n       Connecticut has fewer insurer options available on Access \n     Health CT, its public health exchange, which was created by \n     the Affordable Care Act.\n       As of February 18, two insurers dominated 97 percent of \n     health plans sold through Access Health CT.\n\n  There is a ``less competitive exchange market and'' let me point out \n``higher than average premiums.''\n  If that is what my colleague from Connecticut wants to say is a \nsuccess, let him have it, but he has no right, in my opinion, to come \nand say that a woman who wrote to me is either not smart enough to know \nhow to figure out how much of her premiums she is being asked to pay \nand what her premiums were prior to her losing insurance because of the \nhealth care law.\n  Then the Senator from California came to the floor to say: Well, \npeople aren't losing the care they had.\n  NBC Connecticut, again where our colleague is from, says: ``Some \nConnecticut doctors said they will not accept certain health insurance \nplans offered on the state health exchange.'' The story goes on to say: \n``It broke my heart,'' losing the doctor she had been to before whom \nshe trusts and has faith in but because of the health care law is \nlosing that care.\n  I come to the floor to just point out that Republicans have better \nideas. Republicans have ideas about ways to help work to lower the cost \nof care so patients can get the care they need from a doctor they want \nat lower cost, not the situation we see across the country, where many \nindividuals believe and truly feel harmed as a result of the \nPresident's health care law.\n  With that, in response to what my colleagues from Connecticut and \nCalifornia have just said, we are here today to talk about jobs, the \neconomy, getting people back to work. As a doctor, I will tell you \nlong-term unemployment, how it affects someone's life, how it affects, \nI believe, their identity, their self-worth, their dignity, and the way \nthey think about themselves, and so it is much more important that we \nget Americans back to work.\n  I am on the floor with a number of my colleagues. The Senator from \nSouth Dakota is on the floor, and he knows as well as anyone the impact \nunemployment has in rural America, in the Western United States and how \nwhen jobs go away it makes it much harder for other jobs to come. I \nwould ask that he share some of those thoughts with us right now.\n  Mr. THUNE. I thank the Senator from Wyoming for his observations \nabout health care and more particularly about jobs.\n  We are talking about a 13th extension now of unemployment insurance \nbenefits which, in my view, does treat a symptom, but it doesn't do \nanything to address the underlying cause. The cause is we have too many \npeople in this country who are out of the work, which means we need to \ncreate more jobs, and that means making it less expensive and less \ndifficult to hire people, not driving up the cost of hiring.\n  The Senator from Wyoming has just touched on one of the issues that \nis affecting hiring in this country; that is, ObamaCare.\n  You can say what you want--and the other side may have some stories, \nwhich we will not dispute, unlike when we come up here and we share the \nstories, the real-life stories of some of our constituents, and then we \nhave the majority leader of the Senate say those stories aren't true, \nthose stories are all made up. Then he came to the floor\n\n[[Page S2077]]\n\nlast week in response to more bad news about ObamaCare and said the \nreason people aren't signing up for it is they just aren't educated \nenough about the Internet.\n  What he is essentially saying is that the people of this country, No. \n1, aren't telling the truth and; No. 2, aren't very smart. That is not \nwhat I believe and I don't think that is what any of my colleagues \nbelieve.\n  We do believe there are things we ought to be doing to get Americans \nback to work. Repealing ObamaCare would be a good place to start \nbecause it is making the cost of growing your business, expanding your \nbusiness in this country, dramatically higher. It is also raising the \npremiums and the deductibles for people all across this country, for \nmiddle-class families, and giving them fewer options when it comes to \ndoctors and to hospitals.\n  I want to talk just briefly, if I might, about the cost of \noverregulation and what it is doing to our economy.\n  We have had an opportunity during this discussion on unemployment \ninsurance to talk about some of the things that we would do if we would \nbe given a chance to offer amendments. Typically, the case around here, \nwhat happens, the practice and pattern of late is that the majority \nleader fills the tree and blocks us from offering amendments. We have a \nlot of Members on our side who have great ideas about things that would \nactually create jobs, actually grow the economy. One of the things we \nknow is costing jobs and hurting the economy is the cost of \noverregulation, destroying jobs and making it more difficult for our \njob creators.\n  In fact, the estimate is it is almost one-half trillion dollars in \nthe cost of regulations since the President has come to office--almost \none-half trillion dollars added--added cost in this country. That \nfigure is larger than the entire economy of Peru. It is larger than the \nentire economy of Sweden. Think about that. The cost of regulation in \nthis country since this President has come to office is larger than the \nentire economies of either Sweden or Peru.\n  One of the largest contributors to these new regulations and \ncompliance costs is the EPA, the Environmental Protection Agency. They \ncame out with the Boiler MACT regulations, they came out with the \nUtility MACT regulations, and they came out with tier 3 fuel standards. \nAll of these things that the EPA has finalized are some of the most \ncostly regulations we have seen from any agency in recent history.\n  These rules will impose billions of dollars in costs on energy \nproducers and manufacturers, which are going to be passed on to \nconsumers in the form of higher prices. Unfortunately, for consumers \nalready hurting in the Obama economy, more bad news is on the way. The \nEPA is currently working on regulations for ozone standards, greenhouse \ngas emissions for powerplants, and a dramatic expansion of the Clean \nWater Act that will reach into ditches and gullies all across America.\n\n  I would like to briefly touch on the impacts EPA mandates, including \ngreenhouse gas standards, regional haze requirements, Utility MACT, and \nBoiler MACT, are having on energy prices back in my home State of South \nDakota. Unfortunately, South Dakotans are on the frontlines of this \nadministration's war on affordable energy.\n  In 2008, then-Senator Obama promised to make energy prices skyrocket. \nToday, in my home State, he is fulfilling that promise. Just Monday \nBlack Hills Power, a utility company in western South Dakota, announced \na proposed rate increase to cover the cost of new EPA mandates. If that \nrate increase is approved, the average customer's rates will increase \nby $130 a year. For a family living in western South Dakota, $130 can \ngo a long way toward putting food on the table or making a car payment.\n  South Dakota is a rural State with energy-intensive manufacturing and \nagricultural sectors of our economy. Families have to travel long \ndistances. We are a cold-weather climate. We see dramatic swings in \nseasonal temperatures that create uncertainty when opening monthly \nutility bills. Unfortunately, the EPA's backdoor energy tax, which is \nalready beginning to hit South Dakota's families, is about to get even \nmore expensive.\n  The tier 3 gasoline standards, greenhouse gas regulations, and new \nozone rules are a train wreck of new regulations that are going to \nfurther drive up energy costs and destroy jobs. That is why I have \noffered two commonsense amendments to rein in these costly EPA \nregulations.\n  The first amendment would require Congress to approve any EPA \nregulation with a projected cost of more than $50 million a year. If \nCongress rejects that rule, the EPA would be forced to go back to the \ndrawing board and pursue less costly alternatives.\n  From regulating greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act to \nregulating streams and ditches under the Clean Water Act, this EPA \nstretches authority well beyond what Congress intended when we created \na Federal-State environment regulatory structure decades ago. This EPA \nneeds to be reined in, and the best way to do that is by creating \ncongressional oversight of major regulations.\n  My second amendment would create another check on the EPA's ever-\nexpanding regulatory reach. This would require the Department of Energy \nand the Government Accountability Office to conduct a cost-benefit \nanalysis of EPA's proposed greenhouse gas regulations on powerplants.\n  If, based on this study, the DOE, the Department of Energy, or GAO \ndetermined that the new regulations would raise energy prices or \ndestroy jobs, the new regulations could not take effect. The EPA could \nstill propose new regulations on new and existing powerplants, but \nthose regulations couldn't be finalized until it certified that those \nnew rules would not negatively impact jobs or energy costs.\n  We have over 10 million people who remain unemployed. Economic growth \nand job creation remain stagnant and middle-class incomes have dropped \nby $3,000 per family over the past 5 years. The last thing middle-class \nfamilies need is for their pocketbooks to be further stretched by \nmisguided government policies that drive up energy costs. It is time to \nput a check on the EPA. It is time to have an open debate, an amendment \nprocess on commonsense proposals to increase congressional oversight, \nand it is time to put consumers ahead of liberal environmental groups.\n\n  I encourage my colleagues on the floor with me today to continue \npushing for policies that make energy more abundant and more \naffordable. Unlike the heavyhanded regulations we have seen from the \nObama administration, these policies will actually create jobs and help \ngrow the middle class. I will continue fighting, along with my \ncolleagues joining me on the floor today, to make sure we get votes on \nthese policies and begin to rein in the out-of-control regulations from \nthe Obama administration.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I am pleased to be here with my colleagues \ntalking about ways we can get people back to work, regulations that \ndon't make sense, and energy policies that clearly every economist we \ntalk to understands are a key to the future.\n  I know the Republican leader has joined us on the floor, and I think \nI will ask him if he has some comments he would like to make, and then \nwe can come back to me at the end of his comments.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my friend from Missouri.\n  What we have been talking about is how to create jobs. Unfortunately, \nthe agenda of the Senate Democratic majority does just the opposite. It \nappears as if we are not likely to be able to get any amendments \noffered that would actually create jobs and opportunity for our people.\n  One of the things I have been so disturbed about over the years is \nthe inability of employees to make a voluntary choice about whether \nthey want to belong to a union.\n  In addition to the energy jobs measures we are discussing here today, \nI have another related measure I would like to highlight. As I \nmentioned earlier this morning in my opening remarks, enacting national \nright-to-work legislation is just plain common sense. My colleague from \nKentucky, Senator Paul, has been the leader on this issue.\n  This is a fundamental issue of worker freedom. This amendment would \nempower American workers to choose\n\n[[Page S2078]]\n\nwhether they would like to join a union. It would protect a worker from \ngetting fired if she would rather not pay dues to a union boss who \nfails to represent her concerns and her priorities. According to one \nsurvey, 80 percent of unionized workers agreed that workers should be \nable to choose whether to join a union.\n  It is an issue of upward mobility. A worker should be able to be \nrecognized and rewarded for her individual hard work and productivity.\n  This is paycheck fairness. A worker should no longer be held back by \nan antiquated system where pay raises are based on seniority rather \nthan on merit.\n  This is an issue of leveling the playing field. Workers in all States \nwould have a more equal chance of finding work in every State, and they \nwould no longer see their communities failing to secure new investments \nbecause their State hasn't passed a right-to-work law.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order for me to \noffer my amendment No. 2910, which I have just described to my \ncolleagues here in the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, reserving my right to object, the underlying \nmeasure is a bipartisan response to an emergency in terms of extending \nunemployment for 5 months--a temporary extension. Given the emergency \nnature of the underlying legislation, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, Senator Thune, my friend from South Dakota, \nand I have worked for a long time on the kinds of economic and \ntroublesome regulations he talked about earlier. Nobody appears to be \nanswerable to the people--those who come forward with these \nregulations. I think he has an amendment on that, and I would afford \nhim the chance to talk about that amendment.\n  Mr. THUNE. I thank my colleague from Missouri.\n  Senator Blunt and I have, as he said, worked very hard when it comes \nto the overreach of government agencies and the burdens of regulations, \nthe cost of regulations and what that is doing to a lot of middle-class \nfamilies and their pocketbooks.\n  I mentioned earlier a couple of amendments I had filed here that \npertained to energy costs in my home State of South Dakota, one of \nwhich sets a $50 million threshold over which a regulation proposed by \nthe EPA would have to be voted on by the Congress of the United States, \nand if Congress rejected it, the EPA would have to go back to the \ndrawing board to come up with an alternative approach. That amendment \nis amendment No. 2895, and I think it fits perfectly with what we are \ntalking about today, which is growing our economy, creating jobs, and \ntrying to do what actually would get people back to work. Certainly, \nthe burdensome cost of regulation is a tremendous deterrent and \nimpediment to job creation in this country.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be in order for me to offer my \namendment No. 2895.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). Is there objection?\n  The senior Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, reserving my right to object, once again, \ngiven the emergency nature of this bipartisan legislation to address \nthe plight of over 2 million Americans desperately looking for work, I \nobject and hope we can press on with the passing of the underlying \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, let's talk about this topic a little \nlonger--regulation. Again, in my view--and my friend from South Dakota \nand I have shared this view for a long time--when the Congress passes \nlaws--and I think it is appropriate that we are not always in the best \nplace to come up with the regulations that put those laws in place--I \nbelieve the country has clearly come to a place where nobody is then \nanswerable for regulations that have a significant impact on our \neconomy.\n  The Senator from Kentucky Mr. Paul and I have cosponsored the REINS \nAct, which addresses these laws that meet this kind of threshold, and \nit is a bill that was before the Congress, but we can't get that bill \nto the floor.\n  Senator Thune and I have worked for a long time on this kind of \nproposal that would simply create opportunity.\n  The emergency nature of the opportunity is really a 5-year emergency \nnow where we have seen job opportunity after job opportunity go away. \nPart of that is surely because of what were the unintended but clear \nconsequences of the Affordable Care Act, and part of it is rules and \nregulations that don't make sense to people who are about to take \nenough of a chance with their creation of opportunity for themselves \nand somebody else without having any idea that someone answerable to \nthem is eventually going to have to answer for what the Federal \nGovernment does. And that is what bringing these regulations to the \nfloor would do.\n  Nobody is saying Congress should be responsible for implementing \nevery law and the goal of law, but we should be responsible for the \nimpact of that law and should have the final say on rules and \nregulations that we have essentially started in motion. They should \ncome back here.\n  If we don't do this on this bill today, we should do this. We should \nhave done this years ago. Many of us in this body, in the Congress, \nhave believed for a long time that this is one of the major impediments \nto job creation.\n  Another impediment is bad energy policy. That is why there are so \nmany energy amendments. The amendment I offered where the Congress \ncouldn't have a carbon tax unless it passed a threshold of 60 votes was \noffered in the budget debate last year, and 53 of my colleagues--\nDemocrats and Republicans here on the floor--agreed that, yes, we \nshould have a special threshold.\n  When we talk about a tax that makes gas at the gasoline pump more \nexpensive; that makes diesel fuel that delivers products more \nexpensive; that raises the utility bill of everybody who has some \nelement of fossil fuel in their utilities, and that is virtually \neverybody; that makes it less likely that people will create \nmanufacturing jobs and those kinds of opportunities here, of course we \nought to be talking about those kinds of policies, whether or not it is \nthe carbon tax.\n  In Ohio, in Missouri, in Wyoming, in the vast middle of the country, \nour energy comes from fossil fuels. Those are the resources we have. \nOur focus should be on using those more effectively, not figuring out \nways we shouldn't use them at all or figuring out ways to double the \nutility bill.\n  That is the EPA's own estimate of their own rule, that the utility \nbill, they say, will go up 80 percent if the rule is in place. I think \nthat is probably a little optimistic on their part. Eighty percent is \nalmost doubling your current utility bill. Think about where you work \nor your daughter-in-law works or your son-in-law works or somebody in \nyour family works, doubling the utility bill there and wondering if \nthere will still be a utility there or if that company will decide to \ngo somewhere else. The incredibly capable and competitive American \nworkforce is being held back by utility policies that stop people from \nmaking the investments they want to make.\n  The energy cost of manufacturing, according to the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers and others, is a key element now in that \nfinal decision to decide where you are going to build something, where \nyou are going to make something, and, most importantly for families, \nwhere you are going to create a job that has the kind of take-home pay \nfamilies need.\n  When we talk about the Keystone Pipeline, the ability to maximize our \nuse of natural gas, of fracking for oil, we are talking about the great \nresources we have, and we should use those resources to our benefit. \nEvery other country in the world, when they look at their tableaux of \nnatural resources, the first two words that come to mind in every other \ncountry in the world are ``economic opportunity'' or ``economic \nadvantage.'' What does this allow us to do that we couldn't do \notherwise? What advantage does this give us over our competitors?\n  We shouldn't let the first two words that come to mind when we look \nat our\n\n[[Page S2079]]\n\nnatural resources be ``environmental hazard.'' What is the worst thing \nthat would happen and what would happen if that happened every day? No. \n1, the worst thing to happen is something we should think about but not \nbe overwhelmed by. We should see that that doesn't happen, and if it \ndoes happen, what are we immediately prepared to do about it so it does \nnot become an ongoing problem? That is the whole formula it takes on \nthe energy side, on the natural resources side to create opportunity.\n  The one thing government policies can do, although they can't create \njobs, is they can create an environment where people want to create \nprivate sector jobs. That is and continues to be the No. 1 priority \ndomestically this Congress should be focused on--what we do to create \nmore private sector jobs. I think energy is a big part of that.\n  Certainly, my friend from Wyoming Senator Barrasso who has brought us \ntogether to talk about this, understands that so well. Energy and \nregulation policies that make sense are the kinds of policies that help \nus create the opportunities that hard-working families need and that \nfamilies who would like to see somebody in their family have that job \nwith great take-home pay are focused on.\n  I yield for my friend Senator Barrasso.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I thank my colleague, and I appreciate the comments of \nmy colleague Senator Blunt, who has been a leader and champion on the \nissue of getting people back to work.\n  We heard the Senator from Rhode Island saying there are people out \nthere desperately looking for work. What we are doing is bringing to \nthe floor amendments to this piece of legislation that will actually \nget people back to work nearly immediately.\n  So I rise today to discuss how Congress can actually help the people \nwho are unemployed get back to work. We have been debating all week \nwhether the Senate should extend unemployment insurance to the long-\nterm unemployed. And whether or not one supports extending unemployment \ninsurance, we can all agree and should all agree that job creation \nshould really be the top priority. This, to me, is where the \nunemployment insurance bill, as currently written, falls short. That is \nwhy I, along with a number of my colleagues, have filed amendments that \nwould help create nearly 100,000 jobs.\n  Our amendment would do two things, and President Obama has failed to \ndo them. The amendment I am here with Senator Hoeven to discuss would \npermit--approve the Keystone XL Pipeline as well as liquefied natural \ngas exports to our allies and strategic partners.\n  The Keystone XL Pipeline has been pending for over 5\\1/2\\ years--over \n5\\1/2\\ years. During that time the Obama administration has conducted \nfive separate environmental reviews of this project--five environmental \nreviews in the last 5\\1/2\\ years.\n  Despite this scrutiny, President Obama continues to delay approving \nthe Keystone XL Pipeline even though its construction would support \nover 42,000 jobs. That 42,000 jobs number is not my number. This is the \njobs estimate from President Obama's own State Department.\n  The Keystone XL Pipeline has broad bipartisan support throughout the \ncountry. A recent Washington Post/ABC News poll found that 65 percent \nof Americans support the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline. \nLabor unions such as the plumbers and pipefitters, building and \nconstruction trades, international labor, and the union of operating \nengineers, among others, have all called on the President of the United \nStates to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline. Just over 1 year ago, 62 \nMembers of the Senate voted in favor of the Keystone XL Pipeline.\n  If the Senate is going to extend unemployment insurance, it should \nalso help Americans get back to work. We should adopt this amendment \nwhich approves the Keystone XL Pipeline.\n  The other part of the amendment deals with approving LNG exports--\nliquefied natural gas--to our allies and strategic partners. Before \ngetting into the specifics of that, I ask my colleague and friend from \nNorth Dakota, Senator Hoeven--who has worked closely with supporters of \nthe Keystone XL Pipeline, a man who was Governor of the State of North \nDakota during the early discussions--to express his thoughts on why we \nthink this is important to the economy, to help those people who are \nunemployed, and help getting Americans back to work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I thank the esteemed Senator from Wyoming \nfor leading this colloquy.\n  Our effort here is to address in real terms the problem--the \nlegislation we have on the floor right now is the unemployment \ninsurance bill--to truly address the problem, which is getting people \nback to work, rather than additional government payments added onto the \npayments already made.\n  What we are trying to do is make sure there are jobs to get people \nback to work. Energy is an incredible opportunity to do just that. So \nwhen we talk about this energy legislation, it is about producing more \nenergy for our country. But it is about jobs, it is about economic \ngrowth, and it is about national security. So I commend the esteemed \nSenator from Wyoming for leading the charge on legislation which would \nallow us to export liquefied natural gas.\n  We currently consume in the United States on an annual basis about 26 \ntrillion cubic feet of natural gas a year, but we produce 30 trillion \ncubic feet of natural gas a year. So we are already in a situation \nwhere we are producing more than we consume. We import some from \nCanada, and we are growing in terms of our domestic production in \nStates such as Wyoming, my home State, and others. Across the country \nwith the shale gas development, we are producing more and more natural \ngas. We need a market for that natural gas, and Europe very much needs \nnatural gas so they are not dependent on Russia for their energy. So we \nare talking about an opportunity here at home to actually create more \neconomic activity and put people back to work. That is the real \nsolution. It doesn't cost the government one penny. Instead, we get \nrevenue--not from higher taxes, but from a growing economy and people \ngoing back to work.\n  When we look at this legislation, we have taken legislation led by \nthe Senator from Wyoming and we have tied it together with Keystone \nlegislation I have submitted. We call it the Energy Security Act, and \nit does those two things--it approves the Keystone XL Pipeline, a $5.3 \nbillion investment by private companies in our economy. By the Obama \nadministration's own estimate, their State Department has said it will \ncreate more than 40,000 jobs in the construction phase. We tie that \nwith legislation which has been put forward by the Senator from \nWyoming, which I am extremely pleased to cosponsor. We put those two \ntogether, LNG exports with Keystone. We call it the Energy Security \nAct. We have submitted it and we have filed it as amendment No. 2891.\n  I therefore ask unanimous consent that it be in order for me to offer \nmy amendment No. 2891.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, reserving my right to object, once again, \nthe underlying legislation is designed to help 2.7 million Americans \nwho need the support. It is a bipartisan agreement. There is a time and \nplace to debate all these issues, but I think the time and place now is \nto move forward and vote on the underlying agreement.\n  Therefore, I respectfully object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. With due deference to the good Senator, I understand his \ndesire to make sure people who are unemployed receive assistance. I \nthink he truly is a champion in that effort. I appreciate the \nopportunity to work with him in a bipartisan way. But I would submit \nthis very legislation absolutely complements what he is trying to do, \nand does it in a number of ways, first, in terms of a permanent, real, \nlong-term solution--meaning getting those people back to work, but, \nsecond, in terms of paying for it, in terms of actually paying for the \ncost of unemployment insurance, these provisions--this amendment and \nthe other amendment we are offering--will actually help create revenue \nto do what the Senator is trying to do.\n\n[[Page S2080]]\n\n  For that reason, I think it is absolutely complementary to the \nlegislation at hand and will in fact add bipartisan support to passage \nof that legislation.\n  I will cite one more extremely compelling study which relates to this \npoint before I turn back to the Senator from Wyoming.\n  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce in 2011 commissioned a study. They had \nexperts do an evaluation of energy projects awaiting approval to \nproceed from the administration--awaiting permits or other requirements \nso they could proceed with these energy projects.\n  What I am talking about are energy projects that total billions, even \nhundreds of billions, of dollars where private companies are willing to \ninvest their money and develop energy resources across this great \ncountry.\n  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce study I cite was performed in 2011. It \ncame back and said there are more than 350 energy projects, both \nrenewable type energy and traditional energy, that are stalled because \nof bureaucratic redtape on the part of the Federal Government at a cost \nof $1.1 trillion to the American economy and nearly 2 million jobs for \nthe American people. Think about that, 2 million jobs for the American \npeople, when what we are talking about here today is the unemployed.\n  What we are talking about here today is putting people back to work.\n  I will cite from that study:\n\n       In aggregate, planning and construction of the subject \n     projects (the ``investment phase'') would generate $577 \n     billion in direct investment, calculated in current dollars. \n     The indirect and induced effects (what we term multiplier \n     effects) would generate an approximate $1.1 trillion increase \n     in U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) including $352 billion \n     in employment earnings, based on present discounted value \n     (PDV) over an average construction period of seven years. \n     Furthermore, we estimate that as many as 1.9 million jobs \n     would be required during each year of construction.\n\n  Good-paying construction jobs. The Keystone XL Pipeline is just one \nof those more than 350 projects, and it alone is an investment of $5.3 \nbillion. It alone, according to the State Department's own estimates, \nwill create more than 40,000 jobs.\n  What are we trying to do here? I thought it was to put people back to \nwork, trying to make sure they have an opportunity--in States such as \nOhio. Of course, in my State we have an energy boom. We are trying to \nget people. We have more jobs than people because we have unleashed \nthis investment in energy. We have done that in our State. Why not do \nit across the country? Why not do it across the country? There is no \nquestion we can.\n  We have offered other amendments as well. The other point I want to \nmake is they are bipartisan amendments. They are amendments that don't \ncost the Federal Government any money but create incredible investment \nand incredible opportunity for our people, and they are bipartisan.\n  One of the amendments put forward by the Senator from Missouri passed \nthrough the House with 1 dissenting vote. I don't know if the 1 \ndissenting vote was Republican or Democrat, but I don't know how you \nget any more bipartisan than that, because they were one short of \nunanimous. So that is what we are talking about here.\n  I know negotiations and discussions are going on as to votes we may \nget on the legislation we are offering as part of this unemployment \ninsurance bill. I ask the leadership on the majority side to allow us \nto vote on these amendments. We will accept the verdict of the Senate; \nall 100 get to vote, which is what we were sent here to do.\n  I will close with that. This isn't about either the Democratic side \nof the aisle or the Republican side of the aisle. This is about people \nwho are unemployed and need an opportunity. We absolutely have the \nability to give them that opportunity, so let's do it. Let's do it. \nThat is what this debate is all about.\n  Again, I thank the distinguished Senator from Wyoming for leading the \ndiscussion. He has been an energy leader as well as a physician, so he \ncertainly has been a leader on the health care issue too. But he has \ncertainly been an energy leader, and his State is a leading energy-\nproducing State.\n  As I said at the outset, and he has made the point so eloquently, \nthis is an opportunity. Energy is an opportunity. It is jobs, it is \neconomic growth, it is national security. Let's go. Let's get it done.\n  With that, I turn to my colleague from Wyoming and again thank him \nfor his leadership of this important discussion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 5 minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of my friend \nand colleague from North Dakota, a State in which he served as a \nGovernor, a business leader in the community, and knows the State very \nwell and knows the importance of energy--not just to his State's \neconomy but to the economy of the country and the importance for people \nwho want work, who want jobs.\n  I think bringing together the issues of the Keystone XL Pipeline as \nwell as the exportation of liquefied natural gas is what will help get \nAmericans back to work.\n  Since September of 2010, the Obama administration approved only seven \napplications to export liquefied natural gas. The administration is \nsitting on 24 pending applications. Thirteen of those applications have \nbeen pending for more than 1 year. Some of these applications have been \npending for more than 2 years. To put this in context: The United \nStates has approved less than half of the LNG export capacity that \nCanada has approved. To me, this administration's delay is unacceptable \nand the excuses have run out.\n  I take a look at this from the standpoint of what is happening \nglobally as well. Ukraine imports about 60 percent to 70 percent of its \nnatural gas from Russia. Nine of our NATO allies import 40 percent or \nmore of their natural gas from Russia. Four of our NATO allies import \n100 percent of their natural gas from Russia.\n  LNG exports would help our strategic partners and allies free \nthemselves from Russian energy. This is why our NATO allies are calling \non Congress to expedite--expedite--LNG exports.\n  LNG exports will give our allies an alternative supply of natural gas \nand enable them to resist Russia's intimidation. LNG exports will also \nhelp create jobs right here at home.\n  In February, The Economist explained that LNG exports ``would \ngenerate tanker loads of cash'' for the United States.\n  More recently, Nera Economic Consulting suggested that LNG exports \ncould help reduce the unemployment rolls by as many as 45,000 over the \nnext few years. This is extraordinary. LNG exports would not only \ncreate new jobs but would employ Americans who cannot find work today.\n  LNG exports would help as many as 45,000 Americans find \nwork. President Obama through his actions has made it very clear that \njobs are not his priority. He seems to be more interested in inventing \nnew delays and new excuses than in actually creating new jobs. That is \nwhy the Senate must act today and here in this place. That is why the \nSenate should approve the Keystone XL Pipeline and LNG exports and that \nis why we should adopt the amendment that Senator Hoeven has offered.\n\n  So, Mr. President, I come to the floor today to say Republicans have \nnow tried to offer 9 amendments we believe would get this economy \ngrowing again, amendments we believe would actually create jobs and put \npeople back to work.\n  Now, to inform my colleagues of what I am about to do, I am going to \nmove to table the pending Reid amendment No. 2878, which for everyone's \ninformation is an amendment which merely changes the date of enactment. \nSo Senators voting not to table this amendment would rather change the \ndate than vote on amendments that would help put people back to work.\n  In order for my colleagues to be able to offer amendments, I move to \ntable the pending Reid amendment No. 2878, and I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, pursuant to an order that is now in effect \nin the Senate, I move to proceed to executive session to consider the \nMalinowski, Wu, and Birx nominations, and ask that all time for debate \nbe yielded back on all of these nominations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the nominations.\n  The assistant bill clerk read the nominations of Tomasz P. \nMalinowski, of the District of Columbia, to be Assistant Secretary of \nState for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor; Portia Y.

Birx, of Maryland, to be Ambassador at Large and Coordinator \nof United States Government Activities to Combat HIV/AIDS Globally.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I rise to express my support for \nthe nomination of Dr. Deborah Birx to serve as the next Global Aids \nCoordinator at the Department of State. Dr. Birx's extensive \nleadership, experience, and research in the field of HIV/AIDS make her \nan ideal candidate to lead our Nation's response to HIV/AIDS around the \nworld.\n  The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, PEPFAR, has been a \nresounding success. Our investments in fighting HIV/AIDS throughout the \nworld have resulted in access to treatment for millions of people and \ndramatic reductions in new infections. It has also garnered \nunprecedented respect for the United States in communities around the \nworld. This is why it is important that we have a strong coordinator \nwho will continue to lead on this important issue. Dr. Birx has a \nunique combination of scientific, technical, and leadership experience \nthat makes her the best candidate for this position.\n  Dr. Birx began her career serving in the Walter Reed Army Medical \nCenter and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, where she led \nthe Department of Defense in its work on HIV/AIDS throughout the 1980s. \nIn that role, she lead one of the most influential HIV vaccine trials \nin history,\n\n[[Page S2082]]\n\nwhich resulted in the first supporting evidence of any vaccine being \neffective in lowering the risk of contracting HIV.\n  For more than a decade, Dr. Birx served as the Director of the U.S. \nMilitary HIV Research Program at the Department of Defense. During her \ntime there she brought together the Army, Navy, and Air Force in a new \nmodel of cooperation and greatly improved the U.S. military's HIV/AIDS \nefforts through innovative collaboration.\n  Since 2005, she has served as the Director of the Global AIDS Program \nat the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC. Through her \nleadership, CDC now has an infrastructure that supports HIV/AIDS \nprograms in over 75 countries in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, and Latin \nAmerica which are funded by PEPFAR.\n  Dr. Birx has dedicated her career to advancing and improving the \nfield of HIV/AIDS. After three decades in the fight against HIV/AIDS, \nher passion and dedication to her work has not wavered, and she remains \nstalwart in her belief that we can put an end to this epidemic. Her \nleadership and expertise in this field is unprecedented, which is why I \nurge my colleagues to support the nomination of Dr. Deborah Birx to \nserve as the next U.S. Global Aids Coordinator.\n\n\n                     Vote On Malinowski Nomination\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume legislative session.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, I can still remember my first job as \nthough it was yesterday. I worked as a busboy at a local family \nrestaurant during our small-town fair. While that job only lasted a few \ndays, I still remember how incredibly proud I was to have earned a few \ndollars myself. The next year that same family hired me to bus tables \nand wash dishes year-round at their family restaurant. I soon went from \nbusing tables to bagging groceries and then stocking shelves at the \nlocal grocery store.\n  I grew up on a small farming and ranching operation. So whether it \nwas drying dishes after dinner or helping my dad with the cattle, hard \nwork was simply a requirement for every single member of my family. In \naddition to tending cattle, my dad worked as a utility lineman. And my \nmother worked in a factory inspecting wheels on the assembly line.\n  Like a lot of Americans, I learned the dignity of work long before I \never held a job. I learned at home.\n  Everyone deserves a fair shot at success in this country. That is at \nthe heart of why raising the minimum wage truly matters.\n  Minimum wage workers are not just teenagers. They are single parents \nworking two jobs to make ends meet. They are women working a minimum-\nwage job at a movie theater for 8 years waiting for a raise. They are \nstudents working toward a degree that they hope will make all the \ndifference in their lives. They are mothers and fathers working 40 \nhours a week--sometimes many more--to support their families.\n  These are the Americans who work hard and earn the Federal minimum \nwage and still find it difficult--some would argue impossible--to get \nahead.\n  At $7.25 an hour, the Federal minimum wage has lost more than 30 \npercent of its value over the past four decades. Groceries and housing, \neducation and energy costs all continue to rise, but the minimum wage \nsimply has not kept pace.\n  This financial hardship is especially felt by women who make up a \nmajority of minimum wage workers in this country. And stagnant wages \nhinder a family's chance to work their way into the middle class.\n  For many, raising the minimum wage means the difference between \npoverty and dignity. It can mean the difference between a trip to the \nfood bank and a trip to the grocery store. It means the difference \nbetween earning enough to just barely get by and earning enough to at \nleast think about the future.\n  That is why I am supporting the Minimum Wage Fairness Act to raise \nthe Federal minimum wage to $10.10 per hour by 2015.\n  According to recent estimates, more than 100,000 New Mexicans would \nreceive a direct raise from this legislation, and another 43,000 would \nsee their pay increase as overall wages improve, dramatically \nincreasing economic opportunities for New Mexico families.\n  Raising the minimum wage is not just good for those workers; it is \ngood for business and it is good for the economy at large. A higher \nminimum wage helps reduce turnover, increases productivity, and boosts \nconsumer demand.\n  A higher minimum wage puts more money in the pockets of people who \nspend locally and helps create a ladder of opportunity into the middle \nclass.\n  Americans are no strangers to hard work and embrace the belief that \nif you work hard and you play by the rules, you should be able to get \nahead, you deserve a fair shot.\n  There are cities in New Mexico that are already taking the initiative \nand raising the minimum wage on their own. The city of Santa Fe's \nminimum wage is $10.51 per hour. As a city councilor myself, I fought \nto raise the minimum wage in Albuquerque. And today Albuquerque's \nminimum wage is still $1.25 more than the current Federal rate.\n  In Las Cruces, there is a growing grassroots effort to raise that \ncity's minimum wage.\n  I know this fight. We need to raise the national minimum wage so that \nall workers have a fair shot to get ahead. Because, the truth is, the \ndeck has been stacked against working families for some time now. Too \nmany working families are forced to make decisions that hurt the \nprogress and strength of our Nation as a whole--such as taking on an \nextra shift instead of pursuing their education, or having to choose \nbetween paying the heating bill or the phone bill.\n  Raising the minimum wage is key to making this economic recovery work \nfor all of us. But raising the minimum wage alone is not enough to \nconstitute a middle-class economic agenda.\n  We need to put preschool within the financial grasp of every working \nfamily, and we need to address the outrageous increases in college \ntuition and loan costs. We must invest in vocational training and help \nbuild the modern American manufacturing economy of the 21st century. We \nmust close the gender wage gap to ensure that women are paid what they \ndeserve--paid equally with men.\n  Fair, livable wages, together with educational opportunities for \nmiddle-class families--that is a formula for a real opportunity agenda.\n  It is time to ensure that every New Mexican, every American has a \nfair shot. It is time to raise the minimum wage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  The Finance Committee is considering something we call in the Senate \ntax extenders. One of those is the wind production tax credit. For the \nnext 10 minutes or so, I wish to address that\n\n[[Page S2083]]\n\nlaw which has been on the books for more than 20 years. It expired in \nDecember, and, in my view, needs to stay expired.\n  One of the things we remember most about the late President Ronald \nReagan, is what he said about government programs: The closest you will \ncome to eternal life on this Earth is a government program.\n  Well, my nomination for the most glaring example of a government \nprogram that seems to have eternal life is the wind production tax \ncredit--the Federal taxpayers' subsidy for what I would call ``big \nwind.''\n  Here is what the wind production tax credit does. Let's say you build \none of those 20-story turbines and the wind turbines begin to go \naround, as they will about one-third of the time to produce \nelectricity. So for every kilowatt hour of electricity that you \nproduce, the taxpayers will pay you 2.3 cents. That is a pretty good \ndeal because the wholesale price of electricity, depending on where you \nare at in the country, might range from about 3 cents per kilowatt hour \nto 7 cents per kilowatt hour. So let's say you are in Oregon or a part \nof the country where they have pretty cheap electricity and you sell \nwind for 3 cents a kilowatt hour. You will pay 1 cent of the money you \nget in Federal corporate tax. That leaves you with 2 cents, but then \nthe taxpayer is going to come in and pay you 2.3 cents on top of that. \nBecause it is a tax credit, it is worth even more.\n  Now it is even better than that. That subsidy is not just for 1 year, \nbut it is for 10 years. So every time we have a 1-year extension of the \nwind production tax credit, we tell the owner of the wind turbine--and \nusually they take these ownerships and they put them in portfolios and \nthey split them up and sell them to rich people around the country and \naround the world who can use the tax credits--it is for 10 years. So \nthe wind production tax credit is 2.3 cents per kilowatt hour of \ntaxpayer money, every year for 10 years if you are producing wind \nelectricity.\n  This provision of the Tax Code was enacted in 1992. It was supposed \nto be a ``temporary'' subsidy. It was intended to do what we have done \nseveral times in our country, which is to jump-start a new energy \ntechnology. Well, as President Reagan observed, eternal life for a \ngovernment program sinks in pretty quickly. This temporary tax \nprovision, enacted in 1992--more than 20 years ago--has been extended \neight times since its enactment. The wind industry has become a very \nwell-developed industry.\n  I asked President Obama's Nobel Prize-winning Energy Secretary, \nSecretary Chu, in the first term of President Obama's administration \nhow he would describe wind power. He said it was a ``mature'' \ntechnology.\n  The No. 1 problem with the wind production tax credit is its cost. \nCongress enacted a 1-year extension for 2013. That was at a cost of \nnearly $12 billion to the taxpayers--remember, not all in 2013; that \nwas just for a 1-year extension. For 2014 there is another 1-year \nextension which is being considered by the Finance Committee, and that \nwill be another $6 billion.\n  This is real money. I mean, just look at the amount of money we spend \non energy research in multiple agencies. The number is about $10 \nbillion let's say we, through our research, developed a way to capture \ncarbon from coal plants and recycle that carbon and turn it into \nsomething commercially feasible and sell it. Then all of a sudden, \nthese coal plants that people worry about because they produce carbon, \nwould be as clean as nuclear power, as clean as wind power. As a result \nwe would be building coal plants everywhere in America. That seems like \na better use of taxpayer dollars. We would have cheap electricity--even \ncheaper electricity for a longer period of time.\n  We spend $10 billion on energy research in a year and the last 1-year \nextension of the wind production tax credit was $12 billion over 10 \nyears. By comparison, take tax breaks for Big Oil. One of the last \ntimes President Obama wanted to end the tax subsidies for what he \ncalled Big Oil, he identified $4 billion worth of tax subsidies. Well, \nmost of those tax breaks, he calls subsidies for Big Oil, are tax \nbreaks that many manufacturing companies have.\n  The point I am trying to make is that we are talking about a lot of \nmoney.\n  The supporters of this tax credit will say: ``Let's phase it out.'' \nIn fact, it is phased out. If Congress did not act, all of those people \nwho currently today have their wind turbines would continue to get \ntheir subsidies for up to 10 more years. So that phases it out.\n  But let's say we phase it out according to a proposal that was made \nlast year by the wind industry. Well, the American Energy Alliance said \nthat might cost as much as $50 billion over 10 years--a huge amount of \nmoney. Now, there could be some other form of phase out--I would \nwelcome the opportunity to see it--that would not cost so much. Maybe \nthat would make sense, but beware the phase out.\n  The United States uses 20 to 25 percent of all of the electricity in \nthe world. It is important to us. We use it for our computers, we use \nit for our businesses, we use it for our military, and we use it for \nour lights. If the lights go out in America, America stops. That is how \nimportant electricity is to us.\n  Where does that electricity come from? Four percent of it comes from \nwind power. Of course, that is only available when the wind blows--\nusually at night, usually when we need it the least. Four percent of \nour electricity is wind after 22 years and billions of dollars. The \nrest of it comes from other sources--7 percent from hydroelectric \npower; 19 percent from nuclear power, which is about 60 percent of all \nof our clean energy; nearly 40 percent from coal; and 27 percent from \nnatural gas. So 4 percent from wind.\n  It is true, as wind power advocates say, that in the past Congress \nhas approved other jump-starts for energy technology. But the \ndifference is that we put a cap on them.\n  We are very happy about all of the unconventional gas we have in this \ncountry today. Suddenly, we have an enormous amount of natural gas. The \nresearch for that partially came from Sandia Laboratory, from \nDepartment of Energy demonstration projects. There was a tax credit for \nfracking, but it expired in 1992. The demonstration projects are over. \nThis technology is out in the marketplace and making lives better all \nacross the country. Take plug-in electric cars. I supported that, but \nthere was a cap on the number of credits we had for plug-in electric \ncars--200,000 per manufacturer. The nuclear production tax credit works \njust like the wind production tax credit. You sell a kilowatt hour of \nelectricity from a nuclear power plant, and we will give you a taxpayer \ncredit. But that is capped at 6,000 megawatts. So there is a limit to \nit. There is no cap on the subsidy for electricity produced by wind. I \ndo not know the exact number, but it is probably in the 50- or 60- or \n70,000 megawatt range.\n  Problem No. 1 is cost.\n  Problem No. 2 is reliability risk.\n  The problem here is that Congress is picking winners and losers. When \nit gives wind power such a big subsidy that is sometimes more than the \ncost of the electricity, it undercuts our coal and nuclear plants. And \nwhat that does is put us at risk as a country. Any country that uses \nthat much electricity needs these big plants to operate almost all the \ntime--coal and nuclear--to keep the lights on, to support jobs, to keep \nthe cars running, and to make America run. Our country cannot run on \nwindmills that only work when the wind blows. We cannot run only on \nsolar power that only works when the Sun shines. We have to have \nbaseload power.\n\n  Because the wind subsidy is picking winners and losers, it undercuts \nbaseload power. It has caused the Center for Strategic and \nInternational Studies, a very well-respected organization, to say that \nthe combination of the federal subsidy for wind power and low gas \nprices could cause as many as 25 percent of our nuclear plants in \nAmerica to close within the next 10 years. That would be a terrible \nblow to our country's economy, to our effort to improve family incomes \nand to find jobs for middle-class Americans.\n  How could that be? How does it do that? Well, let's take this \nexample. Let's say you are in Chicago and it is the middle of the \nnight, 3 a.m., and the demand for electricity goes down as people go to \nsleep. Well, the supplier of electricity to your home or your business \nin Chicago is buying electricity from the market at the lowest possible\n\n[[Page S2084]]\n\ncost. Well, as the demand goes down, the price goes down, and who is \nleft out there selling electricity? It is the wind power people because \nthey can give away their electricity and still make a profit because of \nthe subsidy. This negative pricing is what is undermining baseload, \ncoal and nuclear.\n  We are very proud of the fact that in our country we have, in effect, \na domestic price for natural gas. It is very low. Chemical companies \nare moving back to America instead of leaving. Manufacturing plants are \nenjoying the lower costs, and so are homeowners as they heat and cool \ntheir homes. But remember that natural gas prices can go up and they \ncan go down. In 2005 they were not $3 and $4 as they are today, they \nwere $13. In New England, even today sometimes natural gas prices spike \nto $30 a unit. So it is important to have diversity and it is important \nto have baseload power.\n  The third problem is that these large wind turbines destroy the \nenvironment in the name of saving the environment. Some people might \nlike to look at them. I really do not. Particularly in my part of the \ncountry, the only places they work are along the foothills or along the \ntops of the most beautiful mountains in the Eastern United States. So \nyou string these 20-story structures with blinking lights that can be \nseen for 20 miles in the middle of the beautiful view you have in the \nEastern United States. They take up a lot of space.\n  You could run these 20-story windmills from Georgia to Maine to \nproduce electricity, scarring the entire eastern landscape. Or you \ncould produce the same amount of electricity with eight nuclear power \nplants. And you would still need the nuclear power plants to produce \nelectricity when the wind is not blowing, which is most of the time.\n  The final problem is energy security. I had a meeting with George \nShultz, the former Secretary of State, the other day in San Francisco. \nHe made an observation that I had not heard him make before. George \nShultz said, ``We should pay a lot of attention to generating more \nenergy where we use it because of national security risks.''\n  George Shultz is head of the MIT Energy Initiative. He was observing \nthat the supply of energy ought to be near the user of energy. That is \nespecially true with military bases. It could be true for the rest of \nus in this age of terrorism. That is another reason it makes less sense \nto subsidize these giant turbines say in the Great Plains, and then \nsomeone has to pay for 700 miles of transmission lines through \nbackyards and nature preserves to get the wind power to Memphis--to \nbring that electricity to Tennessee and the Tennessee Valley.\n  Expecting the United States to operate on windmills is the energy \nequivalent of going to war in sailboats while nuclear power is \navailable. It is even worse than that. It is the same as destroying our \nnuclear ships--our nuclear plants, the same way--and replacing them \nwith sailboats.\n  The energy subsidy for wind turbines has served a purpose for the \nlast 22 years. We have spent enough money on them. We have distorted \nthe market as much as we can stand. Because of the cost and because we \nare undermining the baseload power of coal and nuclear, which puts us \nat risk as a country that uses 20 to 25 percent of the electricity in \nthe world, my hope would be that the Finance Committee would save some \nmoney and let the marketplace flourish. Give us the opportunity to \nallow the wind production tax credit to stay right where it is, \nexpired, as it did at the end of last year. Let those persons who \nalready have the benefit of the credits enjoy them for the rest of the \nperiod of time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I rise to address two subjects briefly on the floor and \nwould ask that my remarks be divided appropriately in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. There has been a lot said about the Affordable Care Act \non the floor of this Chamber for 5 years. I was here when we passed the \nAffordable Care Act. I am in the Senate as it is being implemented.\n  There have been lots of things said about it, but this year marks one \nof the things we need to recognize as a major hit to small business. \nBernie Marcus, a founder of Home Depot and the former chairman and CEO, \nopined yesterday in the Wall Street Journal about the cost of ObamaCare \nto American business, a hidden tax that has been unveiled on the \nAmerican people, the American ratepayer, and the American small \nbusiness person.\n  A tax assessment of $8 billion in 2014 is being levied by the \nAffordable Care Act against every insurance company that sells to the \nsmall- and medium-sized market, to every insurance company that sells a \nMedicare Advantage policy or a Medicare managed care policy. The 2014 \nassessment is $8 billion, and it graduates up to where in 2018 it is \n$14.3 billion. That assessment is an arbitrary amount of money that was \nused as a pay-for in the ObamaCare legislation.\n  It is assessed on the insurance companies based on their market share \nof the insurance market in small- or medium-sized carriers, Medicare \nAdvantage, and Medicaid managed care plans. It represents about a $500-\nper-year rate increase on every one of those policyholders, because as \nwe all know when an insurance company has the added cost to the \nadministration of their policy, that cost is obviously passed on to the \nconsumer; $500 a year is $5,000 in the next decade. It also represents \nover the next decade the loss, as estimated by the CBO and NFIB, of \n146,000 jobs.\n  Let's think for a minute. The main topics we have had this year in \nthe Senate of the United States is income inequality, the need to lower \nunemployment, and the need to create jobs. Yet the signature piece of \nlegislation of this administration is going to cost us because of a new \ntax being levied against insurance companies that provide health \ninsurance to the American people, and it is going to cost 146,000 jobs. \nIt is another example of how we need to rethink the approach of the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  We have to recognize all the things it has done from the standpoint \nof taxes, cost, lost jobs, and lost wages. Reform that legislation, \nrepeal that legislation, and get it right for the people of the United \nStates of America.\n  I commend Bernie Marcus on bringing this to the people's attention. I \ncommend him on all he has done for my State and for our country, and I \nhope he will keep on giving us his opinion for what is best for the \nUnited States of America.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a column \nwritten and published yesterday in the Wall Street Journal by Mr. \nBernie Marcus, cofounder, former chairman, and CEO of Home Depot.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From The Wall Street Journal, Apr. 1, 2014]\n\n                  ObamaCare's Hidden Hit on Businesses\n\n                           (By Bernie Marcus)\n\n       The law's insurance-company fee will raise premiums and \n     kill at least 146,000 jobs.\n       President Obama's promise that Americans could keep their \n     health insurance if they liked it was the most infamous of \n     the Affordable Care Act's sketchy sales pitches. But many of \n     the law's most damaging aspects are less known, buried in \n     thousands of pages of regulations.\n       Consider the ``fee''--really a hidden sales tax--that all \n     health-insurance companies have been forced to pay since the \n     first of this year on premiums for policies sold to \n     individuals and small and medium-size businesses. The health-\n     insurance tax--known as HIT in business circles--is expected \n     to generate revenues of about $8 billion this year and as \n     much as $14.3 billion by 2018, according to the legislation.\n       The Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on \n     Taxation predict that insurance companies will pass the cost \n     on to customers, as any company subject to such a tax would. \n     In other words, millions of Americans lucky enough to keep \n     their current health insurance under ObamaCare will be paying \n     much higher premiums because of this tax, with the added cost \n     rippling through the economy and stifling job creation.\n       The National Federation of Independent Businesses projects \n     the health-insurance tax will add an additional $475 per year \n     for the average individually purchased family policy--nearly \n     $5,000 over the course of a decade. Small businesses will \n     take an even bigger hit, with the cost of an employer-\n     provided family policy rising a projected $6,800 in the next \n     decade.\n       Since most large companies self-insure, they aren't \n     affected by the new tax. But smaller- and medium-size \n     businesses don't have that luxury and will bear the brunt of \n     the tax. Many will be forced to raise their employees' share \n     of premium payments or, worse, lay off workers to pay the \n     escalating costs of health care for their core employees.\n\n[[Page S2085]]\n\n       The NFIB projects private-sector employment through 2022 \n     will be reduced by at least 146,000 jobs because of the \n     health-insurance tax, and perhaps as much as 262,000 jobs. \n     That's like vaporizing some of the largest employers in the \n     country. Just the low-end estimate--146,000 jobs--is still \n     more than the total number of employees currently working for \n     companies like Costco, Microsoft and Delta Airlines.\n       Sadly, the NFIB predicts that 59% of the reduced job growth \n     will be in small- and medium-size businesses, America's \n     biggest engines of job creation. Worse, 26% of the problem \n     will be concentrated in very small businesses--the Main \n     Street cafes, retailers and family businesses that are the \n     backbone of the U.S. economy. America's 28 million small \n     businesses make up 99.7% of all American employers. They also \n     create 63% of new private-sector jobs.\n       The jobs never created because of the health-insurance tax \n     will be a ``death of a thousand cuts'' on Main Street that \n     adds up to a major wound for the economy. As a result, NFIB \n     predicts total gross domestic product in 2022 will be $23 \n     billion to $35 billion smaller than it would have been absent \n     the HIT.\n       To get a handle on what this means, consider that \n     McDonald's Corp. grossed $27.6 billion last year, selling to \n     68 million customers per day in 119 countries. So this one \n     new tax on our health insurance is projected to drill a hole \n     in our economy as big as McDonald's in just eight years, with \n     the overwhelming majority of the damage falling on already \n     struggling small businesses.\n       According to the Congressional Budget Office, the \n     Affordable Care Act was designed to fix only half the problem \n     of uninsured Americans, by bringing the number of uninsured \n     from 53 million down to 27 million--equal to the current \n     population of Texas. Yet this half-solution has brought with \n     it full-sized problems--like lost health coverage for the \n     previously insured, and job-killing policies like the health-\n     insurance tax.\n       Poor enrollment figures and endless stories of Americans \n     losing insurance indicate the law won't even be able to \n     accomplish its incomplete goals. Building a sicker economy \n     will not create healthy Americans. Congress and the president \n     must reform this ``reform.''\n\n\n                                  Iran\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. America was insulted earlier last month by the Iranian \npeople. The government of the nation of Iran has appointed a new \nAmbassador to the United Nations.\n  The new Ambassador's name is Hamid Aboutalebi. He will be an \nAmbassador to the U.N. who served on the ground in the Iranian forces \nwho took the American Embassy hostages in 1979, captured 52 Americans, \nand held them for 444 days--a man who claims he was just an innocent \nbystander and didn't have much to do with that horrible tragedy. If you \nwere alive at that time and watched the ``Nightline'' shows night after \nnight to watch the beatings, the torture, the terror, and the capture \nof the American people, you understand full well that nobody could have \nbeen within sight of that Embassy and not claim to be a part of it.\n  My State has been touched. Almost every State of the Union has been \ntouched. Those hostages who were held--right up until the time Ronald \nReagan was sworn in as President--were finally released at the last \nminute when the U.S. Government waived their right to compensation \nagainst the nation of Iran.\n  The nation that held 52 of our diplomats hostage for 444 days signed \nan agreement never to have to pay any reparation to those people and is \nnow appointing to the United Nations, the world forum, an ambassador \nwho was on the site in Tehran when those people were taken captive. It \nis an insult to America.\n  First and foremost, the Government of Iran should apologize; second \nand foremost, the Government of Iran should compensate all of those \nhostages who had been held. Fifty-two hostages were held and 25 percent \nof them have passed away. One of them, as recently as late last year, \ntook their own life as a consequence of the injuries they suffered.\n  One of the citizens from my State, Col. Chuck Scott of Jonesboro, GA, \nwas on television just 2 nights ago about the tragedy in Iran. His \nteeth were knocked out by a 2 by 4 during his captivity. He is going \nback for another surgery in another week to try to remedy some of the \npain he harbors from that tragedy that took place 34 years ago.\n  It is an insult to everything the United Nations stands for, to the \nintegrity of the people of the United States of America, and the memory \nof those who passed and those who lived who were held hostage. We \nshould demand this appointment be withdrawn by the Iranian Government. \nWe should demand an apology on behalf of the Iranian Government to the \npeople of United States of America, and we should demand that they \nvoluntarily compensate those hostages.\n  They are not going to do that, and I know that, which is why we \nintroduced legislation, which I principally sponsored 3 years ago, to \ncompensate the 52 hostages who were held in captivity from 1979 until \n1981. It is a shame beyond belief that 52 Americans who were held \nhostage are the only Americans in the same circumstance who have not \nbeen compensated for the damages perpetrated upon them.\n  I hope a vehicle comes through the floor of the Senate where we can \nattach this. Senator Kerry, while he was chairman of the committee and \nnow Senator Menendez, who is now the chairman, and Ranking Member \nCorker have all embraced our concept of seeing to it that we fight to \nsee that recompense is finally made to those hostages who were captured \nfrom 1979 to 1981.\n  We have a great and compassionate country, and we owe them and their \nfamilies every effort to see that the nation of Iran compensates them \nand they are in some way paid back for the terrible tragedy that was \nperpetrated upon them.\n  But first and foremost, Iran needs to know that this U.S. Senator, \nand I think every U.S. Senator, realizes the affront to the American \npeople and the insult to the United Nations that Iran is perpetrating \nby making this appointment as Ambassador of their country today.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                 Amtrak\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about one of the \nmost recent American transportation success stories--Amtrak's Northeast \ncorridor--and how Congress can help it grow.\n  First, however, I would like to thank two great leaders on the Senate \nAppropriations Committee. First, our chair, Barbara Mikulski--she is \nfrom the Northeast corridor. I often stop by in Baltimore as I take the \ntrain from New York to Washington. She has been a staunch defender of \nAmtrak from the day she got here. And Patty Murray who is chairman of \nthe transportation subcommittee. She is not from the Northeast corridor \nbut, of course, cares very much about Amtrak across the Nation and has \nbeen a defender of those of us who care about Amtrak and depend on \nAmtrak in the Northeast, as well as throughout the whole country. In \ntough budget times, these two folks have stood up for Amtrak from one \nend of the Nation to the other, and we very much appreciate that.\n  Now, as the committees begin their work on the fiscal year 2015 \nappropriations, my colleagues and I are here to urge something that \nwill benefit millions of riders on the Northeast corridor, which runs \nfrom Boston to Washington, DC.\n  We are mindful of the fact we depend on national support for Amtrak. \nEven though the Northeast corridor is far and away the most used and \nthe most profitable of the Amtrak lines, we are one Amtrak. We \nunderstand how important Amtrak is, even if it doesn't serve as many \npassengers in sparsely populated States, and of course in more \npopulated areas on the west coast and the Midwest and the South.\n  Having said that, I want to point out that I strongly believe in the \nlong-distance service provided by Amtrak. It connects rural communities \nand other economic hubs by rail. People want it and like this service. \nIn upstate New York, in the Buffalo to Albany corridor, it is clearly \nnot as used as in the Northeast corridor, but we know how much we \ndepend on Amtrak there. In the other 49 States people depend on it as \nwell.\n  Since 1971, Amtrak, in the Northeast and throughout the country, has \nbeen a Federal responsibility, and it should continue to be. So the \nproposal we are\n\n[[Page S2086]]\n\nadvocating today is one of fairness to both ends of the national \npassenger rail system. What we are saying is simple. Accept Amtrak's \nnew budget framework, which would allow the NEC to reinvest profits \nwhile continuing to provide long-distance service.\n  First, let me explain the backdrop. Amtrak's Northeast corridor has \nbecome a profit-generating operation that carries passengers in an \neconomically critical region home to over 50 million people. Some of \nthe facts on our region: It generates $1 out of $5 of GDP. One out of \nevery three Fortune 100 companies has its headquarters located there. \nOne out of every five jobs in the United States is located in the \nNortheast corridor. So you wouldn't be surprised that over the past \ndecade ridership along the Northeast corridor has been growing.\n  Between the years of 2001 and 2011, Amtrak's share of the air-rail \ntravel market has increased from 37 percent to 75 percent for trips \nbetween New York and Washington and 20 percent to 54 percent from New \nYork to Boston. Look at those increases. You wouldn't believe it. It is \ncounterintuitive almost, but three-quarters of the people who make the \ndecision to travel between Washington, DC, and New York, and don't use \na car or a bus but would rather use a plane or train, use the train. \nEven a majority now on the slightly longer route to Boston use the \ntrain.\n  It is a testament to the region and to Amtrak that every day 750,000 \npeople travel over portions of the Northeast corridor main line. That \nis nearly half of all railroad commuters nationally. It is a total of \n260,000 trips a year. Look at all the different commuter railroads that \nrun over Amtrak's Northeast corridor structure. Here they are: Mass \nBay, Shoreline East, Metro North in my city of New York, and in my \nmetropolitan area of New York, Long Island Railroad, New Jersey \nTransit, SEPTA--Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation--Maryland Area \nRegional Commuter, and Virginia.\n  Two of the biggest commuter railroads in the country operate on \nAmtrak's structure, and those are in the metropolitan area that the \nPresiding Officer and I share. They are Metro North and the Long Island \nRailroad. Hundreds of thousands of people use these railroads every \nday.\n  So the Northeast corridor is one of the most important arteries in \nthe beating heart of our economy, and I am happy to report that \nbusiness is booming. NEC revenues currently exceed operating costs by \nmore than $300 million a year. So one would think, finally, we have the \nmeans to update the aging infrastructure that Amtrak and our commuter \nrail system depend upon. Unfortunately, the growth of the Northeast \ncorridor and the profits it has produced are not going back into the \nsystem. Instead, over the last 10 years, NEC revenues have been used to \ncover the costs of the State-supported and long-distance services \nacross the rest of the national railroad.\n  We understand in the Northeast why that has happened, again because \nwe depend on support throughout the country and we need to bring the \nwhole country together. But it is happening at the same time the \nFederal contributions to Amtrak in the form of operating grants have \ndeclined. In fact, operating grants to Amtrak are lower now by almost \nhalf than they were under a Republican Congress and President George \nBush. Here are the numbers. You can see them: $1 billion in 2003, and \nthey stay about the same. But operating as a percentage of the total \nwent from 50 percent to 24 percent.\n  That is not necessarily a bad thing. For the past few years, some of \nmy Republican colleagues have urged Amtrak to become more efficient and \nrely on Federal operating grants. Amtrak has done just that. In 2013, \nAmtrak set an annual ridership record of 31.6 million and a ticket \nrevenue record of $2.1 billion.\n  The reason my colleagues and I are speaking today is to make it very \nclear that weaning Amtrak off of Federal operating grants shouldn't \ncome at the expense of the capital costs in the Northeast corridor. The \nAmtrak operating grant request for 2015 is $700 million--a fraction of \nthe overall budget, and lower than the 2005 funding level under George \nBush. The total request is for $1.62 billion, a modest request over \nlast year's $1.4 billion. This would allow all long-distance service \nmandated by Congress to continue and, importantly, it would allow $300 \nmillion a year to come back into the Northeast corridor's \ninfrastructure. That is real money--money that, if continued over time, \ncan service loans to build new tunnels and bridges and fix up the \ntracks and stations which we desperately need. It is an old, old \nsystem.\n  Think of some of the immediate projects Amtrak may have to forego if \nthey do not receive the full request: the replacement of structural \ncolumns underneath Philadelphia's beautiful 30th Street Station; \noverhauling the Acela, which is very profitable, and usually, we know, \nvery full, to improve Amtrak's on-time performance; and extremely \nimportant--because if they collapse the whole Northeast corridor \ncollapses and their transportation mechanism collapses causing real \nharm to the economy--reconstruction of the decaying infrastructure in \nthe East River tunnels.\n  This last project is particularly important--the East River tunnels, \nthat is--for several reasons. It shows the massive benefits of this \nplan for people who use railroads that they rely on. The trains carry \nhundreds of thousands of passengers back and forth every day and are in \na major state of disrepair. The proposal will allow Amtrak to invest \nmore--way more--in these vital East River tunnels, making them more \nreliable and improving travel for Long Island Railroad riders and NEC \npassengers every day. A collateral benefit for all commuting New \nYorkers is that there are Penn Station improvements--the most heavily \nused transportation hub in the country. The plan would fund many of \nthese key improvements and make them happen quicker.\n\n  The status quo is unacceptable. The current Federal funding \nrequirements leave the NEC's infrastructure vulnerable to a bigger, \ncostlier, and far more damaging failure than we have ever seen.\n  The long-term need to increase capacity and make needed repairs to \nour bridges and tunnels could not be clearer. Several important \nsegments, such as Hudson River tunnels, are growing at a record level. \nBy 2030--look at that--the need will be even greater. These are \nsegments which will exceed capacity by 2030--lots of them.\n  In my State of New York we see the economic cost of devastating \nevents such as Hurricane Sandy, which flooded Hudson River tunnels and \nshut down the Northeast corridor for days. According to new estimates, \na 1-day disruption along the Northeast corridor could cost the economy \n$100 million.\n  So I would ask my colleagues--both Democrats and Republicans--from \nStates along the Northeast corridor and from around the rest of the \ncountry to support an increase in Federal investment in our rail \ninfrastructure. I know we can get bipartisan support because there has \nbeen bipartisan support in the past. Senators in this body on both \nsides of the aisle supported operating grant levels requested by Amtrak \nin the past. In the longer term, we know we need to authorize a \ndedicated intercity passenger rail fund that provides robust investment \nin this infrastructure.\n  In the meantime, our Nation can no longer afford to let a railroad \nthat carries half of Amtrak's trains and 80 percent of the Nation's \nrail commuters fall apart at the seams. Allowing the NEC to keep the \ncash it generates will help benefit and support those same profit-\nmaking activities, helping to create a virtual cycle of reinvestment. I \nhope that sounds like something my colleagues across the aisle could \nsupport.\n  If we want an interstate commuter network in the next century, we \nmust begin by fixing and improving the infrastructure from the \nbeginning of the last century. That was the mission of our good friend, \nmy dear friend, the late Frank Lautenberg. He was a tireless and \npassionate advocate for improving our Nation's infrastructure--\nespecially our railways--because he knew it would better the State's \neconomy and indeed our country's economy. We can honor his legacy by \ncarrying on that mission.\n  I ask my colleagues to recognize this great leader as they have in \nthe past. Give the Northeast corridor the funds and flexibility to reap \nthe benefits of its recent growth while still providing service around \nthe rest of the country.\n\n[[Page S2087]]\n\n  With that, I would like to turn to my friend the junior Senator from \nConnecticut to ask him to talk about the importance of the Northeast \ncorridor for his State and especially the relationship Amtrak has with \ncommuter railroads.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Thank you, Mr. President, and I thank the Senator from \nNew York for bringing us all together this evening to talk about the \nreally vital economic importance of the Northeast corridor to States \nsuch as Connecticut, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and New York.\n  This is a pivotal moment for the Northeast corridor. We have a region \nthat is growing with respect to the number of people who are using the \nrail but an infrastructure that is dramatically aging.\n  It is important to remember the connection between investment in rail \nand the emergence of this Nation's economic greatness. The rail line \nthat means the most to us in Connecticut was chartered in 1844. It was \nthe New York and New Haven Railroad, and it was initially built to \nconnect New York to Boston, going through New Haven and going through \nConnecticut. Later on, it had a spur going through Long Island and then \na spur connecting down to Providence. It was built at a time of massive \nrail expansion all across the country.\n  In the last 25 years of the 1800s, where a lot of this expansion \nhappened after the initial investment in places such as New York and \nConnecticut and Boston, the expansion of rail led to a tenfold increase \nin economic output for this Nation. It allowed for enormous social and \neconomic mobility because if you didn't like the circumstances where \nyou were today, tomorrow you could be halfway across the country \nbecause of a train. It allowed for the gradual evaporation of a lot of \nthe divisions that were created because of the Civil War. As people got \nto know other parts of the country and could move more freely back and \nforth, they began to understand what this Nation was really about. One \nhistorian, John Hankey, has noted that the railroads essentially \ntransitioned our lexicology about the United States from referring to \n``these United States'' to ``this United States.'' It is a small \ndifference, but it suggests the way in which the rail lines allowed for \nthis country to connect.\n  Nowhere has this expansion of rail mattered more than in the \nNortheast corridor. We have the highest concentration of population, \nthe highest concentration of commerce, the highest concentration of \nports of shipping, and the highest concentration of rail lines. Not \nonly do we have Amtrak running up and down the spine of the Northeast \ncorridor, we have 10 commuter railroads, including Metro North, a line \nMr. Blumenthal--the Presiding Officer--and I are very proud of.\n  We have 260 million passengers today who are using the Northeast \ncorridor. That number is expected to grow in 2030 to 412 million. Just \nthink about that. We are talking about a time period of only 16 years. \nWe are going to go from 260 million passengers today to 412 million \npassengers in 2030. If you ride a train from Bridgeport to Stanford or \nfrom Stanford to Grand Central on any given Monday morning or any given \nThursday afternoon, you are going to fail to understand how that line \nis going to be able to absorb an increase from 260 million passengers \nto 412 million passengers. We simply don't have the capacity today to \nbe able to absorb that increase.\n  We have 1,000 bridges and tunnels along the Northeast corridor that \nare badly in need of repair. Some of them are 100 years old. The \nestimates are that over the next 20 years we have to spend $50 billion \nalong the Northeast corridor simply to maintain a state of good repair. \nI wish this were a cheaper exercise, but it is not.\n  In Connecticut alone, we have to replace a bridge in Cos Cob that is \ngoing to cost $830 million. The Norwalk Bridge has to be rehabbed for \n$250 million. The Saugatuck River Bridge in Westport has to be rehabbed \nas well for $300 million. The Devon Bridge replacement project is going \nto be $750 million. We have to upgrade communication and signals all \nalong the New Haven Line; that is $400 million. We have an old aging \ncatenary--the electric lines above the supply power to the trains--that \nis going to be $600 million as well.\n\n  In Connecticut it is our lifeblood, meaning we are nothing if not for \nthe economic power that is driven by those trains. About a decade ago \nan economic report came out on Connecticut that really shook the State \nto its core. It talked about the great economic potential Connecticut \nhas as we sit right between the enormous job-creating hubs of New York \nCity and Boston. But it warned us that if we don't get serious about \nunclogging the arteries out of Connecticut into Connecticut, that, in \nthe words of the report, ``Connecticut risks becoming an economic cul-\nde-sac.'' That is a pretty scary premise, the idea that we could be so \nclose to all of this economic activity, but simply because people \ncannot get to Connecticut or get out of Connecticut because of these \naging rail lines, we are going to ultimately be left behind.\n  So what we are really here to talk about is just a principle of basic \nfairness. The Northeast corridor makes money. It is the only section of \nrail in the Nation that does make money simply because of volume and \nbecause of efficient management. The profit equals about $300 million a \nyear. We are not asking for the Northeast corridor to get any more than \nwe are owed; we simply want that $300 million, as Amtrak has proposed, \nto be reinvested in the line.\n  From the Cos Cob Bridge to the Sagatuck River Bridge, we are going to \nhave to make these upgrades at some point. If we don't, ultimately they \nare going to fall down. We have seen not only in the Northeast corridor \nbut across the country the consequences of allowing our infrastructure \nto atrophy to the point of crisis and collapse. So why don't we make \nthose investments today? Why don't we make those investments at a \nmoment when people need to go to work, when the repairs are as cost-\nefficient as they are going to get, and when the line itself in the \nNortheast is generating $300 million extra a year that right now is \ngoing to other parts of the country?\n  I agree with Senator Schumer. We support a national Amtrak. We \nstrongly support a robust inner-city connection linking major cities, \nmajor urban areas with rail all across the country. Just in our small \nregion, we have half of the trips of the entire country. So we think it \nis not too much to ask that to the extent we are profitable, we get to \nreinvest that money into an infrastructure that is older than any other \npiece of infrastructure in the entire country.\n  I would say this: It is not just about fairness for the States that \nmake up the Northeast corridor. The economic power of the Northeast \nspreads itself out all across the country. The corporations that are \nlocated in Manhattan and Stanford and Newark employ people in Nebraska \nand in California, in South Dakota and Texas. So our pitch to our \ncolleagues outside of the Northeast is not just that it seems to be the \nright and fair thing to do for all of this profit that is being made \nthrough the ticket fares passengers in the Northeast are paying to stay \nin the Northeast, but the benefit that comes from a well-constructed, \nefficiently run Northeast corridor accrues to the entire country.\n  I am really pleased Senator Schumer brought us down to the floor \ntoday to talk about how important reinvesting this $300 million is to \nthe Northeast corridor. In my State, with Metro North generating \nliterally hundreds of millions of dollars in economic benefit to our \nsection of the country, if we don't recapture this income, if we aren't \nable to make these repairs that I listed, then, as that economic report \nsuggests, we really do risk our State of Connecticut ultimately \nbecoming an economic cul-de-sac.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schumer). The Senator from Connecticut is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Thank you, Mr. President. I am honored to follow the \nPresiding Officer, my good friend Senator Schumer of New York, and my \ncolleague and friend Senator Murphy of Connecticut to talk about an \nissue that really affects quality of life, our pocketbooks, and our \nenvironment.\n  But first I wish to join my colleague from New York in paying tribute \nto\n\n[[Page S2088]]\n\none of the great transportation advocates, indeed one of the great \npublic servants of our time, Senator Frank Lautenberg, who preceded me \nas chairman of a critical subcommittee on the commerce committee which \nhas authority and jurisdiction over surface transportation.\n  I am tremendously honored to have followed him in that role, and my \nmission and ambition is to be as effective and eloquent and ardent as \nhe was in this cause. It is a cause that brings us together as a \nnation, as my colleague from New York has so eloquently said. We are \nbetter when we come together as a nation and the railroads provide \narteries carrying the lifeblood of our economy. Not only is the train \nused for commuters going to work and riders going to visit relatives \nand enjoying tourism, traveling, vacations, and other benefits of this \ngreat Nation, but it also transports the freight that is critical to \ncarry goods and services.\n\n  We know the infrastructure is aging all across the country. We are, \nin effect, transporting goods and services, products and people, \ncommuters and riders in the 21st century using 20th century equipment, \ntracks, and other infrastructure. We are talking, indeed, about the \neconomic lifeblood of our Nation, which has linked us coast to coast, \nnorth to south, and east to west in ways that are not only economically \nmaterial and tangible but also emotionally and psychologically vital to \nour present and our future.\n  These economic benefits will not continue. They are not an accident \nof history. They are the result of purposeful invention and investing, \nand we are challenged as a nation as to whether we will continue to \ninvest to ensure that our railroads carry our freight and our people to \nplaces they must go if we are to have economic growth and jobs in this \nNation. No one knows this fact better than those who live on the \nNortheast corridor. It is among the busiest. In fact, the Metro-North \nline is the busiest in the Nation. It has bridges and tracks that are \nmore than 100 years old, and tragically we have seen the consequences \nof lack of proper maintenance, management, and inspection of our \ninfrastructure.\n  My colleague from New York has been a relentless and tireless \nadvocate for improving rail service along the Northeast corridor and \nmost particularly in the area of our region of New York, Connecticut, \nand New Jersey.\n  The derailment in Bridgeport was a recent tragedy that resulted in \nthe loss of lives and caused injuries as well as power outages which \ndisrupted travel for as much as 13 days. These disruptions should lead \nto a new era of leadership at Metro-North, and hopefully it will.\n  Good management is the key to making this railroad work better than \nit has and making it safer and more reliable. Good management is vital, \nbut money, along with management, is absolutely necessary. In fact, \ngood management requires investing, and that is why we are here today--\nnot to talk about money for the sake of dollars and cents but the \ninvestment it means in the track, the bridges, the cars, and other \nequipment vital to make this railroad safer and more reliable.\n  We know some of this investment is small in amount. The Senator from \nNew York and I have championed the idea of cameras facing inward and \noutward. Compared to the overall costs of investments, that one is \nrelatively new. Likewise, alerters placed in cabs that operate the \nrailroad cost relatively little, but other expenditures are much more \nsubstantial, and one of the problems is that money has been going into \nthe system--money taken from the riders and users in the New Jersey, \nConnecticut, and New York area along the Northeast corridor has gone to \nthe system as a whole.\n  As I mentioned at the beginning, far from begrudging the national \nsystem this kind of investment, we support it, but we need our fair \nshare, which is necessary to make the investment that is critical to \nbridges such as Saugatuck, the Connecticut River, and the Norwalk \nRiver. These bridges contain movable components. They are important for \nmarine traffic as well as rail. They are frequently opened and closed. \nThey experience more stress than normal, and the resulting corrosion \nrequires trains to use reduced speed. Repair and eventual replacement \nof many of these bridges will be crucial for keeping train traffic safe \nand reliable not only along the Northeast corridor but also freight and \nriders traveling from New York, Connecticut, and New Jersey to other \nparts of the east coast and indeed across the country.\n  It is a national investment, not just a Northeast investment. It is \nan investment we must make as a whole or our infrastructure will \ncrumble and continue to erode.\n  I am proud to join my colleagues to urge that Amtrak's full funding \nrequest for fiscal year 2015 be granted. This amount will allow the \nNortheast corridor's operating revenue to be reinvested back where it \nis needed most--the Northeast corridor--and will simultaneously provide \nmuch needed Federal support for rail networks in the rest of the \ncountry.\n  A fair share is what the Northeast corridor needs and deserves. A \nfair share is what we are advocating. As my colleagues have explained, \nthe support we offer and advocate for this Northeast corridor is a \nbenefit to the whole country, and it is consistent with national \nsupport for railway travel which eliminates congestion on roads, raises \nthe quality of our air, makes for safer travel, and maybe equally, if \nnot more importantly, creates jobs.\n  This investment will help create jobs and drive economic growth in \nthe jobs it creates directly and the jobs it enables along the route of \ntravel.\n  I thank my colleagues for joining me in this effort, and I know, in \nparticular, that there is a bridge in New Jersey--a movable swing \nbridge along the Hackensack River between Kearny and Secaucus, NJ. I \nbelieve it is called the Portal Bridge. That Portal Bridge is a key \nlinchpin in the Northeast corridor. Having a functional Portal Bridge \nis essential to me as a resident of Connecticut. When I go from \nWashington to New York and then to Connecticut, we are one country. We \nare united by that railroad, and that Portal Bridge is a key linchpin \nin the Northeast corridor. It is as important to me as it is to my \ncolleague from New Jersey who has been--similar to Senator Lautenberg--\na tireless advocate for rail transportation, and he has done model work \non improving rail transportation in this country.\n  I am happy to yield for the senior Senator from New Jersey, Mr. \nMenendez.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nConnecticut for his engagement and for recognizing our former \ncolleague, Senator Lautenberg, whose passion for public transportation \nwas unmatched in this body. He understood the nexus of why it was \nimportant not just to our State of New Jersey and the Northeast but to \nthe country.\n  My colleague from Connecticut is correct, that Portal Bridge--it is \ncalled the Portal Bridge because it is a bridge that is a portal to the \nentire Northeast corridor and carries passengers over a movable swing \nbridge across the Hackensack River between Kearny and Secaucus, NJ. It \nis a portal into and out of Manhattan. It is one of the busiest \nsections of the corridor with hundreds of passengers and commuter \ntrains crossing it every day.\n  You would think that given its importance to the Northeast and the \nmillions who live in that region, it would be a state-of-the-art, \nreliable, world-class bridge that we would be willing to invest in, \nmaking it the best possible bridge. Unfortunately, the reality is quite \ndifferent.\n  The Portal Bridge was built in 1910. It is over 100 years old and \ndeteriorating--causing significant delays for Amtrak riders in New \nJersey and throughout the system. Because of the low clearance over the \nHackensack River, the bridge opens to allow ships to pass, thereby \ncreating delays for rail passengers and then more delays come when the \nbridge doesn't lock into place because it is too old and doesn't work \nproperly.\n  We have delay after delay all because we are unwilling to invest in \nour infrastructure, and that is simply unacceptable. When the bridge \ndoesn't close, trains throughout the Northeast corridor are delayed \nwhile Amtrak workers scramble to fix it. Further adding to the problems \nare speed restrictions that have been in place on the bridge since \n1996. These restrictions have been\n\n[[Page S2089]]\n\nessential to allow trains to cross safely, hardly a comforting thought \nfor riders traveling on the corridor.\n  The Northeast corridor is the Nation's busiest rail line and serves \n700,000 people every day. The line supports eight commuter railroads \nevery day, carrying over 200,000 New Jersey transit passengers. So \nfailure to invest in a modern, state-of-the-art system does a \ndisservice to all of us--certainly to the commuters. It is an economic \nhindrance in a region that supports 20 percent of the entire Nation's \nGDP.\n  There are other reasons to consider the importance of these \ninvestments and one is our economy and jobs. These intercity rail \nsystems ultimately create an opportunity for people to get to \nemployment and to reach out to find employment and find better \nemployment.\n  It is also about companies that send their sales force up and down \nthe Northeast corridor in a thorough and effective and efficient way. \nIt is about those who might visit one of the great health institutions \nalong the Northeast corridor for a health challenge they face. It is \nabout tourism from anywhere--from the sights of New York or New Jersey \nor along the entire route, crossroads of the revolution, all the way to \nthe Nation's Capital of Washington, DC. It is about visiting a loved \none and having a way to do it that allows them to be able to afford to \ndo so.\n  In the aftermath of September 11, we learned that a multiplicity of \ntransportation modes was critical to security questions because on that \nfateful day when every trans-Hudson crossing closed down--the bridges \nclosed down, the tunnels closed down, the ability to do intercity rail \nclosed down--the one element that was open was a different form of \ntransportation, and that was ferries. Imagine, in a different context, \nif you don't have intercity rail to move people away from a location in \nwhich there was a September 11-like event that, in fact, the \nconsequences that would flow.\n  We learned after September 11 that transportation is more than about \ngetting from one place to another, more than about sending a sales \nforce, more than even about the quality of life and the environment by \nhaving more people on an efficient system, it is also another dimension \nof security in a post-September 11 world. We must do better.\n  As far as the Amtrak budget proposal, I am pleased that Amtrak's \nfiscal year 2015 budget request takes a step in the right direction to \nimprove its record of good repair and reliability in the Northeast \ncorridor. In spite of the challenges of aging infrastructure, Amtrak in \nthe Northeast corridor is a profitable rail line, generating over $300 \nmillion each year. Yet, under the current structure, Amtrak has been \nunable to invest those profits back into essential projects such as the \nPortal Bridge, which is ultimately the portal by which all of Amtrak's \nrail lines to the Northeast have to go through. These profits have \ninstead been used elsewhere on Amtrak's system, subsidized long-\ndistance services that were traditionally a core Federal \nresponsibility.\n\n  For too long Congress has failed to meet its responsibility on these \nroutes, relying on the riders of the Northeast corridor to subsidize \nother parts of the rail network. Riders on the Northeast corridor \ndeserve to have profits generated along the line reinvested--not used \nas a substitute for insufficient Federal investment. Amtrak's new \nproposal will allow it to keep revenue generated by the corridor in the \ncorridor--a commonsense solution and a successful business model for \nthe Northeast.\n  At the same time, Amtrak proposes full funding for lines outside of \nthe Northeast corridor, making this a win-win proposal for America's \nrail system.\n  Finally, making these investments now will help us prevent large-\nscale failures that could cripple our region in the future. \nUnfortunately, we in New Jersey know all too well the consequences of a \nsignificant transportation failure. When Hurricane Sandy crashed ashore \nin October of 2012, our transportation systems were inundated with \nwater and severely damaged. We saw firsthand what happens when the \ntransit and rail networks we often take for granted are rendered \nunusable. Residents were stranded--cut off from their loved ones and \ntheir livelihoods. Sandy showed us just how much our region depends on \nits rail and transit networks.\n  As New Jersey and its networks work to rebuild, we must take every \nopportunity to strengthen our infrastructure and prevent future \nfailures of our transportation system. Current Federal funding \nrequirements leave the Northeast corridor vulnerable by preventing us \nfrom reinvesting in critical projects.\n  Amtrak's budget proposal is a straightforward solution, by keeping \nand allowing the Northeast to keep and reinvest its own profits. At the \nsame time, the proposal would maintain funding for other rail lines to \nensure a valuable, viable national network. The bottom line: This is a \nproposal whose time has clearly come.\n  So it is time that we as a Congress say enough is enough; 100-year-\nold infrastructure is simply unacceptable. It is time to make the \ninvestments that will support our economy and our quality of life and, \nI would add, our security. It is time to live up to our Federal \ncommitments and fully fund our rail network.\n  I certainly wish to join my other colleagues in thanking our \ncolleague from New York Senator Schumer for leading this important \ndiscussion about the future of Amtrak. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis budget proposal, to fully fund Amtrak's operating and capital \ncosts nationwide, and to take the long overdue step of allowing \nNortheast corridor profits to be reinvested into our critical \ninfrastructure.\n  Now let me turn this over to my colleague Senator Booker who, until \nhe came to the Senate, was the mayor of the State's largest city by \nwhich all of these different modes of transportation came together and \nthrough which the Northeast corridor has a major station. He saw, as it \nrelated to his own community, the realities of what the rail passenger \nsystem meant for consumers, what it meant for businesses, and what it \nmeant for our security.\n  I yield the floor for the distinguished Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, Senator Menendez is absolutely correct. \nWhen I was mayor of New Jersey's largest city, we sat upon a critical \ntransportation superstructure--a key node in the larger region. I wish \nto thank my senior Senator, whom I relied upon then for being the \nchampion he is for infrastructure investment, for the critical nature \nof the rail lines that crisscross our region, and really being a \npromoter of jobs, of business growth, of security, and of the health of \nthis critical system. It is very good to have my senior Senator make \nsuch important remarks. I wish to pick up from there. It is a little \nuncomfortable not having the Presiding Officer on the floor with me, \nbut I will continue nonetheless.\n  I wish to thank all of my colleagues who have already spoken from \nneighboring States about this absolutely vital transportation corridor. \nIf this were a country of its own, this corridor, from Washington to \nBoston--this area--we would be the fifth largest economy in the world. \nThis region continues to grow, with more than 12 million residents \nprojected by 2040.\n  In New Jersey, our tracks and tunnels are simply no longer able to \nmeet the growing demand of our Amtrak and commuter rail lines. New \nJersey commuters--passengers up and down the Northeast corridor--are \nprofoundly frustrated by overcrowded trains and by delay after delay \nafter delay. It inhibits their transportation. It inhibits their \nproductivity. It inhibits their ability to be successful because of \nthose delays. Our underfunded passenger rail network forces too many of \nour residents to then drive, where they end up stuck in traffic, \ncontributing more greatly to smog and pollution, and really making it \neven more dangerous for them on our already overly congested highways.\n  Amtrak needs the ability to reinvest the growing profit from the \nNortheast corridor back into the critical Northeast corridor \ninfrastructure. This much needed budget request would allow Amtrak to \ninvest $300 million of their profits back into this region and would \nallow Amtrak to make overdue updates and repairs. This would create \njobs at this incredibly important time in our economic present. It \nwould create jobs and allow our busy commuter lines to travel more \nsafely and more reliably.\n  We need this economic growth. We need to alleviate the problems with\n\n[[Page S2090]]\n\nthis infrastructure. We need to make the daily lives of tens of \nthousands of people better.\n  One of the most important steps we can take to alleviate this \ncongestion and delays in New Jersey and throughout this region is to \nmake this investment. But I also say another critical aspect of making \nthose investments is to make a strategic investment in the Gateway \nproject. Amtrak's 2015 budget request seeks to continue investing in \nneeded preliminary work on the Gateway project. The Gateway project is \nAmtrak's most important initiative--a project that is going to generate \nbenefits throughout the Northeast region that will have a multiplier \neffect throughout our economy, enabling growth, enabling job creation, \nimproving the quality of life, and helping one of the most prosperous \nregions on the globe continue to grow.\n  Currently, there are just two tunnels connecting New Jersey to New \nYork via rail. These tunnels are currently operating at full capacity, \nwith roughly 24 trains at peak hours carrying over 70,000 riders daily, \nwith no space for additional riders during rush hour. In order to \nexecute repairs and safety checks on these 100-year-old tunnels, Amtrak \nis required to shut down the entire tunnel and suspend half the trips \nin and out of the city. This causes so much of a burden. This is an \nunnecessary burden. This is a threat to the safety of thousands of New \nJersey Transit and Amtrak passengers.\n  Ridership demand in and out of Manhattan is actually predicted to \ndouble in the coming decades--double. It is critical for the economic \nhealth of our region to accommodate this increase and ensure that \nurgently needed growth and the safety and security of so many \nAmericans. The Gateway project itself would build two new rail tunnels \nfrom New Jersey to New York City and expand Penn Station in New York to \nhandle all of this additional capacity. This project alone would create \nthousands and thousands of jobs. It would reduce commuter times and \nmake traveling by rail more flexible and, very importantly to resident \nafter resident who has reached out to me, it would make it more \nreliable. This critical investment will drive economic growth \nthroughout that entire region.\n  Upon completion, the Gateway project would allow Amtrak to run 8 more \ntrains during peak hours and allow New Jersey Transit to run 13 more \ntrains. This is a significant capacity increase that would take \nthousands of cars off the roads every single day. It would increase \nrevenue for Amtrak and New Jersey Transit. It would allow intercity and \ncommuting passengers shorter and easier trips up and down the Northeast \nand in and out of Manhattan, and it would improve significantly the air \nquality of our region, alleviating the respiratory challenges so many \npeople unnecessarily face because of commuter car pollution.\n  In short, all of these reasons point to something critical: It would \nmake it easier for our region to be prosperous, for businesses to grow, \nand American opportunity to increase. It is essential that Congress \njoin with Amtrak in advancing this important regional project and \nsupport Amtrak's overall mission to deliver reliable, efficient \npassenger rail service across the United States. For Amtrak to be \nsuccessful in the long term, Congress needs to become a more reliable \ninvestment partner and fund multiyear Amtrak budgets, to have \npredictability in that funding, making it again multiyear. Our current \napproach of lurching from annual budget to annual budget does not allow \nfor Amtrak to flourish and serve our citizens as it could and as it \nshould. We need a level of predictability to make these kinds of \ninvestments. Support for the Amtrak fiscal year 2015 budget request \nwould be a step in the right direction.\n  I urge my colleagues to appreciate this critical understanding that \nwe are a people who thrive through connectivity, whether it is virtual \nconnectivity on the Internet or even human connectivity; that we need \nto, in environments such as this, one to another, work together. \nIndeed, it is the words of Martin Luther King, written in a jail cell \nin Birmingham, AL, in 1963, in the spring of that year, almost 50 years \nago--he wrote in profound manner, and I paraphrase it: We are all \ncaught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a common garment \nof destiny. It was an elevation and understanding of the power of human \nconnection, that we share one destiny, and that when we exalt our \nconnections, prosperity grows, equality grows, opportunity grows. What \nKing talked about in a spiritual way lives also in the physical: \nCountry, from its transcontinental railroads, a country that united \nitself in early innovations and AM/FM dials; all the ways we as a \nnation have made more robust connectivity. It has spurned industry, it \nhas spawned industry, and it has made jobs multiply and multiply--\neconomic growth connecting American to American. Right now, in this \ncritical time, we must continue.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in making sure we support the \nAmtrak budget. I know from personal experience the challenges and the \ntrials and the dangers from the status quo. It is time for us to \nadvance. It is time for us to come to together, to invest in America, \nto expand opportunity, and make real, in a physical way, those \ndeepening connections we have, one to another.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. President, one of the privileges of addressing the \nSenate each morning is the opportunity to call attention to what I \nbelieve and what I think the country believes are noble causes. I \ncertainly hope so.\n  Today is World Autism Awareness Day. To the Americans who have autism \nand the millions of family and friends affected by this condition, one \nday is simply not enough to focus on this misunderstood illness, but it \nhelps--and we certainly hope it does.\n  Autism is a general term for a group of complex disorders of brain \ndevelopments affecting social interaction, communication, and behavior. \nAccording to a recent study by the Centers for Disease Control--in \nfact, the report came out this week--1 in 68 children is diagnosed with \nhaving some form of autism in our country. As more and more children \nare identified as being autistic, it is important we in Congress do all \nwe can to provide them, their families, and their caretakers, the help \nthat is so vitally necessary.\n  Under the Affordable Care Act, autism screenings and other preventive \nservices are available at no cost to families. For those diagnosed with \nautism, the days of being denied health insurance due to their \npreexisting condition ended with the passage and implementation of the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  Today, because of the Affordable Care Act, adult children with autism \nmay stay on their parents' policies through age 26, providing them with \nthe stability and additional treatment they need.\n  With benefits such as these, it is no wonder that more than 7 million \npeople have sought health coverage under the Affordable Care Act. This \ndoesn't count the estimated 800,000 to 900,000 people on 14 State \nexchanges. But in addition, everyone who tried to sign up during the \nlast many months and were unable to get through, for whatever reason, \nare also now going to be signing up, which will add hundreds of \nthousands of more people.\n  So the numbers are pretty clear. The estimate given by the White \nHouse many months ago, which my Republican colleagues made fun of, has \nnow been exceeded. So maybe they will quiet down and stop talking about \nrepealing this bill that affects millions and millions of people \nfavorably.\n  While the health care law is helping autistic Americans who have been \ndiagnosed and their families, researchers at the National Institutes of \nHealth are\n\n[[Page S2091]]\n\ntackling the question of why this disease is here, what are the origins \nof this condition.\n  Research is critical in supporting development tools, interventions, \nand evidence-based services to help provide a quality of life for \npeople in the autism spectrum.\n  Over the last year, researchers funded by NIH have made significant \nadvances in understanding the onset of autism. They have learned that \nbrain changes that contribute to autism occur even during pregnancy and \ncontinue through the first years of life. They have also concluded that \nsome of the possible signs of autism may begin to appear within the \nfirst 6 months it can be identified. The work at the NIH in \nunderstanding the problem cannot be understated, but far more needs to \nfollow to better comprehend autism.\n  Congress also has responsibilities. One is providing resources to the \nNational Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control, and \nwe need to do that. My friend Senator Durbin has introduced legislation \nthat would focus on ways we can provide more help that is badly needed. \nWith sequestration and the other cuts which have taken place it has \nbeen unfair to these two agencies.\n  The Achieving Better Life Experience Act--also known as the ABLE \nAct--would improve the quality of life for individuals with autism and \nother disabilities through tax-advantaged savings accounts. These \nspecial savings accounts would help disabled Americans and their loved \nones plan for the future by setting aside money to cover future \nexpenses, including education, housing, therapy, and rehabilitation.\n  I am a sponsor of the ABLE Act and proud to stand with all advocates \nin celebrating today World Autism Awareness Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/02/senate-section/article/S2091-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2091]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                UKRAINE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, yesterday afternoon a bipartisan majority \nin the House of Representatives passed Senate legislation to provide \nloan guarantees to Ukraine and to impose sanctions on certain Ukrainian \nand Russian officials.\n  This legislation comes at a time when Ukraine's future hangs in the \nbalance between democracy and dictatorship. The brave Ukrainians who \nprotested across the country and at Maidan square have shown an \ninspiring determination to defend their freedom. Many of them endured \nthe brutal attacks of riot police, snipers, and below freezing \ntemperatures. Some died in the mayhem. President Putin, who has long \ndemonstrated his disregard for international law and human rights in \nhis own country, has now extended that sphere of repression to Ukraine \nby violating its sovereignty and strong-arming its citizens.\n  This legislation exemplifies our support for a free and democratic \nUkraine. The new government will face every imaginable economic, \npolitical, and security challenge, but the country's interim leaders \nhave already indicated a willingness to implement austere reforms to \nput their country on the right track. It is important that during this \ntime of uncertainty the people of Ukraine know that they have the full \nsupport of the United States and the international community.\n  In addition to the loan guarantees which will be available \nimmediately to help facilitate the development of a more resilient \neconomy, the legislation authorizes funds for democracy and security \nassistance in future years. It also imposes sanctions against various \nUkrainian and Russian officials who have been identified as principles \nin the subversion of democracy in Ukraine and who have treated the \npublic treasury as their own personal bank account. While efforts to \nrecover stolen assets will not restore the entire amount that has \ndisappeared, it will further expose President Yanukovych and other \ncorrupt officials for the criminals that they are.\n  I do want to say that I am very disappointed that domestic politics \nprevented inclusion of provisions, included in the version of the bill \nthat was reported by the Foreign Relations Committee, authorizing U.S. \nsupport for reforms and participation in the quota increase at the \nInternational Monetary Fund. These reforms have been widely recognized \nas important for global economic stability, for maintaining U.S. \nleadership at the IMF, and for our efforts to maximize international \nassistance for Ukraine. Unfortunately, the House Republican leadership \ndecided that partisan politics at home is more important than U.S. \nleadership in an international organization that we were instrumental \nin creating.\n  Ukraine and Russia have a shared history, but it is clear that the \npeople of Ukraine see their future with Europe. That is why it is \nimperative that we support them at this critical time, and that we send \na strong message to President Putin that there are real consequences to \nthe use of brute force to violate the territorial integrity of Russia's \nneighbors.\n  As chairman of the appropriations subcommittee that funds our \nassistance for Ukraine, my subcommittee will not only provide the \nbudget authority to pay the subsidy cost of the loan guarantees, we \nwill also look for other ways in fiscal year 2015 to protect it and its \nneighbors from further Russian aggression.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/02/senate-section/article/S2091-2", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2091]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      VERMONT COMMISSION ON WOMEN\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Vermont Commission on Women this year \ncelebrates its 50th anniversary. Established in 1964 by Vermont \nGovernor Philip Hoff, the commission was established in response to a \nchallenge presented by President Kennedy, urging every State in the \ncountry to create such commissions ``to encourage women to use their \nabilities, and to reduce discrimination against women.'' I am proud \nthat Vermont's is one of the oldest continuously operating commissions \nin the United States.\n  The commission's work is fueled by 16 volunteer commissioners, a team \nof advisors and a small but energetic staff. By advocating for new \nState laws and strengthening old ones, the commission has fought to \nreduce gender discrimination, achieve pay equity, support families and \ncreate job opportunities for women in my home State. Just last year, \nthe commission was a strong force in strengthening provisions of \nVermont's Equal Pay Act, so that women move closer to the reality of \nreceiving equal pay for equal work. The law also extended protections \nso that employees could ask coworkers about their pay, and perhaps \nlearn of disparities, without fear of retaliation.\n  I have no doubt the commission's ongoing efforts have helped Vermont \nwomen narrow the gender pay gap, to 84 cents for every dollar earned by \na man. Vermont is leading the way in this area: the national level \nfinds women earning 77 cents for every dollar earned by their male \ncounterparts. I am grateful to the commission for its ongoing support \nfor the Paycheck Fairness Act, which the Senate will consider in the \ncoming weeks.\n  The commission also serves as a needed source of information. Its \nhandbook, The Legal Rights of Women in Vermont, serves as a valuable \nguide for women who may find themselves in need of advice on matters \nsuch as adoption, employment rights, housing and divorce. The \ncommission also conducts research, coordinates conferences and \nworkshops, and engages in partnerships, all in the interest of \nfurthering gender equality.\n  Despite the great strides that have been made over five decades in \nVermont and across the Nation, we know that many discriminatory issues \naffecting women still exist today, and that the need for the \ncommission's work is still critical.\n  The State of Vermont is very fortunate to have such a strong group \nadvocating for women's rights. I have been proud to work with the \nVermont Commission on Women for over 15 years on Vermont's Women's \nEconomic Opportunity Conference, an annual event in Vermont that brings \nwomen of all different backgrounds together to talk about the \nchallenges facing women in the work place.\n  I am proud to acknowledge and honor the Vermont Commission on Women \nas it celebrates 50 years of leadership and achievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/02/senate-section/article/S2091-3", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2091-S2092]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. MARKEY.

Mr. President, today I recognize Samuel DeMaio, \nthe dynamic director of the Newark Police Department. A driving force \nfor reform, Sammy is one of those people who talks the talk, walks the \nwalk, and does both to the benefit of the community at large.\n  Samuel Anthony DeMaio was born on December 25, 1966, in Newark, where \nhe was raised with his younger sister Sherri by his father Carmine, a \nNewark police officer, and his mother Marysue. In 1986, on what he \nwould later say was ``one of the happiest days in my life,'' Sammy \nfollowed in his father's footsteps and began his career with the Newark \nPolice Department at the age of 19.\n  A hard worker from the start, Sammy proved his dedication and skill \nby consistently becoming the youngest officer to hold each position as \nhe ascended the ranks of the Newark Police Department. His focus on \ntransparency, officer training, and collaboration made our communities \nsafer and more unified. It is that dedication and openness that helped \nset our community on its upward trajectory, and it is why his shoes \nwill be so hard to fill.\n  Sammy was in and of the community. He is a cop's cop who is respected \nby everyone in the department, from rank and file to top brass. Sammy \nis held in high esteem in the greater community, from the city council \nthat unanimously voted to appoint him, to once-skeptical community \nleaders won over by his commitment to transparency and accountability.\n  Sammy took great pride in collaborating with and incorporating the \ncommunities he policed. He began conducting the officers' roll call out \non the street in an effort to change the way the officers and residents \nviewed each other. When I started Newark's Super Summer program, aimed \nat keeping kids out of trouble during the summer months, Sammy was \nright there with me. He founded the Annual Youth Public Safety Academy, \na hands-on, joint project of the City of Newark's Police and Fire \nDepartments in conjunction with the Essex County Prosecutor's Office, \nwhere participants learned how to report crimes, prevent fires, and \nresist criminal activity.\n  Sammy retired from the police department on February 21, 2014, after \n28 years on the Newark police force. These years of service were spent \nexclusively in New Jersey's largest municipal police department, and \nwere marked by exemplary dedication to the best interests of the \ncommunity and his fellow officers. When considering on the day of his \nretirement, Sammy said, ``This is probably the saddest day I'm going to \nhave in my life.''\n  It is an honor to formally recognize the contributions that Sammy \nDeMaio made to the citizens of Newark throughout his career in law \nenforcement, to thank him for his tremendous service, and to wish him \nhappiness in a well-deserved retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/02/senate-section/article/S2092-3", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2092]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       KICK FOR CANCER TOURNAMENT\n\n Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate the \nparticipants in the ``Kick for Cancer'' charity martial arts tournament \nwhich is held annually in Gilmanton, NH. Since its founding the \ntournament has raised more than $120,000 to benefit the Central New \nHampshire Visiting Nurses Association & Hospice, helping this critical \ncommunity resource serve 350 patients and their families each year. I \nam happy to report this year marks the 25th anniversary of the Kick for \nCancer Tournament, which draws participants to our great State from all \naround the country.\n  The tournament was founded thanks to the hard work of Dr. Georganne \nVerigan, a long-time teacher and leader in the martial arts community. \nShe founded the Kick for Cancer tournament to teach her students the \nimportance of giving back to their communities, and also to demonstrate \nthat giving can be fun and exciting. As evidenced by the popularity of \nthe tournament, Dr. Verigan's lesson clearly resonates with young \nmartial arts students.\n  On behalf of the people of New Hampshire I would like to thank Dr. \nVerigan for her selfless work to improve the availability of home and \nhospice care, and her efforts to impart the value of community service \nonto a generation of young citizens. I look forward to hearing of the \ncontinued growth and success of the Kick for Cancer Tournament.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/02/senate-section/article/S2092-4", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2092-S2093]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:58 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nagrees to the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 4152) to \nprovide for the costs of loan guarantees for Ukraine.\n  The message further announced that the House has passed the following \nbills, without amendment:\n\n       S. 1557.

PROHIBITION ON ENERGY TAX.\n\n       (a) Findings; Purposes.--\n       (1) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (A) on June 25, 2013, President Obama issued a Presidential \n     memorandum directing the Administrator of the Environmental \n     Protection Agency to issue regulations relating to power \n     sector carbon pollution standards for existing coal fired \n     power plants;\n       (B) the issuance of that memorandum circumvents Congress \n     and the will of the people of the United States;\n\n[[Page S2099]]\n\n       (C) any action to control emissions of greenhouse gases \n     from existing coal fired power plants in the United States by \n     mandating a national energy tax would devastate major sectors \n     of the economy, cost thousands of jobs, and increase energy \n     costs for low-income households, small businesses, and \n     seniors on fixed income;\n       (D) joblessness increases the likelihood of hospital \n     visits, illnesses, and premature deaths;\n       (E) according to testimony on June 15, 2011, before the \n     Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate by \n     Dr. Harvey Brenner of Johns Hopkins University, ``The \n     unemployment rate is well established as a risk factor for \n     elevated illness and mortality rates in epidemiological \n     studies performed since the early 1980s. In addition to \n     influences on mental disorder, suicide and alcohol abuse and \n     alcoholism, unemployment is also an important risk factor in \n     cardiovascular disease and overall decreases in life \n     expectancy.'';\n       (F) according to the National Center for Health Statistics, \n     ``children in poor families were four times as likely to be \n     in fair or poor health as children that were not poor'';\n       (G) any major decision that would cost the economy of the \n     United States millions of dollars and lead to serious \n     negative health effects for the people of the United States \n     should be debated and explicitly authorized by Congress, not \n     approved by a Presidential memorandum or regulations; and\n       (H) any policy adopted by Congress should make United \n     States energy as clean as practicable, as quickly as \n     practicable, without increasing the cost of energy for \n     struggling families, seniors, low-income households, and \n     small businesses.\n       (2) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are--\n       (A) to ensure that--\n       (i) a national energy tax is not imposed on the economy of \n     the United States; and\n       (ii) struggling families, seniors, low-income households, \n     and small businesses do not experience skyrocketing \n     electricity bills and joblessness;\n       (B) to protect the people of the United States, \n     particularly families, seniors, and children, from the \n     serious negative health effects of joblessness;\n       (C) to allow sufficient time for Congress to develop and \n     authorize an appropriate mechanism to address the energy \n     needs of the United States and the potential challenges posed \n     by severe weather; and\n       (D) to restore the legislative process and congressional \n     authority over the energy policy of the United States.\n       (b) Presidential Memorandum.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, the head of a Federal agency shall not \n     promulgate any regulation relating to power sector carbon \n     pollution standards or any substantially similar regulation \n     on or after June 25, 2013, unless that regulation is \n     explicitly authorized by an Act of Congress.\n\n                            PART II--PERMITS\n\n     SEC. 131.
