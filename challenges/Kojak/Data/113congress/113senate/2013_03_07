Mr. President, my Republican colleagues love to extol the \nvirtues of regular order. If only we could get back to regular order, \nthey say, we could function again. Yesterday, we saw both sides of \nthat.\n  On the one hand, my Republican colleagues did practice regular order. \nOn the other, they didn't. Let's take the one they didn't.\n  They demanded a 60-vote threshold for confirmation of a very \nqualified nominee, Caitlin Halligan, to be United States Court of \nAppeals Judge for the DC Circuit. Republicans once again hid behind a \ncloture vote--filibuster, by another term--to prevent a simple up-or-\ndown vote on this important nomination. They took the easy way out.\n  On the other hand, one Republican Senator did return to regular \norder. As is his right, he spoke for as long as he was able to speak. \nAnd that is a filibuster. After 12 hours standing and talking, this is \nhow Senator Paul ended his filibuster:\n\n       I would go for another 12 hours to try to break Strom \n     Thurmond's record, but I've discovered there are some limits \n     to filibustering and I'm going to have to take care of one of \n     those in a few minutes here.\n\n  Well, I have been involved in a few filibusters, as Rand Paul was \nyesterday, and what I have learned from my experiences with talking \nfilibusters is this: To succeed, you need strong convictions but also a \nstrong bladder. It is obvious Senator Paul has both.\n  We should all reflect on what happened yesterday as we proceed with \nother nominations, including a lot of judicial nominations. This can be \na Senate where ideas are debated in full public view and obstruction \nhappens in full public view as well or it can be a Senate where a \ncouple Senators obstruct from behind closed doors without ever coming \nto the Senate floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/07/senate-section/article/S1239-8", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1239-S1240]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             BLOODY SUNDAY\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, forty-eight years ago today, a young man by \nthe name of John Lewis set out on a march across Alabama, from Selma to \nMontgomery. By his side were a few hundred\n\n[[Page S1240]]\n\nfreedom-loving men and women calling for an end to discrimination \nviolence against African Americans.\n  Today, John Lewis is a distinguished member of the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, but back then when he was a young civil rights leader, \nhe was determined to fight injustice and force the United States to \nlive up to its founding principle that all people are created equal.\n  I had the good fortune to go--not this year but a year or two ago--\ndown to Selma and participate in this reenactment. John Lewis was \nthere, as I saw on TV a few days ago. It was a cold day when I went \nthere, and you saw them all bundled a few days ago. And on the day of \nthe march, you see the TV pictures of John Lewis with a long coat, and \nhe had a backpack. I asked him what was in the backpack. He said, I \nthought I would be arrested and I would be put in jail. I had in that \nbackpack an apple and a book I was reading.\n  After being viciously beaten, John Lewis doesn't know what happened \nto his apple, his book, or his backpack. But what a legend he has \nbecome. He wasn't arrested that day. Instead, John and the peaceful \nprotesters by his side were met a few blocks into their march by State \ntroopers with dogs, fire hoses, and clubs, and they used every one of \nthem against these marchers. Many of the marchers, including John \nLewis, were viciously beaten.\n  The terrible violence of that day, known as Bloody Sunday, was \nbroadcast across the country. For the first time the bloody reality of \nthe struggle for equal rights was beamed into America's living rooms. \nBloody Sunday marked the turning point in the civil rights movement as \nAmericans cried out against the injustice and bloodshed they saw on the \ntelevision screens.\n  Later that month protesters finally completed that march from Selma \nto Montgomery, and more than 25,000 patriots converged on the Alabama \nState Capitol Building. From the steps of the Alabama capitol, Dr. \nMartin Luther King spoke of the power of peaceful resistance. This is \nwhat he said:\n\n       Selma, Alabama, became a shining moment in the conscience \n     of man. If the worst in American life lurked in its dark \n     street, the best of American instincts arose passionately \n     from across the nation to overcome it.\n\n  Six months later President Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of \n1965, and that is where Senator Thurmond, whom I had the good fortune \nof serving with here, took to the floor and gave that speech for 24 \nhours.\n  I may disagree with Strom Thurmond, but he had a right to talk. Rand \nPaul had a right to talk.\n  The Supreme Court last week considered striking sections of the law \nbarring areas with a history of discrimination from changing voting \npractices without Federal approval. That is what the Voting Rights Act \nwas all about. Critics say those protections are no longer necessary. \nBut anyone who waited hours to cast a ballot in 2012 knows that is not \ntrue. A 102-year-old woman waited 8 hours to vote. And anyone who has \nwatched the State legislature pass laws designed to intimidate eligible \nvoters and keep the poor, minorities, and the elderly from the polls \nknows the fight for freedom is not over.\n  America has made great strides to eradicate racism, thanks to legends \nsuch as John Lewis. But, together, we must guard that progress with \nvigilance, keeping in mind the sacrifices made by so many 48 years ago \ntoday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/07/senate-section/article/S1240-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1240]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, yesterday the junior the Senator from \nKentucky took to the Senate floor to exercise his rights as an \nindividual Senator in pursuit of an answer from the Attorney General \nconcerning the rights of U.S. citizens.\n  The filibuster was extended, heartfelt, and important, and I wish to \nsay a few words in reaction to that effort and, as well, on the \nnomination of John Brennan to be Director of the Central Intelligence \nAgency.\n  The question he raised was entirely appropriate and should have \nalready been answered by the Obama administration.\n  First, I wish to state for the Record and to correct any \nmisimpression that yesterday's long debate was a criticism of the \nSenate's oversight of our Nation's intelligence activities. In fact, \nthe Senate Select Committee on Intelligence is responsible for \nconducting vigorous oversight of our Nation's intelligence activities, \nand I want to make clear that they were not the subject of last night's \ndebate. The members of that committee conduct that oversight in a \nprofessional, responsible manner, and selflessly serve the rest of the \nSenate in that capacity.\n  Let me assure the Senate, the activities of the intelligence \ncommunity are closely monitored and overseen by the Intelligence \nCommittee, to include all counterterrorism activities.\n  Most recently, the committee has conducted a serious and much-needed \ninquiry into the terrorist attack on the temporary mission facility in \nBenghazi, Libya, and has conducted a thorough review of John Brennan's \nnomination to be Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Thanks to \nthe leadership of Chairman Feinstein and Vice Chairman Chambliss, the \ncommittee has made significant progress in reviewing Mr. Brennan's \nrecord, the intelligence related to the terrorist threat in Libya, and \nin reviewing the administration's legal opinions concerning some \noverseas activities.\n  Second, in reviewing Mr. Brennan's nomination, Senator Paul has asked \na series of questions of the executive branch. Senator Paul has a right \nto ask questions of the administration, and the administration has a \nresponsibility to answer in keeping with the rules established for \noversight of intelligence activities and for protecting sensitive \ninformation.\n  The specific question, however, is not an intelligence-related \nquestion but a straightforward legal question: Does the President have \nthe authority to order the use of lethal force against a U.S. citizen \nwho is not a combatant on U.S. soil without due process of law?\n  To his credit, John Brennan directly answered the question motivating \nSenator Paul's filibuster: The Central Intelligence Agency does not \nconduct lethal operations inside the United States, nor does it have \nthe authority to do so. What is befuddling is why the Attorney General \nhas not directly and clearly answered the question.\n  The U.S. military no more has the right to kill a U.S. citizen on \nU.S. soil who is not a combatant with an armed unmanned aerial vehicle \nthan it does with an M-16. The technology is beside the point. It \nsimply doesn't have that right, and the administration should simply \nanswer the question. There is no reason we cannot get this question \nanswered today. And we should get the question answered today. Frankly, \nit should have been answered a long time ago.\n  Last, during Senator Paul's filibuster, I noted that I cannot support \nJohn Brennan's confirmation. During January of 2009, the President \nissued a series of Executive orders which, in my judgment, weakened the \nability of our intelligence community to find, capture, detain, and \ninterrogate terrorists. As President Obama's senior adviser on \ncounterterrorism, Mr. Brennan has been a fierce defender of the \nadministration's approach to counterterrorism as articulated by the \nExecutive orders I just referred to. He has been a loyal, dogged \ndefender of the administration's policies, policies with which I \nseriously disagree. My greatest concern is that the Director of Central \nIntelligence must be entirely independent of partisan politics in \ndeveloping objective analysis and advice that he gives to the \nPresident. After 4 years of working within the White House, confronting \ndifficult policy matters on a daily basis, and having attempted to \ndefend the administration's policies--sometimes publicly, sometimes to \nthe media, and occasionally to the Senate--I question whether Mr. \nBrennan can detach himself from those experiences.\n\n  For that reason I will oppose his nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/07/senate-section/article/S1240-3", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1240-S1241]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak as in morning business for up to 12 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Economic Growth\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak about spending \nand its impact on economic growth. I think it is important Washington \nclosely considers the true impact Federal spending and our soaring \nnational debt are having on economic growth.\n  Over the past few weeks, the White House and the President have been \nout campaigning across the country and making statements aimed at \ncausing fear and anxiety about the sequester. The White House has \npainted the sequester--which, keep in mind, amounts to just 2.4 percent \nof all Federal spending--as something which would lead to an economic \ndisaster in this country.\n  The White House attempts to cause fear and anxiety have fallen flat. \nWhat is more, many of the claims which were made were simply false. In \nfact, the critics agree.\n  Bill Keller wrote in the New York Times: ``The White House spent last \nweek in full campaign hysteria.''\n  The Washington Post issued four Pinocchios with regard to false \nclaims made by Education Secretary Arne Duncan about the sequester's \nimpact on teachers' jobs.\n  The National Journal states: ``The White House's strategy to \nexaggerate the immediate impact of the cuts has backfired.''\n  In Politico: ``For all the hype, spin and blame exchanged over the \nacross-the-board cuts, the reality is they don't mean the sudden \neconomic collapse of America.''\n  It is important to see the sequester in its overall context. All the \nhype associated with this could be analogous, I suppose, to all the \nhype we had yesterday about the weather. Everybody expected we were \ngoing to have the blizzard of 2013, and it never materialized. All of \nthe predictions with regard to doom and gloom relating to sequester \nhave also not amounted to very much.\n  The American people have picked up on that. I think most of them \nagree, if you look at public opinion polls, that Washington does need \nto tighten its belt. Washington does need to reduce its spending. \nWashington needs to lessen the appetite it has to take more of the \nAmerican taxpayers' money and spend it on what most taxpayers view to \nbe not really necessary.\n  When you talk about a 2.4-percent reduction in overall Federal \nspending, most Americans, when they evaluate their own financial \nsituations, come to the conclusion most of them probably could absorb, \nif they had to, a 2.4-percent reduction in their own spending. They \nwould look at their budgets in very realistic ways. They would \nscrutinize and examine where they could find spending which is low \npriority, things they could live without. What we have seen here in \nWashington from the administration is various heads of agencies and \ndepartments going out and trying to identify the biggest, most high-\nprofile thing for dramatic effect in an attempt to scare and frighten \nthe American people.\n  The American people recognize, and hopefully the administration has \ncome to the conclusion as well, a 2.4-percent reduction in overall \nFederal spending is something we need to absorb here in Washington, DC, \nand demonstrate to the American people we are serious about getting \nWashington's fiscal house in order.\n  I have long maintained the sequester is not the best way to rein in \nFederal spending. There is a better way to do so. The reductions called \nfor in the sequester disproportionately impact certain areas of the \nbudget. We all know about the impact on the national security budget, \nwhich represents only 20 percent of Federal spending but gets 50 \npercent of the cuts in the sequester.\n  I would have preferred a different approach. Given the refusal of \nPresident Obama and Senate Democrats to come to the table and find \nalternative savings, the sequester has gone into effect. The President \nand most Senate Democrats wanted to see an increase in taxes, something \nmany of us believe would be very harmful to the economy. If you look at \nwhat the President has already received in terms of tax increases since \nhe has been in office, it amounts to about $1.7 trillion.\n  If you look at the last 4 years and all the promises which were made \nabout additional spending, stimulus spending, $1 trillion in additional \nstimulus spending back when the President first took office, how that \nwould impact the economy, we were told it would take unemployment down \nbelow 6 percent. We all know what has happened. We continue to \nexperience sluggish, slow, anemic growth with chronic high \nunemployment, and we continue to pile massive amounts of debt on the \nbacks of our children and grandchildren.\n  While the President has been seeking to cause alarm and cast blame \nwith regard to the sequester, one must question the economic arguments \nhe is making. The President and his allies in Congress claim he \ninherited a bad economy and increased spending is necessary to \nstimulate economic growth. President Obama's agenda, since he has been \nin office, has been to spend more, tax more, and regulate more.\n  As I mentioned earlier, over $1.7 trillion in new taxes has been \nimposed to be signed into law since he took office. The most recent of \nthat, the fiscal cliff, was $620 billion on January 1. If you add up \nthe tax increases in ObamaCare, there is over $1 trillion there. If you \nlook at the $518 billion in new regulations which have been approved \nsince the President took office, you may see we put an enormous amount \nof cost, burden, new requirements, mandates, and harm to the economy \nand the small businesses which create jobs: $1.7 trillion in new taxes, \nthe $518 billion in new regulations.\n  What has been the impact of those policies? It is pretty clear \naverage economic growth under this President has averaged eight-tenths \nof 1 percent, .8 percent of the overall share of the economy, GDP. This \nis less than 1 percent economic growth, on average, in the 4 years this \nPresident has been in office.\n  To put it in perspective, if you look at past Presidents when we have \nhad economic downturns and recessions, President Reagan inherited a bad \neconomy too. When he came to office, we were faced with a series of \nreal economic circumstances: high inflation, high interest rates, and \nweak growth.\n  President Reagan put in place policies which were progrowth. He \nenacted progrowth tax reform, fewer regulations. The economy grew \nnearly three times as fast as it has under President Obama's watch.\n  The point, very simply, is if you put the right policies in place, if \nyou make it less difficult and less expensive for our small businesses \nand our job creators to create more jobs, there are more jobs and \neconomic growth. If you make it more difficult, more expensive, and \nharder for our small businesses and our job creators to create jobs, \nthere are fewer jobs, less economic growth, and lower take-home pay for \nAmerican families and workers.\n  If the Obama recovery was as strong as Reagan's, our economy would be \n$1.5 trillion larger today, meaning more jobs and more opportunity for \nAmericans. This is assuming if you were getting a comparable level of \ngrowth in the economy. The fact is President Obama's spending, tax, and \nregulatory policies are hamstringing economic recovery, jobs, and \nopportunity.\n  Yesterday the Federal Reserve released the latest edition of its so-\ncalled beige book or more formally known as\n\n[[Page S1242]]\n\nthe Summary of Commentary on Current Economic Conditions. The beige \nbook stated the 2010 health care law is being cited as a reason for \nlayoffs and a slowdown in hiring.\n  This report, which examines economic conditions across various \nFederal Reserve districts throughout the country, stated: ``Employers \nin several districts cited the unknown effects of the Affordable Care \nAct as reasons for planned layoffs and reluctance to hire more staff.''\n  It is clear President Obama's policies are the real threat to our \neconomy, not the sequester. A 2.4-percent across-the-board reduction in \nFederal spending here in Washington, DC, clearly--if you look at the \nrate of growth we have seen in spending since the President took office \nof over 20 percent in 2009, in the overall scheme of things, is \nsomething which is very reasonable. The American people see this as \nreasonable overall.\n  On the contrary, if you look at policies the President has put in \nplace, whether this is more stimulus spending, growing government, \nhigher taxes, more regulations, we are getting a very different picture \nof what those policies look like in terms of the impact on our economy. \nWe have seen negative impacts, high-level spending, and high annual \ndeficits during the President's first term. As a consequence of these \nstatistics, there is slower economic growth.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an opinion \npiece by Michael Boskin, which he wrote earlier in the week. In this \narticle Mr. Boskin makes the case that spending cuts will actually help \nthe economy: ``Standard Keynsian models that claim a quick boost from \nhigher government spending showed the effect quickly turns negative. So \nthe spending needs to be repeated over and over, like a drug, to keep \nthe hypothetical positive effect going.''\n  Mr. Boskin points to an academic study which found returning spending \nto pre-crisis, pre-Obama levels--about a 3-percent reduction in \nspending as a percentage of our entire GDP--would increase short-term \neconomic growth because expectations of lower future taxes and debt \nlead to higher incomes, more private spending, and investment.\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Mar. 4, 2013]\n\n              Larger Spending Cuts Would Help the Economy\n\n                         (By Michael J. Boskin)\n\n       President Obama's most recent prescription for economic \n     growth--more government stimulus spending, new social \n     programs, higher taxes on upper-income earners, subsidies for \n     some industries and increased regulation for all of them--is \n     likely to have the same anemic results as in his first \n     administration.\n       Recall: The $825 billion stimulus program did little \n     economic good at a cost of hundreds of thousands of dollars \n     per job, even based on the administration's own inflated job \n     estimates. Cash for Clunkers cost $3 billion merely to shift \n     car sales forward a few months. The PPIP (Public-Private \n     Investment Program for Legacy Assets) to buy toxic assets \n     from the banks to speed lending generated just 3% of the $1 \n     trillion that the program planners anticipated.\n       And now? Mr. Obama proposes universal preschool ($25 \n     billion per year), ``Fix it First'' repairs to roads and \n     bridges, plus an infrastructure bank ($50 billion), ``Project \n     Rebuild,'' refurbishing private properties in cities ($15 \n     billion), endless green-energy subsidies, and a big hike in \n     the minimum wage. The president and Senate Democrats also \n     demand that half the spending cuts under sequestration be \n     replaced with higher taxes.\n       These proposals are ill-considered. The evidence sadly \n     suggests the initial improvement in children's cognitive \n     skills from ``Head Start'' quickly evaporates. Higher minimum \n     wages increase unemployment among low-skilled workers. A \n     dozen recent studies in peer-reviewed journals, including one \n     by the president's former chief economic adviser Christina \n     Romer, document the negative effects of higher taxes on the \n     economy.\n       As for adventures in industrial policy, former Obama \n     economic adviser Larry Summers wrote a memo in 2009 about the \n     impending $527 million loan guarantee to Solyndra and other \n     recipients of government largess. ``The government is a \n     crappy v.c. [venture capitalist],'' he wrote, in what is also \n     the best postmortem. In 2010, Harvard economist Edward \n     Glaeser concluded in the New York Times that infrastructure \n     is poor stimulus because ``It is impossible to spend quickly \n     and wisely.'' Federal infrastructure spending should be dealt \n     with in regular appropriations.\n       Will more spending today stimulate the economy? Standard \n     Keynesian models that claim a quick boost from higher \n     government spending show the effect quickly turns negative. \n     So the spending needs to be repeated over and over, like a \n     drug, to keep this hypothetical positive effect going. Japan \n     tried that to little effect, starting in the 1990s. It now \n     has the highest debt-to-GDP ratio among the countries of the \n     Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development--and \n     that debt is a prime cause, as well as effect, of Japan's \n     enduring stagnation.\n       The United States is heading in this wrong direction. Even \n     if the $110 billion in annual sequestration cuts are allowed \n     to take place, the Congressional Budget Office projects that \n     annual federal spending will increase by $2.4 trillion to \n     $5.9 trillion in a decade. The higher debt implied by this \n     spending will eventually crowd out investment, as holdings of \n     government debt replace capital in private portfolios. Lower \n     tangible capital formation means lower real wages in the \n     future.\n       Since World War II, OECD countries that stabilized their \n     budgets without recession averaged $5-$6 of actual spending \n     cuts per dollar of tax hikes. Examples include the \n     Netherlands in the mid-1990s and Sweden in the mid-2000s. In \n     a paper last year for the Stanford Institute for Economic \n     Policy Research, Stanford's John Cogan and John Taylor, with \n     Volker Wieland and Maik Wolters of Frankfurt, Germany's \n     Goethe University, show that a reduction in federal spending \n     over several years amounting to 3% of GDP--bringing \n     noninterest spending down to pre-financial-crisis levels--\n     will increase short-term GDP.\n       Why? Because expectations of lower future taxes and debt, \n     and therefore higher incomes, increase private spending. The \n     U.S. reduced spending as a share of GDP by 5% from the mid-\n     1980s to mid-1990s. Canada reduced its spending as share of \n     GDP by 8% in the mid-'90s and 2000s. In both cases, the \n     reductions reinforced a period of strong growth.\n       An economically ``balanced'' deficit-reduction program \n     today would mean $5 of actual, not hypothetical, spending \n     cuts per dollar of tax hikes. The fiscal-cliff deal reached \n     on Jan. 1 instead was scored at $1 of spending cuts for every \n     $40 of tax hikes.\n       Keynesian economists urge a delay on spending cuts on the \n     grounds that they will hurt the struggling economy. Yet at \n     just one-quarter of 1% of GDP this year, $43 billion of this \n     year's sequester cuts in an economy with a GDP of more than \n     $16 trillion is unlikely to be a major macroeconomic event.\n       Continued delay now leaves a long boom as the only time to \n     control spending. There was some success in doing this in the \n     mid-1990s under President Clinton and a Republican Congress. \n     More commonly the opposite occurs: A boom brings a surge in \n     tax revenues and politicians are anxious to spread the \n     spending far and wide.\n       In any case, the demand by Mr. Obama and Senate Democrats \n     that any dollar of spending cuts in budget agreements this \n     spring (to fund the government for the rest of the fiscal \n     year and when the debt limit again approaches) be matched by \n     an additional dollar of tax hikes is economically unbalanced \n     in the extreme. Those who are attempting to gradually slow \n     the growth of federal spending while minimizing tax hikes \n     have sound economics on their side.\n\n  Mr. THUNE. To wrap up and put this into perspective, Federal spending \nhas increased nearly 20 percent since 2009. Sequestration, the across-\nthe-board spending reductions which will occur under the sequester, \namount to a reduction of 2.4 percent out of a $3.5 trillion budget. \nEven with the sequester, the government will spend more this year than \nit did last year.\n  I would hope the President would begin to be honest with the American \npeople about the impact of his tax hikes, his spending, and new \nregulations are having on our Nation's economic growth and recovery; \nmore important, coming to the conclusion and being honest with the \nAmerican people about that, change his policies; actually come to a \nconclusion based on what we have seen, 4 years of his policies, which \nis slow growth, and a .8 percent economic growth on average for the \npast 4 years. There is also, as I said before, high unemployment, \nchronic unemployment--which is still around that 8-percent level--and \nmassive amounts of new debt we are piling on the backs of future \ngenerations.\n  Not only do we need the President, in terms of his rhetoric, to be \nhonest with the American people, we need him to change his policies and \ntake an honest look at the relationship between spending and economic \ngrowth. This shows the sequester will not have long-term negative \nimpacts on the economy. We need to put the Federal Government on a \nstable fiscal path in order to create the kind of economic certainty \nneeded in this country to grow the economy and create jobs.\n  Less spending by Washington, DC, actually will lead to greater \neconomic growth, a private economy, more jobs for the American people, \nand higher take-home pay.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n[[Page S1243]]\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate as if in morning business and ask to be joined in colloquy with \nthe Senator from South Carolina, Senator Graham.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           The Drone Program\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I wish to quote from this morning's \neditorial in the Wall Street Journal entitled ``Rand Paul's Drone \nRant.'' I wish to read for the edification of my colleagues the \neditorial which was in the Wall Street Journal, a credible media \noutlet, this morning.\n  The Wall Street Journal reads:\n\n       Give Rand Paul credit for theatrical timing. As the storm \n     descended on Washington, the Kentucky Republican's old-\n     fashioned filibuster Wednesday filled the attention void on \n     Twitter and cable TV. If only his reasoning matched the \n     showmanship.\n       Shortly before noon, Senator Paul began talking filibuster \n     against John Brennan's nomination to lead the CIA. The tactic \n     is rarely used in the Senate and was last seen in 2010. But \n     Senator Paul said an ``alarm'' had to be sounded about the \n     threat to Americans from their own government. He promised to \n     speak ``until the President says, no, he will not kill you at \n     a cafe.'' He meant by a military drone. He's apparently \n     serious, though his argument isn't.\n       Senator Paul had written the White House to inquire about \n     the possibility of a drone strike against a U.S. citizen on \n     American soil. Attorney General Eric Holder replied that the \n     U.S. hasn't and ``has no intention'' to bomb any specific \n     territory. Drones are limited to the remotest area of \n     conflict zones like Pakistan and Yemen. But as a hypothetical \n     constitutional matter, Mr. Holder acknowledged the President \n     can authorize the use of lethal military force within U.S. \n     territory.\n       This shocked Senator Paul, who invoked the Constitution and \n     Miranda rights. Under current U.S. policy, Mr. Paul mused on \n     the floor, Jane Fonda could have been legally killed by a \n     Hellfire missile during her tour of Communist Hanoi in 1972. \n     A group of noncombatants sitting in public view in Houston \n     may soon be pulverized, he declared.\n       Calm down, Senator. Mr. Holder is right, even if he doesn't \n     explain the law very well. The U.S. Government cannot \n     randomly target American citizens on U.S. soil or anywhere \n     else.\n\n  I repeat that: The U.S. Government cannot randomly target American \ncitizens on U.S. soil or anywhere else.\n\n       What it can do under the laws of war is target an ``enemy \n     combatant'' anywhere at any time, including on U.S. soil. \n     This includes a U.S. citizen who is also an enemy combatant. \n     The President can designate such a combatant if he belongs to \n     an entity--a government, say, or a terrorist network like al-\n     Qaida--that has taken up arms against the United States as \n     part of an internationally recognized armed conflict. That \n     does not include Hanoi Jane.\n       Such a conflict exists between the U.S. and al-Qaida, so \n     Mr. Holder is right that the U.S. could have targeted (say) \n     U.S. citizen Anwar al-Awlaki had he continued to live in \n     Virginia. The U.S. killed him in Yemen before he could kill \n     more Americans. But under the law al-Awlaki was no different \n     than the Nazis who came ashore on Long Island in World War \n     II, were captured and executed.\n       The country needs more Senators who care about liberty, but \n     if Mr. Paul wants to be taken seriously, he needs to do more \n     than pull political stunts that fire up impressionable \n     libertarian kids in their college dorms. He needs to know \n     what he's talking about.\n\n  I watched some of that ``debate'' yesterday. I saw colleagues of mine \nwho know better come to the floor and voice this same concern, which is \ntotally unfounded. I must say that the use of Jane Fonda's name does \nevoke certain memories with me, and I must say she is not my favorite \nAmerican, but I also believe that as odious as it was, Ms. Fonda acted \nwithin her constitutional rights. To somehow say that someone who \ndisagrees with American policy, and even may demonstrate against it, is \nsomehow a member of an organization which makes that individual an \nenemy combatant is simply false. It is simply false.\n  I believe we need to visit this whole issue of the use of drones--who \nuses them, whether the CIA should become their own Air Force, what the \noversight is. The legal and political foundation for this kind of \nconflict needs to be reviewed.\n  Relating to this, let me quote from an article by Jack Goldsmith that \nwas in the Washington Post on February 5, 2013, entitled: ``U.S. needs \na rulebook for secret warfare.''\n\n       The legal foundation rests mostly on laws designed for \n     another task that government lawyers have interpreted, \n     without public scrutiny, to meet new challenges. Outside the \n     surveillance context, Congress as a body has not debated or \n     approved the means or ends of secret warfare. Because secret \n     surveillance and targeted strikes, rather than U.S. military \n     detention, are central to the new warfare, there are no \n     viable plaintiffs to test the government's authorities in \n     court. In short, executive-branch decisions since 2001 have \n     led the Nation to a new type of war against new enemies on a \n     new battlefield without enough focused national debate, \n     deliberate congressional approval or real judicial review.\n       What the government needs is a new framework statute--akin \n     to the National Security Act of 1947, or the series of \n     intelligence reforms made after Watergate, or even the 2001 \n     authorization of force--to define the scope of the new war, \n     the authorities and limitations on presidential power, and \n     forms of review of the President's actions.\n\n  I don't think we should have any doubt there are people both within \nthe United States of America and outside it who are members of \nterrorist organizations and who want to repeat 9/11. All of us thank \nGod there has not been a repeat of 9/11. Most of the experts I know \nwill say there has been a certain element of luck--a small element but \nstill an element of luck, such as the Underwear Bomber and others--that \nhas prevented a devastating attack on the United States. But to somehow \nallege or infer the President of the United States is going to kill \nsomebody such as Jane Fonda or someone who disagrees with the \ngovernment's policies is a stretch of imagination which is, frankly, \nridiculous--ridiculous.\n  I don't disagree that we need more debate, more discussion, and, \nfrankly, probably more legislation to make sure America does protect \nthe rights of all our citizens and to make sure, at the same time, if \nsomeone is an enemy combatant, that enemy combatant has nowhere to \nhide--not in a cafe, not anywhere. But to say that somehow, even though \nwe try to take that person, that we would hit them in a cafe with a \nHellfire missile--well, first of all, there are no drones with Hellfire \nmissiles anywhere near. They are over in places such as Yemen and \nAfghanistan and other places around the world.\n  We have done a disservice to a lot of Americans by making them \nbelieve that somehow they are in danger from their government. They are \nnot. But we are in danger--we are in danger--from a dedicated, \nlongstanding, easily replaceable leadership enemy that is hellbent on \nour destruction, and this leads us to having to do things perhaps we \nhaven't had to do in other more conventional wars.\n\n  I don't believe Anwar al-Awlaki should have been protected anywhere \nin the world, but that doesn't mean they are going to take him out with \na Hellfire missile. It means we are going to use our best intelligence \nto apprehend and debrief these people so we can gain the necessary \nintelligence to bring them all to justice.\n  All I can say is, I don't think what happened yesterday is helpful \nfor the American people. We need a discussion, as I said, about exactly \nhow we are going to address this new form of almost interminable \nwarfare, which is very different from anything we have ever faced in \nthe past, but somehow to allege the United States of America, our \ngovernment, would drop a drone Hellfire missile on Jane Fonda, that \nbrings the conversation from a serious discussion about U.S. policy to \nthe realm of the ridiculous.\n  I would also like to add an additional note. About 42 percent, as I \nam told, of the Members of this Senate are here for 6 years or less. \nEvery time a majority party is in power, they become frustrated with \nthe exercise of the minority and their rights in the Senate. Back some \nyears ago, when the Republicans--this side of aisle--were in the \nmajority, we were going to eliminate the ability to call for 60 votes \non the confirmation of judges. We were able to put that aside. There \nwas another effort at the beginning of this Senate to do away with 60 \nvotes and go back down to 51, which, in my view, would have destroyed \nthe Senate.\n  A lot of us worked very hard--a group of us--for a long time to come \nup with some compromises that would allow the Senate to move more \nrapidly and efficiently but at the same time preserving the 60-vote \nmajority requirement on some pieces of legislation. What we saw \nyesterday is going to give ammunition to those critics who say the \nrules of the Senate are being abused. I hope my colleagues on this side \nof the aisle will take that into consideration.\n\n[[Page S1244]]\n\n  I note the presence of the Senator from South Carolina. The Senator \nfrom South Carolina, as many of our colleagues know, is a lawyer. He \nhas been a military lawyer in the Air Force Reserve for over 20 years. \nIf there is anyone in the Senate who knows about this issue from a \nlegal and technical standpoint, it is my colleague from South Carolina.\n  I ask my colleague from South Carolina, is there any way the \nPresident of the United States could just randomly attack someone, with \na drone or a Hellfire missile, without that person being designated an \nenemy combatant?\n  And I don't think, as much as I hate to say it, that applies to Jane \nFonda.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank my colleague. That is a very good question.\n  This has been a very lively debate. Senator Paul has a lot of \npassion, and that is a great thing. This is an important issue. We \nshould be talking about it, and I welcome a reasoned discussion. But to \nmy Republican colleagues, I don't remember any of you coming down here \nsuggesting that President Bush was going to kill anybody with a drone--\nI don't even remember the harshest critics of President Bush from the \nDemocratic side. They had a drone program back then, so what is it all \nof a sudden about this drone program that has gotten every Republican \nso spun up? What are we up to here?\n  I think President Obama has, in many ways, been a very failed \nPresident. I think his executive orders overstep, I think he has \nintruded into the congressional arena by Executive order, I think \nObamaCare is a nightmare, and there are 1,000 examples of a failed \nPresidency, but there is also some agreement. People are astonished, I \nsay to the Senator, that President Obama is doing many of the things \nPresident Bush did. I am not astonished. I congratulate him for having \nthe good judgment to understand we are at war.\n  To my party, I am a bit disappointed that you no longer apparently \nthink we are at war. Senator Paul, he is a man unto himself. He has a \nview I don't think is a Republican view. I think it is a legitimately \nheld libertarian view.\n  Remember, Senator Paul was the one Senator who voted against a \nresolution that said the policy of the United States will not be to \ncontain a nuclear-capable Iran. It was 90 to 1. To his credit, he felt \nthat would be provocative and it may lead to a military conflict. He \nwould rather have a nuclear-capable Iran than use military force, and \nhe said so--to his credit. Ninety of us thought, well, we would like \nnot to have a military conflict with Iran, but we are not going to \ncontain a nuclear-capable Iran because it is impossible.\n  What would happen is that if Iran got a nuclear weapon, the Sunni \nArab States would want a nuclear weapon, and most of us believe they \nwould share the technology with the terrorists, who would wind up \nattacking Israel and the United States. It is not so much that I fear a \nmissile coming from Iran; I fear, if they got a nuclear weapon or \nnuclear technology, they would give it to some terrorist organization--\nlike they gave IEDs to the Shia militia in Iraq to kill Americans--and \nthey would wreak havoc on the world.\n  So we don't believe in letting them have it and trying to contain \nthem because we believe their association with terrorism is too long \nand too deep, that it is too dangerous for Israel and too dangerous for \nus. But Senator Paul, to his credit, was OK with that; I just disagree \nwith him.\n  As to what he is saying about the drone program, he has come our way \nsome, and I appreciate that. Before, he had some doubt in his mind as \nto whether we should have killed Anwar al-Awlaki in Yemen--an American \ncitizen who had collaborated with al-Qaida and was actually one of the \nmilitary leaders of al-Qaida in Yemen, who had radicalized Major Hasan, \nand who had been involved in planning terrorist attacks against U.S. \nforces throughout the region.\n  President Obama was informed through the military intelligence \ncommunity channels of Anwar al-Awlaki's existence, all the videos he \nmade supporting Jihad and killing Americans, and he, as Commander in \nChief, designated this person as an enemy combatant.\n  Mr. President, you did what you had the authority to do, and I \ncongratulate you in making that informed decision.\n  And the process to get on this target list is very rigorous--I think \nsometimes almost too rigorous.\n  But now, apparently, Senator Paul says it is OK to kill him because \nwe have a photo of him with an RPG on his shoulder. He has moved the \nball. He is saying now that he wants this President to tell him he will \nnot use a drone to kill an American citizen sitting in a cafe having a \ncup of coffee who is not a combatant. I find the question offensive.\n  As much as I disagree with President Obama, as much as I support past \nPresidents, I do not believe that question deserves an answer because, \nas Senator McCain said, this President is not going to use a drone \nagainst a noncombatant sitting in a cafe anywhere in the United States, \nnor will future Presidents because if they do, they will have committed \nan act of murder. Noncombatants, under the law of war, are protected, \nnot subject to being killed randomly.\n  So to suggest that the President won't answer that question somehow \nlegitimizes that the drone program is going to result in being used \nagainst anybody in this room having a cup of coffee cheapens the debate \nand is something not worthy of the time it takes to answer.\n  Mr. McCAIN. May I ask my colleague a question especially on that \nsubject.\n  A lot of our friends--particularly Senator Paul and others--pride \nthemselves on their strict adherence to the Constitution and the \ndecisions of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Isn't it true that as a result of an attack on Long Island during \nWorld War II, an American citizen--among others--was captured and hung \non American soil, and the U.S. Supreme Court upheld that execution \nbecause that individual was an enemy combatant? Does that establish \nwithout a doubt the fact that these are enemy combatants, and no matter \nwhere they are, they are subject to the same form of justice as the \nterrorists in World War II were?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. It has been a long-held concept in American jurisprudence \nthat when an American citizen sides with the enemies of our Nation, \nthey can be captured, held, and treated as an enemy combatant; they \nhave committed an act of war against our country, not a common crime.\n  In World War II, German saboteurs landed on Long Island. They had \nbeen planning and training in Germany to blow up a lot of \ninfrastructure--and some of it was in Chicago. So they had this fairly \nelaborate plan to attack us. They came out of a submarine. They landed \non Long Island. And the plan was to have American citizens sympathetic \nto the Nazi cause--of German origin, most of them--meet them and \nprovide them shelter and comfort. Well, the FBI back then broke up that \nplot, and they were arrested. The American citizens were tried by \nmilitary commission, they were found guilty, and a couple of them were \nexecuted.\n  Now, there has been a case in the war on terror where an American \ncitizen was captured in Afghanistan. Our Supreme Court reaffirmed the \nproposition that we can hold one of our own as an enemy combatant when \nthey align themselves with the forces against this country.\n  This Congress, right after the September 11 attacks, designated \nauthorization to use military force against al-Qaida and affiliated \ngroups. So the Congress has given every President since 9/11 the \nauthority to use military force against al-Qaida and affiliated groups. \nAnd American citizens such as Anwar al-Awlaki and that guy Hamdi who \nwas captured in Afghanistan have been treated as enemy combatants, and \nif President Obama does that, he is doing nothing new or novel.\n  What would be novel is for us to say that if a terrorist cell came to \nthe United States, if an al-Qaida cell was operating in the United \nStates, that is a common crime and the law of war doesn't apply. It \nwould be the most perverse situation in the world for the Congress to \nsay that the United States itself is a terrorist safe haven when it \ncomes to legal rights; that we can blow you up with a drone overseas, \nwe can capture you in Afghanistan and hold you under the law of war, \nbut if there is a terrorist cell operating in the\n\n[[Page S1245]]\n\nUnited States, somehow you are a common criminal and we will read you \nyour Miranda Rights.\n  I just have this one question to get Senator McCain's thoughts. I \nhope we realize that, hypothetically, there are patriot missile \nbatteries all over Washington that could interdict an airplane coming \nto attack this Capitol or the White House or other vital government \nfacilities.\n  I hope the Senator understands--Senator McCain is a fighter pilot--\nthat there are F-15s and F-16s on 3-minute to 5-minute alert all up and \ndown the east coast. If there is a vessel coming into the United States \nor a plane has been hijacked or a ship has been hijacked that is loaded \nwith munitions or the threat is real and they have taken over a craft \nand are about to attack us, I hope all of us would agree that using \nmilitary force in that situation is not only lawful under the \nauthorization to use military force, it is within the inherent \nauthority of the Commander in Chief to protect us all.\n  Mr. McCAIN. And should not be construed as an authority to kill \nsomebody in a cafe.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. It should be construed as a reasonable ability to defend \nthe homeland against a real threat. And the question is, Do you feel \nthreatened anymore? I do. I think al-Qaida is alive and well.\n  And to all those who have been fighting this war for a very long \ntime, multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, who have tried to keep \nthe war over there so it doesn't come here, to the failed plots that \nhave been broken up by the CIA and the FBI, God bless you. We have to \nbe right every time; they only have to be right once.\n  If you think the homeland is not a desire of al-Qaida, it is \nabsolutely on the top of their list. They are recruiting American \ncitizens to their cause, and unfortunately a few will probably go over \nto their side. Thank God it will be just a few.\n  But to take this debate into the absurd is what I object to. We can \nhave reasonable disagreements about, the regulatory nature of the drone \nprogram should be under the Department of Defense and what kind of \noversight Congress should have. I think that is a really good \ndiscussion, and I would like to work with Senator Durbin and others to \ncraft--the Detainee Treatment Act was where Congress got involved with \nthe executive branch to come up with a way to better handle the \ndetainee issue.\n  But the one thing I have been consistent about is I believe there is \n1 Commander in Chief, not 535, and I believe this Commander in Chief \nand all future Commanders in Chief are unique in our Constitution and \nhave an indispensable role to play when it comes to protecting the \nhomeland. If we have 535 commanders in chief, then we are going to be \nless safe. And if you turn over military decisions to courts, then I \nthink you have done the ultimate harm to our Nation--you have \ncriminalized the war. And I don't think our judiciary wants that.\n  So as much as I disagree with President Obama, I think you have been \nresponsible in the use of the drone program overseas. I think you have \nbeen thorough in your analysis. I would like to make it more \ntransparent. I would like to have more oversight.\n  As to the accusation being leveled against you that if you don't \nsomehow answer this question, we are to assume you are going to use a \ndrone--or the administration or future administrations would--to kill \nsomebody who is a noncombatant--no intelligence to suggest there are \nenemy combatants sitting in a cafe hit by a Hellfire missile--I think \nit is really off base.\n  I have this one final thought. If there is an al-Qaida operative U.S. \ncitizen who is helping the al-Qaida cause in a cafe in the United \nStates, we don't want to blow up the cafe. We want to go in there and \ngrab the person for intelligence purposes.\n  The reason we are using drones in Afghanistan and Pakistan is we \ndon't have any military presence along the tribal border. The reason we \nare having to use drones is we can't capture people. The preference is \nto capture them, not to kill them. But there are certain areas where \nthey operate that the only way we can get to them is through a drone \nstrike.\n  Mr. McCAIN. And may I say to my friend that there are scenarios where \nthere could be an extreme situation where there is a direct threat. We \ncould draw many scenarios--a bomb-laden, explosive-laden vehicle headed \nfor a nuclear powerplant--where the President of the United States may \nhave to use any asset the President has in order to prevent an \nimpending catastrophic attack on the United States of America. And that \nis within the realm of possible scenarios.\n  So to somehow say that we would kill people in cafes and therefore \ndrone strikes should never be used under any circumstances I believe is \na distortion of the realities of the threats we face.\n  As we are speaking, there are people who are plotting to attack the \nUnited States of America. We know that. At the same time, we are ready, \nas the Senator said, to discuss, debate, and frame legislation that \nbrings us up to date with the new kind of war we are in. But to somehow \nhave a debate and a discussion that we would have killed Jane Fonda \ndoes, in my view, a disservice to the debate and discussion that needs \nto be conducted.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. That is a very good point.\n  I look forward to a discussion about how to deal with a drone \nprogram. It is just a tactical weapon. It is an air platform without a \npilot.\n  Now, if there is a truck going toward a military base or nuclear \npowerplant, we have a lot of assets to interdict that truck. Maybe you \ndon't need the F-16. But I guarantee you, if there was a hijacked \naircraft coming to the Capitol, the President of the United States \nwould be well within his rights to order the Patriot missile battery to \nshoot that plane down or have an F-16 shoot it down. And we are ready \nfor that, by the way.\n  I would just suggest one thing. The number of Americans killed in the \nUnited States by drones is zero. The number of Americans killed in the \nUnited States by al-Qaida is 2,958. The reason it is not 2 million, 20 \nmillion, or 200 million is because they can't get the weapons to kill \nthat many of us. The only reason it is 2,958 is because their weapons \nof choice couldn't kill more. Their next weapon of choice is not going \nto be a hijacked airplane up there; it is going to be some nuclear \ntechnology or a chemical weapon, a weapon of mass destruction. That is \nwhy we have to be on our guard.\n  When you capture someone who is associated with al-Qaida, the best \nthing is to hold them for interrogation purposes. We found bin Laden \nnot through torture, we found bin Laden through a decade of putting the \npuzzle together.\n  Senator Durbin and Senator McCain, both are very effective advocates \nthat we have to live within our values and that when we capture \nsomebody, we are going to hold them under the law of war. We are going \nto explore the intelligence, but we are going to do it within the laws \nthat we signed up to, such as the Geneva Conventions, the Convention \nAgainst Torture.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Absolutely.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I very briefly thank my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle. It was 12 hours ago when I was standing right here, a lonely \nvoice among others who were discussing this issue, bringing up the \npoints the Senator raises. The first is the drone is a weapon. There \nare many weapons that can deliver lethal force. We should view this as \nan issue of lethal force, not an issue of drones per se--although it \nmay raise some particular questions in application. It is largely a \nquestion of lethal force.\n  The second question has been raised by both Senators. What if the \nfourth airplane had not been brought down by the passengers? What if \nthat plane were headed for this Capitol Building and all other planes \nhad been landed across America under orders of our government and we \nknew this plane was the fourth plane in control of the terrorists, what \nauthority did President Bush have as Commander in Chief at that moment?\n  I don't think anyone would question he had the authority to use \nlethal force to stop the terrorists from using that plane as a fourth \nweapon against the United States.\n  There was no debate last night about that particular point. This \nnotion--and I am glad this point has been raised--that we are somehow \ngoing to use drones to kill people sipping coffee in\n\n[[Page S1246]]\n\ncafes is ludicrous. It is absurd. It goes beyond the obvious. We need \nthose people. Bringing those people into our control gives us more \ninformation.\n  Second, for goodness' sake, the collateral damage of something that \nbrutish would be awful. So I thank the Senator for putting it in \nperspective.\n  I think Attorney General Holder could have been more artful in his \nlanguage yesterday, but at the end of the day, even Senator Cruz \nacknowledged he said it would be unconstitutional to use this kind of \nlethal force if there weren't an imminent threat pending against the \nUnited States.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If I may say real quickly, an imminent threat.\n  MR. DURBIN. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. We may have to do a little better job of defining that, \nbut to say imminent threat would then translate into killing somebody \nin a cafe is not a mature debate or discussion.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. If I can add, let me tell the Senator about imminent \nthreat and military law. In Iraq we had disabled terrorist insurgents. \nThere was a big debate in the Marine Corps because under military law \nwhen a lawful combatant, a person in uniform, has been disabled and it \ndoes not present an imminent threat, we don't have the ability to shoot \nthem. OK.\n  The terrorists in Iraq put IEDs on wounded belligerents, unlawful \nenemy combatants. So the Marine Corps wrestled very long and hard with \nthe rules of engagement. If you come upon somebody who is wounded, \napparently was disabled, under what circumstances could you use lethal \nforce because they may be booby-trapped.\n  To the Marine Corps' credit, they came up with a balance between who \nwe are--we just don't shoot even our enemies who are helpless and \nwounded--and the ability for force protection.\n  Here is what I would say about the circumstance in question. The \nprocess of determining who an enemy combatant is has always been a \nmilitary process. It is not a congressional debate. Our committees \ndon't get a list of names and we vote on whether we think they are \nenemy combatants. Courts don't have trials over who is an enemy \ncombatant. If there is a question about enemy combatant status under \nthe Geneva Conventions, you are entitled to a single hearing officer \nand that is all. In World War II, there were a lot of people captured \nin German uniform who claimed they were made to wear the uniform by the \nGermans. All of them had a hearing on the battlefield by a single \nofficer. It has been long held by military law it is a military \ndecision, not judicial decision or legislative decision, to determine \nthe enemy of the nation.\n  So President Obama has taken this far beyond what was envisioned. \nThis administration has a very elaborate process to determine who \nshould be determined to be an enemy combatant. I think it is thorough. \nI think it has many checks and balances. As much as I disagree with \nthis President on many issues, I would never dream of taking that right \naway from him because he is the same person, the Commander in Chief, \nwhoever he or she may be in the future, that we give the authority to \norder American citizens in battle where they may die. He has the \nauthority to pick up a phone, Senator McCain, and say you will launch \ntoday, and you may not come back.\n  I cannot imagine a Congress who is OK with the authority to order an \nAmerican citizen in battle--we don't want to take that away from him, I \nhope--that is uncomfortable with the same American determining who the \nenemy we face may be.\n  As to American citizens, here is the law. If you collaborate with al-\nQaida or their affiliates and you are engaged in helping the enemy, you \nare subject to being captured or killed under the law of war. What is \nan imminent threat? The day that you associate yourself with al-Qaida \nand become part of their team, everywhere you go and everything you do \npresents a threat to the country. So why do we shoot people walking \ndown the road in Pakistan? They don't have a weapon. There is no \nmilitary person in front of them who is threatened. The logic is that \nonce you join al-Qaida, you are a de facto imminent threat because the \norganization you are supporting is a threat.\n  For someone to suggest we have to let them walk down the road, go \npick up a gun and head toward our soldiers before you can shoot them is \nnot very healthy for the soldier they are trying to kill and it would \nbe a total distortion of law as it exists. Back here at home, and I \nwill conclude----\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will allow just one last comment and I \nthank him for the statement on the floor--from both my colleagues. The \nJudiciary Committee's Subcommittee on the Constitution is going to have \na hearing, it is already scheduled, on this issue of drones. There are \nlegitimate questions to be raised and answered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. There are.\n  MR. DURBIN. I might add that in my conversations with the President \nhe welcomes this. He has invited us to come up with a legal \narchitecture to make certain it is consistent with existing precedent \nand military law and other court cases as well as our Constitution. I \nthink that is a healthy environment for us to have this hearing and \ninvite all points of view and try to come up with a reasonable \nconclusion.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I could not welcome that more. It worked with the \nDetainee Treatment Act, it worked with the Military Commissions Act. I \nthink it is the right way to go.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I think that concludes our discussion. I \nwould agree with the Senator from Illinois and my colleague from South \nCarolina that we need hearings. We need to discuss how we conduct \nthis--the United States, in what appears to be, for all intents and \npurposes, an interminable conflict that we are in and we have to adjust \nto it. But that conversation should not be talking about drones killing \nJane Fonda and people in cafes. It should be all about what authority \nand what checks and balances should exist in order to make it a most \neffective ability to combat an enemy that we know will be with us for a \nlong time.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. If I could just have 2 minutes of wrapup, I will. To my \nfellow citizens, the chance of you being killed by a drone--because you \ngo to a tea party rally or a moveon.org rally or any other political \nrally or you are just chatting on the Internet quietly at home--by your \ngovernment through the use of a drone is zero, under this \nadministration and future administrations. If that day ever happened, \nthe President of the United States or whomever ordered such an attack \nwould have committed murder and would be tried. I don't worry about \nthat.\n  Here is what I worry about; that al-Qaida, who has killed 2,958 of \nus, is going to add to the total if we let our guard down. I will do \neverything in my power to protect this President, whom I disagree with \na lot, and future Presidents from having an ill-informed Congress take \nover the legitimate authority under the Constitution and the laws of \nthis land to be the Commander in Chief on behalf of all of us.\n  As to any American citizen thinking about joining with al-Qaida at \nhome or abroad: You better think twice because here is what is going to \ncome your way. If we can capture you, we will. You will be \ninterrogated. You will go before a Federal judge and one day you will \ngo before a court and you will have a lot of legal rights, but if you \nare found guilty, woe be unto you.\n  Here is another possibility. If you join with these thugs and these \nnuts to attack your homeland and if we have no ability to capture you, \nwe will kill you and we will do it because you made us. The process of \ndetermining whether you have joined al-Qaida is not going to be some \nFederal court trial. It is not going to be a committee meeting in the \nCongress. Because if we put those conditions on our ability to defend \nourselves, we cannot act in real time.\n  Bottom line: I think we are at war. I think we are at war with an \nenemy who would kill us all if he could, and every war America has been \nin we have recognized the difference between fighting crime and \nfighting a war. If you believe, as I do, we are at war, those who aid \nour enemies are not going to be treated as if they robbed a liquor \nstore. They are going to be treated as the military threat they are.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I thank my colleague and also thank the \nSenator from Illinois for his engagement. In closing, I would like to \ncongratulate my friend from South Carolina for his best behavior last \nnight at dinner. He was on his best manners and everyone was very \nimpressed.\n\n[[Page S1247]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I rise in support of the \nnomination of John Brennan to be the next director of the Central \nIntelligence Agency. Mr. Brennan earned a bipartisan vote of 12-3 in \nthe Senate Intelligence Committee, on which I serve. He is clearly \nqualified to lead the CIA and deserved that bipartisan vote in \ncommittee. And he deserves confirmation by the full Senate today.\n  I say that in spite of the difficulties my colleagues and I \nencountered in extracting information and commitments throughout the \nconfirmation process. Our concerns were less about John Brennan himself \nand more about the role that the next CIA director needs to play. And \nwe believe that the information and commitments we finally secured from \nhim and from the White House are extraordinarily relevant to the role \nof any CIA director.\n  Alongside several of my colleagues, I fought to enhance transparency \nand preserve our system of checks and balances. The American people \nhave the expectation that their government is upholding the principles \nof oversight and accountability.\n  Consistent with our national security, the presumption of \ntransparency should be the rule, not the exception. The government \nshould make as much information available to the American public as \npossible, while protecting national security.\n  We have seen during previous administrations the problems that can \narise when even the intelligence committees are left out of the loop: \nwarrantless wiretapping, extraordinary detention and torture. Ben \nFranklin put it well when he said: ``Those who would sacrifice liberty \nfor security deserve neither.''\n  Congressional oversight is critical to ensure that we sacrifice \nneither, as we pursue a smart, but tough, national security strategy, \nespecially in this age of new forms of warfare.\n  This was true over the past several months, as I joined Senator Wyden \nand others in pushing hard for access to the legal justification used \nby the executive branch to lethally target Americans using drones. The \nfact that we had to push so hard, I am sorry to say, no doubt erodes \nthe government's credibility with the American people. But it also \ngives us an opportunity--and a good reason--to maintain and strengthen \nour system of checks and balances.\n  I am glad the Administration met our requests and is giving members \nof the Intelligence Committee access to legal opinions on targeting \nAmerican citizens. This is an important first step. But there is more \nto be done for Congress to understand the limits on the drone program.\n  Madam President, our government has an obligation to the American \npeople to face its mistakes transparently, help the public understand \nthe nature of those mistakes, and then correct them. In this regard, \nthe next Director of the CIA has an important task.\n  The specific mistakes I am referring to are outlined in the \nIntelligence Committee's 6,000-page report on the CIA's deeply flawed \ndetention and interrogation program. Acknowledging the flaws of this \nprogram is essential for the CIA's long-term institutional integrity as \nwell as the legitimacy of ongoing sensitive programs.\n  I know the Presiding Officer will take a keen interest in this as she \nis a strong supporter of civil liberties and protecting our freedoms. \nThat is why I will hold Mr. Brennan to the promise he made to me at his \nconfirmation hearing; that is, to correct inaccurate information in the \npublic record on the CIA's detention and interrogation program. That is \nwhy I will continue to urge him to ensure that the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee's report on this flawed program is declassified and made \npublic.\n  In the committee's confirmation hearing, Mr. Brennan promised to be \nan advocate of ensuring the committee has what it needs to do its \nfunctions. I believe Mr. Brennan is that advocate.\n  I look forward to working with him and the administration with my \ngoal of protecting our national security while also safeguarding \nAmerica's constitutional freedoms and determining the limits of \nexecutive branch powers in this new age of warfare.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Remembering Deamonte Driver\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor to note a sad \nanniversary. Friday, March 1, marked 6 years since the tragic death of \na 12-year-old Maryland child named Deamonte Driver. I have spoken about \nhim many times since his passing, which happened just weeks after I \ncame to the Senate.\n  The death of any child is tragic; Deamonte's was even more so because \nit was entirely preventable. He died from untreated tooth decay. It \nstarted with an infected tooth. Deamonte began to complain about \nheadaches in early January 2007. By the time he was evaluated at \nChildren's Hospital's emergency room, the infection had spread to his \nbrain, and after multiple surgeries and a lengthy hospital stay, he \npassed away.\n  The principal at Deamonte's school, Gina James, remarked, ``Everyone \nhere was shocked. They couldn't understand how he could have a \ntoothache and then die. We sometimes give the little kids candy as a \nreward; well, for a while they stopped taking it because they would \nsay, `if I get a cavity, will I die?' ''\n  Because Deamonte did not get a tooth extraction that would have cost \nabout $80, he was subjected to extensive brain surgery that eventually \ncost more than $250,000. That is more than 3,000 times the cost of an \nextraction.\n  After Deamonte's death, more Americans began to recognize the link \nbetween dental care and overall health that medical researchers have \nknown for years.\n  Former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop once said that ``there is no \nhealth without oral health.'' The story of the Driver family has \nbrought Dr. Koop's lesson home in a painful way.\n  Children living in poverty have twice as much tooth decay as middle- \nand upper-income children, and nearly 40 percent of black children have \nuntreated tooth decay in their permanent teeth.\n  This has serious implications for their overall health. Untreated \noral health problems in children can result in attention deficits, poor \nschool performance, and problems sleeping and eating. And these \nproblems carry over to adulthood. Improper oral hygiene can increase an \nadult's risk of having low birth-weight babies, developing heart \ndisease, or suffering a stroke.\n  Employed adults lose more than 164 million hours of work each year \ndue to dental disease and dental visits, and in 2009 over 830,000 \nemergency room visits were the result of preventable dental conditions. \nPoor oral health is also associated with a number of other diseases, \nincluding diabetes, stroke and respiratory disease. In older adults, \npoor oral health is significantly associated with disability and \nreduction in mobility.\n  Medical researchers have discovered the important linkage between \nplaque and heart disease, that chewing stimulates brain cell growth, \nand that gum disease can signal diabetes, liver ailments and hormone \nimbalances. Further, oral research has led to advanced treatments like \ngene therapy, which can help patients who have chronic renal failure.\n  They have also discovered that oral disease is far more prevalent \nthan you might imagine. In fact, dental decay is the most common \nchronic childhood disease in the United States. Dental disease affects \n1 in 5 children aged 2 to 4, and more than half of all children have \ndental disease by the time they reach second grade. By the age of 17, \napproximately 80 percent of young people have had a dental cavity.\n  The average 50-year-old in the United States has lost 12 teeth, and \nby age 65 over one-quarter of Americans have lost all their teeth. More \nthan 10 percent of the nation's rural population have never visited a \ndentist.\n  These are sobering statistics. But here is the good news: Dental \ndecay is a dynamic disease process, and not a static problem. Before a \ncavity is formed in the tooth, the caries infection can actually be \nreversed. That means that we can prevent tooth decay, as long as dental \ncare is made available and good oral hygiene practices are used.\n\n[[Page S1248]]\n\n  Deamonte's story was told around the world. But nowhere did it hit \nharder than in his home State of Maryland. I am proud of how the \nMaryland Congressional Delegation, Governor Martin O'Malley, and the \nMaryland General Assembly have responded to the need for better access \nto oral health care.\n  In 2010 and 2011, the Pew Center on the States named Maryland a \nnational leader in improving dental access for low-income Marylanders. \nWe were the only State to meet seven of Pew's eight dental policy \nbenchmarks, and we ranked first in the nation for oral health. CMS also \ninvited our State officials to share their story at its national \nquality conference in August 2011 and placed Maryland's achievements in \nits Best Practices Guide.\n  I will mention just some of what Maryland has accomplished: In 2010, \nour State secured $1.2 million in Federal funding to develop a \nstatewide Oral Health Literacy Campaign, called ``Healthy Teeth, \nHealthy Kids.'' More than 368,000 children and adults in Medicaid \nreceived dental care in 2011; 82,000 more than in 2010. The percentage \nof pregnant women receiving dental care in 2011 was 28.4 percent, \ncompared to 26.6 percent in 2010.\n  Created by the Robert T. Freeman Dental Society and funded in part by \nthe State, the Deamonte Driver Mobile Dental Van Project provided \ndiagnostic and preventive services for over 1,000 Prince George's \nCounty children who live in neighborhoods where otherwise care would be \nunavailable to them.\n  The Kaiser Family Foundation awarded a $200,000 grant to the Maryland \nDental Action Coalition that funded a pilot dental screening program at \na school-based health center in Prince George's County.\n  The Dental Action Coalition also began granting and reimbursing \nprimary care providers to apply fluoride varnish for children up to 3 \nyears of age. By June 2012, 385 primary care providers had administered \nover 58,000 treatments.\n  The Maryland Community Health Resources Commission continues to \nexpand oral health capacity for underserved communities. Since 2008, \nthe Commission has awarded 20 dental grants totaling $4.6 million. \nThese grants have funded services to more than 35,000 low-income \nchildren and adults in our State.\n  I am also very proud of what Congress has done. In the CHIP \nReauthorization Act passed a few months after Deamonte died, we \nestablished a guaranteed oral health benefit for children. With the \nleadership of Senators Baucus, Grassley, Rockefeller, Collins, and \nformer Senator Bingaman, we created grants to the States to improve \noral health education and treatment programs. We also addressed one of \nthe problems that Deamonte's mother faced in trying to get care for \nhim--a lack of readily available information about accessible \nproviders.\n  For a variety of reasons, it is difficult for Medicaid and CHIP \nenrollees to find dental care, and working parents whose children \nqualify for those programs are likely to be employed at jobs where they \ncan't spend 2 hours a day on the phone to find a provider. So HHS must \ninclude on its Insure Kids Now Web site a list of participating \ndentists and benefit information for all 50 States and the District of \nColumbia.\n  Also, in 2009, Congress passed the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America \nAct. That law created the Healthy Futures Corps, which provides grants \nto the States and nonprofit organizations so they can fund national \nservice in low-income communities. It will allow us to put into action \ntools that can help us close the gap in health status--prevention and \nhealth promotion. For too long we have acknowledged health disparities, \nstudied them, and written reports about them. With the help of the \nsenior Senator from Maryland, my colleague, Senator Barbara Mikulski, \nwe added language to that law specifying oral health as an area of \nfocus.\n  Now the Healthy Futures Corps can help recruit young people to work \nin the dental profession, where they can serve in areas that we have \nshortages of providers in urban and rural areas. It will fund the work \nof individuals who can help parents find available oral health services \nfor themselves and their children. It will make a difference in the \nlives of the Healthy Futures Corps members who will work in underserved \ncommunities and in the lives and health of those who get improved \naccess to care. Then in the 2010 Affordable Care Act, we enacted \nseveral landmark provisions designed to improve oral health.\n  The ACA funds and encourages a number of oral health prevention \nactivities. First, it directs the CDC to establish a 5-year national \noral health education campaign. This campaign is required to use \nscience-based strategies and to target children, pregnant women, \nparents, the elderly, individuals with disabilities and ethnic and \nracial minority populations, including Native Americans.\n  The ACA also created demonstration grants to study the effectiveness \nof research-based oral health programs, which will be used to inform \nthe public education campaign.\n  The health care law expands an existing school-based dental sealant \nprogram to each of the 50 States and territories and to Indians, Indian \ntribes, tribal organizations and urban Indian organizations. It directs \nthe CDC to enter into cooperative agreements with State, territorial \nand Indian organizations to establish guidance, conduct data collection \nand implement science-based programs to improve oral health.\n  ACA also authorizes HHS to make grants to dental schools, hospitals, \nand nonprofits to participate in dental training programs. This funding \ncan be used to provide financial assistance to program participants, \nincluding dental and dental hygiene students as well as practicing \ndentists, and for loan repayment for faculty in dental programs. The \nACA also provides grants for up to 15 demonstration programs to train \nalternative dental health providers in underserved communities.\n  The law authorizes and requires a number of public health initiatives \nthat should improve access to oral health care, including an $11 \nbillion, 5-year initiative that funds construction, capital \nimprovements and service expansions at community health centers, where \nso many oral health services are provided.\n  It also establishes a National Health Care Workforce Commission to \nserve as a resource to evaluate education and training to determine \nwhether demand for health care workers is being met, and identify \nbarriers to improvement. We need that information. That was Senator \nBingaman's provision and it should be funded as soon as possible.\n  But perhaps the most important provision is a requirement that health \nplans cover a set of essential health benefits, EHBs, that includes \npediatric dental care. Beginning January 1, 2014, the law says that \noral health care for children must be part of the essential health \nbenefits package that must be offered in the new health insurance \nexchanges and in the small group and individual insurance markets that \nexist outside the exchanges.\n  When the ACA was passed nearly 3 years ago, I had great hopes that in \na few years, I could stand here on the Senate floor and celebrate all \nthe progress we had made in bringing affordable dental care to every \nchild in this nation. I had hoped this would be a day to talk about \nwhat a difference Congress has made in the oral health of America's \nchildren. We celebrated that section of the law, because it meant that \nonce and for all, oral health would be available to America's children. \nIt gave many of us hope that we would be able to get every child basic \ndental care and begin to erase the epidemic of dental disease that \nstill affects millions of American children. Now, however, the \naffordability of that benefit is at risk.\n  The ACA includes a Finance Committee provision that allows stand-\nalone dental plans to exist in the market. In a colloquy on September \n26, 2011, Senators Baucus, Stabenow, and Bingaman engaged in a \ncolloquy.\n  They clarified that the intent of the law in allowing stand-alone \ndental plans was not to create separate standards but to ensure \ncompetition in the insurance exchanges and allow choice in the \nmarketplace.\n  Later, I joined 10 of my colleagues in writing to HHS Secretary \nSebelius, urging her to ensure that all children who receive their \ndental coverage through a stand-alone dental plan should have the same \nlevel of consumer protections and cost-sharing as those who get \ncoverage through a plan that offers integrated benefits.\n\n[[Page S1249]]\n\n  Last week, HHS published a final rule on the benefits that creates a \nseparate out-of-pocket limit for stand-alone dental plans, but only \nspecifies that the limit be ``reasonable.'' There are two huge problems \nwith this approach. First, an additional out-of-pocket limit will make \nthe benefit far less affordable for many families. It was not what \nCongress intended. The whole point of adding pediatric dental benefits \nto the essential health benefits package was to make certain that oral \nhealth not be considered separate from overall health.\n  We have been here before. This approach is similar to policies that \nwere set decades ago for mental health services--separate policies to \ncover mental health treatment, separate limits on coverage, and \nseparate copays. Mental health was treated as second-class health care. \nWe know now that this was an injustice. It was wrong to treat those \nservices, and the patients who used them, as second-class. Many of my \ncolleagues were here in Congress when we fought the battles for mental \nhealth parity. It was a difficult battle, but we won. It seems to me \nthat this is what we are doing now with dental care, rather than \ntreating it as part of the Essential Benefits Package, which was our \nintent in the Affordable Care Act.\n  Section 1402(b) of the law also establishes an out-of-pocket limit \nfor all families and lowers that limit for families with incomes under \n400% of the Federal poverty level. By creating a separate limit, HHS is \nreducing the number of families who will be able to afford dental \ncoverage for their children.\n  Second, the rule has left the determination of what is a \n``reasonable'' out-of-pocket limit to each State. With pressure from \ninsurance companies, a State could decide to provide an out-of-pocket \nlimit of $1,000 or more per child, which could more than double out-of-\npocket costs for a family with five children.\n  In the Federally run exchanges, HHS has the authority to set a \n``reasonable'' out-of-pocket limit. Last Thursday, in a Finance \nCommittee hearing, I asked Jon Blum, the CMS Deputy Administrator, \nabout the idea of segregating dental benefits from health benefits and \nincreasing cost-sharing. This is what he said: ``Well I think one of \nthe lessons that we learned within the Medicare program is that when \nthe care is siloed, our benefits aren't fully integrated. That can \noften lead to worse total health care consequences. I can pledge to get \nback to you with direct answers to your questions. But I do agree with \nyour general principle that when benefit design is broken up and care \nis not coordinated, that it can often lead to bad quality of care. ``\n  Later that day, I spoke with CMS acting administrator Marilyn \nTavenner. I asked her to take into account the affordability of a plan \nthat had separate, high cost-sharing, and she agreed to consider my \nviews. Less than 24 hours later, CMS released a proposed ``guidance'' \nto insurers, setting a maximum out-of-pocket limit of $1,000. When I \ncontacted HHS to ask whether this was a per-family or per-child limit, \nthe expert in charge of the rule was unable to tell me. They did not \nknow whether this meant extra costs per year of $1,000 or $5,000 for a \nfamily with five children. This tells me that the affordability of care \nwas a secondary consideration when this final rule was written.\n  There are still millions of American children without coverage for \ndental care. If we are to make real progress in improving the health of \nAmericans, we cannot afford to continue giving oral health care second-\nclass treatment.\n  The question now is whether the guidance to plans will go forward. It \nis contrary to Congressional intent and contrary to the best interests \nof American families to allow it to stand. On this sixth anniversary of \nthe death of Deamonte Driver, let's pledge to do better for our \nchildren.\n\n  Madam President, I call to the attention of my colleagues a colloquy \nbetween Senators Bingaman, Stabenow, and Baucus in the Record of \nSeptember 26, 2011, at page S5973.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/07/senate-section/article/S1249-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, as a kind of predicate to this \nnomination, we have heard a 13-hour filibuster from Senators who desire \nan answer to the question that was proffered by Senator Paul. I have \nthat answer. It is dated March 7. It is a letter from the Attorney \nGeneral Eric Holder. It is to Senator Rand Paul.

The answer \n     to that question is no.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Eric H. Holder, Jr.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. So, hopefully, the need to continue any of this will \nbe vitiated, and we will be able to proceed with a vote. It is my \nunderstanding that I have a half hour on behalf of the majority of the \nIntelligence Committee to make a statement in support of Mr. Brennan.\n  Mr. Brennan's nomination was reported out of the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee on Tuesday by a strong bipartisan vote of 12 to 3. I look \nforward to an equally strong vote by the Senate later today.\n  Let me begin with his qualifications, which are impressive and \nunquestioned. John Brennan began his career as an intelligence officer \nwith the CIA in 1980. He worked as a CIA officer for 25 years in a \nvariety of capacities, including as an analyst in the Office of Near \nEastern and South Asian Analysis and as a top analyst in the CIA \nCounterterrorism Center from 1990 to 1992, both areas that remain very \nmuch a focus of the CIA today.\n  He was the daily intelligence briefer at the White House and served \nas George Tenet's executive assistant. Despite his background as an \nanalyst, Mr. Brennan was selected to serve as Chief of Station, a post \ngenerally filled by a CIA operations officer. He served in Saudi \nArabia, one of the most important and complex assignments, and then \nreturned to Washington as then-DCI Tenet's Chief of Staff and the \nDeputy Executive Director of the CIA.\n  Mr. Brennan then served as the head of the Terrorist Threat \nInterrogation Center, the predecessor organization to the National \nCounterterrorism Center (NCTC), where he also served as the Interim \nDirector. After a short stint in the private sector, he returned to be \nPresident Obama's top counterterrorism and homeland security adviser. \nIn that capacity, he has been involved in handling every major national \nand homeland security issue we have faced since 2009.\n  He has been involved in counterterrorism successes, including this \nadministration's efforts to bring Osama bin Laden to justice and at \nleast 105 arrests of terrorist operatives and supporters in the United \nStates since 2009. He also helped implement the lessons learned from \nUmar Farouq Abdul-\n\n[[Page S1250]]\n\nmutallab's attempted bombing of a jet over Detroit, the loss of CIA \npersonnel in Khowst, Afghanistan, and the terrorist attacks in \nBenghazi, Libya. So he is qualified.\n  For the past 4 years, Mr. Brennan has been among the President's \nclosest advisers. As Director of the CIA, he would lead this Nation's \nlargest intelligence agency and will continue to provide information \nand advice on intelligence matters to the President, his national \nsecurity team, and this Congress.\n  Throughout the past three decades, Mr. Brennan has observed every \naspect of intelligence from analysis to collection to covert action, \nfrom inside government and the private sector, and from both the \nintelligence and policy sides.\n  I actually do not believe there is anyone who is more qualified to \ntake over the CIA than John Brennan. So he cannot be denied this post, \nin my view, on the basis of qualification. I think even those who \noppose his nomination recognize there is no question but that he is \nwell qualified. From the time he walks into the CIA, he will be ready \nto go, up to speed on the numerous threats and challenges this country \nfaces all over the globe.\n  Let me speak for a moment why that is important and why it is so \nimportant that we move to confirm John Brennan. As the Director of the \nCIA, he leads the most diverse and clandestine intelligence agency, the \nonly agency to conduct covert actions, the largest all-source analytic \nworkforce. And he sits in the principal committee meetings where the \nmost sensitive national security decisions are made.\n  The past two CIA Directors, both Mr. Panetta and General Petraeus, \nhave played significant roles in keeping the Senate and House \nIntelligence Committees informed of sensitive operations. They have \nprovided an independent assessment of hot spots and strategic threats \naround the world. John Brennan will do the same.\n  By its nature, the CIA is among the parts of our government that \nreceive the least oversight. Its activities are largely shielded from \nthe view of the press, the public, the Government Accountability \nOffice, and, indeed, most Members of Congress. The Director of the CIA \nmust be both unimpeachable in his--or, hopefully, one day her--\nintegrity, while guiding a workforce of people who operate in the \nshadows for the benefit of our Nation. This is important.\n  He must manage an independent and creative workforce, build and \nnurture relationships with foreign spy chiefs, and lead teams of \nscientists, technicians, lawyers, analysts, and operatives who are \ninvolved in clandestine work. In short, the CIA is capable of the very \nbest of America, and, catastrophically at times, it is capable of great \nmistakes.\n  It follows that the position of CIA Director requires an uncommon \nnominee. That position should not remain vacant for long. For the past \n5 months, the Deputy Director, Michael Morell, has served as the Acting \nDirector.\n  Mr. Morell, like John Brennan, is a career CIA officer and a very \ngifted one. But as I discussed with him last Friday, he cannot single-\nhandedly attend the White House principals meeting, the deputies \nmeetings, direct the agency, meet with liaison partners, testify before \nCongress, implement sequestration, and do everything else the Director \nand Deputy Director must jointly do.\n  John Brennan and Michael Morell will be a great team in leading the \nCIA. I believe they compensate for one another. Michael Morell has \nthese skills in analysis, and I think John Brennan has skills that make \nhim a very strong and, yes, even tough leader.\n  We face continuing attack from terrorists. There is no question about \nthat. I see the reports every day. Our posts overseas remain at risk, \nand terrorists still seek to attack us at home. As a matter of fact, \nthere have been over 100 arrests in the last 4 years by the FBI in this \ncountry.\n  There is a massive and still growing humanitarian disaster underway \nin Syria with no end in sight and the prospect of an increasingly \ndesperate regime with nothing to lose. Instability is going to continue \nto fester across North Africa, from Mali to Algeria, to Libya and \nbeyond, breeding and harboring a new generation of extremist.\n  The North Korean regime is threatening to disavow the 1953 cease-fire \nwith the South, and it has the nuclear and missile capability to cause \nmassive destruction and instability.\n  Iran's nuclear program continues to grow and its Revolutionary Guard \nand Hezbollah proxy are growing bolder and more capable.\n  China's foreign policy and military might are increasing. According \nto well-sourced recent unclassified reports, its cyber operations are \nbleeding our private sector dry.\n  The CIA has a role to play in all of these areas, as well as \nmaintaining and expanding its global coverage. This is going to require \nprioritizing resources and producing better results from a very skilled \nCIA workforce. So the CIA Director position must be filled. Five months \nis too long to leave it vacant. John Brennan, I believe, and 12 members \nof our committee believe, is the right person to fill it.\n\n  On that question, whether we can depend on John Brennan to be \nstraight with the committee, I believe he will be and that he will be \nsomeone with whom we can build a strong and trusting relationship.\n  Let me just say one thing that is important. It is very important \nthat the Intelligence Committees in both of these Houses have that \nrelationship with the Director of the CIA, so that with a bond of trust \nthere can be a sharing of information which enables our oversight to be \nmore complete. Without that, our oversight is not complete, and it \ncertainly is not as rigorous as what is required.\n  In nominating John Brennan, President Obama spoke of his ``commitment \nto the values that define us as Americans.'' DNI Clapper, in a letter \nof support to the committee, noted John's ``impeccable integrity'' and \nthat his ``dedication to country is second to none.'' He has been \ncalled the administration's ``conscience,'' and I believe he will be a \nstraight shooter, which is extraordinarily important to me. I want the \ntruth whether it is good or bad. I want the truth. I believe every \nmember of my committee feels the same way.\n  Mr. Brennan has been straightforward with the committee throughout \nthe confirmation process. He has pledged to be open with us if \nconfirmed. We will take him up on that pledge. In his opening statement \nat the committee's public confirmation hearing, Mr. Brennan said: If \nconfirmed, ``I would endeavor to keep this committee fully and \ncurrently informed, not only because it is required by law, but because \nyou can neither perform your oversight function nor support the mission \nof the CIA if you are kept in the dark.''\n  He acknowledged that the ``trust deficit has at times existed'' \nbetween the Intelligence Committee and the CIA, and he pledged to make \nit his goal to strengthen the trust between our institutions. I look \nforward to giving him that opportunity. To be sure, I will hold him to \nthese words.\n  I recognize that building a relationship and trust requires two \nwilling partners. We are willing. I believe he will be willing. We will \nfind out.\n  In fact, there is a broader issue on the interaction between the \nexecutive branch and the Congress on intelligence matters. It goes well \nbeyond Mr. Brennan, and I wish to speak about it.\n  I have served on the Intelligence Committee for more than 12 years. \nThis is actually a lot more unusual than it sounds. From the \ncommittee's establishment in 1976 to the end of 2004, there were term \nlimits on committee membership. Senators rotated off the committee just \nwhen they had served for long enough to understand what the \nintelligence community is doing and, most important, how it operates.\n  Senators Rockefeller, Wyden, Mikulski, and I have all served on the \ncommittee for more than a decade, and Senators Chambliss and Burr are \nnear that total. Both served on the House committee before coming to \nthe Senate.\n  So now we have veterans on the committee who have watched and \nlistened. We spend a minimum of 2 hours in a committee meeting twice a \nweek and often longer. We cannot take home notes. Notes go in the safe \nand we cannot take home classified information. It means a lot of \nreading whenever we are able to find the time to go to a SCIF to read \nthe classified information\n\n[[Page S1251]]\n\nwhich daily is quite voluminous. We see everything except the \nPresident's PDB; that is, the President's Daily Brief. All the other \ninformation from all the other agencies stream through this committee. \nIt is vital we read it because this is where we find out where the \nthreats are.\n  We have been able to truly understand the relationship between the \nIntelligence Committee, the intelligence community, and the importance \nof having the committee kept fully and currently informed of \nintelligence matters. That is not our wish. That is a requirement of \nthe National Security Act. We have seen what happens when this is not \nthe case, when the committee doesn't have access to full knowledge of \nintelligence, as with the weapons of mass destruction weapons before \nthe war or with the CIA's detention and interdiction program through \nthe past administration.\n  By contrast, when we are briefed, we can provide input and advice. We \nwork to put an end to ill-advised plans, and we give the intelligence \ncommunity a measure of support and defend its actions.\n  There is a very strong feeling on both sides of the aisle that the \ncommittee is not receiving the information it needs to conduct all \noversight matters in the manner in which we should. There is the matter \nof Office of Legal Counsel opinions concerning the targeted killing of \nAmericans. The committee needs to understand the legal underpinning of \nnot only this program but of all clandestine programs, of all covert \nactions, so we may ensure the actions of the intelligence community \noperate according to law. Absent these opinions, we cannot conduct \noversight that is as robust as it needs to be.\n  During the confirmation process, we were able to reach an agreement \nwith the administration to receive these opinions, with staff access \nand without restrictions on note taking.\n  I want to thank the administration. I think increasingly they \nunderstand this problem of the need for us to access more information. \nIt is not a diminishing one, it is a growing one, and it is spreading \nthrough this House--and I suspect the other House as well.\n  It needs to be this way. We need to know the legal basis for very \nserious actions taken in a secretive way by the intelligence community. \nTherefore, we can defend it. If we don't see it, we don't know.\n  I also wish to address the drone issue once more, mainly to discuss \nthe hypothetical examples offered yesterday by the Senator from \nKentucky. On Fox News this week, he mentioned--and I began with this \n``what we are talking about is eating dinner in your house, you are \neating in a cafe or walking down the road, and a drone strike can \noccur. It is not about people involved in combat, it is about people \nwho they think might be.''\n  A drone strike against someone eating in a cafe or walking down the \nroad will never happen in the United States of America. This is not \npermitted in the United States of America. The Attorney General, in his \nletter to Senator Paul, has said just that. It will not happen.\n  I hope this puts this issue to an end. It is one thing to target a \nterrorist in an isolated country where there are isolated mountains and \nvalleys and where we cannot get to them to capture them, but we know \nterrorists and terrorist leaders are plotting against the United \nStates.\n  The United States of America is a different place. There is access to \nthe court system, access to police, access to FBI, access to warrants, \naccess to arrests, access to be able to find and ferret out individual \nterrorists. Drones will never be used in the United States of America \nto kill innocent Americans, not if I have anything to do with it.\n  Yesterday, in the Judiciary Committee while I was present, Senator \nCruz followed up on Senator Paul's concerns, asking Attorney General \nHolder if an American eating in a cafe--who doesn't pose an imminent \nthreat--could be killed by a drone. I don't believe the Attorney \nGeneral, at the time he heard the question or recognized the simplicity \nof the facts presented by the hypothetical. When he did, he said no. My \nview is the Attorney General's letter to Senator Paul is correct. The \nonly case in which the use of lethal force against Americans in the \nUnited States could be contemplated or constitutional would be an \nextraordinary circumstance such as the attack on Pearl Harbor or the \nterrorist attacks on September 11, where four big commercial airliners \nwere hijacked and flown into three large buildings, with the fourth \ncrashing into a field in Pennsylvania.\n  Another issue, where the committee has sought documents, is related \nto the Benghazi terrorist attack.\n  I notice that the vice chairman is on the floor. He and I have worked \nto bring the additional documents his side wanted on the Benghazi \nattacks. We have a commitment from the administration that all those \ndocuments, if they haven't already been forthcoming--and it is my \nunderstanding from the Senator most have been forthcoming--the \nremaining ones will be forthcoming as well.\n  My view is the committee has received the information we need in \norder to render a judgment about what happened in Benghazi before the \nattacks of last September 11 and 12, during, after, and before. My \nview, quite simply stated, is there was strategic warning about the \nconditions in Eastern Libya. And based on the previous attacks in the \narea, it was likely this mission not it was not a consulate--but this \nmission could well be a site of attack. Members have asked legitimate \nintelligence questions within our jurisdictional lane about Benghazi, \nand they deserve answers to their questions.\n  Many Senators on both sides of the aisle in the committee see the \nneed for a better relationship and a better appreciation of what we \nneed in order to do our work. As I discussed previously, we are very \ndifferent from other congressional bodies which do oversight. Our \nefforts aren't supplemented by the press, GAO or by nonprofit and \nadvocacy groups in the same way they are in the other committees of the \nCongress. The Intelligence Committees in the House and the Senate need \nto receive information from the executive branch in order to exercise \nrobust oversight.\n\n  I have spoken directly to the President, the President's Chief of \nStaff, the National Security Adviser, and the Director of National \nIntelligence about this. I believe they are truly beginning to \nunderstand what is at stake. I am told they have an open view and are \ndiscussing increased transparency with us at this time.\n  I strongly believe John Brennan will be part of the solution, and he \nwill be someone with whom we may work closely. He is well qualified. \nHis leadership and management are sorely needed, and he has strong \nbipartisan support in the committee.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote.\n  I yield the floor to the distinguished vice chairman from Georgia, \nwith whom it has been a great pleasure for me to work. We haven't \ndisagreed on a lot--we have disagreed on a few things--but I want the \nSenator to know I wish to continue our relationship.\n  We need to put together another authorizing bill. I look forward to \nworking with you, Mr. Vice Chairman, in that regard, and I thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I rise to explain why I am opposing \nthe nomination of John Brennan to be the next director of the Central \nIntelligence Agency.\n  First, I wish to say I thank the chairman for her kind comments. Let \nme state, as they had reiterated, we had 2 great years where we \naccomplished a great deal. She is one tough gentle lady, particularly \nwhen it comes to the national security of the United States.\n  It has been a pleasure to work with her. It is rare we ever disagree, \nbecause we both have the same end result in mind, which is to make sure \nAmerica and Americans are safe, secure, and the intelligence community \nis doing its part to ensure that happens.\n  Her leadership has just been amazing. We have produced authorization \nbills over each of the last 2 years--we have actually done four in 2 \nyears, which indicates there was a backlog of those authorization \nbills.\n  We have also reauthorized FISA and some other measures which equip \nour intelligence community as well as our law enforcement community \nwith the tools they need to combat terrorism. It is because of her \nleadership we have been able to do that.\n\n[[Page S1252]]\n\n  When we do disagree, it is kind of an unusual situation. We may have \ndisagreements in a bipartisan way within our committee. This is good. \nIt is healthy.\n  Sometimes Democrats will side with me or Republicans will side with \nthe chairman on an issue. This shows us people are voting with their \nhearts and what they think is in the best interests of America, not \nfrom a partisan standpoint.\n  I attribute that to the leadership of Chairman Feinstein because of \nher openness and for allowing bipartisan participation in a fine way.\n  I expect Mr. Brennan is going to be confirmed by the Senate. I would \nhave liked to have supported his nomination.\n  Unfortunately, I have significant concerns about several matters I \nsimply cannot put aside. If confirmed, Mr. Brennan will interact \nextensively with the Senate Intelligence Committee and in particular \nwith Chairman Feinstein and with myself as the vice chairman. He will \nhave many opportunities over the next several years to alleviate my \nconcerns, and I hope he does so. At this time, I cannot support placing \nhim in a position so vital to our national security mission.\n  During the confirmation process, including during the open hearing, \nI, along with other members, asked Mr. Brennan questions about the \nleaks of classified information, issues involving congressional \noversight, interrogation, and detention matters. His responses to many \nof these questions were very troubling and raised new concerns about \nMr. Brennan's judgment, his reluctance to commit to transparency with \nCongress, and ultimately his candor. Let me describe these concerns \nmore fully.\n  First, I am deeply disturbed by Mr. Brennan's responses to the \ncommittee regarding leaks of classified information, especially the \ndisclosure relating to the AQAP underwear bomb plot thwarted in May of \n2012. Mr. Brennan acknowledged to the committee he had told four media \ncommentators we had ``inside control'' of this bomb plot but disputed \nassertions that this disclosure resulted in the outing of a source. It \nis undeniable that the day after his disclosure, there were dozens of \nstories in the media stating the plot was foiled by a ``double agent'' \nor ``undercover agent'' who posed as a willing suicide bomber.\n\n  Mr. Brennan is poised to serve as the head of the Nation's leading \nspy agency where he will be privy to some of the most sensitive, if not \nall of the most sensitive, and highly classified operations being \nconducted by the intelligence community. That he apparently thinks he \ndid nothing wrong in this disclosure is very troubling, to say the \nleast.\n  We all know there is a big problem with leaks of classified \ninformation. We constantly deal with it in the committee and seek to \neliminate it. We cannot effectively hold accountable those responsible \nfor such leaks if a senior government official appears to shrug off his \nown damaging disclosure. I hope Mr. Brennan will reconsider his \nposition on this case and convey to those he expects to lead, not just \nin words but by his own example, the importance and necessity of \nmaintaining the secrecy he will be sworn to uphold.\n  Second, Mr. Brennan appears to be one of the architects of the \nadministration's current detention policy--or better stated, lack \nthereof. Since the President signed the Executive orders in 2009 \ndisbanding the CIA's detention and interrogation program and ordering \nthe closure of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility, many of us have \nbeen asking the administration to tell us what their new detention \npolicy is. Unfortunately, in the years since, we have seen a most \nunsatisfactory response play out in ways that I believe are detrimental \nto our collection of timely intelligence and, ultimately, to our \nnational security.\n  We have seen a disturbing trend of returning to the pre-9/11 days \nwhen bringing criminal charges against terrorists was a preferred \ncourse rather than long-term detention, which allows for greater \nintelligence collection. Because of this preference, the 2009 Christmas \nDay bomber, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, was read his Miranda rights 50 \nshort minutes after being pulled off the airplane that he had just \ntried to bomb. It took 5 weeks before he would again cooperate and no \none knows what intelligence might have been lost during that delay.\n  Somali terror suspect Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame was held on a naval \nship and interrogated for 60 days before being brought to a Federal \nCourt, all because the administration refused to send any more \ndetainees to Guantanamo Bay.\n  Even in the months before the Osama bin Laden raid, other than saying \nGuantanamo Bay was off the table, administration officials could not \ntell Congress where bin Laden would be held if he were captured.\n  Most recently, Ani al-Harzi, the only person held in connection with \nthe September 11, 2013, attacks in Benghazi that claimed the lives of \nfour Americans, was released by the Tunisians and is now roaming about \nfree because this administration would not take custody of him unless \ncriminal charges could be filed here in the United States.\n  Mr. Brennan is not merely a staunch and unapologetic advocate of this \nmisguided policy, he is the driving force behind it.\n  By criminalizing the war on terrorism, this administration has tied \nthe hands of our intelligence interrogators and appears to be avoiding \nopportunities to capture terrorists in favor of just killing them or \nrelying on our foreign partners to do our intelligence collection for \nus. Mr. Brennan disputes this assertion and testified that he was not \naware of any instance in which we had the opportunity to capture a \nterrorist but took a lethal strike instead. But his testimony on this \npoint appears to be particularly incredible. While reasonable minds may \ndiffer as to whether bin Laden should have been taken alive, to argue \nthat he could not have been taken alive and captured is not believable \nwhen his wives and children were left behind during the raid. The truth \nis the administration simply had no plan to capture him.\n  Now, while in this case of UBL, killing him probably was the best \noption, I believe that all options have to be on the table and utilized \nwhen appropriate; otherwise, we are potentially losing valuable \nintelligence. Yet Mr. Brennan's testimony before the Intelligence \nCommittee made clear that he is fully satisfied with how detainees are \ncurrently being handled and he is insistent the CIA remain out of the \ndetention business, even if it means we do not get direct or timely \naccess to detainees.\n  Thirdly, Mr. Brennan continues to insist that he conveyed to \ncolleagues at the CIA his personal objections to the CIA's \ninterrogation program. Yet not a single person has come forward to \nvalidate that claim. And Mr. Brennan still refuses to identify those \ncolleagues, in spite of several direct requests by the Intelligence \nCommittee. During the time in question, Mr. Brennan served as the CIA's \nDeputy Executive Director. We know he was privy to information about \nthe program, as we have seen numerous documents he received during and \nafter the interrogation of Abu Zubaydah.\n  It is not just reasonable, it is expected our intelligence \nprofessionals, especially those in leadership positions, will speak up \nwhen they see actions they believe are harmful to the agency or to \nothers. Yet by Mr. Brennan's own account, he stood by and let the CIA \nproceed down a path that he says he believed to be morally wrong and \nlikely to harm the long-term reputation of the CIA. This is not the \nmoral courage we expect, especially from those who are in a position to \ninfluence policy and operations. Unfortunately, Mr. Brennan continues \nto insist that his official silence was entirely appropriate, and I \ncould not disagree more.\n  I am also troubled by Mr. Brennan's apparent willingness to scuttle \nyears of belief in the value of the information obtained from the CIA's \ninterrogation program simply because the recent interrogation study \nconducted by the committee's majority staff found otherwise. In my \nview, the study is significantly flawed, not the least of which being \nthat not a single intelligence community witness was interviewed. I am \nworried about the impact Mr. Brennan's reversal will have on the morale \nof those current CIA employees who were involved in the program and \nwhose own judgment and reputations are called into question by this \nstudy.\n\n[[Page S1253]]\n\nI expect when the CIA returns its comments to the Intelligence \nCommittee about the accuracy of the report that Mr. Brennan will not \nlet his personal views of the program interfere with the professional \nassessment and analysis of CIA employees.\n  Finally, underlying all of these issues are the principles of candor \nand transparency with Congress. Our Nation was founded with three \ncoequal branches of government, each one providing checks and balances \nover the other in a manner specified in the Constitution. Federal law \nalso imposes explicit obligations on the intelligence community, such \nas keeping Congress fully and currently informed of significant \nintelligence activities. Ordinarily, during confirmation hearings, \nnominees unequivocally pledge their cooperation to Congress. Yet during \nhis confirmation process, Mr. Brennan refused to give affirmative \nanswers when asked to commit to such cooperation.\n\n  For example, he pledged to only give ``full consideration'' to any \nrequest that the committee be provided with raw intelligence, even \nthough the committee has been given such intelligence in the past. When \nasked about the inexcusable problems the committee has faced in trying \nto obtain documents about the Benghazi attacks, Mr. Brennan promised \nonly to try to reach an accommodation with the committee if a similar \nsituation should ever arise again. This is hardly encouraging. Some may \nsay that Mr. Brennan was simply being honest and not overpromising. I \nmight agree but for the fact this pattern of obstruction and lack of \ncooperation is becoming all too familiar to the committee, and Mr. \nBrennan has been involved in many of the decisions to withhold \ninformation from Congress.\n  For example, when the National Counterterrorism Center was created, \nCongress gave it specific responsibility to serve as the primary \norganization for strategic operational planning for counterterrorism. \nFor too long the committee has been refused full access to the \nresulting counterterrorism strategies, a decision for which Mr. Brennan \nis directly responsible. Rather than give us the strategies, the \nadministration has proposed an ``accommodation'' to simply brief the \ncommittee, but as of today we still have not been briefed, even though \nwe are asked to fund the strategies as well as their implementation.\n  There are other examples, including the absurd restrictions that were \nrecently placed by the White House on the review of the OLC opinions \nregarding lethal strikes on U.S. citizens. It is incomprehensible that \nCongress is being denied unfettered insight into matters concerning the \nintentional killing of U.S. citizens.\n  During the confirmation process, Mr. Brennan called on the \nIntelligence Committee to be the protector and defender of the CIA. \nThat is not an accurate description of the committee's role. Given the \nclassified nature of intelligence activities, the committee serves as \nthe eyes and ears of the American people, and our responsibility lies \nfirst and foremost to them. That is not to say we will not defend the \nCIA or the rest of the intelligence community against unjust attacks. \nWe will. But the committee's primary role is to conduct oversight, and \nwe cannot do that effectively without full cooperation from the \nintelligence community as well as the administration. I hope and expect \nMr. Brennan will now give us that cooperation rather than just what he \nviews as an accommodation.\n  The Director of the CIA has extensive and direct interactions with \nMembers of Congress, especially those of us on the Intelligence \nCommittee. During sensitive operations or times of crisis, the Director \nis often one of the first to communicate with Members. There have been \ntoo many instances in the past--under administrations of both parties--\nin which facts were withheld from Members or information was painted in \na particular light to suit messaging needs, as we saw with the Benghazi \ntalking points. That is simply unacceptable.\n  If confirmed as the CIA Director, Mr. Brennan's credibility must be \nunquestionable. We expect our spy agencies to be very good at hiding \nthe truth--but not with Congress. Here too Mr. Brennan will be an \nexample that all CIA employees look to, and his own standards of \nhonesty and credibility in dealing with Congress must be above and \nbeyond all reproach.\n  In conclusion, let me say that I have great confidence in the men and \nwomen at the CIA. Each and every day they give this Nation their best, \nand for that we are most grateful. They are the most professional, best \neducated, and best operational intelligence agency in the world. They \nare unbelievable men and women. My vote today is not a message to them \nnor is it an indication of the faith I have in the CIA. My vote is not \npersonal toward Mr. Brennan; rather, it simply reflects my belief that \nthe unauthorized disclosure of classified information is wrong \nregardless of whether you are on the front lines or you are an adviser \nto the President.\n  My vote also reflects my belief, especially at this time in our \nhistory, that the Director of the CIA should not support detention and \ninterrogation policies that are returning us to the pre-\n9/11 days of elevating criminal charges over intelligence collection. \nIn my view, Mr. Brennan is on the wrong side of both of these issues.\n  I also believe Congress must be an equal branch of the government, \nand this growing trend of refusing to cooperate with Congress must end. \nThe future and security of our country depends on all of us working \ntogether. To do that well, there must be transparency and honesty. If \nconfirmed as the CIA Director, Mr. Brennan has a tough job ahead of \nhim. If he abides by these principles, he will find his job will be \nmuch easier, as he will have earned the support and the trust of \nCongress, and the country will be better off for it. Assuming \nconfirmation of Mr. Brennan, he will have my full cooperation and \nsupport, I expect nothing less from him, and I hope that all of my \nconcerns will be put to rest.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. UDALL. Madam President, I am voting today for the confirmation of \nJohn Brennan to head the Central Intelligence Agency, CIA. He is a \nqualified nominee, and this position is too important to our national \nsecurity to remain vacant. Mr. Brennan is a 25-year veteran of the \nCentral Intelligence Agency. He has been an able adviser to President \nObama and part of some of the most important national security \ndecisions made during the last 4 years, including the raid that killed \nOsama bin Laden.\n  John Brennan should be confirmed as CIA Director. While I am \nsupporting his nomination, I want to make one thing clear: I am not \nsatisfied by the administration's limited disclosure of documents \noutlining the legal justification for an extraordinary authority--to \ntarget and kill American citizens in the course of counterterrorism \noperations. I first called on the administration to provide Congress \nwith its legal justification in September 2011. This was after a \nremotely piloted aircraft strike in Yemen killed Anwar al-Awlaki, an \nAmerican-born citizen. It was clear that al-Awlaki was a senior al-\nQaeda leader who posed a threat to American lives and deserved his \nfate. Nevertheless, we are a nation of laws. Congress has a vital \noversight role and shared national security responsibility. We are \nentitled access to full legal justifications for the President's \nauthority to target and kill an American citizen, and an explanation of \nwhat limits there are to that authority. These legal precedents are \nconstitutional issues of the highest order.\n  Last month, eleven United States Senators from both parties--\nincluding myself--sent a letter to the President requesting the release \nof all legal opinions justifying his authority to authorize the killing \nof American citizens as part of counterterrorism operations. There has \nbeen some progress. The Justice Department recently provided many of \nthese documents to members of the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence. However, I believe all of us in the Senate should be able \nto review these documents and fulfill our constitutional duty to \nconduct rigorous congressional oversight. While I will support John \nBrennan's confirmation today, I will continue to seek access to these \nlegal opinions so that the Senate can fulfill its responsibility.\n  Since the attacks on September 11, 2001, both Presidents Bush and \nObama have claimed expansive wartime executive authorities that have \nbeen supported in Justice Department legal\n\n[[Page S1254]]\n\nopinions. We saw this in the previous administration with the issues of \ndetainee interrogation methods and extraordinary renditions. While we \nrecognize the administration's authority to target and kill enemy \ncombatants, the targeting of American citizens in counterterrorism \noperations raises important constitutional questions. Congress shares \nconstitutional authority for national security matters, and we must be \nallowed to conduct oversight, which, in this case, includes reviewing \nthe legal justifications of the executive branch. When there is no \noversight, abuses can occur. And I believe that every administration \nmust be held accountable, regardless of which party controls the White \nHouse.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I continue to have some concerns about \nJohn Brennan, the President's nominee to serve as the next Director of \nCentral Intelligence.\n  First, I am troubled by Mr. Brennan's unwillingness to state \nunambiguously that waterboarding is torture. At his hearing before the \nIntelligence Committee, I asked Mr. Brennan this question three times \nwithout getting a direct answer:\n\n       SENATOR LEVIN: You've said publicly that you believe \n     waterboarding is inconsistent with American values. It's \n     something that should be prohibited, goes beyond the bounds \n     of what a civilized society should employ.\n       My question is this, in your opinion does waterboarding \n     constitute torture?\n       MR. BRENNAN: The attorney general has referred to \n     waterboarding as torture. Many people have referred to it as \n     torture. The attorney general, premiere law enforcement \n     officer and lawyer of this country.\n       And as you well know and as we've had the discussion, \n     Senator, the term ``torture'' has a lot of legal and \n     political implications.\n       It is something that should have been banned long ago. It \n     never should have taken place in my view. And, therefore, it \n     is--if I were to go to CIA, it would never, in fact, be \n     brought back.\n       SENATOR LEVIN: Do you have--do you have a personal opinion \n     as to whether waterboarding is torture?\n       MR. BRENNAN: I have a personal opinion that waterboarding \n     is reprehensible and it's something that should not be done. \n     And, again, I am not a lawyer, Senator, and I can't address \n     that question.\n       SENATOR LEVIN: Well, you've read opinions as to whether or \n     not waterboarding is torture. And I'm just--I mean, do you \n     accept those opinions of the attorney general? That's my \n     question.\n       MR. BRENNAN: Senator, you know, I've read a lot of legal \n     opinions. I've read an Office of Legal Counsel opinion in the \n     previous administration that said in fact waterboarding could \n     be used.\n       So from the standpoint of--of that, you know, I cannot \n     point to a single legal document on this issue.\n       But as far as I'm concerned, waterboarding is something \n     that never should have been employed and--and--and as far as \n     I'm concerned, never will be, if I have anything to do with \n     it.\n       SENATOR LEVIN: Is waterboarding banned by the Geneva \n     Conventions?\n       MR. BRENNAN: I believe the attorney general also has said \n     that it's contrary, in contravention of the Geneva \n     Convention.\n       Again, I am not a lawyer or a legal scholar to make a \n     determination about what is in violation of an international \n     convention.\n\n  After the hearing, I wrote to Mr. Brennan, pointing out that the \nPresident and senior administration officials, including both lawyers \nand non-lawyers, had concluded that waterboarding is torture. I asked \nthe question again, and again I got no direct answer. Mr. Brennan \nreplied:\n\n       You have asked for my position on whether waterboarding \n     constitutes `torture.' I understand and appreciate your \n     concern about the use of waterboarding by the prior \n     Administration. As I have made clear, I considered it \n     reprehensible then and now, and I have been an unwavering \n     supporter of the President's decision to ban its use. I have \n     also in the past stated that I believe waterboarding subjects \n     a person to severe pain and suffering, which is a common way \n     of defining `torture.' In addition, I have indicated in our \n     prior conversations and in my appearance before the Senate \n     Select Committee on Intelligence on February 7, the term \n     `torture' is a legal term, and I defer to the Attorney \n     General on matters of legal interpretation.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my letter to Mr. Brennan, \nand Mr. Brennan's response, be printed in the Record immediately after \nmy statement.\n  Second, I am troubled that, during the time that Mr. Brennan served \non the staff of the National Security Council--NSC, senior \nadministration officials consistently declined to provide Congress with \naccess to key legal memoranda relative to the use of targeted strikes \nagainst terrorist targets. Indeed, we were able to obtain access to \nthese memoranda only after it became clear that Mr. Brennan might have \ntrouble being confirmed if they were not made available.\n  Third, I am troubled that, during the time that Mr. Brennan served on \nthe NSC staff, senior officials in the intelligence community and the \nNSC staff apparently did not protest when U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice \nwas rejected for the position of Secretary of State on the basis of her \npublic comments on the Benghazi attacks, even though those comments \nwere based on talking points produced by, reviewed by, and edited by \nthose same officials.\n  My concerns about Mr. Brennan's unresponsiveness in these three areas \nare not sufficient to overcome the fact that he is qualified to be \nDirector of Central Intelligence. But it is my hope that he will learn \nfrom this confirmation process and be more responsive to congressional \nrequests for information in the future.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 20, 2013.\n     John O. Brennan,\n     Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and \n         Counterterrorism, The White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Brennan: I am troubled that, during your \n     confirmation hearing on February 7th, you chose not to \n     express your personal opinion as to whether waterboarding \n     constitutes torture. As the Senate Select Committee on \n     Intelligence continues to consider your nomination to be \n     Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), I would \n     appreciate your answers to the following questions for the \n     record.\n       In a November 2007 interview with CBS News, you stated, ``I \n     think it [waterboarding] is certainly subjecting an \n     individual to severe pain and suffering, which is the classic \n     definition of torture.''\n       Do you still hold that view today?\n       During his January 2009 confirmation hearing, Attorney \n     General Holder stated ``waterboarding is torture'' and \n     pointed out ``If you look at the history of the use of that \n     technique used by the Khmer Rouge, used in the inquisition, \n     used by the Japanese and prosecuted by us as war crimes. We \n     prosecuted our own soldiers for using it in Vietnam.''\n       During a press conference in April 2009, President Obama \n     said ``waterboarding violates our ideals and our values. I do \n     believe that it is torture. I don't think that's just my \n     opinion; that's the opinion of many who've examined the \n     topic.''\n       In another press conference in November 2011, President \n     Obama said ``Waterboarding is torture. It's contrary to \n     America's traditions. It's contrary to our ideals. That's not \n     who we are.'' He continued, ``If we want to lead around the \n     world, part of our leadership is setting a good example. And \n     anybody who has actually read about and understands the \n     practice of waterboarding would say that that is torture.''\n       Finally, during his February 2009 confirmation hearing to \n     be Director of the CIA, Leon Panetta said ``I believe that \n     waterboarding is torture and that it's wrong.''\n       Do you agree with President Obama, Attorney General Holder, \n     and Secretary Panetta that waterboarding constitutes torture?\n       I would appreciate your prompt response to these questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Carl Levin,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 25, 2013.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you Mr. Chairman, for your letter \n     of February 20, 2013.\n       You have asked for my position on whether waterboarding \n     constitutes ``torture.'' I understand and appreciate your \n     concern about the use of waterboarding by the prior \n     Administration. As I have made clear, I considered it \n     reprehensible then and now, and I have been an unwavering \n     supporter of the President's decision to ban its use. I have \n     also in the past stated that I believe waterboarding subjects \n     a person to severe pain and suffering, which is a common way \n     of defining ``torture.'' In addition, I have indicated in our \n     prior conversations and in my appearance before the Senate \n     Select Committee on Intelligence on February 7, the term \n     ``torture'' is a legal term, and I defer to the Attorney \n     General on matters of legal interpretation.\n       In closing, let me assure you that I fully appreciate that \n     the humane treatment of detainees is both a national security \n     and a humanitarian imperative. If I am confirmed to serve as \n     Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, I will never \n     approve the deployment of waterboarding under any \n     circumstance, and will do everything in my power to prevent \n     its use.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              John O. Brennan,\n\n                           Assistant to the President for Homeland\n                                    Security and Counterterrorism.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n[[Page S1255]]\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  I would first associate myself with the remarks of the Senator from \nGeorgia, Mr. Chambliss, who is the ranking member on the Intelligence \nCommittee and has looked into this much deeper than I would ever be \nable to. I appreciate the comments, the depth, and knowledge he has \nimparted on that.\n  So I would be in opposition of the nomination of John Brennan for CIA \nDirector.\n  The administration hasn't been forthcoming in answering a vitally \nimportant question of whether Americans could be killed by a drone on \nAmerican soil without first being charged----\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, would the Senator from Wyoming yield for a \nunanimous request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ENZI. I yield to the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the time on \nthe Republican side be limited to 15 minutes, with Senator Paul--and \nhow much time does my friend from Wyoming need?\n  Mr. ENZI. I asked for 10, but I could do it in 8.\n  Mr. REID. Eight minutes. Everybody else is gone.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the time on the Republican side be \nlimited to 15 minutes for Senator Paul and 8 minutes for Senator Enzi; \nthat following the use or yielding back of time on the nomination, the \nmandatory quorum under rule XXII be waived; the Senate proceed to vote \non the cloture motion; that if cloture is invoked, the Senate proceed \nto vote on confirmation of the nomination, without intervening action \nor debate; further, that the motion to reconsider be considered made \nand laid on the table, with no intervening action or debate; that no \nfurther motions be made in order to the nomination; that President \nObama be immediately notified of the Senate's action and the Senate \nthen resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there any objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I extend my appreciation. There is no one \nin the Senate who is more courteous and thoughtful than Senator Enzi, \nand I appreciate his assistance.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the Senator very much.\n  As I was mentioning, this administration hasn't been forthcoming in \nanswering the vitally important question of whether Americans could be \nkilled by a drone on American soil without first being charged with a \ncrime or being found guilty in a court of law. This should have been a \nvery simple answer.\n  White House Press Secretary Jay Carney stated today that the \nadministration does not have the authority to kill Americans on \nAmerican soil. That is great news. However, it shouldn't have taken a \nU.S. Senator 12 hours of nonstop talking for the administration to \nacknowledge the simple fact that it can't kill Americans on American \nsoil without a trial.\n  I wish to applaud Senator Paul's courage and conviction last night as \nhe stood on the Senate floor for nearly 13 hours defending our rights \nunder the Constitution. Senator Paul deserves recognition for standing \nup for the American people and bringing this issue to light. And it is \nan issue that I and many of my constituents in the State of Wyoming \nfind very troubling.\n  In fact, as I traveled around Wyoming a couple weeks ago, it became \nabundantly clear that people are very concerned over the \nadministration's disregard for constitutionally guaranteed individual \nrights.\n  Drones--unmanned aerial vehicles--have been made famous by their use \nin our war on terrorism. For a number of years these weapons have \nserved in operations in Iraq and Afghanistan with success. However, the \nuse of drones for both military and civilian purposes abroad and \ndomestically is increasing.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, the Federal Aviation \nAdministration predicts 30,000 drones will fill the skies in less than \n20 years. Although many of these uses will likely be for civilian \npurposes--disaster relief, border control, crime fighting, and \nagricultural crop monitoring--the use of drones raises new privacy and \ncivil liberty questions for U.S. citizens.\n  The first concern raised by the use of drones is how it may impact on \nour fourth amendment rights: U.S. citizens have the right to be free \nfrom unreasonable searches and seizures. Drones push the limits of what \ncould be considered reasonable. Courts generally recognize that U.S. \ncitizens have substantial protections against warrantless government \nintrusions into the home, and that the fourth amendment offers less \nrobust restrictions on public places. However, drones begin raising the \nquestion of what is reasonable when it comes to the expectation of \nprivacy in one's driveway or even backyard.\n  In a speech last night, Senator Paul reiterated additional \nconstitutional concerns that he has been seeking an answer on for a \nnumber of weeks. The administration just now responded, but it raises \nthe concern about the willingness of the White House to act \ntransparently.\n  When it comes to important matters of national security and \nconstitutional liberties, we should all be asking ourselves why it took \na U.S. Senator 12 hours of nonstop talking for the Department of \nJustice to acknowledge the simple fact that it cannot kill American \ncitizens on American soil without a trial. Senator Paul asked a \nstraightforward question and deserved a straightforward answer in a \ntimely manner. His question hit right at the heart of the fifth \namendment--rights as U.S. citizens, particularly ``no person shall . . \n. be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of \nlaw.''\n  The first response Senator Paul got back was everything short of a \nstraightforward answer. This administration did not rule out the \npossibility of using drones against Americans on U.S. soil. This is \nparticularly problematic, because our Constitution does not say the \nfifth amendment applies when the President or Attorney General thinks \nit applies. But it raises the concern about the willingness of \nthe White House to act transparently.\n\n  There is no reason why it should have taken so long for the \nadministration to acknowledge they don't have the authority to kill \nAmericans on U.S. soil without due process of law--specifically to deny \nsomeone the right to a judge and jury and a trial. The fifth amendment \nwas written with this particular form of government abuse in mind and \nit was more than appropriate for Congress to ask this question in its \noversight role.\n  We know, and our legal system recognizes, that you don't get due \nprocess when you are actively attacking our soldiers or our government. \nHowever, that wasn't the question Senator Paul posed. Congress needed \nclarification from the administration on this nomination. In order to \nbuild faith and confidence in our Nation's military and intelligence \ncommunity, we also need transparency and responsiveness in the \nquestions raised by Congress.\n  I will not be supporting John Brennan's nomination because of the \nlack of transparency and timeliness on this important matter, and the \nreasons given by the Senator from Georgia.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, yesterday I spent a considerable amount of \ntime on the floor talking about the idea of whether Americans are \nprotected by the fifth amendment always--whether you can be targeted \nfor drone strikes in America without your due process rights; whether \nyou get your day in court if you are accused of a crime in America. I \nasked this question directly to the President, and I am pleased to say \nthat we did get a response this morning. The response from the Attorney \nGeneral reads:\n\n       It has come to my attention that you have a question. Does \n     the President have the authority to use a weaponized drone to \n     kill an American not engaged in combat on American soil? The \n     answer to that question is no.\n\n  So it has taken a while, but we got an explicit answer. I am pleased \nwe did. And, to me, I think the entire battle was worthwhile, one, \nbecause we got to have a lot of discussion about when can drones be \nused--particularly when can a drone strike be used against an American \non American soil?\n  The reason this is important is often drones are used overseas toward \npeople\n\n[[Page S1256]]\n\nwho are not actively engaged in combat. I am not saying they are not \nbad people or they might have previously been in combat. But the thing \nis, we have to have a higher standard in our country. We can't have an \nallegation from the country that says you are an enemy combatant or \nthat you are associated with terrorism. That is an allegation.\n  If you are e-mailing somebody who is a relative of yours in the \nMiddle East, and they may or may not be a bad person, it doesn't \nautomatically make you guilty; if we label you an enemy combatant and \nsay you are guilty, you don't get your day in court, and that is just \nnot American.\n  We have many soldiers from my State, from Fort Campbell and Fort \nKnox, who fight overseas for us. They are fighting for the Bill of \nRights. They are fighting for the Constitution.

I am back to again urge my colleagues to wake up to \nthe stark reality of climate change. We often hear in this Chamber \ncolleagues extolling the virtues of the marketplace. Indeed, a fair and \nopen marketplace is the cornerstone of our economy. Markets work--not \nperfectly always but better than any other mechanism.\n  Paraphrasing Winston Churchill, one might say that markets are the \nworst form of setting prices and exchanging goods, except all of the \nother methods that have been tried. But markets only work when they are \nfair. Markets are not fair if the price of goods does not take all the \ncosts into account.\n  A grocery store, for instance, has to pay to have its garbage \nremoved. It has to build that garbage removal into its prices. And that \nis the right thing. That is the market working. If that grocery store \ncan recycle or compact or composite its trash and make removal cheaper \nand lower its prices, then that is right too. That is the market \nworking. But if a second grocery store down the street breaks the law \nand throws its garbage into the park next door and then competes with \nlower prices, that is not a market in proper operation. That is not a \nfair market. That is just one person cheating another.\n  If a factory makes a product and treats its waste, that is part of \nits cost. That is good. That is how it is supposed to be. If the \nfactory can figure out how to treat its waste more efficiently and \nlower prices, terrific. That is also the market at work. But a factory \ndown the river that breaks the law by dumping its waste into the river \nmay have better prices as a result, but that is not a fair market.\n  The value of open and fair markets is lost when people cheat, when \nthey offload their costs onto the general public. The garbage in the \npark, the waste in the river--the grocery store down the street and the \nfactory down the river--does not reduce costs; businesses just \noffloaded them onto their neighbor, onto the rest of us. They may \nactually have even made it more costly for everyone, but they have \nmanaged to impose that cost on the public.\n  There is even a word for these offloaded costs. They are \nexternalities, the harms that are caused that are external to the \ncompany. This is not complicated. It is econ 101. It is also law 101.\n  Seventy years ago a soda bottle exploded and injured the hand of a \nwaitress named Gladys Escola. Ms. Escola sued the bottler. The court \ndecision has been in most every law student's first-year classes ever \nsince.\n  In a famous concurrence, Justice Traynor ruled in the case of Escola \nv. Coca-Cola Bottling Company that the cost of Ms. Escola's injury \nshould fall on the bottler. His logic was simple and clear: They made \nthe bottle. If they did not have to pay for the injuries exploding \nbottles caused, they would just keep making exploding bottles. If you \nmade them responsible for the exploding bottles they made, they would \nhave a big incentive to improve their bottles and everyone would be \nsafer.\n\n  As Judge Traynor said 70 years ago, ``Public policy demands that \nresponsibility be fixed wherever it will most effectively reduce the \nhazards.''\n  This idea that you shouldn't be able to offload your costs and have \nthe park, the river, or Ms. Escola's hand pay the price is not new, and \nit is not unusual. Frankly, we see it in our own lives. It is also \nfairness 101, as well as econ 101 and law 101. You may not rake your \nlawn and throw the leaves over the fence into your neighbor's yard. The \nprinciple is the same--they are your leaves, and you clean them up.\n  What do soda bottles and yard work have to do with climate change? \nThe very same principle applies. We now know how much harm carbon \npollution is causing. We see the costs all around us in storm-damaged \nhomes, flooded cities, in drought-stricken farms, raging wildfires, in \ndying coral and disappearing fish, in shifting habitats and migrating \ndiseases, in changed seasons and rising seas, in vanishing glaciers and \nmelting icecaps. These are costs. In some cases they are economic \ncosts. People lose money. The owner of a ski lodge, for example, losses \nmoney when the ski season gets shorter and shorter. In some cases they \nare personal costs, such as not being able to take your granddaughter \nto the stream near where you grew up because it is dried up or the \nbeach island you used to explore as a kid because it is underwater. In \nsome cases the cost is life-and-death. Powerful storms and severe heat \nwaves take a deadly toll. These are real costs, and they come as a \nresult of carbon pollution.\n  These costs, however, are not factored into the price of the coal or \noil that is burned to release the carbon. The big oil companies and the \ncoal barons have offloaded those costs onto society.\n  There is nothing inherently wrong with producing energy. There is \nnothing inherently wrong with bottling soda or running a grocery store. \nWhat is wrong is when you knowingly pass on the cost of your exploding \nbottle, your waste disposal, or your carbon pollution to everybody \nelse.\n  Oil and coal companies have been sending carbon pollution into the \natmosphere since the Industrial Revolution. When these industries \nstarted, the risks were poorly understood. Today they know better. They \nknow what the harm is that they are doing, and they continue. When they \nlie and pretend those costs aren't out there--leaves? What leaves? \nThere is no garbage in the park. Your hand is just fine, Mrs. Escola--\nand when they pay people to lie and pretend those costs aren't out \nthere, well, that is all just flat wrong. And when they do it with fat \ncampaign contributions, slick lobbyists, and marauding super PACs, that \nmakes it worse. That is dirty pool. It is a market failure. It takes \nunfair advantage of competing energy sources that don't pollute so \nmuch, and it makes the competition between them unfair. The big oil \ncompanies and the coal barons are no different than the grocery store \ndumping its garbage in the park or the factory spilling its waste into \nthe river. They are not bearing the costs of their product, and they \nare cheating on their competitors. There is a right way to do it. They \nfigured out how to do it the wrong way and have other people pick up \nthe tab.\n  When it comes to carbon pollution, economists can estimate the true \ncost of dirty energy. It is often called the ``social cost of carbon.'' \nThe social cost of carbon includes the financial consequences of a \nchange in climate, such as property loss, increased health care costs, \nand loss of productivity that come with heat waves, drought, heavy \nrains, sea-level rise, habitat shifts, ocean warming, and \nacidification.\n  We recently learned from NOAA that their scientists predict that \nworldwide, the average summertime loss in labor capacity will double by \n2050, as the climate warms and periods of extreme heat become more \nfrequent and more intense, affecting labor-intensive outdoor work such \nas construction and farming. That is a social cost of carbon.\n  Of course, certain costs can be hard to predict. How do you calculate \nthe cost of an extinct species? What does it cost to leave to our \nchildren and grandchildren warmer, more acidic, less biodiverse oceans? \nThese calculations may not always be perfect, but that doesn't make the \ncosts any less real. For instance, in my home State of Rhode Island, \nthe costs to our fishermen of these changes is very real.\n  In the final tally, economists tell us that big carbon emitters are \nunloading a big cost onto the public and onto future generations. On \naverage, estimates of the social cost of carbon are about $48 per ton \nof carbon dioxide--$48 per ton that these big businesses dodge and that \nwe all pay for.\n\n[[Page S1258]]\n\n  Whatever the exact dollar amount, it is time for Congress to wake up \nand start discussing these very real costs. This is why I am working \nwith several colleagues to establish a fee on carbon pollution. We hope \nto have a draft framework soon to start this discussion. The idea is \nsimple: The big carbon polluters pay a fee to the American people to \ncover the cost of dumping their waste into our atmosphere and oceans--\nthe costs they now push off onto the rest of us, giving them unfair \nadvantage against their competitors.\n  I am pleased to participate in an effort to determine how best to \nassess a carbon pollution fee, how to protect American manufacturers \nfrom overseas competition that is cheating, and how to protect middle- \nand low-income families. It has been recognized by Republicans and \nDemocrats alike that a carbon pollution fee can reduce emissions and \nhelp make the market more efficient.\n  Last month Senator Sanders and Senator Boxer introduced related \nlegislation, and I commend them for their efforts. I also wish to \ncommend Senator Boxer this week, as chairwoman on the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, for beginning a regular appearance on the floor \nto draw this Chamber's attention to the dangers of carbon pollution. I \nhope more colleagues will join us in this important discussion. It is \neconomics 101, it is law 101, and it is fairness 101.\n  We have had enough sleepwalking. We have had enough silence. We have \nbeen warned by our national defense and intelligence communities, we \nhave been warned by the national academies, we have been warned by the \nGovernment Accountability Office, we have been warned by the \noverwhelming consensus of the scientific community, and, of course, we \nare hearing from millions of concerned Americans. It is time for this \nCongress to wake up and to put a price on carbon pollution that matches \nthe costs of carbon pollution. We won't get it done if we don't wake up \nto what is happening all around us.\n  I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/07/senate-section/article/S1258-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1258-S1259]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              JOB CREATION\n\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I rise today to reflect on how we can do \nwhat we so often say we want to do here in the Senate, and that is to \nhelp grow our American economy, to help create jobs for people from our \nhome States and from all across our country.\n  Yesterday, in my State of Delaware, I cohosted with my congressional \ncolleagues a job fair--a job fair where 1,300 people showed up. They \nshowed up early, stayed late, and interviewed for jobs with dozens of \nemployers. It was a personal reminder of how many people in my home \nState and across this great country of ours continue to look for work \nin this recovery that is still too slow. It is a reminder that one of \nour core challenges in the government is to do what we can to create an \nenvironment of opportunity and an environment of economic growth where \nthe people we work for have a shot at a better job.\n  One of the things I think we can do is to seize opportunities in the \nglobal markets, because 95 percent of consumers worldwide actually live \nbeyond our borders. As the chair of the Subcommittee on Africa, on the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee, I wanted to take some time today to \ndraw the attention of those in this Chamber and those who watch us \naround the country to the enormous opportunity presented by the \ncontinent of Africa.\n  Too often the impression of Africa in the American media and in the \npopular imagination is one that focuses on crises--on very real \nhumanitarian or security crises--in a few countries such as Somalia or \nMali or Congo. The average American, the average Member of this \nChamber, often overlooks a changed reality in the last decade--a decade \nin which 6 of the 10 fastest growing economies on Earth were in sub-\nSaharan Africa. In fact, studies show in the decades to come that \nnumber will simply increase to seven.\n  So what are we to make of all this opportunity in Africa? There are \nsome Fortune 500 companies--well-known household names such as Coca-\nCola, Caterpillar, DuPont-Pioneer--that have seen this opportunity and \nare taking advantage of it. They have recognized a vast and rapidly \ngrowing middle class in countries such as Nigeria, Chad, Ethiopia, and \nRwanda--not exactly household name countries and not exactly countries \nthe average American thinks of as having great world markets. But these \ncompanies have penetrated these markets and have recognized the \nopportunity that lies within.\n  It is important they have done that in no small part with help from \nthe U.S. Government. But as I held two hearings last year on this \nsubcommittee, and we met--the folks who work with me and myself--with \nfolks from think tanks and from companies and embassies, we realized we \ncould do this better; we could be more streamlined, more targeted, and \nmore focused in the work we are doing to take advantage of this \nremarkable opportunity.\n  It is also, frankly, in our strategic national interest for us to do \na better job of promoting U.S.-Africa trade, because as African \neconomies grow, it promotes free markets, democratic values, good \ngovernance, and stability in African countries. And by ensuring these \ncountries and the regions are stable and economically vibrant, we \nreduce the number of times we are drawn into humanitarian crises or \nsecurity crises and we improve the lot of hundreds of millions of \nAfricans who then go on in a virtuous cycle of building their trade \nrelationships with us.\n  As I have heard time after time, it takes firsthand personal \nengagement, it takes trade missions, it takes being there in person to \ngrasp the scope of the opportunities and to respond to them \nresponsibly. To do that well, it takes American diplomats and American \nrepresentatives there on the ground.\n  I won't soon forget meeting with a head of state in West Africa on a \ntrip with another Senator last year, and he asked us why America isn't \nmore present; why we don't send more trade delegations. He said, the \nBrazilians were here last week, the Indians are coming next week, and \nthe Chinese practically live here. As I have learned in the past year, \nwe are not doing enough as a country, as a government, as a Congress to \npromote investments and to see this opportunity for what it is.\n  Well, others have seen the opportunity and have seized it. Just to \npick one, China has actually exceeded the United States in terms of its \ntotal amount of exports to Africa of just a few short years ago. It has \nrocketed past us. The amount of foreign direct investment, the amount \nof export and import sales between China and Africa has grown \ndramatically. In fact, it has grown far more rapidly than the United \nStates. Even though we have longstanding and positive relationships, I \nfear we will wake up and discover that China has secured long-term \ncontracts that lock in their interests for decades and lock out \nAmerican companies, American employers, and American interests.\n  The World Bank recently predicted Africa is on the verge of a \ntakeoff, much as we saw happen in the Pacific Rim or in India or in \nCentral America over the last 20 years. In my view, we have to engage \nnow. When we grow our exports to parts of the world such as Africa, it \ngrows American jobs and high-quality jobs. Every billion dollars in \nexports we send overseas supports another 5,000 U.S. jobs. Last year, \nU.S. exports overseas supported more than 7 million jobs.\n  I salute the initiative of the President and the Department of \nCommerce which are focused on trying to do more business with Africa, \nand to do it more wisely. But, frankly, we need to do more. So as \nchairman of the Subcommittee on Africa of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, along with my friend and partner in the last Congress, \nSenator Johnny Isakson of Georgia, I convened a series of hearings to \nfocus on U.S. economic statecraft in Africa, to gather data, to have \nconversations, and to learn the facts about what we need to do to be \nmore competitive.\n\n[[Page S1259]]\n\n  I have released a report today called ``Embracing Africa's Economic \nPotential,'' which offers concrete recommendations to the U.S. \nGovernment--actions we can take right now, often in partnership with \nour private sector and with African governments, to strengthen our \ntrade relationship between the United States and the countries of sub-\nSaharan Africa. Anyone interested can download a copy at \ncoons.senate.gov/africa. Our report makes six recommendations, none of \nwhich involves spending a single dime of additional taxpayer money. In \nfact, it recommends ways to use what money we already spend on \nexploring and expanding into the market of Africa more efficiently \nand more effectively. So let's look at the recommendations in the \nreport.\n\n  First, it suggests we work with our African partners to remove \nbarriers to trade. Trade is impeded in Africa by everything from poor \ngovernance, unreliable infrastructure, complex tariffs, to corruption. \nThere are solutions the United States has already offered and there are \nefforts already underway by American businesses in partnership with our \nAfrican partners. In particular, USAID has set up regional trade hubs \nthat have done great work in breaking through barriers to growing \nregional trade. But we can and should do more.\n  Second, reauthorize and strengthen the African Growth and Opportunity \nAct, better known as AGOA, in advance of its expiration in 2015. This \nlegislation has been hugely successful in promoting African exports \ninto the American market and in building mutually reinforcing \nrelationships between the United States and the continent. I think we \ncan do even more to create jobs both in the United States and Africa by \ndiversifying products covered by AGOA, by improving its utilization by \nAfrican countries, by ensuring its benefits are mutually beneficial \nbetween our country and Africa, and by not waiting until the 11th hour \nto act on reauthorization.\n  Senator Isakson, and many in this Chamber, worked very hard to secure \nreauthorization of the third country fabric provision of AGOA last \nyear, but it took longer than it should have and it was more difficult \nthan it needed to be. It is my hope, working together with colleagues \nhere and in the House, we can get a jump on this in advance of 2015.\n  The third recommendation is to improve coordination between the many \nU.S. Government agencies working on trade policy to develop a \ncomprehensive strategy for investment in sub-Saharan Africa. As many as \n10 different Federal agencies are responsible for parts of trade policy \nand international development. So making sure they are working together \nefficiently is a good way for us to ensure success.\n  Fourth, we need to increase the presence of the U.S. Foreign \nCommercial Service in critical areas in the region. This chart shows \nthose countries that have the fastest growing economies, and these are \nthe few places where we have representatives from USAID or from the \nDepartment of Commerce.\n  In short, my point is there are many countries that have strongly \ngrowing economies where we have no representation. We have, in fact, \nzero U.S. Foreign Commercial Service officers in five of the six \ncountries listed here as having the fastest growing economies. In fact, \nwe only have six officers in all of sub-Saharan Africa, compared with \nsignificantly higher numbers in Asia and elsewhere.\n  I am concerned the reason for this is that Commerce isn't forward \nlooking in its resource allocation and doesn't see the scale of the \nopportunities in Africa. Although I was grateful that Acting Secretary \nBlank made a trade mission trip to Africa late last year, that was the \nfirst time in a decade a U.S. Secretary of Commerce had made a visit to \nthe continent, and there is much more we need to do.\n  Our fifth recommendation is to bolster support for the agencies that \nfinance and support U.S. commercial engagement overseas, particularly \nin Africa. These agencies, the Export-Import Bank--known as Ex-Im--and \nthe Overseas Private Investment Corporation, known as OPIC--issue \npolitical risk insurance and help with financing, particularly \nfinancing to markets where they don't yet have a robust banking sector \nand where the rule of law is less certain. These agencies are smart \ninvestments that actually generate real returns for American taxpayers \nand contribute to the bottom line for the American Federal Government.\n  Our sixth and last recommendation is to engage the community of \nAfrican-born individuals who now live in the United States--the so-\ncalled diaspora communities--to strengthen economic ties. Who better to \nserve as an American representative of the system, and who better to \ntake on the spirit of entrepreneurship and penetrate African markets \nthan those born, raised, or connected to African countries and who have \nbeen educated in the United States and have been successful here and \nnow have the resources and opportunity to reconnect with their \ncountries of origin or the countries of their families. We can and must \ndo more to strengthen these resources, and I was pleased to get a \nchance to speak at the second annual diaspora conference hosted by the \nDepartment of State last year. It is my hope we will invest further in \nthis untapped resource--something that distinguishes the United States \nfrom our competitors in other parts of the world who do not have the \nblessing of a strong diaspora community as we do.\n  So in short, each of these six recommendations will get us closer to \nour goal of a more vibrant, a faster growing and more sustainable U.S.-\nAfrica trade relationship. But the key to implementing these \nrecommendations in an integrated way is to listen to each other, to \nembrace them, and move forward across the several committees of \njurisdiction, across the 10 different Federal agencies and entities, \nand to develop a coordinated plan for taking advantage of this \nremarkable part of the world that can also grow American jobs.\n  We have an opportunity to seize this moment and to promote economic \nengagement, to strengthen the American economy and to advance the \nvalues of freedom and democracy around the world. Make no mistake, \nthough, today we are falling short. We are failing to grasp this \nopportunity as strongly and clearly as our competitors are. We can act \non a number of smart legislative proposals, including the Increasing \nAmerican Jobs Through Greater Exports to Africa Act, which I \ncosponsored in the last Congress along with Senators Durbin and \nBozeman, and which I hope we will reintroduce shortly to establish a \ncomprehensive U.S. strategy for public-private investment, trade, and \ndevelopment in sub-Saharan Africa. At the same time, the administration \ncan, and I hope will, do more to coordinate strategy and use our \nresources effectively.\n  The report we have issued today I hope will be seen as a wake-up \ncall. If we fail, we will wake up 10 years from now and we will see \njobs and opportunities we might have grasped taken by our competitors. \nIt is my hope we will not watch these opportunities pass us by but \nwill, instead, take advantage of this remarkable moment and this great \nopportunity.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/07/senate-section/article/S1259-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1259-S1260]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I would like to add to the remarks I \nmade a moment ago about climate change to respond to some statements \nthat have been made recently on the Senate floor on this subject.\n  As those of us who are advocates in the cause of doing something \nabout climate change know, the polluters and their advocates have an \nadvantage: They only have to create doubt, they only have to create \ndebate in order to create delay and allow the polluters to continue \nmaking money at the expense of the rest of us. That means the \narguments, frankly, don't have to be true; they just have to be made. \nThen they can say there is still debate, then they can say there is \nstill controversy, both of which are self-fulfilling prophecies.\n\n[[Page S1260]]\n\nBut they are not real, and some of what has been said is pretty \nflagrant.\n  One of the lead Senate deniers came to the floor the other day to \nchallenge President Obama. President Obama said this in his State of \nthe Union Address:\n\n       But the fact is, the 12 hottest years on record have all \n     come in the last 15. Heat waves, droughts, wildfires, and \n     floods--all are now more frequent and intense.\n\n  My denier colleague quoted him. And to quote my colleague, he said--\nreferring to the President:\n\n       The President said, yes, it's true that no single event \n     makes a trend. But the fact is that the 12 hottest years on \n     record have all come in the last 15. That is just flat wrong.\n\n  So why don't we just take a look and see where the President got his \ninformation so we can put this into some perspective. The President got \nhis information from NASA. Maybe people in this body are more capable \nthan NASA at dealing with scientific things, but when you consider that \nNASA has put an explorer on the surface of Mars, I think they are \nentitled to some credence about basic science. And they agree--in fact, \nReto Ruedy, a program manager at the Goddard Institute, has laid out \nthe actual years. Some of these are statistical ties because they are \nequally hot.\n  The No. 1 and 2 hottest years, according to them, are 2010 and 2005. \nThe No. 3 through 8 hottest years are 2007, 1998, 2002, 2003, 2006, and \n2009. The 9th through 12th hottest years recorded are 2012, 2011, 2001, \nand 2004. If you go to the 13th year, it is 2008. The 14th and the 15th \nare 1997 and 1995. All of the 15 hottest years on record are 1995 and \nthereafter. The top 12, all have happened 1998 and thereafter.\n  It is not just NASA's data set that confirms this. NOAA also looks at \nthe same information. They come at it a little bit differently--and \nthey do have a difference. I will concede that. NOAA considers 2012 to \nbe the 10th warmest year on record instead of the 9th. That is the \ndifference between NASA and NOAA. And we are talking about records \ngoing back to 1880, so it is a broad data set.\n  If you look at NOAA's data, it actually shows that 14 of the past 15 \nyears were the hottest on record. Ditto the National Center for \nAtmospheric Research.\n  Of course, as many of us know, in political life there is a group out \nthere called Politifact that takes a look at claims that are made in \nthe public debate and politics, and they assign them ``true'' to \n``pants on fire.'' They looked at the President's claim that the 12 \nhottest years on record have come in the last 15 years. They gave the \nPresident a ``true.'' Indeed, they said:\n\n       Obama was actually overcautious in his statement, so we \n     rate his statement true.\n\n  So we have one denier--a Senator--against NASA, against Politifact, \nagainst NOAA, and against the National Center for Atmospheric Research. \nI think it is pretty clear who has the facts on their side.\n  This is the other statement that was made:\n\n       I don't think anyone disagrees with the fact that we \n     actually are in a cold period that started about 9 years ago.\n\n  Let's look at the facts. This is the temperature data. The green \nrepresents the actual data. The red line is a statistically derived \nmean of all that information. It is something that is done \nmathematically. It is not amenable to argument; it is not amenable to \ndebate. You can do it using different methods, but it is clear from \nthat data set that we are in fact in a warming period, not a cooling \nperiod.\n  So how do you get to say that in 9 years we are in a cooling period? \nWell, if you go back a few years here, you see there are some high \npoints, and if you pick just those high points and then you go forward \n9 years, you can draw a graph that goes down. But you have to be very \ncareful how you pick your points to create that illusion. You can \nactually do it, if you want, repeatedly in the data. You could pick \nthis point and have it go down. You could pick this point and have it \ngo down. You could pick this point and have it go down, and this, and \nthis.\n  For each one of those points, you could say: Well, during this \nperiod, it was actually a cold period. It was actually a cooling \nperiod.\n  But when you look at the actual information and when you look at the \nstatistically driven mean that cuts through all the data, it is pretty \nclear that to try to look at it this way is playing tricks with the \ndata. It is playing games and trying to fool people. It is twisting and \ndistorting the data.\n  I think that is a less-than-honest application of these facts. So if \nthat is the sort of misleading statistical trick the polluters and \ntheir advocates have to resort to, that is just another reminder that \nit really is time for us to wake up and get to work on this. There is \nno credible scientific debate over what carbon pollution is doing to \nour atmosphere and our oceans, and it is pretty darned clear that it is \nwarming--and warming pretty fast.\n  I appreciate the opportunity for this clarification.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nPolitifact article that I referred to in my remarks be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nBarack Obama Says the 12 Hottest Years on Record Have Come in the Last \n                                15 Years\n\n       During his State of the Union address, President Barack \n     Obama touted the country's progress in reducing carbon \n     pollution emissions but added that recent advances in fuel \n     efficiency and renewable energy have not done enough to curb \n     climate change.\n       ``For the sake of our children and our future, we must do \n     more to combat climate change,'' Obama said. ``Now, it's true \n     that no single event makes a trend. But the fact is, the 12 \n     hottest years on record have all come in the last 15. Heat \n     waves, droughts, wildfires, floods--all are now more frequent \n     and more intense.''\n       In 2012, the country experienced severe weather threats \n     including drought, a devastating Hurricane Sandy and severe \n     thunderstorms. We decided to fact-check whether the 12 \n     hottest years on record have all come since 1998.\n       The White House directed us to NASA's Goddard Institute for \n     Space Studies, which tracks global surface temperatures. The \n     institute concluded that 2012 was the ninth-warmest year on \n     record, with 2010 and 2005 being the all-time highs.\n       For the contiguous United States, 2012 was the country's \n     warmest year yet. It beat the previous record by one degree \n     Fahrenheit.\n       Reto Ruedy, a program manager at the Goddard Institute, \n     told PolitiFact that the institute's data produces the \n     following ranking of hottest years. Items on the same line \n     are statistically tied.\n       1-2: 2010, 2005\n       3-8: 2007, 1998, 2002, 2003, 2006, 2009\n       9-12: 2012, 2011, 2001, 2004\n       13: 2008\n       14: 1997\n       15: 1995\n       This analysis shows that 13 of the warmest years have \n     occurred in the past 15 years. Alternately, one could say \n     that 12 of the warmest years came in the last 13.\n       We see a few other issues to note.\n       The NASA data set isn't the only one available. The \n     National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration also analyzes \n     global surface temperatures using its own methodology. The \n     two measurements diverge somewhat--NOAA considers 2012 the \n     10th-warmest year on record since records began in 1880, \n     rather than the ninth.\n       However, NOAA's data for land and ocean temperature \n     anomalies shows that 14 of the past 15 years were the hottest \n     on record.\n       There are other ways one could measure ``hottest years.'' \n     Kevin Trenberth, a scientist with the National Center for \n     Atmospheric Research, agreed with the 13-of-15 calculation. \n     But he added that the NASA and NOAA values refer to global \n     mean surface temperature. ``One could define `hottest' in \n     other ways, such as by how much Arctic sea ice there is,'' he \n     said.\n\n\n                               Our ruling\n\n       Obama said, ``The 12 hottest years on record have all come \n     in the last 15.'' Data from NASA shows 13 of the hottest \n     years on record have come in the last 15, and by a different \n     data set produced by NOAA, 14 of the hottest years on record \n     have come in the last 15. Obama was actually over-cautious in \n     his statement, so we rate his statement True.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/07/senate-section/article/S1260-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1260-S1261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO RAYMOND DAVIS\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \ndistinguished public service of Raymond Davis, who for 40 years has \nserved the U.S. Senate, first for the Architect of the Capitol and \nlater as a technical assistant and information specialist in the Office \nof Public Records for the Secretary of the Senate. His institutional \nknowledge and understanding of filing processes and disclosure laws \nhave been invaluable in helping the Senate fulfill its\n\n[[Page S1261]]\n\ncommitment and obligation to openness and transparency, while his kind \nand helpful character has been a benefit to everyone in the Senate \ncommunity.\n  Raymond first worked for the Architect of the Capitol where he was \ntasked with jobs from busing tables at lunchtime to flying flags over \nthe Capitol Building. He was soon hired as a clerk by the Secretary of \nthe Senate and would go on to serve in the Office of Public Records \ntaking on responsibilities ranging from lobbying registration to \ncampaign finance disclosure.\n  During his many years of service, Raymond always put customer service \nfirst. Candidates who filed a Senate campaign report, and Senators and \nstaff members who filed a financial disclosure report or other Senate \nreport, encountered Raymond's efficient and very capable assistance. \nOver the years, he also assisted those filing lobbying registrations \nand reports. The public, the press and researchers have all benefitted \nfrom his knowledge and guidance in the Office of Public Records.\n  Raymond is known throughout the Senate community, to those who \nfrequent his office and to those who look forward to his cheerful \ngreeting each day in the halls, as a friendly and welcoming colleague. \nAn avid sportsman, Raymond was a slugger for the Senate Document Room \nsoftball team and a regular at Senate coed football and Capitol Hill \ntouch football league games.\n  Through his deft knowledge and faithful customer service, Raymond has \nsignificantly contributed to the functioning of this institution. He \nhas been an important mentor to others, helping to train staff and pass \non the knowledge he gained in four decades of work.\n  The Senate can be proud of Raymond Davis' legacy of public service. \nWe are grateful for his many contributions, and we wish him well in \nretirement and all his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/07/senate-section/article/S1261-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           VOTE EXPLANATIONS\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado.

Mr. President, this year marks 65 years since the State \nof Israel was born, and I wish to speak today about the importance of \nthat occasion and the celebration that will take place in communities \nall across the world.\n  Our country has a deep friendship with Israel, dating back to just 11 \nminutes after its creation on May 14, 1948, when President Harry Truman \nbecame one of the first world leaders to recognize Israel's \nindependence.\n  Our two nations have always been friends and allies in our struggle \nto make the world a safer place. I am proud of our long friendship and \nour shared values.\n  When Israel was founded, the Jewish people finally had a home. The \nnew State provided not only a refuge to Jews who survived the \nunprecedented horrors of the Holocaust, but also a place to begin anew. \nEven in such a tough and unforgiving climate, the Jewish people knew \nthey could build a country that could help change the world.\n  The Walk the Land 65 project is the perfect way to celebrate Israel's \nanniversary. The theme of this year's walk is to celebrate life, and \npeople all across the world will join together and walk through their \ncommunities by honoring Israel's gifts to the world, especially those \nregarding life: creating life, sustaining life, saving life, preserving \nlife, enhancing life, protecting life, improving life, cherishing life, \nnurturing life and beautifying life.\n  As a collaboration between the Afikim Foundation, the World Zionist \nOrganization and the Israel Ministry of Public Diplomacy and Diaspora \nAffairs, Walk the Land 65 is showing the world just how important \nIsrael's contributions to the world really are.\n  I am pleased to see walks taking place across my home State of \nMichigan: in Flint, Grand Rapids and Metro Detroit.\n  Every religious, cultural and ethnic group across the State is an \nimportant thread in Michigan's rich cultural fabric. We in Michigan are \nproud of our Jewish communities and their contributions to our State.\n  One important attribute that the people of Israel share with the \npeople of the United States is our system of values. Both countries are \nlands of freedom and democracy. While these two countries were formed \nat very different times, they both uphold and honor critical freedoms--\nfreedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of association, freedom \nof the press, and government by the consent of the governed.\n  This foundation has led to a country that truly celebrates life and \nworks to improve life across the world. Israel began in a desert, but \ntoday, it is a fountain of culture, innovation and industry.\n  This didn't happen overnight, though. David Ben-Gurion and the \nfounders of Israel had a great vision for their country. They built \nIsrael from scratch, turning the arid land into fertile farms and \nthriving cities.\n  Israel is a leader in innovation for creating, sustaining, preserving \nand saving lives through its work in agriculture and health care. It is \nalso enhancing life through its innovation in technology, alternative \nenergy and so many other fields.\n  Today, Israel is among the top three countries in the world in terms \nof patents per capita, and number one in terms of startup businesses \nper capita. Israel is also a leader in clean energy research and \ndevelopment, and is helping to create the power the world needs.\n  The Israeli people are leaders in celebrating life, as evidenced by \ntheir humanitarian works and their pioneering medical advances that \nwill save and improve people's lives, and they are making a real \ndifference throughout the world.\n  Israel continues to serve as a shining model of democratic values, \nand an important presence in the region; it shows the world that \ndemocracy can survive--and--thrive anywhere people wish to be free.\n  I am proud of our friendship, and I am proud to help celebrate \nIsrael's 65th Anniversary with the Walk the Land 65 Project.\n  Congratulations to the people Israel and everyone involved in this \nwonderful project.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/07/senate-section/article/S1261-3", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1261-S1262]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  OBSERVING INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about International \nWomen's Day. International Women's Day is an occasion to honor and \npraise women for their accomplishments and to celebrate women who are \nmaking a difference, both here in America and around the world. Already \nthis year, we have seen advances for women in the United States. In \nJanuary, former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta announced that women \nin the military can now join their male colleagues on the front line. \nAmerica's military is the greatest in the world and it has been made \nstronger with the promise of equal opportunity for women and men. Last \nmonth, we reauthorized the Violence Against Women Act, which provides \nvictims of domestic violence with the services they desperately need.\n  We need to ensure that women across the world, not just in the United \nStates, have the same liberty to determine the scope of their own lives \nand futures. Unfortunately, in far too many nations women face \nextraordinary obstacles. A woman's ability to earn a sustained income \nis severely limited by\n\n[[Page S1262]]\n\ncultural norms and lack of opportunity, which explains why women \nrepresent nearly 70 percent of the world's poor. And if extreme poverty \nand destitution weren't enough, women around the world are under \nattack. Worldwide, 1 in 3 women will experience some form of violence \nin her lifetime. Women and girls in emergencies, conflict settings, and \nnatural disasters often face extreme violence. The World Health \nOrganization has reported that up to 70 percent of women in some \ncountries describe having been victims of domestic violence at some \nstage in their lives.\n  When we discuss the issues of poverty and violence against women, we \ncannot think of them in isolation. They work in tandem, feeding off of \none another. Violence against women and girls is both a major \nconsequence and cause of poverty; the two go hand-in-hand. Violence \nprevents women and girls from getting an education, going to work, and \nearning the income they need to lift themselves and their families out \nof poverty.\n  I believe in the power of women to change the world, and empowering \nwomen is one of the most critical tools in our tool box to fight \npoverty and injustice. Integrating the unique needs of women into our \ndomestic and international policies is critical. Decades of research \nand experience prove that when women are able to be fully engaged in \nsociety and hold decisionmaking power, they are more likely to invest \ntheir income in food, clean water, education, and health care for their \nchildren. Investment in women creates a positive cycle of change that \nlifts women, families, and entire communities out of poverty.\n  In January, President Obama issued a memorandum on the coordination \nof policies and programs to promote gender equality and empower women \nglobally. This memo recognizes that coordinating gender equality and \nempowering women is critical to effective international assistance \nacross all sectors such as food security, health care, governance, \nclimate change, and science and technology.\n  Our Nation has the potential to be a true leader in empowering women \nacross the globe, ending gender-based discrimination in all forms, and \nending violence against women and girls worldwide. And on this \nInternational Women's Day, let us join together to continue to fight \nfor the rights of women both at home and abroad.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/07/senate-section/article/S1262-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1262]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 REMEMBERING JUDGE LEONARD L. WILLIAMS\n\n Mr. COONS. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute Judge \nLeonard L. Williams, a great Delawarean who passed away this past \nweekend at the age of 78. Judge Williams was a respected attorney and \njudge in Wilmington, as well as a pioneer for civil rights and racial \nequality in our State. It is a fitting tribute the flags in Wilmington \nwere lowered to half-staff in his honor.\n  Judge Williams was a towering figure in Delaware history, but to my \nwife, Annie, and me, he was first and foremost a beloved neighbor. \nJudge Williams lived down the street from us on Woodlawn Avenue and was \nalways quick with a honk and a wave when he drove by in his truck. We \nwill miss his fellowship and his kindness.\n  When he passed away this weekend, I was in Alabama attending the \nFaith and Politics Institute's Congressional Civil Rights Pilgrimage \nled by Representative John Lewis. There is poetry in the timing, as \nJudge Williams' lifetime commitment to the civil rights movement \ncontinually reminded me that our country's great promise cannot be \ntruly realized until full equality is achieved.\n  In his youth, Judge Williams worked as a clerk at a store on Market \nStreet in Wilmington. One day he witnessed a robbery and needed to \nappear in municipal court to give his testimony. When he entered, he \nwas told ``Coloreds'' could not sit on the left side of the room, that \narea was reserved for whites. Years later, Leonard Williams would \nbecome a judge, presiding over that very courtroom.\n  Judge Williams not only lived through the civil rights movement, he \nhelped shape it.\n  He grew up in a large family in Wilmington and attended primary and \nsecondary school before Brown v. Board of Education and the \ndesegregation of the Wilmington public school system. Before 1950, \nblack students could not attend the University of Delaware. A landmark \ncivil rights lawsuit changed that and enabled Judge Williams to attend \nUD on a football scholarship. He became one of the first black students \nto graduate from the University of Delaware and entered law school at \nGeorgetown University. When he was admitted to the Delaware Bar in \n1959, he was only the fifth African American attorney in Delaware's \nhistory.\n  As a young lawyer, Judge Williams partnered with Louis Redding, \nDelaware's first black attorney and the very lawyer who argued Parker \nv. University of Delaware, the case which opened UD to black students. \nAt the time, African Americans were denied access to restaurants, \ntheaters, and other places of public accommodation in Delaware and \naround the country. One day in 1958, William Burton, a member of the \nWilmington City Council, entered the Eagle Coffee Shoppe but was \nrefused service. The restaurant, like many in Wilmington at the time, \nwould not serve African-Americans. Because the restaurant leased space \nfrom the Wilmington Parking Authority, Burton filed suit in the \nDelaware Court of Chancery against the restaurant and the parking \nauthority. Judge Williams and Louis Redding took the case, ultimately \nwinning a judgment in the Supreme Court that private discrimination on \nState owned property violated the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. \nConstitution.\n  Judge Williams' involvement in that case changed the course of \nDelaware history. Yet he never saw himself as a hero, just as somebody \ntrying to serve his community. All of us will miss him deeply. We will \nkeep Judge Williams' wife, Andrea, and his three children, Leonard Jr., \nDena, and Garrett, in our prayers as we grieve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/07/senate-section/article/S1262-2", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1262-S1263]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REMEMBERING ZORA BROWN\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life, \nlegacy and service of Zora Brown. Zora, who passed away March 3, 2013 \nat the age of 63, was a forceful advocate for cancer research and \nbreast cancer awareness. As a three-time breast and ovarian cancer \nsurvivor, Ms. Brown turned her experience into a lifetime of tireless \nwork to help others affected by cancer.\n  I had the honor and pleasure of meeting Zora last summer when she \nparticipated in a Senate Cancer Coalition forum focused on breast \ncancer. At the forum, she spoke poignantly and clearly about the impact \nof breast and ovarian cancer on her family, and on the African-American \ncommunity. Zora's message was not one of despair, but rather one of \nhope and perseverance. She compared her own experience with cancer to \nthat of her grandmother and great-grandmother, and highlighted how \nrecent advances in cancer research gave her knowledge and treatment \noptions that the other women in her family never had.\n  Throughout her career, Zora founded and was associated with countless \norganizations dedicated to the fight against cancer. After her first \ndiagnosis with breast cancer in 1981, Zora founded the Breast Cancer \nResource Committee, an organization dedicated to lowering the breast \ncancer mortality rate among African Americans. She later founded and \nserved as Chairperson of Cancer Awareness Program Services, CAPS, \nproviding comprehensive educational and prevention programs focusing on \ncancers affecting women. In 1991, President Bush appointed her to the \nNational Cancer Advisory Board of the National Cancer Institute, which \nhelps steer the institute's policy. She served on the board until 1998. \nDue in part to Zora's influence and persistent advocacy, Congress \nappropriated $500,000 for breast and cervical screening for low-income, \nuninsured inner city women. In addition, she has been a part of the \nAmerican Association for Cancer Research, the U.S. Conference of \nMayors' Cancer Awareness Campaign, and the Board of Health in her \nhometown of Oklahoma City.\n  With Zora's passing we have lost a great leader and advocate in the \nfight against cancer. Her passion, grace, and ability to connect with \nothers were\n\n[[Page S1263]]\n\nqualities that made a lasting impact. It is now up to all of us to \ncarry on her legacy and work toward our shared dream of conquering \ncancer for everyone. It was an honor to spend time with her and hear \nthrough her eloquent words and fighting spirit how cancer touched her \nlife and how she chose to use her personal experience to make a true \ndifference in our world. My heartfelt condolences go out to her family \nand loved ones.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/07/senate-section/article/S1263-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1263-S1264]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 LONE PEAK HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL TEAM\n\n Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate and \nexpress my great pride and admiration for the young men of the Lone \nPeak High School basketball team.\n  On Saturday, March 2, 2013, Lone Peak won the Utah State High School \nbasketball championship for the fifth time in 7 years. Now that alone \nis a great accomplishment. However, in addition to winning another \nState championship, the Lone Peak Knights are ranked as the best high \nschool team in the country by the Web site Max Preps.\n  This team has flown somewhat under the radar to achieve their top \nranking. Indeed, not many people expected a team from Utah to dominate \nlike they have.\n  But the Knights have not shied away from competition. No, they have \ntraveled around the country for the past couple of years playing some \nof the best high school basketball teams in the Nation.\n  For example, this season they traveled to Chicago to play in the \nChicago Elite Classic and defeated powerhouse Proviso East by a score \nof 84 to 46. Proviso East is currently 25 to 3 and undefeated in their \nChicago conference.\n  Lone Peak then played in the City of Palms Tournament in Ft. Meyers, \nFL, winning their first three games before suffering their only defeat \nof the season at the hands of Montverde Academy, which is another \nnationally ranked high school team.\n  It needs to be said that there is a difference between Lone Peak and \nteams like Montverde. Lone Peak draws its students and players from \nwithin its school boundaries in Highland and Alpine, UT. Montverde is a \ncollege prep school that recruits players from all over the country to \ncome and play basketball.\n  Lone Peak again travelled out of the State of Utah this season and \ndefeated Wesleyan Christian Academy--another private school that \nrecruits basketball players--in the feature game at the Under Armor \nBrandon Jennings Invitational in Brookfield, MA.\n  The Knights' final foray outside the State of Utah was in mid-January \nwhen they defeated Archbishop Mitty from San Jose, CA, at the Spaulding \nHoopball Classic in Springfield, MA. That game was televised by ESPN \nand Lone Peak won by a decisive score of 81 to 46.\n  This top-ranked team has been led by the trio of Nick Emery, Eric \nMika, and T.J. Haws. But they are more than just three players. They \nare a full team that has worked together for many years under head \ncoach Quincy Lewis. Now in his 10th year as the head coach at Lone \nPeak, Coach Lewis has a proven track record of leading his players, not \nonly to victories on the basketball court but also to becoming fine \nyoung men in the community.\n  Last week, before the Knights won the State championship, he was \nnamed the Naismith national coach of the year. I want to congratulate \nhim on this honor.\n  Another thing that is different about this team is that many of these \nyoung men will give up 2 years of their lives and serve missions for \nthe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. Nick Emery has already \nreceived his mission call and will leave for Germany shortly after high \nschool graduation. Talon Shumway has been recruited to play college \nfootball as a receiver but will serve a mission first.\n  It takes a lot of faith and dedication to put such a promising career \non hold for 2 years. Having served such a mission myself I know that \nthere is no time for basketball or football when you are in the mission \nfield.\n  The Lone Peak Knights have finished the season as the top high school \nbasketball team in the United States, something that has never been \ndone by a school from the State of Utah. It might not be done again. \nBut I have to say that there are young people all over my home State \nthat have been inspired by this team and will want to follow in their \nfootsteps.\n  Once again, Mr. President, I want to congratulate the Lone Peak \nKnights on a wonderful season. It has been quite something to follow \nthis story all season long, and I know that my admiration is shared by \nmany throughout my State and, indeed, throughout the country.\n  As I mentioned, the three leaders on this team get most of the \nheadlines, but their success has really been a team effort and they all \ndeserve recognition. In addition to Emery, Haws, and Mica, the Lone \nPeak roster includes the following players: McKay Webster, Connor \nToolson, Zach Frampton, Brooks Goeckeritz, Chandler Goeckeritz, Talon \nShumway, Braden Miles, Dylan Hedin, Braxton Bruni, Jantzen Allphin, \nMarcus Acton, and Spencer Curtis.\n  Mr. President, the New York Times published an article by Dan Frosch \nlast week that highlighted the achievements of these young men. I ask \nunanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 26, 2013]\n\n                     Out West, Reaching the Summit\n\n                            (By Dan Frosch)\n\n       Highland, UT.--Here, among a string of quiet Mormon towns, \n     where the spires of Latter-day Saints churches glint against \n     the Wasatch Mountains, is the home of what many consider the \n     nation's best high school boys' basketball team.\n       For the past two years, the Knights of Lone Peak High \n     School, a team of lanky, long-armed teenagers who look only \n     slightly more imposing than a chess club, have not just been \n     beating opponents, they have been crushing them.\n       At 23-1, the Knights have been ranked as the best high \n     school team in the country for more than a month by the Web \n     site Max Preps and are working their way through the Utah \n     state playoffs, which end Saturday. While Lone Peak has lost \n     to in-state opponents just three times in the past three \n     years, its success nationally is especially surprising. The \n     Knights have won by an average of nearly 28 points this \n     season, including tournament victories over top teams from \n     Pennsylvania, Illinois and California.\n       ``There was one team we played that was literally laughing \n     when we were warming up,'' the senior center Eric Mika said \n     with a chuckle. ``And we beat them by 50.''\n       Unlike many top high school teams that lure talented \n     players from outside their immediate area, Lone Peak, which \n     has a student body of about 2,300, pulls players from the \n     pruned streets of Alpine and Highland--small communities \n     tucked in the foothills about 30 miles from Salt Lake City, \n     so named by Mormon settlers because the landscape reminded \n     them of the Swiss Alps and Scottish Highlands.\n       The Knights--led by Mika and guards Nick Emery and T.J. \n     Haws--have ascended to the top of the national rankings as \n     relative unknowns, a feat made more remarkable by the simple \n     fact that they hail from a region not recognized for \n     basketball prowess.\n       ``We know we're different whenever we walk into a gym,'' \n     said Coach Quincy Lewis, who has a 206-35 record over the \n     past decade. ``But our guys walk in there with a chip on \n     their shoulder. We know we have something to prove because, \n     honestly, the other teams don't have a great deal of respect \n     for us.''\n       Then Lone Peak starts playing. Its style is a fearless, \n     careening brand of basketball, built on 3-pointers, lobs and \n     dunks, seemingly more suited for a playground than the movie \n     ``Hoosiers.''\n       ``They play like inner-city teams; how blacks consider \n     black teams play,'' said Tyrone Slaughter, who coaches \n     Whitney Young High School in Chicago, which is ranked seventh \n     in the country. ``I don't know any other way to put it.\n       ``So many times we see the predominantly white teams play a \n     conservative style, a precise style of basketball,'' he said. \n     ``When you see this team play, it is completely different.''\n       Last season, Lone Peak beat Whitney Young in a double-\n     overtime game at the Beach Ball Classic tournament in Myrtle \n     Beach, S.C., a performance that helped burnish its \n     reputation.\n       Emery set the tournament's four-game scoring record with \n     119 points. Word of the Knights' lopsided victories spread \n     around Chicago. Now, Slaughter said, if a team is blown out, \n     it is said to have been Lone Peaked.\n       The most apparent reason for the team's success is the \n     triumvirate of Mika, Emery and Haws, players, Lewis says, who \n     ``don't come around very often for anybody, I don't care what \n     program you're a part of.''\n       The 6-foot-2 senior Emery, who averages 19 points, and the \n     6-4 junior Haws, who scores 17 a game, are continuing a \n     family tradition at Lone Peak.\n       Emery's older brother, Jackson, who graduated from the \n     school in 2005, was named Utah's Mr. Basketball and was a co-\n     captain at Brigham Young with Jimmer Fredette.\n\n[[Page S1264]]\n\n       Haws's older brother, Tyler, was also a Lone Peak standout \n     and was 10th in the country in scoring with a 20.9 points-a-\n     game average at B.Y.U. entering Tuesday's games. The 6-foot-\n     10 Mika, who averages 16 points, is in his first season at \n     Lone Peak after transferring from a private school, but he \n     has known Haws and Emery since they were fourth graders \n     playing on youth teams together.\n       ``I feel this is really a once-in-a-life team,'' said Haws, \n     who can make 3-pointers from beyond the N.B.A. range or slash \n     through the lane with moves that have earned him YouTube \n     fame.\n       Lewis has coached many of his players since grade school at \n     clinics and camps. Every summer, he takes the team to play \n     against Amateur Athletic Union squads around the country.\n       Most A.A.U. teams, the equivalent of select youth soccer \n     clubs, choose marquee players from around their region. And \n     it is rare for a high school team to compete against what are \n     essentially all-star rosters.\n       ``We have had very few teams that have competed at that \n     level in term of how they play together, shot selection and \n     chemistry,'' said Greg Procino, the director of events and \n     awards at the Basketball Hall of Fame, which also hosted a \n     tournament that Lone Peak excelled at in 2011 and another in \n     which the team performed well in January.\n       There is, of course, something else that sets the Knights \n     apart.\n       A flip through the team program finds plenty of references \n     to Mormonism, whether it is players noting that the last book \n     they read was the Book of Mormon or affirming their life \n     goals as serving a mission and marrying.\n       Lone Peak players freely discuss how religion unites them. \n     When the team is on the road and needs to practice, it will \n     call up the local Mormon bishop and ask to use the small gym \n     typically attached to each Mormon church.\n       ``A couple of summers ago, we were in Boston,'' Mika said. \n     ``Someone was like: `Oh, you guys are all Mormon. How many \n     moms do you have? You guys all brothers?' We just laugh.''\n       Mika, Emery and Haws have committed to play at B.Y.U., 30 \n     minutes away. All have also decided to go on missions. For \n     Emery, an explosive guard and the most highly recruited of \n     the three, that means leaving for Germany in May and probably \n     not playing organized basketball for two years.\n       ``A lot of factors went into it,'' he said of his decision. \n     ``I've grown up in the Gospel. And I've wanted to serve a \n     mission since I was a young kid. I'll have four years when I \n     come home.''\n       Lewis recalled that Bill Self pulled Emery aside after he \n     had starred at a University of Kansas basketball camp, \n     saying, ``You're good enough to play here.''\n       But it is difficult to ask coaches whose careers rest on \n     immediate success to commit to a top high school prospect who \n     plans to take two years away from basketball.\n       ``The way people look at this state, they say, `If we go in \n     there and recruit kids, we know they're probably L.D.S.,' '' \n     or Latter-day Saints, `` `kids, and they're going on a \n     mission and that's not how our program is set up,' '' Lewis \n     said.\n       For now, however, Lone Peak is seeking a fifth state \n     championship in seven years--the title game is Saturday--and \n     a chance to brag that it ended the season as the country's \n     top-ranked team.\n       At a recent road game against Bingham High School, the gym \n     roared with hundreds of fans from across the region who had \n     come to see Lone Peak for themselves.\n       ``Which are the three guys we were watching again?'' a \n     woman asked her husband.\n       An older man wondered aloud if all three were heading to \n     B.Y.U.\n       By midway through the fourth quarter, the game long in \n     hand, Lewis pulled most of his starters, with Mika, Haws and \n     Emery accounting for 69 of the team's 98 points in a 41-point \n     victory.\n       The three friends sat on the bench, laughing, leaping up \n     when their backups scored and politely chatting with curious \n     fans wandering down for a closer look.\n       It may have been an away game, but this was home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/07/senate-section/article/S1264-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1264]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/07/senate-section/article/S1264-2", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1264]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/07/senate-section/article/S1264-3", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1264]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:03 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.

A bill to establish the Sangre de Cristo National Historical \nPark, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation recognizing one of Colorado's most historically significant \nregions--the San Luis Valley.\n  It is no exaggeration to say that the unique history and culture of \nthe region we commonly call `the Valley' is one of the richest in our \nstate, region, and nation, particularly as an example of early Hispano \nand Latino settlement. As an avid student of history--like so many of \nmy colleagues--I find that the more I learn and experience the stories, \npeople, and places of the Valley, the more I want to learn.\n  First explored by Spanish Colonial expeditions in the 17th century, \nHispano families from Northern New Mexico made many attempts at \npermanent settlement in this region, but weren't successful until the \nlate 1840s, after the territory became part of Mexico. With the oldest \ntown, San Luis, and the oldest water right, the People's Ditch, in \nColorado, the San Luis Valley hosts some of the most intact Mexican \nterritorial settlements in the Southwest. Many descendants of those \noriginal settlers continue to live in the region today.\n  But despite this incredibly rich history, millions of people visit \nColorado every year who are not familiar with the San Luis Valley. The \nlegislation I am introducing today would create the Sangre de Cristo \nNational Historic Park, named for the stunning mountain range that \nforms the eastern border of the valley. The Sangre de Cristo National \nHistoric Park would link together a series of historically significant \nsites throughout the valley--protecting and preserving them for future \ngenerations to experience and learn from.\n  Creating this park will help to tell the story of Colorado's earliest \nsettlers.\n  Telling these stories and protecting these sites is important because \nof their intrinsic value to our history, culture and future \ngenerations. But they are also important to the economy as our state \nand country are emerging from the worst economy in a generation. The \nSangre de Cristo National Historic Park could serve as an anchor for a \nregional tourism economy that can bring jobs to the entire San Luis \nValley and Southern Colorado while recognizing and celebrating the \nValley's rich and important history.\n  Over the last several years, I have held a series of town hall \nmeetings in San Luis, La Jara and Alamosa to learn more about the \nrecently created Sangre de Cristo National Heritage Area and to hear \nthe views of the local communities. I heard a great deal of support for \nthe National Historic Park concept, and today marks an important step \nforward in the process of creating this meaningful, if overdue, park.\n  I look forward to working with stakeholders, local communities and my \ncolleagues to move this legislation forward.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 506. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nrecruitment and retention incentives for volunteer emergency service \nworkers; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Volunteer \nEmergency Services Recruitment and Retention Act of 2013. This bill \nfixes a long-standing problem with the tax code that impedes the \nability of volunteer fire departments to recruit and retain both \nfirefighter and emergency service personnel.\n  For years, local and State governments have provided their volunteer \nfirefighters and EMS personnel with different forms of benefits \nincluding Length of Service Award Plans, commonly known as LOSAPs. \nThese are pension-like benefits for volunteer emergency responders.\n  Unfortunately, the way the tax code handles LOSAPs hinders \ndepartments' abilities to administer the plans and makes it more \ndifficult for volunteer emergency personnel to receive the benefits.\n  My bill would simplify the taxation of LOSAPs in two steps. First, it \nwould allow LOSAPs to be elected as deferred compensation plans, and \nsecond, it would exempt them from the Employee Retirement Income \nSecurity Act of 1974. These two changes will improve access to LOSAP \nbenefits for volunteer emergency responders, without increasing federal \nspending.\n  Today, an estimated 180,000 volunteer firefighters across 27 states \nparticipate in some form of LOSAP. Many States that do not offer these \nbenefits would be more likely to do so if the Federal tax code were \nsimplified. This, in turn, would help volunteer fire departments to \nrecruit more easily and retain personnel. These men and women, our \nlocal first responders, are the foundation of our emergency response \ncapabilities.\n  These volunteers put their lives on the line to help protect our \ncommunities, and their spirit of selflessness and service should be \nrewarded. I am pleased to introduce this legislation with Senator \nSchumer, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this \nbill through the Senate and into law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/07/senate-section/article/S1271-2", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1271-S1272]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 69--CALLING FOR THE PROTECTIONS OF RELIGIOUS MINORITY \n                 RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS IN THE ARAB WORLD\n\n  Mr. INHOFE submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                               S.
