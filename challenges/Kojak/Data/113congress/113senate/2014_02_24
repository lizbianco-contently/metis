Pursuant to the order of the Senate of \nJanuary 24, 1901, as amended by the order of February 10, 2014, the \nSenator from Maine, Mr. King, will now read Washington's Farewell \nAddress.\n  (Mr. KAINE assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. KING, at the rostrum, read the Farewell Address, as follows:\n\nTo the people of the United States\n  Friends and Fellow-Citizens: The period for a new election of a \ncitizen to administer the executive government of the United States \nbeing not far distant, and the time actually arrived when your thoughts \nmust be employed in designating the person who is to be clothed with \nthat important trust, it appears to me proper, especially as it may \nconduce to a more distinct expression of the public voice, that I \nshould now apprise you of the resolution I have formed, to decline \nbeing considered among the number of those out of whom a choice is to \nbe made.\n  I beg you at the same time to do me the justice to be assured that \nthis resolution has not been taken without a strict regard to all the \nconsiderations appertaining to the relation which binds a dutiful \ncitizen to his country--and that, in withdrawing the tender of service \nwhich silence in my situation might imply, I am influenced by no \ndiminution of zeal for your future interest, no deficiency of grateful \nrespect for your past kindness, but am supported by a full conviction \nthat the step is compatible with both.\n  The acceptance of, and continuance hitherto in, the office to which \nyour suffrages have twice called me have been a uniform sacrifice of \ninclination to the opinion of duty and to a deference for what appeared \nto be your desire. I constantly hoped that it would have been much \nearlier in my power, consistently with motives which I was not at \nliberty to disregard, to return to that retirement from which I had \nbeen reluctantly drawn. The strength of my inclination to do this, \nprevious to the last election, had even led to the preparation of an \naddress to declare it to you; but mature reflection on the then \nperplexed and critical posture of our affairs with foreign nations, and \nthe unanimous advice of persons entitled to my confidence, impelled me \nto abandon the idea.\n  I rejoice that the state of your concerns, external as well as \ninternal, no longer renders the pursuit of inclination incompatible \nwith the sentiment of duty or propriety and am persuaded, whatever \npartiality may be retained for my services, that in the present \ncircumstances of our country you will not disapprove my determination \nto retire.\n  The impressions with which I first undertook the arduous trust were \nexplained on the proper occasion. In the discharge of this trust, I \nwill only say that I have, with good intentions, contributed towards \nthe organization and administration of the government the best \nexertions of which a very fallible judgment was capable. Not \nunconscious in the outset of the inferiority of my qualifications, \nexperience in my own eyes, perhaps still more in the eyes of others, \nhas strengthened the motives to diffidence of myself, and every day\n\n[[Page S974]]\n\nthe increasing weight of years admonishes me more and more that the \nshade of retirement is as necessary to me as it will be welcome. \nSatisfied that if any circumstances have given peculiar value to my \nservices, they were temporary, I have the consolation to believe that, \nwhile choice and prudence invite me to quit the political scene, \npatriotism does not forbid it.\n  In looking forward to the moment which is intended to terminate the \ncareer of my public life, my feelings do not permit me to suspend the \ndeep acknowledgment of that debt of gratitude which I owe to my beloved \ncountry for the many honors it has conferred upon me, still more for \nthe steadfast confidence with which it has supported me and for the \nopportunities I have thence enjoyed of manifesting my inviolable \nattachment by services faithful and persevering, though in usefulness \nunequal to my zeal. If benefits have resulted to our country from these \nservices, let it always be remembered to your praise and as an \ninstructive example in our annals that, under circumstances in which \nthe passions agitated in every direction were liable to mislead, amidst \nappearances sometimes dubious, vicissitudes of fortune often \ndiscouraging, in situations in which not unfrequently want of success \nhas countenanced the spirit of criticism, the constancy of your support \nwas the essential prop of the efforts and a guarantee of the plans by \nwhich they were effected. Profoundly penetrated with this idea, I shall \ncarry it with me to my grave as a strong incitement to unceasing vows \nthat Heaven may continue to you the choicest tokens of its beneficence; \nthat your union and brotherly affection may be perpetual; that the free \nconstitution, which is the work of your hands, may be sacredly \nmaintained; that its administration in every department may be stamped \nwith wisdom and virtue; that, in fine, the happiness of the people of \nthese states, under the auspices of liberty, may be made complete by so \ncareful a preservation and so prudent a use of this blessing as will \nacquire to them the glory of recommending it to the applause, the \naffection, and adoption of every nation which is yet a stranger to it.\n  Here, perhaps, I ought to stop. But a solicitude for your welfare, \nwhich cannot end but with my life, and the apprehension of danger \nnatural to that solicitude, urge me on an occasion like the present to \noffer to your solemn contemplation, and to recommend to your frequent \nreview, some sentiments which are the result of much reflection, of no \ninconsiderable observation, and which appear to me all important to the \npermanency of your felicity as a people. These will be offered to you \nwith the more freedom as you can only see in them the disinterested \nwarnings of a parting friend, who can possibly have no personal motive \nto bias his counsel. Nor can I forget, as an encouragement to it, your \nindulgent reception of my sentiments on a former and not dissimilar \noccasion.\n  Interwoven as is the love of liberty with every ligament of your \nhearts, no recommendation of mine is necessary to fortify or confirm \nthe attachment.\n  The unity of government which constitutes you one people is also now \ndear to you. It is justly so; for it is a main pillar in the edifice of \nyour real independence, the support of your tranquility at home, your \npeace abroad, of your safety, of your prosperity, of that very liberty \nwhich you so highly prize. But as it is easy to foresee that, from \ndifferent causes and from different quarters, much pains will be taken, \nmany artifices employed, to weaken in your minds the conviction of this \ntruth; as this is the point in your political fortress against which \nthe batteries of internal and external enemies will be most constantly \nand actively (though often covertly and insidiously) directed, it is of \ninfinite moment that you should properly estimate the immense value of \nyour national Union to your collective and individual happiness; that \nyou should cherish a cordial, habitual, and immovable attachment to it; \naccustoming yourselves to think and speak of it as of the palladium of \nyour political safety and prosperity; watching for its preservation \nwith jealous anxiety; discountenancing whatever may suggest even a \nsuspicion that it can in any event be abandoned; and indignantly \nfrowning upon the first dawning of every attempt to alienate any \nportion of our country from the rest, or to enfeeble the sacred ties \nwhich now link together the various parts.\n  For this you have every inducement of sympathy and interest. Citizens \nby birth or choice of a common country, that country has a right to \nconcentrate your affections. The name of American, which belongs to you \nin your national capacity, must always exalt the just pride of \npatriotism more than any appellation derived from local \ndiscriminations. With slight shades of difference, you have the same \nreligion, manners, habits, and political principles. You have in a \ncommon cause fought and triumphed together. The independence and \nliberty you possess are the work of joint councils and joint efforts--\nof common dangers, sufferings, and successes.\n  But these considerations, however powerfully they address themselves \nto your sensibility, are greatly outweighed by those which apply more \nimmediately to your interest. Here every portion of our country finds \nthe most commanding motives for carefully guarding and preserving the \nUnion of the whole.\n  The North, in an unrestrained intercourse with the South, protected \nby the equal laws of a common government, finds in the productions of \nthe latter great additional resources of maritime and commercial \nenterprise and precious materials of manufacturing industry. The South \nin the same intercourse, benefitting by the agency of the North, sees \nits agriculture grow and its commerce expand. Turning partly into its \nown channels the seamen of the North, it finds its particular \nnavigation invigorated; and while it contributes, in different ways, to \nnourish and increase the general mass of the national navigation, it \nlooks forward to the protection of a maritime strength to which itself \nis unequally adapted. The East, in a like intercourse with the West, \nalready finds, and in the progressive improvement of interior \ncommunications by land and water will more and more find a valuable \nvent for the commodities which it brings from abroad or manufactures at \nhome. The West derives from the East supplies requisite to its growth \nand comfort--and what is perhaps of still greater consequence, it must \nof necessity owe the secure enjoyment of indispensable outlets for its \nown productions to the weight, influence, and the future maritime \nstrength of the Atlantic side of the Union, directed by an indissoluble \ncommunity of interest as one nation. Any other tenure by which the West \ncan hold this essential advantage, whether derived from its own \nseparate strength or from an apostate and unnatural connection with any \nforeign power, must be intrinsically precarious.\n  While then every part of our country thus feels an immediate and \nparticular interest in union, all the parts combined cannot fail to \nfind in the united mass of means and efforts greater strength, greater \nresource, proportionably greater security from external danger, a less \nfrequent interruption of their peace by foreign nations; and, what is \nof inestimable value! they must derive from union an exemption from \nthose broils and wars between themselves which so frequently afflict \nneighboring countries not tied together by the same government, which \ntheir own rivalships alone would be sufficient to produce, but which \nopposite foreign alliances, attachments, and intrigues would stimulate \nand embitter. Hence likewise they will avoid the necessity of those \novergrown military establishments, which under any form of government \nare inauspicious to liberty, and which are to be regarded as \nparticularly hostile to republican liberty. In this sense it is, that \nyour Union ought to be considered as a main prop of your liberty, and \nthat the love of the one ought to endear to you the preservation of the \nother.\n  These considerations speak a persuasive language to every reflecting \nand virtuous mind and exhibit the continuance of the Union as a primary \nobject of patriotic desire. Is there a doubt whether a common \ngovernment can embrace so large a sphere? Let experience solve it. To \nlisten to mere speculation in such a case were criminal. We are \nauthorized to hope that a proper organization of the whole, with the \nauxiliary agency of governments for the respective subdivisions, will \nafford\n\n[[Page S975]]\n\na happy issue to the experiment. It is well worth a fair and full \nexperiment. With such powerful and obvious motives to union affecting \nall parts of our country, while experience shall not have demonstrated \nits impracticability, there will always be reason to distrust the \npatriotism of those who in any quarter may endeavor to weaken its \nbands.\n  In contemplating the causes which may disturb our Union, it occurs as \nmatter of serious concern that any ground should have been furnished \nfor characterizing parties by geographical discriminations--northern \nand southern--Atlantic and western; whence designing men may endeavor \nto excite a belief that there is a real difference of local interests \nand views. One of the expedients of party to acquire influence within \nparticular districts is to misrepresent the opinions and aims of other \ndistricts. You cannot shield yourselves too much against the jealousies \nand heart burnings which spring from these misrepresentations. They \ntend to render alien to each other those who ought to be bound together \nby fraternal affection. The inhabitants of our western country have \nlately had a useful lesson on this head. They have seen in the \nnegotiation by the executive--and in the unanimous ratification by the \nSenate--of the treaty with Spain, and in the universal satisfaction at \nthat event throughout the United States, a decisive proof how unfounded \nwere the suspicions propagated among them of a policy in the general \ngovernment and in the Atlantic states unfriendly to their interests in \nregard to the Mississippi. They have been witnesses to the formation of \ntwo treaties, that with Great Britain and that with Spain, which secure \nto them everything they could desire, in respect to our foreign \nrelations, towards confirming their prosperity. Will it not be their \nwisdom to rely for the preservation of these advantages on the Union by \nwhich they were procured? Will they not henceforth be deaf to those \nadvisers, if such there are, who would sever them from their brethren \nand connect them with aliens?\n  To the efficacy and permanency of your Union, a government for the \nwhole is indispensable. No alliances, however strict, between the parts \ncan be an adequate substitute. They must inevitably experience the \ninfractions and interruptions which all alliances in all times have \nexperienced. Sensible of this momentous truth, you have improved upon \nyour first essay by the adoption of a Constitution of government better \ncalculated than your former for an intimate Union and for the \nefficacious management of your common concerns. This government, the \noffspring of our own choice uninfluenced and unawed, adopted upon full \ninvestigation and mature deliberation, completely free in its \nprinciples, in the distribution of its powers uniting security with \nenergy, and containing within itself a provision for its own amendment, \nhas a just claim to your confidence and your support. Respect for its \nauthority, compliance with its laws, acquiescence in its measures, are \nduties enjoined by the fundamental maxims of true liberty. The basis of \nour political systems is the right of the people to make and to alter \ntheir constitutions of government. But the Constitution which at any \ntime exists, until changed by an explicit and authentic act of the \nwhole people, is sacredly obligatory upon all. The very idea of the \npower and the right of the people to establish government presupposes \nthe duty of every individual to obey the established government.\n  All obstructions to the execution of the laws, all combinations and \nassociations under whatever plausible character with the real design to \ndirect, control, counteract, or awe the regular deliberation and action \nof the constituted authorities, are destructive of this fundamental \nprinciple and of fatal tendency. They serve to organize faction; to \ngive it an artificial and extraordinary force; to put in the place of \nthe delegated will of the nation the will of a party, often a small but \nartful and enterprising minority of the community; and, according to \nthe alternate triumphs of different parties, to make the public \nadministration the mirror of the ill concerted and incongruous projects \nof faction, rather than the organ of consistent and wholesome plans \ndigested by common councils and modified by mutual interests. However \ncombinations or associations of the above description may now and then \nanswer popular ends, they are likely, in the course of time and things, \nto become potent engines by which cunning, ambitious, and unprincipled \nmen will be enabled to subvert the power of the people and to usurp for \nthemselves the reins of government, destroying afterwards the very \nengines which have lifted them to unjust dominion.\n  Towards the preservation of your government and the permanency of \nyour present happy state, it is requisite not only that you steadily \ndiscountenance irregular oppositions to its acknowledged authority but \nalso that you resist with care the spirit of innovation upon its \nprinciples, however specious the pretexts. One method of assault may be \nto effect in the forms of the Constitution alterations which will \nimpair the energy of the system and thus to undermine what cannot be \ndirectly overthrown. In all the changes to which you may be invited, \nremember that time and habit are at least as necessary to fix the true \ncharacter of governments as of other human institutions, that \nexperience is the surest standard by which to test the real tendency of \nthe existing constitution of a country, that facility in changes upon \nthe credit of mere hypotheses and opinion exposes to perpetual change \nfrom the endless variety of hypotheses and opinion; and remember, \nespecially, that for the efficient management of your common interests \nin a country so extensive as ours, a government of as much vigor as is \nconsistent with the perfect security of liberty is indispensable; \nliberty itself will find in such a government, with powers properly \ndistributed and adjusted, its surest guardian. It is indeed little else \nthan a name, where the government is too feeble to withstand the \nenterprises of faction, to confine each member of the society within \nthe limits prescribed by the laws, and to maintain all in the secure \nand tranquil enjoyment of the rights of person and property.\n  I have already intimated to you the danger of parties in the state, \nwith particular reference to the founding of them on geographical \ndiscriminations. Let me now take a more comprehensive view and warn you \nin the most solemn manner against the baneful effects of the spirit of \nparty, generally.\n  This spirit, unfortunately, is inseparable from our nature, having \nits root in the strongest passions of the human mind. It exists under \ndifferent shapes in all governments, more or less stifled, controlled, \nor repressed; but in those of the popular form it is seen in its \ngreatest rankness and is truly their worst enemy.\n  The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by \nthe spirit of revenge natural to party dissension, which in different \nages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is \nitself a frightful despotism. But this leads at length to a more formal \nand permanent despotism. The disorders and miseries which result \ngradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the \nabsolute power of an individual; and sooner or later the chief of some \nprevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his competitors, \nturns this disposition to the purposes of his own elevation on the \nruins of public liberty.\n  Without looking forward to an extremity of this kind (which \nnevertheless ought not to be entirely out of sight) the common and \ncontinual mischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it \nthe interest and the duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain \nit.\n  It serves always to distract the public councils and enfeeble the \npublic administration. It agitates the community with ill founded \njealousies and false alarms, kindles the animosity of one part against \nanother, foments occasionally riot and insurrection. It opens the door \nto foreign influence and corruption, which find a facilitated access to \nthe government itself through the channels of party passions. Thus the \npolicy and the will of one country are subjected to the policy and will \nof another.\n  There is an opinion that parties in free countries are useful checks \nupon the administration of the government and serve to keep alive the \nspirit of liberty. This within certain limits is probably true--and in \ngovernments of a monarchical cast patriotism may look\n\n[[Page S976]]\n\nwith indulgence, if not with favor, upon the spirit of party. But in \nthose of the popular character, in governments purely elective, it is a \nspirit not to be encouraged. From their natural tendency, it is certain \nthere will always be enough of that spirit for every salutary purpose. \nAnd there being constant danger of excess, the effort ought to be by \nforce of public opinion to mitigate and assuage it. A fire not to be \nquenched, it demands a uniform vigilance to prevent its bursting into a \nflame, lest instead of warming it should consume.\n  It is important, likewise, that the habits of thinking in a free \ncountry should inspire caution in those entrusted with its \nadministration to confine themselves within their respective \nconstitutional spheres, avoiding in the exercise of the powers of one \ndepartment to encroach upon another. The spirit of encroachment tends \nto consolidate the powers of all the departments in one and thus to \ncreate, whatever the form of government, a real despotism. A just \nestimate of that love of power and proneness to abuse it which \npredominates in the human heart is sufficient to satisfy us of the \ntruth of this position. The necessity of reciprocal checks in the \nexercise of political power, by dividing and distributing it into \ndifferent depositories and constituting each the guardian of the public \nweal against invasions by the others, has been evinced by experiments \nancient and modern, some of them in our country and under our own eyes. \nTo preserve them must be as necessary as to institute them. If in the \nopinion of the people the distribution or modification of the \nconstitutional powers be in any particular wrong, let it be corrected \nby an amendment in the way which the Constitution designates. But let \nthere be no change by usurpation; for though this, in one instance, may \nbe the instrument of good, it is the customary weapon by which free \ngovernments are destroyed. The precedent must always greatly \noverbalance in permanent evil any partial or transient benefit which \nthe use can at any time yield.\n  Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political \nprosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports. In vain \nwould that man claim the tribute of patriotism who should labor to \nsubvert these great pillars of human happiness, these firmest props of \nthe duties of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the \npious man, ought to respect and to cherish them. A volume could not \ntrace all their connections with private and public felicity. Let it \nsimply be asked where is the security for property, for reputation, for \nlife, if the sense of religious obligation desert the oaths, which are \nthe instruments of investigation in courts of justice? And let us with \ncaution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without \nreligion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined \neducation on minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience both \nforbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of \nreligious principle.\n  It is substantially true that virtue or morality is a necessary \nspring of popular government. The rule indeed extends with more or less \nforce to every species of free government. Who that is a sincere friend \nto it can look with indifference upon attempts to shake the foundation \nof the fabric?\n  Promote then, as an object of primary importance, institutions for \nthe general diffusion of knowledge. In proportion as the structure of a \ngovernment gives force to public opinion, it is essential that public \nopinion should be enlightened.\n  As a very important source of strength and security, cherish public \ncredit. One method of preserving it is to use it as sparingly as \npossible, avoiding occasions of expense by cultivating peace, but \nremembering also that timely disbursements to prepare for danger \nfrequently prevent much greater disbursements to repel it; avoiding \nlikewise the accumulation of debt, not only by shunning occasions of \nexpense, but by vigorous exertions in time of peace to discharge the \ndebts which unavoidable wars may have occasioned, not ungenerously \nthrowing upon posterity the burden which we ourselves ought to bear. \nThe execution of these maxims belongs to your representatives, but it \nis necessary that public opinion should cooperate. To facilitate to \nthem the performance of their duty, it is essential that you should \npractically bear in mind that towards the payment of debts there must \nbe revenue; that to have revenue there must be taxes; that no taxes can \nbe devised which are not more or less inconvenient and unpleasant; that \nthe intrinsic embarrassment inseparable from the selection of the \nproper objects (which is always a choice of difficulties) ought to be a \ndecisive motive for a candid construction of the conduct of the \ngovernment in making it, and for a spirit of acquiescence in the \nmeasures for obtaining revenue which the public exigencies may at any \ntime dictate.\n  Observe good faith and justice towards all nations; cultivate peace \nand harmony with all; religion and morality enjoin this conduct, and \ncan it be that good policy does not equally enjoin it? It will be \nworthy of a free, enlightened, and, at no distant period, a great \nnation, to give to mankind the magnanimous and too novel example of a \npeople always guided by an exalted justice and benevolence. Who can \ndoubt that in the course of time and things the fruits of such a plan \nwould richly repay any temporary advantages which might be lost by a \nsteady adherence to it? Can it be, that Providence has not connected \nthe permanent felicity of a nation with its virtue? The experiment, at \nleast, is recommended by every sentiment which ennobles human nature. \nAlas! is it rendered impossible by its vices?\n  In the execution of such a plan nothing is more essential than that \npermanent, inveterate antipathies against particular nations and \npassionate attachments for others should be excluded and that in place \nof them just and amicable feelings towards all should be cultivated. \nThe nation which indulges towards another an habitual hatred, or an \nhabitual fondness, is in some degree a slave. It is a slave to its \nanimosity or to its affection, either of which is sufficient to lead it \nastray from its duty and its interest. Antipathy in one nation against \nanother disposes each more readily to offer insult and injury, to lay \nhold of slight causes of umbrage, and to be haughty and intractable \nwhen accidental or trifling occasions of dispute occur. Hence frequent \ncollisions, obstinate, envenomed, and bloody contests. The nation, \nprompted by ill will and resentment, sometimes impels to war the \ngovernment, contrary to the best calculations of policy. The government \nsometimes participates in the national propensity and adopts through \npassion what reason would reject; at other times, it makes the \nanimosity of the nation subservient to projects of hostility instigated \nby pride, ambition and other sinister and pernicious motives. The peace \noften, sometimes perhaps the liberty, of nations has been the victim.\n  So likewise, a passionate attachment of one nation for another \nproduces a variety of evils. Sympathy for the favorite nation, \nfacilitating the illusion of an imaginary common interest in cases \nwhere no real common interest exists and infusing into one the enmities \nof the other, betrays the former into a participation in the quarrels \nand wars of the latter, without adequate inducement or justification. \nIt leads also to concessions to the favorite nation of privileges \ndenied to others, which is apt doubly to injure the nation making the \nconcessions, by unnecessarily parting with what ought to have been \nretained and by exciting jealousy, ill will, and a disposition to \nretaliate in the parties from whom equal privileges are withheld. And \nit gives to ambitious, corrupted, or deluded citizens (who devote \nthemselves to the favorite nation) facility to betray or sacrifice the \ninterests of their own country without odium, sometimes even with \npopularity, gilding with the appearances of a virtuous sense of \nobligation, a commendable deference for public opinion, or a laudable \nzeal for public good, the base or foolish compliances of ambition, \ncorruption, or infatuation.\n  As avenues to foreign influence in innumerable ways, such attachments \nare particularly alarming to the truly enlightened and independent \npatriot. How many opportunities do they afford to tamper with domestic \nfactions, to practice the arts of seduction, to mislead public opinion, \nto influence or awe the public councils! Such an attachment of a small \nor weak towards a great and powerful nation dooms the former to be the \nsatellite of the latter.\n  Against the insidious wiles of foreign influence (I conjure you to \nbelieve me,\n\n[[Page S977]]\n\nfellow citizens) the jealousy of a free people ought to be constantly \nawake, since history and experience prove that foreign influence is one \nof the most baneful foes of republican government. But that jealousy to \nbe useful must be impartial; else it becomes the instrument of the very \ninfluence to be avoided, instead of a defense against it. Excessive \npartiality for one foreign nation and excessive dislike of another \ncause those whom they actuate to see danger only on one side, and serve \nto veil and even second the arts of influence on the other. Real \npatriots, who may resist the intrigues of the favorite, are liable to \nbecome suspected and odious, while its tools and dupes usurp the \napplause and confidence of the people to surrender their interests.\n  The great rule of conduct for us in regard to foreign nations is, in \nextending our commercial relations, to have with them as little \npolitical connection as possible. So far as we have already formed \nengagements, let them be fulfilled with perfect good faith. Here let us \nstop.\n  Europe has a set of primary interests, which to us have none or a \nvery remote relation. Hence she must be engaged in frequent \ncontroversies, the causes of which are essentially foreign to our \nconcerns. Hence therefore it must be unwise in us to implicate \nourselves, by artificial ties, in the ordinary vicissitudes of her \npolitics or the ordinary combinations and collisions of her friendships \nor enmities.\n  Our detached and distant situation invites and enables us to pursue a \ndifferent course. If we remain one people under an efficient \ngovernment, the period is not far off when we may defy material injury \nfrom external annoyance; when we may take such an attitude as will \ncause the neutrality we may at any time resolve upon to be scrupulously \nrespected; when belligerent nations, under the impossibility of making \nacquisitions upon us, will not lightly hazard the giving us \nprovocation; when we may choose peace or war, as our interest guided by \njustice shall counsel.\n  Why forgo the advantages of so peculiar a situation? Why quit our own \nto stand upon foreign ground? Why, by interweaving our destiny with \nthat of any part of Europe, entangle our peace and prosperity in the \ntoils of European ambition, rival-ship, interest, humor, or caprice?\n  It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliances with any \nportion of the foreign world--so far, I mean, as we are now at liberty \nto do it, for let me not be understood as capable of patronizing \ninfidelity to existing engagements (I hold the maxim no less applicable \nto public than to private affairs, that honesty is always the best \npolicy)--I repeat it therefore, let those engagements be observed in \ntheir genuine sense. But in my opinion it is unnecessary and would be \nunwise to extend them.\n  Taking care always to keep ourselves, by suitable establishments, on \na respectably defensive posture, we may safely trust to temporary \nalliances for extraordinary emergencies.\n  Harmony, liberal intercourse with all nations, are recommended by \npolicy, humanity, and interest. But even our commercial policy should \nhold an equal and impartial hand: neither seeking nor granting \nexclusive favors or preferences; consulting the natural course of \nthings; diffusing and diversifying by gentle means the streams of \ncommerce but forcing nothing; establishing with powers so disposed--in \norder to give to trade a stable course, to define the rights of our \nmerchants, and to enable the government to support them--conventional \nrules of intercourse, the best that present circumstances and mutual \nopinion will permit, but temporary, and liable to be from time to time \nabandoned or varied, as experience and circumstances shall dictate; \nconstantly keeping in view, that it is folly in one nation to look for \ndisinterested favors from another--that it must pay with a portion of \nits independence for whatever it may accept under that character--that \nby such acceptance it may place itself in the condition of having given \nequivalents for nominal favors and yet of being reproached with \ningratitude for not giving more. There can be no greater error than to \nexpect or calculate upon real favors from nation to nation. It is an \nillusion which experience must cure, which a just pride ought to \ndiscard.\n  In offering to you, my countrymen, these counsels of an old and \naffectionate friend, I dare not hope they will make the strong and \nlasting impression I could wish--that they will control the usual \ncurrent of the passions or prevent our nation from running the course \nwhich has hitherto marked the destiny of nations. But if I may even \nflatter myself that they may be productive of some partial benefit, \nsome occasional good, that they may now and then recur to moderate the \nfury of party spirit, to warn against the mischiefs of foreign \nintrigue, to guard against the impostures of pretended patriotism--this \nhope will be a full recompense for the solicitude for your welfare by \nwhich they have been dictated.\n  How far in the discharge of my official duties I have been guided by \nthe principles which have been delineated, the public records and other \nevidences of my conduct must witness to you and to the world. To \nmyself, the assurance of my own conscience is that I have at least \nbelieved myself to be guided by them.\n  In relation to the still subsisting war in Europe, my proclamation of \nthe 22d of April 1793 is the index to my plan. Sanctioned by your \napproving voice and by that of your representatives in both houses of \nCongress, the spirit of that measure has continually governed me, \nuninfluenced by any attempts to deter or divert me from it.\n  After deliberate examination with the aid of the best lights I could \nobtain, I was well satisfied that our country, under all the \ncircumstances of the case, had a right to take--and was bound in duty \nand interest to take--a neutral position. Having taken it, I \ndetermined, as far as should depend upon me, to maintain it with \nmoderation, perseverence, and firmness.\n  The considerations which respect the right to hold this conduct it is \nnot necessary on this occasion to detail. I will only observe that, \naccording to my understanding of the matter, that right, so far from \nbeing denied by any of the belligerent powers, has been virtually \nadmitted by all.\n  The duty of holding a neutral conduct may be inferred, without \nanything more, from the obligation which justice and humanity impose on \nevery nation, in cases in which it is free to act, to maintain \ninviolate the relations of peace and amity towards other nations.\n  The inducements of interest for observing that conduct will best be \nreferred to your own reflections and experience. With me, a predominant \nmotive has been to endeavor to gain time to our country to settle and \nmature its yet recent institutions and to progress without interruption \nto that degree of strength and consistency which is necessary to give \nit, humanly speaking, the command of its own fortunes.\n  Though in reviewing the incidents of my administration I am \nunconscious of intentional error, I am nevertheless too sensible of my \ndefects not to think it probable that I may have committed many errors. \nWhatever they may be, I fervently beseech the Almighty to avert or \nmitigate the evils to which they may tend. I shall also carry with me \nthe hope that my country will never cease to view them with indulgence \nand that, after forty-five years of my life dedicated to its service \nwith an upright zeal, the faults of incompetent abilities will be \nconsigned to oblivion, as myself must soon be to the mansions of rest.\n  Relying on its kindness in this as in other things, and actuated by \nthat fervent love towards it which is so natural to a man who views in \nit the native soil of himself and his progenitors for several \ngenerations, I anticipate with pleasing expectation that retreat, in \nwhich I promise myself to realize without alloy the sweet enjoyment of \npartaking in the midst of my fellow citizens the benign influence of \ngood laws under a free government--the ever favorite object of my \nheart, and the happy reward, as I trust, of our mutual cares, labors \nand dangers.\n                                                       Geo. Washington.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I thank very much the Senator from Maine, \nMr. King, for his fluent reading of President George Washington's \nFarewell Address, a message to the American people at the close of his \ngreat Presidency--the first Presidency.\n  The annual reading of the farewell address is one of the Senate's \nlongstanding traditions. The custom began in 1862 as a commemoration of \nthe 130th anniversary of President Washington's birth. It was intended \nto boost congressional morale during the Civil War.\n  As then-Senator Andrew Johnson--by the way, I have a great painting \nof President Johnson in my office. I always tell people who come to my \noffice to contrast that with the statue of President Johnson when he \nwas Vice President. I have the good fortune of having Andrew Johnson's \ndesk at the time Lincoln was assassinated. I have that beautiful piece \nof furniture in my office. It is stunningly beautiful. I haven't had a \nchance to talk about that before, so I took this opportunity.\n  As then-Senator Andrew Johnson of Tennessee said before the first \nrecitation of the address:\n\n       The time has arrived when we should recur back to the days, \n     the times, and doings of Washington and the patriots of the \n     Revolution, who founded the government under which we live.\n\n  In 1888--the 100th anniversary of the Constitution's ratification--\nthe Senate then observed the ritual, and every year since 1896 the \nSenate has marked Washington's birthday, honored his legacy, and \nrecurred back to those who founded the government under which we live, \nas we did today with the reading of Washington's Farewell Address.\n  As Senator King mentioned, President Washington prepared the address \nwith input from James Madison, America's fourth President, as well as \nAlexander Hamilton, the Nation's first Treasury Secretary. Similar to \nour Nation's founding documents, including the Constitution, the \nFarewell Address was a collaboration between the great minds of our \ncountry's formative years. Each year, for 118 years, the Senate selects \none of its Members, alternating parties, to deliver these valedictory \nremarks.\n  I am pleased the Senator from Maine, an avid student of history--and \nhe truly is--was able to carry on this important tradition today. \nSenator King has delivered unique aspects of history to our caucus and, \nof course, on the Senate floor he has no parallel to his being able to \npinpoint times of history. I admire him very much, as we all do.\n  With this bipartisan custom of honoring our Nation's founder fresh in \nour minds, the Senate embarks on a fresh work period today. I hope this \nsession will be marked by a tone of cooperation. Washington's \ncollaboration with Madison and Hamilton, among others, is proof enough \nthat when patriots collaborate with the country's good in mind the \nproduct is vastly improved. Too often over the past few years our two \nparties have found themselves working at odds instead of pulling \ntogether for a common purpose. I hope to change that this work period.\n  In addition to considering a number of important nominations, the \nSenate will consider legislation that should draw overwhelming support \nfrom Members of both parties, a bill sponsored by the Senator from \nVermont Mr. Sanders which expands health care and benefits for our \nNation's veterans.\n  I also hope Democrats and Republicans will work together to pass the \nchild care block development grant bill this period. It is bipartisan \nin nature, and I think it should pass. This measure ensures working \nfamilies have safe child care options, protecting both children and \nworking parents. This bipartisan bill, as well as the veterans measure \nwe will consider this week, will offer an opportunity for Democrats and \nRepublicans to find common ground and work together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/24/senate-section/article/S978-2", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S978]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCOMPREHENSIVE VETERANS HEALTH AND BENEFITS AND MILITARY RETIREMENT PAY \n               RESTORATION ACT OF 2014--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, it was a great privilege for me a few \nmoments ago to read George Washington's Farewell Address for a number \nof reasons; one, we learned in doing a little research on this \npractice--which as the majority leader indicated goes back more than \n100 years--that the last Senator from Maine to read President \nWashington's Farewell Address was Senator Ed Muskie, who read it on \nthis floor exactly 50 years ago. The last Senator to read before him \nfrom Maine was a freshman Senator in 1949, one Margaret Chase Smith. So \nif you believe that I am honored and humbled to be following in those \nfootsteps, you would be correct. This is one of the seminal documents \nin American history. It really ranks with the Federalist Papers, the \nDeclaration of Independence, and the Constitution itself. As the \nmajority leader indicated, it didn't simply spring from Washington's \nmind. It actually has an interesting history. It was originally drafted \nin 1792, at the end of Washington's first term, when he intended to \nretire. He kept wanting to retire all the way from the end of the \nRevolutionary War, and the public kept calling him back into service.\n\n  The first speech in 1792 was drafted by James Madison, who was the \nfather of our Constitution. Madison, Hamilton, and Jefferson convinced \nWashington that he couldn't leave at the end of his first term because \nthere was too much going on in the country. The country was still in \nits very formative years, and patriotism required him to stay for a \nsecond term, which he reluctantly did.\n  This speech was delivered in September of 1796--at the end of \nWashington's second term--and was based upon the original Madison \ndraft, edited and updated by Alexander Hamilton. I don't know about \nothers, but I wouldn't mind having Madison and Hamilton be my \nghostwriters--two of the greatest minds in American history and minds \nwhich didn't always agree about all the principles of what the country \nshould work toward, but they agreed to work with Washington on this \nremarkable address.\n  I would like to take a moment to talk about Washington's importance. \nI used to teach about leadership, and one of the fundamental principles \nI used to pound into my students was that execution is as important as \nvision--that\n\n[[Page S979]]\n\nhaving a good idea and a concept is not enough; it has to be executed \nwell in order to take root and actually achieve the benefits that are \nintended.\n  Washington was the execution of the vision of the Constitution. When \nhe took office, there was no United States. There was an idea, there \nwas a vision, there was a concept, but how it was actually put into \npractice was so much in the consequences of Washington's decisions on a \nday-to-day basis, starting with only running for two terms, starting \nwith when they asked him what the President should be called--and, of \ncourse, in Europe it was ``Your Excellency'' and all these fancy \ntitles--and he said: ``Mr. President'' is the proper appellation for an \nexecutive in a republican form of government. But Washington was \nessential to the success of this country because of his role as the \nperson who did the executing of the vision embodied in the Declaration \nof Independence and the Constitution.\n  The speech itself is amazing. In many parts, it could have been \nwritten last week. Several things come through to me very quickly.\n  One is his wonderful, inspiring, powerful, passionate commitment to \npublic service. He talked about his humbleness, his patriotism, his \nfeeling of duty in order to serve his country. Next, he is passionate \nabout national unity, and indeed his comments foreshadow the Civil War. \nHe talked about regional differences and the importance of unity not \nonly to the country as a whole but as benefits to the regions \nthemselves. He talks about the North and South and the East and the \nAtlantic. He is presaging the arguments of the 1830s, 1840s, and 1850s \nthat led to the attempted dissolutions of the country and passionately \nargued for the importance and significance not only as an abstract \nprinciple but in a very material, concrete interest, how important \nunion was.\n  Of course, as one of the two Independents in this body, it would be \nunbecoming for me to dwell at too great length on his imprecations \nabout the dangers of party to our society. I will let those speak for \nthemselves. But he was very worried about what he called factions and \nlater on in the address actually refers to them as ``parties.''\n  He also talks about the dangers of concentration of power and the \nusurpation of power by one branch or another of the government--again, \na fundamental principle and a realization of the important role the \nConstitution played in dividing powers between what he calls the \nsegments of the government.\n  I think one of the aspects that comes through in this document, as it \ncomes through in the Federalist Papers--which is the other sort of \nseminal explanation of how our government came to be and what the \nthinking is--is a brilliant in-depth understanding of human nature. He \nis talking to the ages in this speech. He is not talking to the \npolitics of 1796 or the politics of 1800s or the politics of the \nRevolutionary War; he is talking about human nature and the tendency \ntoward despotism, the tendency toward usurpation, the tendency toward \npower being accumulated in one place, and that comes through. Often he \ntalks about human nature. I think that was one of the most important \nand most salient characteristics of all of the founding individuals of \nthis country.\n  There is a very interesting provision on religion expressly stating \nthat religion is part of our heritage and that morality is part of our \nheritage. He has an interesting image: How can an oath mean anything if \nreligion doesn't mean anything?\n  Finally, there is a short but powerful passage about the importance \nof education. He calls it the ``general diffusion of knowledge.'' That \nis public education. The general diffusion of knowledge means everyone, \nnot just the elite. That is one of the secrets of America, the general \ndiffusion of knowledge.\n  Of course, one that speaks to us today is his admonition to cherish \nthe public credit and not get into debt, and if you get into debt \nbecause of a war, endeavor during peacetime to pay off the debt. I \nthink that is something we really need to take to heart and think \nabout, lest our debt swamp us in the future. He uses a phrase I \ncouldn't help but emphasize when I read the speech: that we should not \nungenerously throw upon posterity the burden which we ourselves ought \nto bear. In other words, we ought to pay our own bill, and right now in \nthis country we are not doing that.\n  He also has a sort of amusing passage about taxes, saying: Nobody \nlikes taxes. They are never fun. They are always inconvenient. But they \nare necessary. And he talks about how the members of the government \nhave to prepare the public for the idea that they have to pay for those \nexpenditures that are going to be entailed in the pursuit of any \ngovernmental enterprise.\n  Finally, he talks about foreign entanglements, probably the most \nfamous portion of the speech, where he talks about being neutral, the \nluxury we have being protected by huge oceans, and that we really \nshould avoid foreign entanglements.\n  Interestingly, on that provision I went back and read the comments. \nEach time a Senator reads the speech, there is a leather-bound book in \nwhich they put their notes, which I am going to be doing in a few \nminutes. I went back and read the notes of Ed Muskie and Margaret Chase \nSmith. In 1949 Margaret Chase Smith wrote in her note: I wonder if we \nshould be entering into NATO. This was indeed the first major foreign \ncommitment of American enterprise after Washington's speech. Margaret \nChase Smith obviously had second thoughts after she had read the speech \nhere on the Senate floor in 1949.\n  Finally, this speech is so powerful because it is so fresh and it \nspeaks to us today. My favorite quote from Mark Twain--and there are \nmany, but one which I suspect I will repeat on this floor at least half \na dozen times during my tenure here: History doesn't always repeat \nitself, but it usually rhymes. In this case, what Washington was \ntelling us in the fall of 1796 rhymes. It helps us to think through so \nmany of the issues which are confronting us here today and the wisdom \nof Washington expressing it. Remember, two of the most brilliant minds \nof that period--Hamilton and Madison--participated in the drafting of \nthe speech--words well worth remembering, a wonderful contribution to \nthe life of our country.\n  I thank the majority leader and the leadership for giving me the \nprivilege and the honor to read the speech today on behalf of my \ncolleagues.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n\n\n                           Energy Regulation\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I spent the morning over at the Supreme \nCourt. I was there to support the plaintiffs in a very important case \nagainst overreach by the Environmental Protection Agency. And here is \nwhy I say this case is important--not only for Kentucky but for the \nentire country.\n  First of all, it involves the all-important question of whether \nelections actually still matter in our country. I say that because 4 \nyears ago President Obama tried to push far-reaching energy-regulating \nlegislation through a Congress which was at the time completely \ndominated by his own party. He had a 40-seat majority in the House and \nhe had 60 votes in the Senate. The cap-and-trade bill passed the House \nbut did not pass the Senate. Even with then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi and a \nDemocratic majority leader in the Senate, he just couldn't get the \nvotes to enact the cap-and-trade bill. A Democrat-controlled Congress \nbeat back the President's plan to radically upend energy regulation in \nour country. They stopped the national energy tax.\n  Just a few months later the American people rendered a harsh verdict \non the Obama agenda in an election wipeout which the President himself \nreferred to as a ``shellacking.'' Others have described the November \n2010 midterm elections as a national restraining order.\n  My point is that this should have been the end of the story on the \nPresident's energy regulation plan. Instead, it was just the beginning.\n  The President's base wasn't about to back off from divisive policies \njust because they couldn't achieve them legislatively. So the far-left \nfringe pressured the White House to push similar regulations through \nthe back door, to achieve through Presidential fiat what they could not \nachieve through legislation. That, of course, is what the Obama \nadministration has done. The administration has attempted to use\n\n[[Page S980]]\n\nstatutes such as the Clean Air Act to regulate what those laws were \nnever intended to regulate and don't even mention.\n  The administration itself effectively acknowledges that if it \nactually followed the plain language of the Clean Air Act in regulating \ncarbon emissions, that would lead to ``absurd results.'' The \nadministration itself said that if they actually followed the plain \nlanguage of the Clean Air Act in regulating carbon emissions, it would \nlead to ``absurd results.''\n  So here is what the Obama administration decided to do about the \nabsurdity: just unilaterally rewrite parts of the law it didn't like, \non its own, without the input of Congress--the branch of government \nthat is supposed to write our laws. This kind of Presidential overreach \nshould concern every Member of this body, regardless of party. From a \nconstitutional perspective, this is a wholly troubling practice which \nneeds to be rectified by the High Court.\n  But this case is about more than just constitutional theory; it is \nalso about people's lives. Regardless of their constitutionality, the \nenergy regulations imposed by this administration are simply bad \npolicy. Coupled with cheaper natural gas, the administration's \nregulations have helped foster hardship in many of America's coal \ncommunities--hardship which has ruined lives and has hurt some of the \nmost vulnerable people in our country.\n  In Kentucky these regulations have helped devastate families who \nhaven't done anything wrong--other than to be on the wrong side of a \ncertain set of liberals who don't seem to approve of the hard work they \ndo to support their families.\n  When President Obama took office, there were more than 18,000 coal \njobs in Kentucky. At last count that figure has dropped to less than \n12,000--with eastern Kentucky coal employment dropping by 23.4 percent \nthis last year alone.\n  Let's be clear. These regulations are unfair, and they represent the \nconquest of liberal elites imposing their political will on working-\nclass Kentuckians who just want to feed their families. That is why I \nhave filed an amicus brief in the case I was referring to. It is on \nbehalf of the Kentuckians who are voiceless in this debate, the \nfamilies that find themselves on the losing end of a ``war'' that has \nbeen declared on them by their own government.\n  I held a listening session on these EPA regulations with coal miners \nin December, and many of their stories were heartbreaking. Listen to \nwhat Howard Abshire of Fedscreek had to say:\n\n       I say to you, Mister President of the United States . . . \n     We're hurting. You say you're the president of the people? \n     Well, we're people too. No one loves the mountains . . . more \n     than we do. We live here. We crawl between them. We get up \n     every morning and we go on top of a mountain in a strip job \n     in the cold rain, snow, to put bread on the table . . . Come \n     and look at our little children, look at our people, Mr. \n     President. You're not hurting for a job; you've got one. I \n     don't have one.\n\n  I hope the President is listening.\n  As far as the Supreme Court is concerned, it now has the opportunity \nto end this latest abuse of the Constitution by the Obama \nadministration. I hope the justices will make the right decision in \nthis case. Either way, I am going to keep fighting. I have already \nfiled a proposal that would allow Congress to have a say in the \nadministration's job-killing regulations.\n  It is time for Washington elites to think about ways to help, instead \nof hurt, the hard-working people of eastern and western Kentucky.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, along with my colleagues, I have been in \nplaces across the country this past week. Most of my time was spent in \nKansas, and certainly Kansans had a good opportunity to express to me \nsome of their worries and concerns about what is going on in \nWashington, DC.\n  One of the things that has become very dominant in those \nconversations is the concern that this administration--Washington, DC--\nthat the Constitution, as we learned it, as we were taught in high \nschool government classes, does not seem to be being complied with. The \nconcern is the constant efforts by this administration to do things \nunilaterally, to put in place executive orders and policies and \nregulations.\n  This has become a common conversation. It is pleasing to me that \nKansans care so much about the structure of our government, the \nfoundation that was created by the Framers of our Constitution, and \nthey have a genuine concern that the Constitution is being violated. \nOften the conversation is: What are you doing about it?\n  The topic I want to talk about today is just one more example. This \none has a reasonably positive ending, but I want to highlight something \nthat has transpired in Washington, DC, that started last May at the \nFederal Communications Commission.\n  I just learned about this recently, and it became much more of a \ncommon topic with knowledge across the country as a result of one of \nthe FCC Commissioners, Ajit Pai, and his opinion piece that appeared \nover the past few days in national publications.\n  What we learned was the Federal Communications Commission was \nconsidering--in fact, considered, put in place--a program in which they \nwere going to survey the broadcasters they regulate. They hired an \noutside firm, as I understand it, and questions were prepared that were \ngoing to be asked of people in newsrooms across the country.\n  The pilot program was organized to occur in South Carolina. Among the \nkinds of questions that were going to be asked in newsrooms across the \ncountry by the FCC were: What is the news philosophy of this station? \nWho decides which stories are covered--whether a reporter ever wanted \nto cover a story and was told they could not do so.\n  It seems to me whether you have a conservative or liberal bent or you \nare down the middle of the road, you ought to have great concern when \nthe agency that regulates the broadcasters decides they want to get \ninto the newsroom to discover how news is developed at that station. \nThat is not part of what the mandate of the FCC is, and it ought to \nraise genuine concerns from those who care about free speech. It \ncertainly raised those concerns from me.\n  I came back to Washington, DC, today with the intention of \nhighlighting this issue for my colleagues, making the American people \nmore aware of this tremendous affront to the First Amendment of the \nU.S. Constitution. The good news is that Chairman Wheeler at the FCC \nannounced just a couple days ago that this proposal, as it included \nquestions about how news was developed, was being withdrawn.\n  So in part I am here to express my genuine concern about how did we \nget so far as for anyone at the FCC or their contractor to think this \nis appropriate behavior for a regulator; and, secondly, I am here to \nsay that I am relieved and pleased that Chairman Wheeler has stepped in \nto withdraw those kinds of questions.\n  The argument was made that this is a voluntary survey, but as \nCommissioner Pai indicated in his opinion piece in the Wall Street \nJournal, it is hard to see how something the FCC is asking of a \nregulated broadcaster would be really considered voluntary.\n  The Commissioner says: Unlike the opinion surveys that many of us \nreceive on the phone or in the mail, in\n\n[[Page S981]]\n\nwhich we can hang up the phone or never answer the phone or we can toss \nthe survey into the trash, when the FCC sends someone to your station \nto ask you questions about how news is developed, it is hard for you to \nsay: I am not going to answer the question, when the FCC has control \nover your license.\n  So I am here to make certain that this kind of approach is something \nthat is in the past. I serve on the Appropriations subcommittee that is \nresponsible for the FCC's budget. When they come to tell us about their \nappropriations request, again I will thank Chairman Wheeler for \nwithdrawing these questions, but I want to make certain there is a \ngenuine concern on behalf of all of us in the Senate--Republicans and \nDemocrats, whatever brand of philosophy you claim to espouse or \nbelieve, you ought to be worried when the FCC is making inroads into \nhow news and opinion is formulated at broadcasting stations--television \nand radio--across the country.\n  So the speech I had intended to give raising this topic is only given \nnow in part. It is my view that every American citizen has certain \ncivic responsibilities. Not just us Members of the Senate, every \nAmerican citizen's primary responsibility as a citizen is to make \ncertain we pass on to the next generation of Americans a country in \nwhich the freedoms and liberties guaranteed by our Constitution are \nprotected throughout the history of our Nation into the future.\n  So I ask my colleagues to be ever vigilant as we see an ever \nencroaching Washington, DC, administration, even Congress, intruding in \nthe lives of the American citizens, particularly as it relates to their \nopportunities for free speech.\n  I will be back later in the week to talk about other intrusions by \nthe Federal Government into free speech and political advocacy. But \nagain, Mr. President, thank you for the opportunity to be on the Senate \nfloor today to highlight what I think would have been an egregious \nviolation of the Constitution by one of our Federal agencies.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. KING). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/24/senate-section/article/S981-1", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S981]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 1752, S. 1917\n\n  Mr. REID.

Is there objection?\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, the Gillibrand and McCaskill bills that the \nmajority leader talked about were filed as amendments to the Defense \nauthorization bill that the Senate passed in December of last year. \nThey each have significant bipartisan support.\n  The majority leader filled the tree on that bill and blocked \namendments on both sides of the aisle, and therefore the Senate did not \nvote on these bills last year. There are hundreds of other amendments \nthat were also blocked.\n  Would the Senator modify this request to include a vote, at a 60-vote \nthreshold, on another proposal that was blocked from consideration? The \nKirk amendment No. 2295 was filed to the Defense bill. It would impose \nadditional sanctions against the government of Iran if it violates the \ninterim agreement with the United States. Will the Senator include a \nvote on the Kirk amendment as part of this agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the majority leader agree to the \nmodification?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I reserve the right to object. There is no \nmore important national security concern today than keeping Iran from \ngetting a nuclear weapons capability. For our own national security and \nfor that of Israel, our ally, we are committed to stopping Iran from \ngetting that capability.\n  That is why President Obama has entered into international \nnegotiations with Iran. The Senate has a long tradition of \nbipartisanship on this issue, including numerous strong bipartisan \nvotes that we put in place to initiate the very sanctions that have \nbrought Iran to the negotiating table.\n  In summation, I am terribly disappointed that my Republican friends \nare trying to turn this vital national security concern into a partisan \nissue by trying to inject it into a setting where it is clearly not \nrelevant.\n  I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Is there objection to the original request?\n  Mr. MORAN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have come to the floor to speak about my \ntwo recent fact-finding trips to Cuba. During the first trip, which was \nan incredible journey across the nation of Cuba, I had conversations \nwith Cuban citizens, farmers, doctors, nurses, students, a very broad \ncross section of the Cuban citizenry, also some government officials.\n  The second trip involved a 1-day visit to the U.S. Detention Center \nat Guantanamo Bay. I would like to begin with details of my first trip \nwhich took place during January's recess in the Senate. First, I wish \nto publicly thank Ambassador Cabanas, the Cuban--well, I guess since we \ndo not have an embassy--he has the rank of Ambassador, but he is in \ncharge of the Cuban interest section here. I wish to thank him and his \nstaff personally for arranging this and overcoming a lot of difficult \nobstacles to make sure we could take this trip.\n  I guess I am the first Senator or Congressman to do this kind of a \ntrip. First, we flew from Miami down to Santiago de Cuba. We spent 2 or \n3 days in Santiago de Cuba. Then we drove from Santiago to Holguin, to \nCamaguey, Santa Clara and into Havana. So we traversed about 700 miles \nduring the week's period we were there, seeing most of the entire \nnation of Cuba.\n  I have not seen--I have not been up to the Pinar del Rio out here in \nthe western part. That is one part I have not been. I had visited as a \nSenator 11 years before, but that was only in Havana. This time I \nwanted to see the country. I wanted to see ordinary Cubans in small \ntowns and communities, to get a feel for what it was like in the rest \nof the country.\n  Most people just go to Havana. That is akin to going to New York City \nand saying you have been to America. It is not the same. There is a lot \nmore country to Cuba, a lot more things going on than just Havana.\n  It is clear to me this is a time that is very important in Cuban-\nAmerican relations. So I just wanted to share some of the insights I \ngained during my travels across this Nation of 11 million people.\n\n[[Page S982]]\n\n  As I said, I arrived in Santiago on January 17. Over the course of \nthe week, we traveled up through the countryside. Again, I wish to \nthank Bernardo Toscano, a Cuban who had been in the United States I \nthink three or four times. He had been in Washington two or three times \nworking in their interest section and I think once or twice in New York \nwith their interest section in New York.\n  So we met him. He came with us to Santiago and then served as a host \nand was with us all during our trip.\n  Bernardo--I always say, he is an Italian Cuban, Bernardo Toscano--\nagain, another indication that there are a lot of different \nnationalities that people in Cuba have.\n  Bernardo was so gracious, so kind, so informative in taking care of \nthings for us. He informed me that he had been to visit 20 States in \nthe United States. So he has been to 20 States. Yet a U.S. citizen \ncannot go to Cuba to see Cuba. But the trip we took was fascinating. \nAll along the way, from Santiago all up the way, we saw tour buses--\ntour buses with people.\n  They looked like North Americans, but in fact they were from England \nand Germany and Sweden and Canada, mostly Canada, a lot of Canadians. \nBut there were people traveling, visiting different things. Canada \nright now, they have a direct flight from Toronto to Santa Clara. Then \nyou get on a bus and go out here, to those wonderful beaches out here, \nwhich we did not visit. A lot of Canadians and a lot of Europeans go \nthere but not Americans. I will have more to say about that.\n  But, again, I wish to thank so many people of Cuba, so many people I \nsaw, for the warm welcome, the hospitality they extended to me, my \nwife, my traveling companions, and my staff as we traveled throughout \ntheir country.\n  Prior to my election--long before my election to Congress, I was a \nNavy pilot stationed at Guantanamo Bay for 18 months. So this was \ninteresting to see the rest of Cuba other than just Guantanamo Bay, \nwhich is right down here. This is the Guantanamo Bay area. It is right \nnear Santiago de Cuba.\n  In fact, landing at the airport in Santiago was quite interesting. \nOne of my traveling companions I was with was a Navy pilot with me when \nI was stationed in Guantanamo. He is Cuban American. We remembered how \nwe were always kind of warned when we were out flying not to get \nmistaken between Santiago and Guantanamo because the runways look \nexactly the same.\n  They are both east-west runways, and they are right there on the \nocean. There is a bay on both of them, and if we weren't careful, we \nmight land on one rather than the other.\n  All that time that we were flying out of there we never went to \nSantiago--of course, we couldn't--but we used to see it as we patrolled \nthe skies around Cuba. So now landing at Santiago was kind of an \ninteresting flashback in time to when I was a young Navy pilot.\n  I wanted to get a firsthand look at the lives of ordinary people \noutside of Havana. Particularly, I have long advocated in this country \nfor a strong public health infrastructure, and I wanted to examine the \nstrengths and weaknesses of Cuba's public health system.\n  When we first arrived in Santiago, we went to visit the cancer \nhospital, which provides treatment for people from across the entire \ncountry. I found the doctors there and the leaders of that hospital to \nbe very dedicated public servants. The institution has struggled to \novercome the devastation of Hurricane Sandy, which hit Santiago very \nhard. Again, it would be mutually beneficial for both Cuba and the \nUnited States if we had better relations and if we had better trade \nrelations with Cuba. They might need some medical equipment that we \nhave, but we could also learn from them on some of the processes and \nprocedures they use in treating cancer patients.\n  I was struck by one thing. This was Friday afternoon, and we were \ngoing through the hospital--yes, they have all the necessary equipment, \nthe radiation machines and all the equipment they need to do radiation, \ninfusion for chemotherapy. They have all of that. As I said, the \nhospital suffered some damage from Hurricane Sandy and that hasn't been \nall fixed yet--but what was interesting, as I was going through the \nhospital, I noticed a lot of empty beds.\n  As we were leaving the hospital, I said to the director: Where are \nall of the people? It looks like you have a lot of empty beds.\n  She said: Oh, it is Friday afternoon. We send them home for the \nweekend.\n  I said: Really?\n  She said a very interesting thing to me.\n  She said: Yes. You come to the hospital to get cured, but you go home \nto get well.\n  I thought about that, because not too long ago I had an instance in \nDes Moines, IA, where I had visited a friend of mine who was seriously \nill with cancer--he has since passed away--but he wanted to leave. \nLiterally, he wanted to leave the hospital for a Sunday meeting of the \nMethodist Church. He was a Methodist minister and the hospital wouldn't \nlet him leave.\n  They said: If you leave, then you have to be all readmitted again \nthrough Medicare, and Medicare will cut off the payments and all of \nthat.\n  There was all of this, and they wouldn't even let him leave for a few \nhours to go halfway across the city to partake in an award he was \nsupposed to receive.\n  I thought about that when I saw this hospital and she said: No, we \nsend people home for the weekend and then they come back on Monday.\n  There are interesting things such as that that we pick up. There is a \nlot the two of us could learn together.\n  In Camaguey--we stopped in Holguin, which is also kind of a small, \nrural community, again with a very kind of comprehensive clinic system. \nAs we drove on up the road to Camaguey, in Camaguey we had an \ninteresting visit. We visited the home of Dr. Carlos Finlay. Now some \npeople might say who is Dr. Carlos Finlay?\n  Dr. Carlos Finlay was the person who discovered the origin of yellow \nfever that is transmitted by a certain mosquito. A lot of people didn't \nbelieve him. They just did not believe him, but he persevered. Later on \nit was a person who is sort of famous around here--at least we know the \nname, Dr. Walter Reed--who, when they were building the Panama Canal, \ndiscovered that Dr. Finlay was right, it was a transmission by \nmosquitoes.\n  We were able to visit his home and there is again a whole cadre of \npeople there doing research on other transmissions of illnesses; for \nexample, the transmission of different diseases by mosquitoes there, \nbut again there is a heavy focus on medical research.\n  When we went to Santa Clara, we visited another clinic there. They \ncall them polyclinics. In other words, they do a lot of different \nthings. It is sort of what we might think of in this country as a \ncommunity health center--it is a community health center. Unlike our \ncommunity health centers, people don't have to just go there to seek \nhelp. The community health centers, the polyclinics, go out there. They \ngo out in very rural areas to make sure kids have their vaccinations \nand to make sure people have checkups.\n  One of the reasons they have such a low infant mortality rate--which \nsome have said is lower than ours and is, in fact, one of the lowest in \nthe world, and they have one of the lowest rates of mortality of \nchildren zero to 5--is because when a woman gets pregnant in Cuba, she \nis visited immediately. As soon as they know about it, she gets visited \nby a nurse; visited by health officials who put her on a better diet, \nmake sure she doesn't smoke, provide supportive services for her during \nher pregnancy, and make sure there is someone there for the birth. For \nthat child, everything is covered from the earliest time of pregnancy \nthrough early childhood.\n  It is a hands-on approach. It is going out serving people rather than \nmaking people come in to them. This is one of the key features of what \nCuba has done. They have made the practice of medicine a public service \nin all aspects. Whether one is a doctor, a surgeon, a nurse or various \nother health practitioners, it is a public service.\n  Cuba has put a great deal of emphasis on prevention, prevention of \nillness. In fact, I must say I was surprised in Cuba that they have \ngone on an antismoking campaign.\n  I was out one night in Santiago. We were out to dinner. We came back \nat about 10 at night, and I noticed a street was blocked off. There \nwere a lot of people out there, and I asked Mr. Toscano what that was.\n  He asked somebody else and said: Well, in Santiago every Friday and\n\n[[Page S983]]\n\nSaturday night they block off long streets and they have festivals, \nstreet parties.\n  I said: I want to go there.\n  So we parked our car and we walked out. We didn't have any guards or \nanybody around us. We just walked down the street. It was a mile long. \nIt was a long street. Late at night, we went down the street, and along \nthe sides of the street there were people cooking foods. There were \nlittle kiosks. We even saw one whole hog on a spit being turned, people \neating. There were families with kids out there and a lot of young \npeople.\n  There were a lot of young people out there looking for other young \npeople on Saturday night. There was music. Every other block had some \nmusic, and it was just kind of a wonderful atmosphere.\n  I noticed two things that I was looking for during my walk down and \nback--how many people were smoking. I counted four people were smoking. \nThere were thousands of people up and down these streets, and I counted \nfour people who were smoking. There may have been more, but that is all \nI could find.\n  During this entire walk, with all of these people out in the street, \n10:30 at night, Saturday night, I saw one policeman, and he didn't have \nany firearms. He just had a stick. He just kind of walked around with a \nstick. There was this wonderful thing, but the idea that no one was \nsmoking, kind of fascinated me.\n  But I digress. I want to talk about the community-based health system \nand keeping people healthy. What they have said is it is not just the \ndoctors' offices--that is only one component of keeping people \nhealthy--it is the entire community, the schools, the community-based \napproach that keeps people healthy. That is something we could learn \nfrom and do in this country.\n  During my visit with health care professionals, they explained that \nin the early 1980s Cuba moved to a comprehensive family practice model \nthroughout the country, with doctors, nurses, and other health \nprofessionals working in teams integrated into the neighborhoods where \nthey live and they work. This has become the pillar of primary health \ncare in Cuba and obviously has contributed to significant improvements \nin health outcomes. I think their longevity, lifespan, is now even \nlonger than ours in the United States.\n  These changes and others have helped Cuba improve its health care \nsystem. There are several indicators of this. For instance, by the end \nof 2013, Cuba reported that its infant mortality rate had declined to \n4.2 for 1,000 live births, the lowest in its history and one of the \nlowest in the world. By comparison, the United States had an infant \nmortality rate of 5.9 per 1,000 live births.\n  Also, over the past couple of decades, Cuba has increased the number \nof medical personnel it sends abroad to serve on medical missions, \nfilling critical needs in underserved countries. There are currently \nnearly 44,000 Cuban medical personnel working in many countries around \nthe world.\n  Last year I took a trip to Namibia and South Africa, and I saw Cuban \ndoctors working there--actually, sometimes alongside our own doctors \nfrom the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Interesting. We \ncan work with them there, but we can't work with them here--so they do. \nThey have sent them all over the world.\n  Also, in Havana I visited a very interesting place I had never heard \nabout. It is called the Latin American School of Medicine. The Latin \nAmerican School of Medicine is about 20 miles west of Havana. It was an \nold naval academy. Evidently, President Castro decided they didn't need \na naval academy, so they closed it down and made it a medical school. \nStudents come from not only all over Latin America but all around the \nworld to go to medical school.\n  Believe it or not, there are students from America going to school in \nHavana--going to medical school. This blew my mind. I never heard of \nsuch a thing.\n  This is what I found out. In the year 2000, the Congressional Black \nCaucus had a trip to Havana. During that trip they met with President \nCastro. One of the Congressmen, Bennie Thompson from Mississippi, had \nsaid something about how difficult it was for them to get people in \ncertain areas of Mississippi. He said there were large areas in his \nhome district that didn't have a single physician. Also, they talked \nabout how expensive it was to go to medical school.\n  So President Castro invited American students to come there, and they \nworked it out. I think the first class started, if I am not mistaken, \nin 2002. I believe that was the first class. Now, believe it or not, \nthere are 108 U.S. students going to this school.\n  I didn't see them all because a lot of them, during their schooling, \ngo out and work in hospitals, clinics, and different things such as \nthat. I met with six of them and it was very interesting. From the left \nis Michael, who was from California; Nikolai from Queens in New York; \nKimberly, also from northern California; Ariel was from Michigan; Olive \nis from Wisconsin; and Sarah is from New Mexico.\n  All of them are first-year students except for Sarah, who is a third-\nyear student, watches over them, and is their tutor or their leader.\n  There are requirements before you go there. They have to be from an \nextremely low-income family and cannot afford to go to medical school. \nThey have to be a college graduate and graduated with one of the \nsciences, such as biology or one of the physical sciences, something \nlike that. So they must have graduated from college. Third, they have \nto agree that when they graduate they are going to come back to America \nand work in an underserved area.\n  Here is the deal: Every one of these students is going to medical \nschool. Do you know what it costs them? Zero. Not one cent. The 108 \nstudents pay nothing. We have over 90 graduates of this school back \nhere in America right now.\n  And that is another thing: Whenever we traveled over to Cuba, I went \nto the clinics and I talked to health people. I always asked them: What \ndid it cost you to go to school? Do you have student debt? No. Medical \nschool is free. There is no cost to going to medical school--none \nwhatsoever. So here are these students, who would never be able to go \nto medical school and absorb that cost, getting a free medical \neducation. So again, here is another of the things we could be working \nwith Cuba on if we had a little better policy with Cuba.\n  The six students I met with are happy and grateful to have the \nopportunity. They were just out of their first 6 months. For the first \n6 months all they do is learn Spanish--Spanish immersion. They had just \nfinished that and they were very happy about that, and that now they \nwould actually start studying medicine. Again, so many different \nthings, but mainly I focused on health care and what they were doing on \nhealth care.\n  I also met with Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez. I had a long lunch \nwith him, their former Ambassador to the United Nations and now their \nForeign Minister. We had a long discussion about our relationship with \nCuba.\n  He himself said it is time we have a new relationship with the United \nStates. It is time for a new course. We can't be bound by old history. \nWe need to make new history. I think that is what I would like to echo \nhere; that we do have a constructive new policy between Cuba and \nAmerica.\n  The last thing I did was to pay a visit to Mr. Alan Gross. Right \nhere, Mr. Alan Gross. This is my staff member, Rosemary Gutierrez, who \nwent with us on this trip and made sure what I was hearing was correct \nin terms of Spanish, since I don't speak Spanish fluently. Mr. Gross, \nas you know, has been in prison now for over 4 years. I am hopeful he \nwill be released soon on humanitarian grounds. I will be working with \nour government to engage with the Cuban Government in serious and \nsustained talks to resolve his situation and other related issues.\n  I might add what we are holding in this photo is a little chain. What \nhe does in his spare time is he puts things together out of bottle \ncaps, plastic bottle caps. He is now serving a 15-year prison sentence. \nI spent well over an hour with him. I think he is holding up pretty \nwell, under the circumstances. Obviously, he is not very happy. Who \nwould be happy, being locked up like that? He is confined to his room \nfor 23 hours of the day, but he is allowed outside. He told me he walks \n10,000 steps a\n\n[[Page S984]]\n\nday and does 50 pullups for an hour each day. So he makes these \nbracelets out of the rings from the water bottles. He also reads and \nwatches television. He says he has television and things to read.\n  I know other Senators have visited with him in Havana, but it is time \nto bring Mr. Gross home. It is time to end this. It is time we do some \ndealing with the Cuban Government on his issue and on some other \nrelated issues that I don't mean to go into right now but the \nadministration knows of which I speak. There is no reason why we can't \nreturn Mr. Gross to this country this year, and I am hopeful that will \nbe done.\n  It is time to recognize that Cuba is our neighbor; that it is not \nonly our neighbor but it is a sovereign nation and we have to work to \nimprove on this relationship with a country 90 miles from our shore. It \nis obvious to visitors, the Cuban people and the American people have a \ngreat deal in common. In all my travels through Cuba, as we stopped at \nvarious places--stopped to have refreshments here and there, stopped in \nsmall communities--I noticed that every small town we went through or \nby had a baseball diamond or maybe two baseball diamonds. It is amazing \nhow many people play baseball in Cuba. They have town teams, and towns \nwill have two teams, one section of town against the other section--\nkids all playing baseball. Wouldn't it be great if we had some kind of \nrelationship where some of our small baseball teams in the United \nStates could go to Cuba and play? We know they have some pretty good \nplayers because some have come here to play in our Major Leagues.\n  In every place I stopped, and with all the people we talked to, I \nnever heard one Cuban--not one--ever say a bad thing about the United \nStates of America or about the American people. I never heard it. I \nexpected some would say: You know, you are doing bad things to Cuba \nwith your embargo and we don't like Americans for this. I expected to \nhear that. I never heard it. Do you know the thing I heard most often \nfrom ordinary Cubans? Where are you from? I said: I am from Iowa and I \nwork in Washington, DC. The usual response was: Oh. Do you know my \ncousin so-and-so, who lives in St. Louis or my cousin so-and-so who \nlives here or there? It seems as though every Cuban has a cousin in \nAmerica someplace. One woman said her son lives in Michigan.\n  There is this sense we have a lot in common, and I never felt any \nanimosity whatsoever. It is clear we have a lot in common. We are both \nnations of hard-working people who want access to basic health care and \na good education for our kids.\n  That is another thing: I didn't spend a lot of time looking at \neducation, but it was clear to me the literacy rate in Cuba is very \nhigh. Some have said it is the highest of all the Latin American \ncountries. I can't attest to that. But it is clear that education is a \nvery important part of the Cuban structure.\n  Over the years, I have met with many Iowans, business people, \ndiplomats who want to improve our relationship with Cuba to facilitate \nmore trade and travel with our neighbors. Even with the limited opening \nwith Cuba's markets, we have seen tremendous benefits from agricultural \nexports to Cuba from my State of Iowa and other parts of the United \nStates. It is only our official policy that stands in the way of much \ngreater exports of U.S. commodities and food products plus related \nagricultural machinery, technology, and so forth.\n  Here is another thing I noticed: We went through a lot of farms and \nwe saw a lot of agriculture--mostly sugarcane, but other things too--a \nlot of cattle. This whole section of Cuba here, in this area of the \nmap, is almost all cattle; livestock--goats and cattle--and other \nagriculture. I want to say this: This is the first and only country I \nhave ever visited where I went out to see agricultural entities and \nhave never seen a John Deere tractor or a John Deere implement of any \nkind. I can go to China. I went almost to the Tibetan border in China \nand saw John Deere equipment. There is John Deere equipment in Africa, \nJohn Deere equipment in Pakistan, and India. If we had better trade, I \nmight see some more John Deere implements down in Cuba, which would be \ngreat for their productivity.\n  We would also benefit from a two-way trade. There are many things \ngrown in Cuba we have appetites for, such as fruits and vegetables--\nfresh fruits that consumers in our country would enjoy.\n  Again, I think Americans really do want to change our policy. I have \nhere the Atlantic Council. On February 11 they released the results of \ntheir latest poll which found that 56 percent of the American people \nsupport the normalization of relations with Cuba, including 63 percent \nof Floridians who want to normalize relations with Cuba. I think we \nhave had a policy of isolation for far too long. As this latest poll \nindicates, the American people think so too. After being in place for \nover 50 years, this embargo has not been effective in any way. Our \npolicy has benefited neither the Cuban people nor the American people.\n  Both the United States and Cuba have recently taken steps to allow \nfor greater travel. It is a significant step forward. The Cuban \nGovernment has eliminated its long-standing policy of requiring an exit \npermit and a letter of invitation for Cubans to travel abroad. This \nchange in policy has allowed for prominent dissidents and human rights \nactivists to travel abroad from Cuba.\n  Additionally, restrictions on remittances have been lifted. I think \nremittances now from Cuban-Americans and their families are now their \nsecond largest export or second to sugar.\n  The United States and Cuba have resumed low-level talks on migration, \nsearch and rescue operations, and other issues. I might mention one \nother. When I was in Guantanamo a week or so ago, with a group led by \nSenator Tester, Captain Nettleton, who is the base commander, took me \naround the base. I had been stationed there, as I said, about 53 years \nago, so I kind of wanted to see some of the old places. As he was \ndriving me around, he took me up to the gate, and coming back I said: \nDo you ever have contact with Cubans? He said: Oh yes, we do. In fact, \n2 years ago the last of the Cubans retired from working at Guantanamo. \nThey lived in Cuba but worked on Guantanamo just until 2 years ago.\n  He told me that recently he went to visit the hospital in Guantanamo \nCity. Now that is not on the map but it is right outside of Guantanamo \nBay, our naval base. He went to visit the hospital there because they \nhave a burn unit. They do not have a burn unit on Guantanamo at our \nfacility. So they have made a handshake deal and an agreement that if \nwe have burn victims on Guantanamo, we can take them to the hospital in \nGuantanamo City. Things like that are happening and are kind of opening \nthe door, so we should build on these small but positive changes in the \nrelationship.\n  The United States should abandon its policy of seeking Cuba's \nisolation. We should lift all restrictions on travel to Cuba. What is \nour justification for denying Americans the right to travel to Cuba? We \nshould allow for all U.S. citizens wishing to go to Cuba to do so. This \nwould expose more Cubans to our young people, our ideas and \ninteractions.\n  When you go to Cuba you see a lot of Canadians, a lot of Europeans, \nand now Cuban-Americans can go to Cuba freely. If you are Cuban-\nAmerican you can get on one of about four to seven daily flights from \nFort Lauderdale, Miami, and Key West to Cuba. If you are a U.S. citizen \nyou can't get on one of those unless you have a permit from the U.S. \nGovernment. If you are a Cuban-American, you can get on the plane and \ngo to Cuba and come back, and more and more are doing so. As of last \nyear, I believe Americans are now the second largest group to visit \nCuba, but they are all Cuban-Americans. We have this crazy policy. If \nyou are Cuban-American you can go to Cuba, but if you are not, you \ncan't. Someone please explain that one to me.\n  It is time for us to chart a new course. Our relationship is frozen \nin a Cold War mentality that has not achieved its goals and made it \ndifficult to move forward on issues that encourage more trade and \ntravel between our two countries. Our policy also fails to promote more \nopenness and respect for internationally recognized human rights.\n  Multiple layers of sanctions remain in place, making it difficult for \nU.S. businesses to trade with Cuba. Both the Cuban people and U.S. \nnational interests would benefit from a modernized and sensible policy. \nNow is not the\n\n[[Page S985]]\n\ntime to be bound and held back by history. It is time to make new \nhistory. It is time to begin a new chapter in the relations of our two \ncountries.\n  I hope the Obama administration and the Cuban Government will seize \nthis opportunity to do just that--to modernize, to move ahead, \nrecognizing always and foremost that Cuba is a sovereign nation. They \nwill not be dominated by America or any other country. We have to deal \nwith them just as we do any other sovereign nation.\n\n\n                               Guantanamo\n\n  I will conclude by saying I had an opportunity on a trip with Senator \nTester and two other Senators to visit the Guantanamo Bay detention \ncenter. We toured Camps 5 and 6, which house the majority of the \ndetainees held at Guantanamo. We also had a tour of the facilities that \nhold high-value detainees, including Khalid Shaikh Mohammed.\n  Based on my own observations on my tour of Guantanamo and reports I \nread about previous conditions, it does appear that detainees are being \ntreated more humanely now than previously and that conditions at \nGuantanamo are in line with how the detainees would be treated if they \nwere held in the United States.\n  However, this trip reinforced my long-held conviction that the \ndetention facility at Guantanamo should be closed as soon as possible. \nIts very existence--remote, offshore, not subject to the laws of the \nUnited States--makes it impossible to justify its existence. That is \nwhy I introduced a bill to close the facility as far back as 2007. That \nis why I continue to believe Federal courts and Federal prisons are \nfully capable of dealing with these detainees.\n  The indefinite detention of hundreds of individuals--some for over 13 \nyears at this point--has harmed our image abroad, complicated relations \nwith friendly countries, and I think really violates the basic \nprinciples of our Constitution. It is not acceptable. And the existence \nof this facility cannot be justified when there is an alternative--and \nthere is.\n  I am not alone in advocating for this prison's closure. Military and \nforeign policy officials across the political spectrum have made it \nclear that we must close the detention center at Guantanamo. Leaders \nincluding Colin Powell, Henry Kissinger, James Baker, Madeline \nAlbright, Warren Christopher, Robert Gates, David Petraeus, and CIA \nDirector John Brennan have all said closing the detention center at \nGuantanamo is critical to our national security.\n  Yet I have no illusions regarding these detainees. Some are extremely \ndangerous terrorists with the determination and the ability, if given \nthe opportunity, to inflict great harm on the United States and its \ncitizens. But, indeed, prisons in the United States are already holding \nmany of the world's most dangerous terrorists--criminals who have been \nfound guilty in a court of law. These include Ramzi Yousef, the \nmastermind of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing; Zacarias Moussaoui, \nthe 9/11 coconspiritor; and Richard Reid, the Shoe Bomber. If we can \nsuccessfully try these terrorists in courts and hold them in our \nprisons, we can do the same with the Guantanamo detainees.\n  In closing, I think it is long past due that we reexamine our policy \ntoward Cuba. I call upon the Obama administration to not waste any more \ntime. Get to it. Let's change our policy. Let's start making new \nhistory and not be detained by the old history. Secondly, it is time \nthat we close the prison in Guantanamo.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Johnson\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, as I have every year since I came to the \nSenate now 8 years ago, I rise today to commemorate Black History Month \nby paying tribute to a distinguished American. This year we are \nprivileged to recognize Willie F. Johnson, a man who has enriched both \nthe Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and our Nation through civic \nengagement and successful entrepreneurial endeavors.\n  Willie Johnson's contributions both as a citizen and as the founder \nand chairman of PRWT Services, Inc.--one of the oldest and most \nsignificant minority-owned businesses in the United States--are a \ncredit to both him and to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Today I am \nproud to share some of Willie's achievements and the examples he and \nPRWT have set of responsible corporate citizenship. PRWT does it all. \nIt employs over 1,500 people, makes money for its shareholders, and \nstill manages to give back to its community and its other stakeholders \nto an extent that few other for-profit companies ever achieve.\n  Throughout his career, Willie Johnson has remained committed to his \nroots in social services and has never lost sight of the importance of \nthe social and community impact of his work. Willie Johnson's \nprofessional life stands as a testament to his values.\n  After graduating from Allen University in South Carolina with a \ndegree in sociology, he earned a master's of social work from the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania while serving as a house parent for the \nPhiladelphia Development Center, a residential facility for young \noffenders. Willie pursued a long career in social services after \ngraduating, working for 18 years as the regional commissioner of the \nOffice of Social Services in the southeastern region of Pennsylvania, \ndirector of Youth Services Coordinating Office for the city of \nPennsylvania, and finally as executive director of the Office of \nEmployment and Training under the Office of the Mayor of Philadelphia. \nSo he has served both our Commonwealth and the city of Philadelphia in \nthat work.\n  After years of serving the people of Philadelphia as a social \nadministrator, Willie's commitment to job creation led him to consider \nwhether he might be better able to benefit his community as an \nentrepreneur. So in 1983 he worked with partners to found Fidelity \nSystems, a cable/line construction company that hired and trained local \nresidents to lay cable and work in equipment warehouses. Through this \nwork, Willie became acquainted with the president of the Lockheed \nMartin company, who was interested in using technology to help State \nand local governments manage their businesses.\n  In August of 1988 Willie joined with Paul Dandridge, Raymond A. \nSaulino, and William Turner to establish PRWT Services, Inc., which we \nnow know by the acronym PRWT. PRWT received its first contract in its \nfirst year, providing parking services for the city of Philadelphia. \nThe company would go on to secure a significant contract from Lockheed \nMartin, providing customer service and back-office staff to support \nLockheed's technology, drawing on the workforce management expertise of \nWillie Johnson and his partners to better manage these resources.\n  Over the years, PRWT expanded to provide business process outsourcing \nservices for a variety of industries as well as serve many State and \nmunicipal governments nationwide. During Willie Johnson's two-decade \ntenure as CEO, PRWT grew to employ more than 1,500 workers in eight \nStates and the District of Columbia.\n  In 2001 PRWT acquired U.S. Facilities, Inc. That acquisition marked \none of the first purchases of a publicly traded company by a minority-\nrun business.\n  In 2008 a PRWT subsidiary became the first minority-owned \nmanufacturer of pharmaceutical ingredients in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  In 2008, after experiencing a 120-percent increase in revenues, PRWT \nmade the decision to become a publicly traded and owned company. \nMindful of their significant role as a successful minority-owned \nbusiness, Willie and his partners made their first public offering \nwhile maintaining majority shares to ensure that the company remained \nminority owned and run. Willie remains chairman of PRWT's board of \ndirectors, which has maintained its leadership and minority-owned \nstatus throughout the process of diversifying.\n  As PRWT has expanded, Willie and his partners have maintained a focus \non the community impact of their work. PRWT is generous with charitable \ncontributions and investments and encourages its employees to volunteer \nand remain engaged in their communities. Willie has been just as \nengaged and committed to service outside of his work with PRWT. He \nserves on the boards of a number of national and Pennsylvania-based \norganizations,\n\n[[Page S986]]\n\nincluding the Philadelphia Tribune, which, as we all know, has been a \nleader of the Black press throughout its history, as well as a variety \nof educational institutions, including his alma mater Allen University, \nthe Cheyney University Foundation, Girard College, and Community \nCollege of Philadelphia. Willie has contributed his significant \nbusiness expertise to the boards of the African American Chamber of \nCommerce and the Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce, where he serves as a \nmember of the executive committee. He has also continued his commitment \nto employment and job creation through his prior service as chair of \nthe Transitional Work Corporation and membership on the Philadelphia \nWorkforce Development Corporation Board.\n  It should surprise no one that Willie Johnson and PRWT have been \nconsistently recognized for their significant accomplishments and \ncontributions. In the year 2001 PRWT received the U.S. Conference of \nMayors Excellence in Public/Private Partnership Award. Black Enterprise \nMagazine has ranked PRWT in the top 100 for the past 9 years and in \n2009 named them the Industrial/Service Company of the Year. In that \nsame year, 2009, Ernst & Young honored Willie as Entrepreneur of the \nYear in the Greater Philadelphia region.\n  Willie has noted that ``there is something very unique about Black \nenterprise: most Black enterprises develop and grow within their own \ncommunity and within their own region because they are depending on \ntheir relationships.'' It is this dedication to community engagement \nwhich is a critical part of Willie Johnson's story and the story of \nPRWT, and it is that community engagement and commitment that we honor \ntoday.\n  Willie Johnson has been a dedicated public servant, a trailblazer for \nBlack business enterprise, and a deeply engaged citizen. Willie's path \nhas touched the lives of many in our Commonwealth and our country. In \nbuilding a world-class entrepreneurial, diversified company, while also \nremaining a responsible corporate citizen dedicated to community \nbetterment, Willie and his partners have built PRWT into an example of \nthe best corporations have to offer. So today, as we come to the end of \nthe month that commemorates Black history, we express our gratitude for \nthe important work Willie Johnson has done throughout his life in \nservice to the people of Philadelphia, the Commonwealth of \nPennsylvania, and our great Nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in morning \nbusiness for up to 12 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/24/senate-section/article/S986-1", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S986-S987]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  CUBA\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, a few minutes ago the body was treated to a \nreport by the Senator from Iowa about his recent trip to Cuba. It \nsounds as if he had a wonderful trip visiting what he described as a \nreal paradise. He bragged about a number of things he learned on his \ntrip to Cuba which I would like to address briefly.\n  He bragged about their health care system: Medical schools are free, \ndoctors are free, clinics are free; their infant mortality rate may be \neven lower than ours.\n  I wonder if the Senator, however, was informed that, No. 1, the \ninfant mortality rate of Cuba is completely calculated on figures \nprovided by the Cuban Government. And by the way, totalitarian \nCommunist regimes don't have the best history of accurately reporting \nthings. I wonder if he was informed that the forecast showed that Cuba \nwas 13th in the whole world in infant mortality. I wonder if the \ngovernment officials who hosted them informed him that in Cuba there \nare instances reported--including by defectors--that if a child only \nlives a few hours after birth, they are not counted as a person who \never lived and therefore don't count against the mortality rate.\n  I wonder if our visitors to Cuba were informed that in Cuba any time \nthere is any sort of problem with a child in utero, they are strongly \nencouraged to undergo abortions, and that is why they have an abortion \nrate that skyrockets and some say is perhaps the highest in the world.\n  I also heard him talk about the great doctors they have in Cuba. I \nhave no doubt they are very talented. I met a bunch of them. You know \nwhere I met them? I met them in the United States because they have \ndefected. Doctors would rather drive a taxicab than be a doctor in \nCuba.\n  I wonder if they spoke to him about the outbreak of cholera they have \nbeen unable to control or the three-tiered system of health care that \nexists where foreigners and government officials get health care that \nis much better than what is available to the general population.\n  I also heard him speak about baseball. I know Cubans love baseball \nsince my parents are from Cuba and I grew up in a community surrounded \nby it. He talked about the great baseball players coming from Cuba, and \nthey are. I wonder if they informed him--in fact, I bet they didn't \ntalk about those players to him because every single one of those guys \nplaying in the Major Leagues defected. They left Cuba to play here.\n  He also talked about how people would come up to him in the streets \nand not a single person said anything negative about America. Nobody \ncame up to him wagging their finger, saying, you Americans and your \nembargo are hurting us. I am glad to hear that because everyone who \nwants to lift the embargo is constantly telling us that the Castros use \nthat to turn the people against us. So obviously that is not true. I am \nglad to hear confirmation of what I already knew to be true.\n  I heard about their wonderful literacy rate and how everyone in Cuba \nknows how to read. That is fantastic. Here is the problem: They can \nonly read censored stuff. They are not allowed access to the Internet. \nThe only newspapers they are allowed to read are Granma or the ones \nproduced by the government. I wish someone on that trip would have \nasked the average Cuban: With your wonderful literacy skills, are you \nallowed to read the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal or, for \nthat matter, any blog? The answer is no.\n  It is great to have literacy, but if you don't have access to the \ninformation, what is the point of it? I wish somebody would have asked \nabout that on that trip.\n  We heard about Mr. Gross, who is not in jail. He is not a prisoner. \nHe is a hostage. In the speech I heard a moment ago, I heard allusions \nto the idea--he didn't say it, but I know the language. I know the \ncode. He made the allusion that maybe there should be a spy swap. Here \nis the problem: Mr. Gross is not a spy. Do you know what his crime was, \nif that is what you can call it? He went to Cuba to hand out satellite \nradios to the Jewish community. We are glad to hear the Cubans are so \nnice to him that they let him walk 10,000 steps a day, do pullups, and \nbuild a necklace out of bottle cap tops. It is very nice that they \nallow him to do those things. How generous.\n  I wonder if anybody asked about terrorism, because Cuba is a state \nsponsor of terrorism. I wonder if anybody asked about the fact that \njust a few months ago a North Korean ship going from Cuba to North \nKorea was stopped in the Panama Canal, and it contained items in \nviolation of international sanctions against the government in North \nKorea.\n  A report just came out confirming what we already knew, that North \nKorea has death camps and prison camps. The Cubans are allowing them to \nevade these sanctions. Did that come up in any of the wonderful \nconversations in the socialist paradise of the Caribbean? I bet it \ndidn't.\n  Let me tell you what the Cubans are really good at. They don't know \nhow to run their economy, they don't know how to build a country, and \nthey don't know how to govern a people. What they are really good at is \nrepression. What they are really good at is shutting off information to \nthe Internet, radio, television, and social media. That is what they \nare really good at. They are not just good at it domestically, they are \ngood exporters of these things.\n  Do you want to see Exhibits A, B, C, and D? I will show them to you \nright now. They have exported repression in real time in our hemisphere \nright now.\n\n[[Page S987]]\n\n  This is the first slide. This gentleman is the former mayor of a \nmunicipality in Caracas. His name is Leopoldo Lopez. This is the \nNational Guard of Venezuela pulling him into an armored truck last \nweek. Do you know why? He is protesting against the government. He is \nprotesting against the Government of Venezuela, which are puppets of \nHavana. They are completely infiltrated by Cubans and agents from \nHavana. Not agents. Openly. There are foreign military affairs \nofficials involved in Venezuela. Do you know why? Because the \nVenezuelan Government is giving them cheap oil--even free oil--in \nexchange for help in doing these sorts of repressions. He is sitting in \njail right now because he is protesting against the government.\n  Here is the next slide. This is Genesis Carmona. She is a beauty \nqueen and student in a city called Valencia. She is on that motorcycle \nbecause the government in Venezuela and thugs--these so-called civilian \ngroups that they have armed, which is another export from Cuba--shot \nher in the head. She died last week.\n  This is the government that the Cubans support, not just verbally, \nnot just emotionally, but with training and tactics. This is what they \ndo, and she is dead. This is her being taken on a motorcycle to the \nhospital where they were unable to save her life because she was shot \nin the head by Venezuelan security forces.\n  Here is another slide. Earlier I showed you Mr. Lopez. These are his \nsupporters being hit by water cannons in the street because they are \nprotesting against the government. This has been going on for 2 weeks. \nThese are the allies of Cuba. Venezuela is a puppet of Cuba. This is \nwhat they do to their own people. They are using water cannons to knock \npeople to the ground. Why? Because they are protesting the government.\n  Here is another slide. This is a demonstrator detained by police. \nLook at how they dragged him through the streets. This is in Caracas, \nVenezuela.\n  I will show another demonstrator. This is a student--by the way, \nthese are all students in the street. This young man was also shot in \nthe head by security forces and progovernment groups in Caracas. This \nhappened on February 11.\n  This is what they do in Venezuela. This is what the allies of the \nCastro regime do. This is what they export. This is what they teach. \nThis is what they support.\n  It doesn't stop here. Who are Cuba's allies in the world? North \nKorea; before he fell, the dictator in Libya; the dictator in Syria; \nthe tyrant in Moscow. This is who they line up with. This is a \nwonderful paradise?\n  What is happening in Venezuela deserves attention in and of itself. \nThis is happening in our own hemisphere. It is shameful that only three \nheads of state in this hemisphere have spoken against what is \nhappening. It is shameful that many Members of Congress who traveled to \nVenezuela and are friendly with Chavez--some even went to his funeral--\nsit by and say nothing while this is happening in our own hemisphere. \nThis is what the wonderful Cuban paradise government we heard about \nsupports.\n  Just this morning the dictator--who calls himself the President, even \nthough he has never been elected to anything--Raul Castro announced he \nis there to do whatever they need to help them do this.\n  I listened to the stuff about Cuba and what is happening in \nVenezuela, and it is very similar, not just in the repression part but \nthe economic part. Venezuela is an oil-rich country with hard-working \npeople. We don't have an embargo against Venezuela. They have a \nshortage of toilet paper and toothpaste. Why? Because they are \nincompetent, and communism doesn't work. They look more and more like \nCuba economically and politically every single day.\n  What is the first thing the Venezuelans did when this broke out? They \ncut off access to Twitter, Facebook, and the Internet. They ran CNN out \nof there. They closed down the only Colombian station. Years before \nthey had to close down all the independent media outlets that \ncriticized the government. Where did they learn that from? Cuba. Yet we \nhave to listen to what a paradise Cuba is.\n  I wonder. How come I never read about boatloads of American refugees \ngoing to Cuba? Why have close to 1\\1/2\\ million people left Cuba to \ncome here, but the only people who leave here to move there are \nfugitives from the law and people who steal money from Medicare and go \nthere to hide? Why? How come no American baseball players defect to \nCuba? Why don't any American doctors defect to Cuba if it is such a \nparadise?\n  He cited a poll that more Americans want normal relations with Cuba. \nSo do I--a democratic and free Cuba. But you want us to reach out and \ndevelop friendly relationships with a serial violator of human rights \nthat supports what is going on in Venezuela and every other atrocity on \nthe planet? On issue after issue, they are always on the side of the \ntyrants. Look it up. This is who we should be opening up to? Why don't \nthey change? Why doesn't the Cuban Government change? Why doesn't the \nVenezuelan Government change?\n  Throughout this week, I will outline proposals and ideas about what \nwe need to do and the sanctions we should be pursuing against the \nindividuals responsible for these atrocities.\n  We have sanctions against North Korea. Why? Because they have a \nterrorist and illegitimate government. We have sanctions against Iran. \nWhy? Because they support terrorism and have an illegitimate \ngovernment. We have sanctions against Cuba. Why? Well, you just saw \nwhy. Sanctions are a tool in our foreign policy toolbox. We, as the \nfreest Nation on Earth, are looked to by people in this country and all \naround the world to stand by them in their moment of need when they \nclamor for liberty and human rights. They look for America to be on \ntheir side, not for America to be cutting geopolitical deals or making \nit easier to sell tractors to the government there. We should be clear \nabout these things.\n  Here is the great news. I don't know if they get C-SPAN in Cuba. I \nbet the government people do. I hope you see that in America we are a \nfree society. You are allowed to stand on the floor and say and spread \nwhatever you want. You think Cuba is a paradise? You think it is an \nexample and model we should be following? You are free to say that \nhere, in the press and anywhere you want. We are also free to come here \nand tell the truth. We are also free to come here and denounce the \nviolations of human rights and brutality.\n  I suggest to my colleagues that the next time they go to Cuba, ask to \nmeet with the Ladies in White. Ask to meet with Yoani Sanchez. Ask to \nmeet with the dissidents and the human rights activists who are jailed, \nrepressed, and exiled. Ask to meet them. I bet you will hear something \nvery different than what you heard from your hosts on your last trip to \nthe wonderful socialist paradise called Cuba, because it is a joke. It \nis a farce. I don't think we should stand by with our arms crossed and \nwatch these things happen in our hemisphere and say nothing about them.\n  I will close by saying over the last week, I have tweeted about these \nissues. I get thousands of retweets from students and young people--\nuntil they shut them out in Venezuela--who are encouraged by the fact \nthat we are on their side. What they want is what we have, freedom and \nliberty. That is what all people want.\n  If America and its policymakers are not going to be firmly on the \nside of freedom and liberty, who in the world will? Who on this planet \nwill? If this Nation is not firmly on the side of human rights and \nfreedom and the dignity of all people, what nation on Earth will? If we \nare prepared to walk away from that, then I submit to you that this \ncentury is going to be a dangerous and dark one, but I don't believe \nthat is what the American people want from us, nor the majority of my \ncolleagues.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for the opportunity to share these \nthoughts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/24/senate-section/article/S987-1", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S987-S988]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Sexual Assault\n\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, this is a sad day for the Senate. \nWhat does it say about this body that after having seen so many brave \nsurvivors of sexual assault in the military walk through the halls of \nthis Congress for over a year now, we can't even give them the decency \nof a debate on the reform they so deeply believe in--a reform they \nbelieve in so deeply that they have selflessly retold their stories, \nreliving some of the worst moments of their lives, all so, hopefully, \nsomeone else doesn't have to suffer what they did. They may not wear \nthe uniform anymore, but no one can tell me they aren't still serving \ntheir country through their sacrifice. Yet we can't even agree to vote \nfor moving forward to debate the issue? They deserve a vote. The men \nand women who serve in our Armed Forces deserve a vote.\n  Anyone who has been listening has heard over and over from survivors \nof sexual assaults in the military how the deck has been stacked \nagainst them. For two full decades the Defense Department has been \nunable to uphold its continued failed promises of zero tolerance for \nsexual assault. But when the Senate can't even agree to debate the one \nreform that survivors have consistently said is needed to solve this \ncrisis, we are telling those victims the deck is stacked against them \nright here in the Senate as well.\n  Last month this Congress rushed with great speed to remove a \nreduction in military pensions not slated to begin until 2015--a fix I \nfully supported. Legislative action was swift, and it was just. But I \nask: Where is the same urgency to help stem the crisis of military \nsexual assault--an epidemic that is happening today? How is it we can't \nwait another week to stop a COLA reduction in pensions, but a reform \nthat will lead to more rapists and predators behind bars waits \nindefinitely. We have been waiting for 20 years now--all the way back \nto 1992, when Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney stated zero tolerance in \nthe wake of Tailhook.\n  As many of my colleagues likely saw, the Associated Press revealed \nnew evidence last month that took years of freedom of information \nrequests to obtain. After reviewing the documents from Okinawa, Japan, \nthe AP described the handling of cases as ``chaotic,'' where commanders \noverruled recommendations to prosecute or dropped charges altogether.\n  Among the AP's findings: ``Victims increasingly declined to cooperate \nwith investigators or recanted--a sign they may have been losing \nconfidence in the system.''\n  If that sounds familiar, it is because that is a fact that today's \nmilitary leaders openly admit themselves. As Commandant of the Marine \nCorps James Amos put it:\n\n       Why wouldn't female victims come forward. Because they \n     don't trust us. They don't trust the chain of command. They \n     don't trust the leadership.\n\n  That is what we have a chance to fix right here today, but we are \nletting it pass us by because some here believe it is not even worthy \nof debate.\n  This was never about being a Democratic idea or a Republican idea. It \nis just about doing what is right. People of good faith from both sides \nof the aisle, from both parties, can unite to deliver an independent, \nobjective, and nonbiased military justice system that is worthy of the \nsacrifice the men and women in uniform make every day. It has taken us \na long time to get to this point--too long, in fact. Every day we wait \nis another day the deck remains stacked against sexual assault victims \nin our military--another day when, statistically, it is estimated that \nover 70 incidents of unwanted sexual contact occur, and nearly nine out \nof 10 go unreported.\n  Nowhere else in America would we allow a boss to decide if an \nemployee was sexually assaulted, except in the U.S. military.\n  The men and women of our military deserve to have unbiased, trained \nmilitary prosecutors reviewing their cases and making the ultimate \ndecision about whether to go to trial solely on the merits of the \nevidence. They deserve a fair shot at justice today, not after another \nyear of a system that is broken under any metric. They deserve a vote \nthat a bipartisan majority of the Senate supports, and they deserve \nthat vote now.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the role.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I am here very proudly and gratefully \nto support the nomination of Jeffrey Meyer as a U.S. district court \njudge for the District of Connecticut. I am proud because of his \nextraordinary credentials. I am grateful to President Obama and, \nhopefully, to this body for giving Connecticut the services of a \nprofessor, litigator, prosecutor, and a person of extraordinary \nintegrity and ability. Jeffrey Meyer has all of the qualifications in \nextraordinary depth and quality to be a great judge. He is truly a \nlawyers' lawyer. He is a prosecutors' prosecutor. He will be a judges' \njudge.\n  Mr. Meyer served as a legal aid lawyer in Vermont for Vermont Legal \nAid and as an associate of two Washington, DC, law firms. He really has \nmade his mark as a prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney's Office in \nConnecticut, where he served for 10 years, five of them as appeals \nchief. He also was a law clerk to Judge Oakes for the Second Circuit. \nHe has a grounding in academia, having taught at Quinnipiac Law School \nand served as Supreme Court advocacy clinic teacher at Yale, where he \nhas also been a visiting professor since 2000.\n  I am abbreviating and summarizing his credentials because they are \nwell documented and well known in this body. What can't be summarized \nso easily is the quality of judgment he has and that befits a judge on \nthe Federal court.\n  Judges on the U.S. district court, as I know from my own experience, \nhaving litigated for quite a few years, are often the last point of \njustice for many people in our country. They are the voice and face of \njustice for so many people who may not have the means or the \npersistence to appeal further, and for most litigants he will be the \nvoice and face of justice before his court. That is a very solemn \nresponsibility. It is a responsibility for life.\n  These decisions about who will serve on the district court are among \nthe most important we make in this body, so we approach it seriously \nand thoughtfully. Following the high standards we impose, Jeffrey Meyer \naptly and abundantly meets the test for serving as a U.S. district \ncourt judge: His background in litigation; his experience in actually \ntrying cases; his background as an academic, in thinking through some \nof the toughest issues of the law and teaching others how to do it, how \nto actually be a lawyer; and, of course, his judgment and his sense of \nperspective and, most importantly, his integrity.\n  I have worked with Jeff Meyer. I know of his dedication to his \nclients. I have worked with him in very tough personal situations where \nhis advice to a client would make a critical difference in that \nperson's life. I know he\n\n[[Page S989]]\n\nhas the human quality of compassion and insight that is really \nnecessary to make judgments about credibility when he has to judge the \ncredibility of a witness on the stand or when he has to sentence an \nindividual who may have broken the law but has mitigating factors to \npresent. Anybody who spends time in a trial court knows that judges \nhave to make split-second decisions based on their knowledge of the law \nbut also on their instincts, on what they sense is right. Jeff Meyer \nhas that quality of judgment that makes all the difference in the \nworld. Some people have it, even if they haven't graduated, as Jeff \nMeyer did, from some of the best schools in the country, and some \npeople don't, even when they have all the degrees in the world. Maybe \nit is common sense or horse sense or good instincts or character. It is \nvery hard for anyone to say who has it without meeting them, as we did \non the Judiciary Committee, and knowing them.\n  I thank the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, my great friend and \ncolleague Senator Leahy, for championing people of this great ability. \nSenator Leahy has devoted his lifetime to the quality of our Federal \njudiciary, and it has been immensely beneficial to our judiciary and to \nall who appear before our Federal judges to have a champion such as \nSenator Leahy of Vermont.\n  There are now 96 vacancies in our Federal court. Thirty-nine of those \nvacancies have been classified as judicial emergencies. Let us get on \nwith our task and our responsibility to make sure justice is not \ndelayed in the greatest country in the history of the world, because we \nknow so often justice delayed is, in fact, justice denied. That may be \ntrue of the least seemingly important case that matters so greatly to \nthe person whose life is at stake or it may be an issue of great moment \nto the Nation's future. But one way or the other, the American people \nrely on us to make sure justice is done, that judges are nominated and \nconfirmed, and that we enable every American to have access to judges \nwho will decide fairly and wisely the merits of their case. Whether it \nis through a trial or in a motion, justice is what makes our Nation one \nof the greatest--the greatest, in fact--in the history of the world.\n  I am very proud and grateful for the opportunity to support Jeff \nMeyer to be a U.S. district court judge for Connecticut.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Connecticut for his kind words. Having served as attorney general \nof his State and in various other roles in our courts, he understands \nvery much when he says justice delayed is justice denied. Whether you \nare a plaintiff or a defendant, that is true.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized for 5 \nminutes and Senator Murphy of Connecticut be recognized for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I began the year expressing my hope that we \nwould set aside our differences and do what is best for this country by \nconfirming qualified nominees to fill these critical vacancies facing \nour Federal judiciary. I have been here with both Republican and \nDemocratic leadership, Republican and Democratic Presidents. Never in \nmy 40 years in the Senate have I seen such an effort to exploit every \nmeans of delay for every judicial nomination, even when a nominee is \nsupported by both Republicans and Democrats and supported by their home \nState Senators. This did not happen with President Ford, with President \nCarter, with President Reagan, with President George H.W. Bush, with \nPresident Clinton, with President George W. Bush. This President is \ntreated differently.\n  Now, I have heard some Senate Republicans claim the majority leader \ncan simply bring up these nominations for a vote whenever he chooses to \ndo so. I think that is done with the hope that some in the press or \nsome people watching may not understand they are hiding from the \nAmerican people the fact that they are not letting the majority leader \nbring them up for a vote. In fact, if their claims were true, we would \nbe voting to confirm four district court judges tonight. Instead, the \nSenate Republicans are deliberately obstructing and placing roadblocks \nso that each and every confirmation takes longer. It is very similar to \nwhat they did when they caused the needless and costly partial shutdown \nof the government. They shut down the government. Here, they are trying \nto shut down the judiciary.\n  This pointless obstruction is why Congress is so unpopular with the \nAmerican people. They make it as difficult as possible to respond to \nthe needs of our Federal judiciary. This has been going on since \nPresident Obama first took office in 2009. In fact, within a short time \nafter the President was sworn in, Republicans filibustered his very \nfirst judicial nominee. That has never been done for any President of \neither party. Incidentally, that judicial nominee, who had the highest \npossible rating from the American Bar Association, had the strong \nsupport of the senior Senator from his State, who was also the senior \nRepublican then serving in the Senate. The most senior Republican \nSenator supported the nomination, but the Republican leadership said: \nNo. We have to filibuster and block the nomination because, after all, \nit was President Obama's nomination, not President Bush's nomination.\n  It was around this time that the Republican leader said his primary \ngoal was for President Obama to fail. Now, if a Democrat had said that \nabout a Republican President, we would have heard about it ad \ninfinitum.\n  We were forced to change the Senate Rules. This was something I was \nvery reluctant to see done, but we did it because we have to get past \nthis obstruction. Otherwise, our Federal judiciary would grind to a \nhalt in many parts of the country. The worst part about it is when \nthere are judicial nominees with the support of both Republican and \nDemocratic Senators, but a tiny group in their leadership says: Oh, no, \nwe cannot possibly vote on these. It might give President Obama a \nvictory. This ignores the fact that he was elected twice by pretty \nsignificant margins. It also ignores the fact that the Federal \njudiciary has always been kept out of partisan politics. Instead, they \ndo it to politicize the Federal judiciary more than I have seen in my \n40 years here. It is a shame. It should stop.\n  Let's start acting like grownups in the Senate, not like children \nfighting in a sandbox. And then they wonder why the American people are \nso turned off. First they close down the Federal Government; now they \nare, by increments, closing down the Federal courts.\n  Tonight I hope we will vote to end the filibusters of four judicial \nnominees to Federal district courts in Connecticut, Arkansas, and \nCalifornia. Each of these nominees--Jeffrey Meyer to fill a vacancy to \nthe District of Connecticut; James Maxwell Moody, Jr., to fill a \nvacancy to the Eastern District of Arkansas; and James Donato and Beth \nLabson Freeman to fill judicial emergency vacancies to the Northern \nDistrict of California--were voted out of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee with the unanimous support of Republicans and Democrats. Yet, \nthey have languished on the Senate floor for months. Because of \nRepublican obstruction we are again wasting precious time to overcome \nprocedural hurdles just to have an up-or-down vote on these worthy \nnominees.\n  I began the year expressing my hope that we would set aside our \ndifferences and do what is best for this country by confirming \nqualified nominees to fill critical vacancies facing our Federal \nJudiciary. Instead, it appears that Senate Republicans have decided to \ndouble down and to further exhaust every means of delay at their \ndisposal, even when a nominee is supported by those on both sides of \nthe aisle and supported by both home State Senators.\n  A few weeks ago, prior to recessing, Senator Pryor asked for \nunanimous consent to vote on the nominations of Timothy Brooks and \nJames Moody to fill judicial vacancies in the Western and Eastern \nDistricts of Arkansas. Both of these nominees had the bipartisan \nsupport of their home State senators, as well as the bipartisan support \nof every single member of the Judiciary Committee. Both these nominees \ncould and should have been confirmed last year, as they were originally \nvoted out of committee by voice vote last October and November, \nrespectively. Nevertheless, Senate Republicans refused\n\n[[Page S990]]\n\nto consent to a vote on their nominations as the year ended. This meant \nthat these nominees had to be re-nominated and re-processed through \ncommittee. Having jumped through all of these additional hurdles, these \nnominees still cannot get a vote on their nominations as Senate \nRepublicans continue to object. Senate Republicans claim that the \nmajority leader himself can bring up these nominations for a vote \nwhenever he chooses to do so. But what the Republicans are hiding from \nthe American people is that they are deliberately obstructing and \nplacing roadblocks so that each and every confirmation takes as long as \nhumanly possible.\n  This illustrates why Congress is so unpopular with the American \npeople. Here, you have lawmakers deliberately making it as difficult as \npossible to do something to address the needs of our Federal Judiciary. \nRepublicans may see this as retribution for the rules change that \noccurred last year, but their steadfast obstruction only hurts the \nAmerican people.\n  More than a month into the new year, we have confirmed just one \njudicial nominee. This is the case even though there are currently 96 \njudicial vacancies, 39 of which have been deemed emergency vacancies by \nthe Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. In stark contrast, there \nwere only 56 judicial vacancies at the same point in President Bush's \ntenure. The comparison is even more troubling when you consider the 32 \njudicial nominees currently pending on the Executive Calendar. We could \nlower the number of judicial vacancies today to 64 if Senate \nRepublicans would consent to voting on the pending nominees. We have \nnot had fewer than 70 vacancies since May 2009, more than 4 years ago. \nAnd for most of President Obama's tenure in office, judicial vacancies \nhave continued to hover around 80 and 90 because of Senate Republican \nobstruction. Nevertheless, Senate Republicans continue to object to \nvotes on these nominations.\n  There are no excuses for the delays except sheer partisanship. All \nbut 3 of the 32 judicial nominees currently pending on the Executive \nCalendar had hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee last year. \nDespite the self-imposed delays by Republicans, who demanded these \nnominees be sent back to the President to be re-nominated and re-\nprocessed through committee, the Judiciary Committee has worked hard to \nagain report them out of committee. The only delay that is holding them \nup is the Republicans who have continuously objected to a vote on their \nnominations.\n  Almost all of the judicial nominees pending before the full Senate \nare uncontroversial. In fact, of the 32 judicial nominees currently \npending, 30 were voted out of committee with bipartisan support. It is \nclear that Senate Republicans have decided to use the rules change as \nanother excuse to further accomplish their partial government shut \ndown. Before the rules change, Senate Republicans used anonymous holds \nto delay confirming qualified judicial nominees, and dragged their feet \nevery step of the way to slow down the confirmation process. Senate \nDemocrats changed the rules precisely because of these delay tactics, \nwhich were causing great harm to the judicial system and negatively \nimpacting those Americans who were seeking justice in our Federal \ncourts. The American people who have sought to obtain justice in our \nFederal courts deserve speedy and prompt justice. The petty partisan \ntactics on display tonight are not even worthy of the playgrounds of \nour children and grandchildren, let alone the United States Senate.\n  It used to be that nominees for U.S. attorney and U.S. marshal were \nconfirmed by unanimous consent without taking up any floor time. \nHowever, Republicans have now decided that they will delay the \nconfirmation of these nominees as well. Once again, the only \nindividuals who are hurt by these tit-for-tat political games are the \nAmerican people. When a State lacks the necessary law enforcement \nofficers they need to keep its streets safe from criminals, it is the \nAmerican people that are hurt. I hope that Senate Republicans will re-\nthink this misguided strategy of obstruction and do-nothingness.\n  Shortly, I hope we can overcome the filibusters on the following \nqualified judicial nominees:\n  Jeffrey Meyer is nominated to fill a judicial vacancy in the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the District of Connecticut. He has served since \n2006 as a professor of law at Quinnipiac University School of Law, and \nsince 2010 as a visiting professor of law at Yale Law School. He served \nas senior counsel to the Independent Inquiry Committee into the United \nNations Oil-for-Food Program in Iraq from 2004 to 2005. He served as an \nassistant U.S. attorney in the District of Connecticut from 1995 to \n2004, and as appeals chief from 2000 to 2004. Prior to his work as a \nFederal prosecutor, he worked as an associate at Kellogg, Huber, \nHansen, Todd, Evans & Figel PLLC from 1993 to 1995, and at Shearman & \nSterling LLP in 1993, and from 1990 to 1991. He worked as a staff \nattorney for Vermont Legal Aid from 1992 to 1993. Following law school, \nhe served as a law clerk to three distinguished Federal judges, \nincluding Justice Harry Blackmun of the U.S. Supreme Court, Judge \nDonald Ross of the Eighth Circuit, and Judge James Oakes of the second \nCircuit. The ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary \nunanimously rated Mr. Meyer well qualified to serve on the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the District of Connecticut, its highest rating. He \nhas the strong support of both his home State Senators, Senator \nBlumenthal and Senator Murphy. He was approved by the Judiciary \nCommittee by voice vote last September, and once again, last month.\n  Judge James Moody is nominated to fill a judicial vacancy in the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas. Since 2003, he has \nserved as a circuit court judge in Arkansas's Sixth Judicial Circuit. \nHe has presided over 1,000 cases in the Arkansas State Court Systems. \nHe previously worked in private practice at Wright, Lindsey & Jennings \nLLP as a partner from 1994 to 2003, and as an associate from 1989 to \n1994. The ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously \nrated Judge Moody well qualified to serve on the U.S. District Court \nfor the Eastern District of Arkansas, its highest rating. He has the \nstrong bipartisan support of both his home State Senators, Senator \nPryor and Senator Boozman. He was approved by the Judiciary Committee \nby voice vote last November, and once again, last month.\n  James Donato is nominated to fill a judicial emergency vacancy in the \nU.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Since \n2009, he has worked in private practice as a partner at Sherman & \nSterling LLP. He has served pro bono as a court appointed mediator in \nthe Northern District of California since 2002, handling civil rights \nactions against state and local law enforcement departments. He \npreviously worked as a Partner at Cooley LLP from 1998 to 2009, and as \na special counsel from 1996 to 1998. He served as a deputy city \nattorney in the Trial Division of the San Francisco City Attorney's \nOffice from 1993 to 1996, and as an Associate at Morrison & Foerster \nLLP from 1990 to 1993. Following his graduation from Stanford Law \nSchool, he clerked for Judge Proctor Hug, Jr., of the United States \nCourts of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Mr. Donato earned his B.A. in \n1983 from the University of California, where he was a member of Phi \nBeta Kappa. He earned his M.A. in history in 1984 at Harvard \nUniversity, and his J.D. in 1988 from Stanford Law School, where he \nserved as senior editor of the Stanford Law Review. He has the strong \nsupport of both his home State Senators, Senator Boxer and Senator \nFeinstein. He was approved by the Judiciary Committee by voice vote \nlast October, and once again, last month.\n  Judge Beth Freeman is nominated to fill a judicial emergency vacancy \nin the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. \nSince 2001, she has served as a California State judge in San Mateo \nCounty Superior Court. She served as the presiding judge from 2011 to \n2012. During her 12 years on the bench, she has presided over \napproximately 150 jury trials and over a thousand bench trials. She \npreviously served as a deputy county counsel to the San Mateo County \nCounsel's Office from 1983 to 2001. She worked in private practice at \nFried, Frank, Harris, Shriver, and Jacobson in Washington, DC as an \nassociate attorney from 1979 to 1981. Judge Freeman earned her B.A. \nwith distinction from the University of California,\n\n[[Page S991]]\n\nBerkeley in 1976. She earned her J.D. from Harvard Law School in 1979. \nShe has the strong support of both her home State Senators, Senator \nBoxer and Senator Feinstein. She was approved by the Judiciary \nCommittee by voice vote last October, and once again, last month.\n  I thank the majority leader for filing cloture petitions to end the \nfilibusters of these much needed trial court judges. I hope my fellow \nSenators will join me today to end these filibusters so that these \nnominees can get working on behalf of the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in support of the \nnomination of Jeffrey Meyer of Connecticut to be a U.S. judge for the \nDistrict of Connecticut. I thank the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee for his hard work in shepherding Mr. Meyer's nomination \nthrough the process and thank my colleagues and leadership for bringing \nit to the floor today.\n  Before I make brief remarks in support specifically of Meyer's \nnomination, I want to associate myself with the remarks of Senator \nLeahy and Senator Blumenthal.\n  There are essentially two ways to try to shut down the government \nfrom within. You can try to defund it--and we have seen that effort \nplay out in real terms at great cost to the American people over the \nlast year and a half--and you can also try to depopulate it. You can \ntry to very slowly and methodically take people out of positions by \neither denying them confirmation into the administration--as we have \nseen, as a long list of nominees to agencies throughout the Federal \nGovernment are being delayed by Republicans--or you can try to keep the \njudiciary understaffed so it cannot do its work as well.\n  So I, unfortunately, believe this is part of a pretty methodical \npolicy and strategy on behalf of those who feel as though they have \nbeen elected to destroy government from within, to both try to defund \nthe organs of government and then also to depopulate its ranks. That is \npart of the reason I think we are laboring under delay tactic after \ndelay tactic when it comes to our Federal judiciary. Today, though, \nhopefully we can unite around a nominee who is singularly qualified to \nserve on the district court.\n  I am proud to support Jeff Meyer's nomination--someone who comes from \na family with deep roots in public service. Mr. Meyer has worked in the \nlegal system but also has a history of helping the poor and the \nvoiceless in Connecticut throughout his career. Both Senator Blumenthal \nand I know his father well, Ed Meyer, who served with me in the \nConnecticut State Senate.\n  Jeff Meyer comes from a world-class educational background, in part \nbecause he got a lot of it in Connecticut. He is a graduate of both the \ncollege and the law school at Yale. He has an extensive academic and \nteaching background. After he graduated law school, Mr. Meyer clerked \nat the Supreme Court for Justice Blackmun, and then for Judge James \nOakes, the former chief judge of the Second Circuit. Currently, he \nteaches the Supreme Court Advocacy Clinic at Yale Law School, where he \nprovides pro bono legal services. Before that, he taught at Quinnipiac \nLaw School, where he was honored with their Excellence in Teaching \nAward.\n  But even more impressive than his academic background and training is \nJeff Meyer's long history of working for a fair and just legal system \nin Connecticut and, frankly, throughout the Northeast. Even as a law \nstudent Jeff Meyer showed a commitment to helping disadvantaged groups \nby giving legal assistance to homeless clients through the Yale Law \nSchool clinic. He actually received an award for his work there from \nthe City of New Haven. Later, he worked as a staff attorney in Senator \nLeahy's home State of Vermont at Vermont Legal Aid. In Connecticut, he \nhelped keep our State safe by serving as an assistant U.S. attorney for \n9 years. Since 2008 he has served on the Connecticut Judicial Ethics \nCommittee--a fairly thankless task, I might add--and he has served on a \nrange of other important State and local committees, including the \nAdvisory Committee for the Selection of the Connecticut Federal Public \nDefender, the Independent Accountability Panel for New Haven's police \ndepartment, and the U.S. Attorney's Police and Urban Youth Task Force.\n  Aside from his academic and community work, Jeff Meyer has also \nmanaged to find time in between to litigate complex commercial issues \nand investigate foreign aid issues. He served as an editor and \ncounselor of the Independent Panel Review of the World Bank Department \nof Institutional Integrity. And he did an incredibly important tour of \nduty as the senior counsel of the Independent Inquiry Committee into \nthe United Nations Oil for Food Program. He also wrote a book on the \nU.N. oil for food scandal. Along with his book, Mr. Meyer has an \nimpressive body of legal scholarship that includes a wide range of law \nreview articles and opinion pieces on topics ranging from criminal \njustice issues, to foreign aid, to workplace safety.\n  I will point out that Jeff Meyer is exceptional in the sense that he \nhas sought work that others in the legal community might avoid. The \nwork he has done on Connecticut's Judicial Ethics Committee or in the \nindependent review process of the New Haven Police Department or even \nin his work investigating the Oil for Food Program was tough stuff--\nissues that were controversial that some other lawyers may have \navoided. But Jeff Meyer sought places in which his talents were needed \nand in areas in which others may have looked the other way.\n  The District of Connecticut is currently about 13 percent \nunderstaffed, and this confirmation would fill a vacancy that has \nexisted now for almost 2 years. Because Jeff Meyer has such stellar \nqualifications, I cannot think of any reason why people in this body \nwould oppose his nomination. I urge all my colleagues to support him.\n  I yield the floor.\n Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, today the Senate will vote to \ninvoke cloture on the nomination of Jeffrey Meyer to fill a judicial \nvacancy on the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut. \nThough I was not able to be present to cast my vote this afternoon, I \nfully support the nomination of this qualified individual to fill the \nvacancy in Connecticut. If I had been here I would have voted to \nconfirm this highly qualified nominee. It would not have changed the \noutcome of the vote. I want to congratulate Senator Leahy and Senator \nGrassley on their leadership and hope that we can all continue to work \ntogether to address the backlog of judicial nominations.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The yeas are 55, the nays are 37, and 1 \nSenator voting ``present.''\n  The motion is agreed to.\n  Pursuant to the provisions of S. Res. 15 of the 113th Congress, there \nwill be up to 2 hours of postcloture consideration of the nomination, \nequally divided, in the usual form.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. On behalf of the majority, I yield back 58 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is so yielded.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Either tonight or tomorrow the Senate will consider \nseveral district court nominees. These nominees will be brought up, \nconsidered by the Senate, and in all likelihood confirmed in very short \norder. As I mentioned several times, this is a procedure the Democrats \nvoted to pursue in November when they voted for the so-called nuclear \noption. The majority voted to eliminate the filibuster on nominations \nand to cut the minority, us Republicans, out of the process.\n  While the Senate is debating these district court nominees, it gives \nme a good opportunity to continue the discussion about how the Senate \nought to be functioning in the constitutional way determined by our \nConstitution writers. There is no debate that the Senate isn't \nfunctioning properly, and we have been treated to relentless finger-\npointing from the other side regarding who is to blame.\n  Unless we can establish a nonpartisan account of how the Senate ought \nto function, this debate will amount to nothing more than a \nkindergarten shouting match.\n  I wish to return to the Federalist Papers, which are the most \ndetailed account, from the time the Constitution was being ratified, \nabout how our institution, this Senate, was intended to \noperate. Although these Federalist Papers were written over 200 years \nago, the principles those papers articulate are timeless, and the \nproblems they highlight are strikingly relevant to this very day.\n\n  The last time I addressed the Senate on this subject I quoted at \nlength from a passage in Federalist No. 62. Although the Federalist \nPapers were published under the pseudonym of ``Publius,'' we know they \nwere written by three of our Founding Fathers: James Madison, Alexander \nHamilton, and John Jay.\n  Federalist No. 62 has been attributed to the father of the \nConstitution James Madison. In it he lists several problems that can be \nencountered by a republic the Senate was specifically, under the \nConstitution, designed to counteract.\n  The first point Madison makes is that having a second chamber--\nmeaning the Senate--composed differently than the House makes it less \nlikely one faction will be able to take over and enact an agenda out of \nstep with the American people.\n  The second point deals with the tendency of a unicameral legislature \nto yield to sudden and popular impulses and pass what he called \n``intemperate and pernicious resolutions.''\n  The third point is that based on the experience of the early \nunicameral State legislatures, a second chamber, with longer terms, \nsuch as the Senate, and a more deliberative process, such as the Senate \nis supposed to have, will make sure any laws passed are well thought \nout. The Framers of our Constitution determined it was better to get it \nright the first time than to subject the American people to the \nupheavals caused by the need to fix poorly conceived laws.\n  Madison talks about the early American experience with ``all the \nrepealing, explaining and amending laws,'' which he calls ``monuments \nof deficient wisdom; so many impeachments exhibited by each succeeding \nagainst each preceding session; so many admonitions to the people, of \nthe value of those aids which may be expected from a well-constituted \nSenate.''\n  In my last speech I did not get to Madison's fourth and final point \nin Federalist Paper 62, which is quite long and deserves to be examined \nin detail, and that is my main purpose today. Madison concludes Federal \nNo. 62 with an extensive discussion of the importance of stability to \ngood government and the danger to rule of law from constant change. So \nhere he is talking about the purpose intended for the Senate. This \nsection starts:\n\n       Fourthly, the mutability in the public councils arising \n     from a rapid succession of new members, however qualified \n     they may be, points out, in the strongest manner, the \n     necessity of some stable institution in the government. Every \n     new election in the States is found to change one-half of the \n     representatives. From this change of men must proceed a \n     change of opinions; and from a change of opinions, a change \n     of measures. But a continual change even of good measures is \n     inconsistent with every rule of prudence and every prospect \n     of success. The remark is verified in private life, and \n     becomes more just, as well as more important, in national \n     transactions.\n\n  Here Madison is making a case for stable government instead of \nconstant change. He says that constant change, even with good ideas, \nwill not produce positive results. Madison then elaborates on the \nvarious problems caused by an unstable government. This is what he \nfirst says about a country that is constantly changing its laws:\n\n       . . . she is held in no respect by her friends; that she is \n     the derision of her enemies; and that she is prey to every \n     nation which has an interest in speculating on her \n     fluctuating councils and embarrassed affairs.\n\n  Madison then makes the case that the domestic ramifications of \nconstantly enacting and changing laws ``poisons the blessing of liberty \nitself.''\n  But he goes on to explain:\n\n       It will be of little avail to the people, that the laws are \n     made by men of their own choice, if the laws be so voluminous \n     that they cannot be read, or so incoherent that they cannot \n     be understood; if they be repealed or revised before they are \n     promulgated, or undergo such incessant changes that no man, \n     who knows what the law is today, can guess what it will be \n     tomorrow.\n\n  This sounds a little bit like what we are finding with the health \ncare law today, which is being rewritten daily and on the fly by the \nObama administration. The Law has been changed by the President 29 \ntimes so far. But it is part of a bigger problem we face with new laws \nand regulations from agencies which have the force of law being churned \nout in such volume that no American can possibly know what all those \nregulations are.\n  Just based upon probability, Americans are likely to violate some \nregulation or some other law without knowing it at the time. Madison is \nmaking a case not just for more thoughtful laws but fewer laws.\n  When the majority leader and many in the media complain the Senate \nshould be passing laws at a higher rate, those people miss the point \nentirely. To listen to some Members of the majority, and even more so \nin the media of America, one would think the success of a session of \nCongress was measured solely on the sheer number of laws passed and not \non the quality of those laws that it passes.\n  Common sense tells all of us the Senate was specifically designed to \nslow down the process and to make sure\n\n[[Page S993]]\n\nthat Congress passes fewer but better laws. Madison elaborates further \non why fewer laws are better in this passage, which is extremely \nrelevant today:\n\n       Another effect of public instability is the unreasonable \n     advantage it gives to the sagacious, the enterprising, and \n     the moneyed few over the industrious and uninformed mass of \n     the people.\n       Every new regulation concerning commerce or revenue, or in \n     any way affecting the value of the different species of \n     property, presents a new harvest to those who watch the \n     change, and can trace its consequences; a harvest, reared not \n     by themselves, but by the toils and cares of the great body \n     of their fellow citizens.\n\n  In other words, a situation where Congress is constantly changing the \nlaws gives more influence to those who can hire lawyers to keep on top \nof the changes and lobbyists who influence them versus the little guy \nwho is out there on his own.\n  It is sometimes said that big businesses don't like regulations. But \nthat isn't my experience in many instances. The bigger and wealthier a \nbusiness or a union or other special interest group, the better chance \nthey have to shape a new law or regulation and the more people they can \nhire to help them comply. On the other hand, small businesses and \nindividuals can't hire a team of lawyers to read the latest laws and \nregulations and fill out the proper paperwork. Small businesses and \nindividuals are the ones squeezed out of the marketplace by the \nconstant flow of new laws.\n  An overactive government benefits the big guys at the expense of the \nlittle guys. If you think that fact is lost on the big guys and their \nlobbyists when they come to Congress, you would in fact be very badly \nmistaken. So as James Madison so wisely noted, an overactive government \nis an invitation to the rich and the powerful to use government to \ntheir benefit and to the detriment of their competitors.\n  That goes to show there is a great benefit to stability in laws as \nopposed to constant change--the very purpose Madison sets out for the \nSenate.\n  A cornerstone of liberty is the rule of law, meaning the law is \ntransparent and no one is above the law. If you look around the world \ntoday, the poorest and least free countries are the ones where there is \nno rule of law. If someone can take what you have earned through force \nand you have no legal recourse, that is an example where there is no \nrule of law. If the rich and the powerful get special privileges, that \nis an example of where the rule of law has broken down.\n  The rule of law is one of the principles our country was founded \nupon. But when there are so many rules and they are changing so quickly \nthe average citizen cannot keep up, that undermines the rule of law.\n  Of course, the situation is only made worse when the rules already on \nthe books are waived for the politically connected. Of course, that is \nanother problem, but one that has become all too common under this \nadministration, particularly with the health care reform law, where 29 \nchanges have already been made by the President on his own volition, \nand some of us believe even contrary to law. As an example, I have even \nheard some Democratic Senators comment: How can the President make the \nchange on employer mandates?\n  Of course, going back to the Senate's role, I am not making a case \nfor doing nothing or that we should be happy with the failure of the \nSenate to debate legislation. The Senate is supposed to be slow and \ndeliberative, not stopped. That is why we are called the greatest \ndeliberative body in the world. Still, it is important to get away from \nthis notion that somehow the failure to ram legislation through the \nSenate with no debate and no amendments is a problem.\n  The reason the Senate doesn't function when the majority leader tries \nto run it that way is very simple. The Senate was not designed to do \nbusiness that way. The Senate was intended to be the deliberative body \nwe always praise and has been for most of its history. But it has now \nbecome routine for the leadership to file cloture to end consideration \nof a matter immediately upon moving to it. By contrast, the regular \norder is for the Senate to consider a matter for some period of time--\nhow long would vary--but allowing Senators from all parties to weigh in \nbefore cloture is even contemplated.\n  Cloture was invented to allow the Senate to end consideration of a \nmatter after the vast majority of Senators had concluded it has \nreceived sufficient consideration. Prior to that, there was no way to \nend debate so long as at least one Senator wished to keep deliberating. \nCloture was a compromise between the desire to move things along and \nthe principle that each Senator, as a representative of his or her \nrespective State, has the right to participate fully in the legislative \nprocess.\n  The compromise was originally that two-thirds of Senators voting had \nto be satisfied a matter had received sufficient consideration. That \nwas reduced to three-fifths of all Senators. Each time this matter is \nrenegotiated, the compromise leans more in favor of speeding up the \nprocess at the expense of allowing Senators to fully represent the \npeople of their respective States.\n  The majority leadership routinely files cloture immediately upon \nproceeding to a matter. Again, cloture is a tool to cut off further \nconsideration of a matter when it appears it is dragging on too long. \nOne can hardly claim the Senate has taken too much time to deliberate \nover something when it hasn't even begun consideration and debate of \nthe specific matter.\n  According to data from the Congressional Research Service, there were \nonly seven times during the first session of this current Congress the \nSenate started to consider a bill for a day or more before cloture was \nfiled. That is out of 34 cloture motions related to legislative \nbusiness. The number of same-day cloture filings has more than doubled \ncompared to when Republicans last controlled the Senate.\n  Moreover, the total number of cloture motions filed each session of \nCongress under this majority leadership has roughly doubled compared to \nthe period from 1991 to 2006, under majority leaders of both political \nparties. Before 1991, cloture was even more rare. This is a sign that \ncloture is being overused, even abused, by the majority.\n  Still, if this alarming rise in cloture motions was a legitimate \nresponse to a minority of Senators insisting on extended debate to \ndelay proceedings beyond what is necessary for reasonable deliberation, \notherwise known as a filibuster, then of course it would be justified. \nThat is clearly not the case when the overwhelming number of motions to \ncut off debate are made before debate has even started.\n  What amount of time is necessary for deliberations and what is purely \ndilatory in any particular case is, of course, a subjective \ndetermination. However, the practice of routinely moving to cut off \nconsideration of virtually every measure when there has not even yet \nbeen any deliberation cannot be justified in a body termed ``the most \ndeliberative body in the world''--that being the U.S. Senate.\n  So we are in a situation where this is very much an abuse of the \ncloture motion. Along with the routine blocking of amendments, cloture \nabuse is preventing Senators from doing what we are paid to do; that \nis, to represent the people of our States.\n  Shutting Senators out of the deliberative process isn't just an \nargument about dry Senate procedure, as the majority leader has tried \nto suggest in response to criticisms. When Senators are blocked from \nparticipating in the legislative process, the people they represent are \neffectively disenfranchised.\n  When I say people are disenfranchised when the majority leadership \nshuts Senators out of the process, I don't just mean citizens of the 45 \nStates that elected Republican Senators. The citizens of States that \nelected Democratic Senators also expect those Senators to offer \namendments and engage with their colleagues from different parties. \nShutting down consideration of a bill before it has been considered \nprevents even Members of the majority party from offering amendments \nwhich may be important to the people of their respective States. Voters \nhave a right to expect the people they elect to actually do the hard \nwork of representing them, not just be a rubberstamp for their \nleadership's legislative agenda.\n  Senators who go along with tactics which disenfranchise their own \nconstituents should have to answer to those who voted them into office \nas to why they aren't willing to do the job they were elected to do. \nThat job includes not just offering amendments\n\n[[Page S994]]\n\nwhen appropriate but taking tough votes which reveal to their \nconstituents where that Senator stands. The majority leader has gone \nout of his way to shield members of his caucus from taking votes that \nmay hurt them back home. Senators don't have any right to avoid tough \nvotes. That is not the deliberative process James Madison envisioned \nand expressed in the writings of the Federalist Papers.\n  If we are going to have good laws which can stand the test of time, \nthe Senate must be allowed to function as it was intended to function. \nOne aspect of what is needed to return the Senate to its proper \nfunction as a deliberative body is to end cloture abuse.\n  I would ask my colleagues to reflect on all the changes to the Senate \nrecently, including those negotiated between the two leaders a year ago \nin return for a promise--which was not kept--not to use the nuclear \noption, as well as the subsequent use of the nuclear option yet 10 \nmonths later, last November.\n  Those reforms, if you can call them reforms, have been in the \ndirection of reducing the ability of individual Senators to represent \nthe people of their States and at the same time concentrating power \nwith the majority leadership. It is time we had some reforms to get the \nSenate back functioning as a deliberative body as was intended under \nthe Constitution. The Senate is supposed to be a place where all voices \nare heard and reason can rise above partisanship.\n  I urge all my colleagues to reflect on these thoughts and think about \nour responsibility to the people of our States. If we do, I am sure we \ncan come up with some sensible reforms to end the abuse of cloture and \nrestore the Senate to the deliberative body the Framers of the \nConstitution intended it to be and, most importantly, as expressed by \nJames Madison. I will be thinking about that, and I would encourage all \nmy colleagues to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n\n\n                               ObamaCare\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Iowa talks \nconvincingly and persuasively about so many times when Members are shut \nout of the process. Certainly chief among those would have been in \n2009, when we could have used the expertise of Senator Grassley, had \nour colleagues across the aisle been willing to work with him in a \nbipartisan fashion to write a bipartisan health care bill which \nemployed market principles and competition. Instead, just as he \nmentioned in his remarks, he was shut out of the process, as were all \nRepublicans. So we have an ObamaCare law on the books now supported by \nevery Democrat in the Senate and supported by no Republicans, some 18 \npercent of our gross domestic product turned on its head by this \nlegislation, and it was not done in a bipartisan fashion as anything \nthis big should be done. The Senator is correct, and I appreciate him \nmentioning the larger sense in which Members feel they are being shut \nout of the process.\n  I rise tonight particularly to call Members' attention to an op-ed in \ntoday's Wall Street Journal, Monday, February 24, page A-15, entitled \n``ObamaCare and My Mother's Cancer Medicine,'' by Stephen Blackwood.\n  I have no idea about Stephen Blackwood's politics. The article at the \nend says Mr. Blackwood is president of Ralston College, a planned \nliberal arts institution in Savannah, GA. So I know he comes from \nacademia, and I know he loves his mother and is concerned with what \nObamaCare has done to his mother's cancer coverage.\n  The story Mr. Blackwood tells about his mother Catherine reflects the \nvery real life-or-death consequences of the President's health care \nlaw. Many of us who oppose the law often point to the financial costs, \nthe delays, and the flawed implementation. But the human aspect is much \nmore tragic.\n  In relaying his family's current situation in this op-ed in the Wall \nStreet Journal today, Mr. Blackwood depicts the law's devastating \neffects on individual Americans. He begins by saying:\n\n       When my mother was diagnosed with carcinoid cancer in 2005, \n     when she was 49, it came as a lightning shock.\n\n  I know it would to any family. He goes on to say later:\n\n       Anyone who's been there knows that a cancer diagnosis is \n     terrifying.\n\n  He explains later on in the op-ed that:\n\n       Carcinoid, a form of neuroendocrine cancer, is a terminal \n     disease but generally responds well to treatment by \n     Sandostatin, a drug that slows tumor growth and reduces (but \n     does not eliminate) the symptoms of fatigue, nausea, and \n     gastrointestinal dysfunction. My mother received a painful \n     shot twice a month and often couldn't sit comfortably for \n     days afterwards.\n       As with most cancers, one thing led to another. There have \n     been several more surgeries, metastases, bone deterioration, \n     a terrible bout of thyroiditis (an inflammation of the \n     thyroid gland) and much more. But my mother kept fighting, \n     determined to make the most of life, no matter what it \n     brings. She has indomitable will and is by far the toughest \n     person I've ever met. But she wouldn't be here without the \n     semimonthly Sandostatin shot that slows the onslaught of her \n     disease.\n       And then in November, along with millions of other \n     Americans, she lost her health insurance. She'd had a Blue \n     Cross/Blue Shield plan for nearly 20 years. It was expensive, \n     but given that it covered her very expensive treatment, it \n     was a terrific plan. It gave her access to any specialist or \n     surgeon, and to the Sandostatin and other medications that \n     were keeping her alive.\n       And then, because our lawmakers and the president thought \n     they could do better, she had nothing. Her old plan, now \n     considered illegal under the new health law, had been \n     canceled.\n       Because the exchange website in her state (Virginia) was \n     not working, she went directly to insurers' websites and \n     telephoned them, one by one--\n\n  This is a woman with carcinoid cancer whose policy has been cancelled \nbecause of ObamaCare\n\n     --over dozens of hours. As a medical office manager, she had \n     decades of experience navigating the enormous problems of \n     even our pre-ObamaCare system.\n\n  Even with her experience, she had trouble with the repeated and \nprolonged phone waits, which Mr. Blackwood described as Sisyphean. In \nthe end, she was told she could purchase a Humana policy.\n\n  The enrollment agent said that after she met her deductible for all \nher treatments and medications, including those for cancer, she would \nbe covered 100 percent. However, the enrollment agents did not have \naccess to the coverage formularies for the plans they were selling. \nThey said the only way to find out what was in the plan in detail was \nto buy the plan.\n  Does that sound familiar? It sounds like what the former Speaker of \nthe House, Nancy Pelosi, famously told us in 2009. We have to hurry up \nand pass the bill so we can find out what is in it.\n  In this case, Mrs. Blackwood needed to hurry up and buy the insurance \nplan--pay the premiums--so she could then find out whether she was \ncovered, and it turns out she was not covered. The cost of the \nSandostatin alone, since January 1 of this year, was $14,000, and the \ncompany was refusing pay.\n  To quote Mr. Blackwood further:\n\n       The news was dumbfounding. This was a woman who had an \n     affordable health plan that covered her condition. Our \n     lawmakers weren't happy with that because . . . they wanted \n     plans that were affordable and covered her condition. So they \n     gave her a new one. It doesn't cover her condition and it's \n     completely unaffordable.\n       Though I'm no expert on ObamaCare (at 10,000 pages, who \n     could be?), I understand that the intention--or at least the \n     rhetorical justification--of this legislation was to provide \n     coverage for those who didn't have it. But there is something \n     deeply and incontestably perverse about a law that so \n     distorts and undermines the free activity of individuals that \n     they can no longer buy and sell the goods and services that \n     keep them alive. ObamaCare made my mother's old plan illegal, \n     and it forced her to buy a new plan that would accelerate her \n     disease and death. She awaits an appeal from her insurer.\n       Will this injustice be remedied, for her or millions of \n     others? Or is my mother to die because she can no longer \n     afford the treatment that keeps her alive?\n       Like every American, I want affordable health care, and I'm \n     open to innovative solutions of all kinds--individual, \n     corporate, for-profit, nonprofit and public. It will take all \n     of these, and all the intelligence, creativity and self-\n     discipline we have, as well as everything we can offer one \n     another as families, neighbors, friends and citizens--and it \n     still won't be perfect. But it is precisely because health \n     care for 300 million people is so complicated that it cannot \n     be centrally managed.\n\n  Mr. Blackwood concludes:\n\n       The ``Affordable'' Care Act is a brutal, Procrustean \n     disaster. In principle, it violates the irreducible \n     particularity of human life, and in practice it will cause \n     many individuals to suffer and die. We can do better, and we \n     must.\n\n\n[[Page S995]]\n\n\n  At this point, I ask unanimous consent that this opinion piece by \nStephen Blackwood be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Feb. 24, 2014]\n\n               ObamaCare and My Mother's Cancer Medicine\n\n                         (By Stephen Blackwood)\n\n       When my mother was diagnosed with carcinoid cancer in 2005, \n     when she was 49, it came as a lightning shock. Her mother, at \n     76, had yet to go gray, and her mother's mother, at 95, was \n     still playing bingo in her nursing home. My mother had always \n     been, despite her diminutive frame, a titanic and \n     irrepressible force of vitality and love. She had given birth \n     to me and my nine younger siblings, and juggled kids, home \n     and my father's medical practice with humor and grace for \n     three decades. She swam three times a week in the early \n     mornings, ate healthily and never smoked.\n       And now, cancer? Anyone who's been there knows that a \n     cancer diagnosis is terrifying. A lot goes through your mind \n     and heart: the deep pang of possible loss (what would my \n     father and all of us do without her?), and the anguish and \n     anger at what feels like injustice (after decades of \n     mothering and managing dad's practice, she was just then \n     going back to school).\n       We, as a family, were scared and angry, but from the \n     beginning we knew we would do all we could to fight this \n     disease. We became involved with fundraising for research, \n     through the Caring for Carcinoid Foundation in Boston; we \n     blogged; we did triathlons (my mother's idea) and cherished \n     our time together as never before.\n       Carcinoid, a form of neuroendocrine cancer, is a terminal \n     disease but generally responds well to treatment by \n     Sandostatin, a drug that slows tumor growth and reduces (but \n     does not eliminate) the symptoms of fatigue, nausea and \n     gastrointestinal dysfunction. My mother received a painful \n     shot twice a month and often couldn't sit comfortably for \n     days afterward.\n       As with most cancers, one thing led to another. There have \n     been several more surgeries, metastases, bone deterioration, \n     a terrible bout of thyroiditis (an inflammation of the \n     thyroid gland), and much more. But my mother has kept \n     fighting, determined to make the most of life, no matter what \n     it brings. She has an indomitable will and is by far the \n     toughest person I've ever met. But she wouldn't still be here \n     without that semimonthly Sandostatin shot that slows the \n     onslaught of her disease.\n       And then in November, along with millions of other \n     Americans, she lost her health insurance. She'd had a Blue \n     Cross/Blue Shield plan for nearly 20 years. It was expensive, \n     but given that it covered her very expensive treatment, it \n     was a terrific plan. It gave her access to any specialist or \n     surgeon, and to the Sandostatin and other medications that \n     were keeping her alive.\n       And then, because our lawmakers and president thought they \n     could do better, she had nothing. Her old plan, now \n     considered illegal under the new health law, had been \n     canceled.\n       Because the exchange website in her state (Virginia) was \n     not working, she went directly to insurers' websites and \n     telephoned them, one by one, over dozens of hours. As a \n     medical-office manager, she had decades of experience \n     navigating the enormous problems of even our pre-ObamaCare \n     system. But nothing could have prepared her for the \n     bureaucratic morass she now had to traverse.\n       The repeated and prolonged phone waits were Sisyphean, the \n     competence and customer service abysmal. When finally she \n     found a plan that looked like it would cover her Sandostatin \n     and other cancer treatments, she called the insurer, Humana, \n     to confirm that it would do so. The enrollment agent said \n     that after she met her deductible, all treatments and \n     medications--including those for her cancer--would be covered \n     at 100%. Because, however, the enrollment agents did not--\n     unbelievable though this may seem--have access to the \n     ``coverage formularies'' for the plans they were selling, \n     they said the only way to find out in detail what was in the \n     plan was to buy the plan. (Does that remind you of anyone?)\n       With no other options, she bought the plan and was approved \n     on Nov. 22. Because by January the plan was still not showing \n     up on her online Humana account, however, she repeatedly \n     called to confirm that it was active. The agents told her not \n     to worry, she was definitely covered.\n       Then on Feb. 12, just before going into (yet another) \n     surgery, she was informed by Humana that it would not, in \n     fact, cover her Sandostatin, or other cancer-related \n     medications. The cost of the Sandostatin alone, since Jan. 1, \n     was $14,000, and the company was refusing to pay.\n       The news was dumbfounding. This is a woman who had an \n     affordable health plan that covered her condition. Our \n     lawmakers weren't happy with that because . . . they wanted \n     plans that were affordable and covered her condition. So they \n     gave her a new one. It doesn't cover her condition and it's \n     completely unaffordable.\n       Though I'm no expert on ObamaCare (at 10,000 pages, who \n     could be?), I understand that the intention--or at least the \n     rhetorical justification--of this legislation was to provide \n     coverage for those who didn't have it.

ObamaCare made my mother's old plan illegal, \n     and it forced her to buy a new plan that would accelerate her \n     disease and death. She awaits an appeal with her insurer.\n       Will this injustice be remedied, for her and for millions \n     of others?

In principle, it violates the irreducible \n     particularity of human life, and in practice it will cause \n     many individuals to suffer and die. We can do better, and we \n     must.\n\n  Mr. WICKER. We talk a lot about the failures of the Affordable Care \nAct. Because of ObamaCare, 7 million people are expected to lose their \nemployer-sponsored health insurance by 2024. Another 5 million \nAmericans have seen their health care plans canceled, and one of them \nis Mrs. Blackwood.\n  I say again to my colleagues and everyone within the sound of my \nvoice, I don't know the politics of the Blackwood family. They had an \ninsurance policy that worked for Mrs. Blackwood. It covered a vital \ndrug--Sandostatin--that kept her alive from the disease of carcinoid \ncancer, and she has lost that coverage because of the very act that was \nsupposed to help people.\n  Mr. Blackwood says, ``We can do better,'' and I suggest we can do \nbetter. We need to repeal this ill-considered law which has caused so \nmuch pain for millions and millions of Americans and still left 31 \nmillion people uninsured.\n  We need to work together across the aisle in a bipartisan way to fix \nthis system and have a system that doesn't throw innocent and sick \npeople out of their insurance coverage and threaten their health and \ntheir very lives.\n  I yield the floor.\n Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, today the Senate will vote to \nconfirm the nomination of Jeffrey Meyer to fill a judicial vacancy on \nthe U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut. Although I was \nnot able to be present to cast my vote this afternoon, I fully support \nthe nomination of this qualified individual to fill the vacancy in \nConnecticut. If I had been here I would have voted to confirm this \nhighly qualified nominee. It would not have changed the outcome of the \nvote. I congratulate Senator Leahy and Senator Grassley on their \nleadership and hope that we can all continue to work together to \naddress the backlog of judicial nominations.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I see the majority leader is on the floor. Obviously, he \nis seeking recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the President pro tempore could wait for \njust a minute, I wish to tell everyone what we are going to do this \nevening. We will have two more votes tonight.\n  I ask unanimous consent that if cloture is invoked on Executive \nCalendar No. 570, at 11:15 tomorrow, Tuesday, February 25, the Senate \nproceed to Executive Session and that all postcloture time with respect \nto Calendar No. 570 be dispensed with and the Senate proceed to vote on \nthe confirmation; further, that following disposition of Calendar No. \n570, the Senate proceed to vote on cloture on Calendar No. 566, and \nthat if cloture is invoked, all postcloture time be dispensed with and \nthe Senate proceed to vote on Calendar No. 566; further, that following \ndisposition of Calendar No. 566, the Senate proceed to vote on cloture \nof Calendar No. 567, and that if cloture is invoked, all postcloture \ntime be dispensed with and the Senate proceed to vote on confirmation \nof Calendar No. 567; that all after the first vote on Tuesday be 10 \nminutes in length; that with respect to the above nominations the \nmotions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, with \nno intervening action or debate; that President Obama be immediately \nnotified of the Senate's action and the Senate then resume legislative \nsession.\n\n[[Page S996]]\n\n  I express appreciation to my friend for yielding to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that there be 2 minutes for debate \nequally divided in the usual form prior to the second rollcall vote \ntonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, when I was in third grade, I read all of \nDickens and all of Robert Louis Stevenson. I remember two words that \nreally struck me during that time. The words ``pettifoggery'' and \n``balderdash.'' I have heard more pettifoggery and balderdash on the \nother side this evening than I could imagine.\n  The fact of the matter is this. The Republican Party--and many of \nthem are dear friends of mine--orchestrated a partial shutdown of the \ngovernment last year. It cost the taxpayers tens of billions of dollars \nand it accomplished nothing. Well, I shouldn't say it accomplished \nnothing. It stopped cancer research and a number of other things. Now \nthey are trying the same thing with the Federal judiciary by taking \njudges who had passed out of the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously \nand doing what the Republicans did with the very first nominee of \nPresident Obama who came up. They filibustered it--something that had \nnot been done ever in my 40 years here with either Republican or \nDemocratic presidents--ever. This was a judge supported by the most \nsenior Republican in the Senate.\n  Shortly after that, the Republican leader said his primary goal was \nfor President Obama to fail. Unfortunately for them, he didn't. He was \nreelected resoundingly. But they have now achieved a partial shutdown \nof the Federal judiciary by blocking these judges. It is balderdash and \npettifoggery.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the time is yielded back.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Jeffrey Alker Meyer, of Connecticut, to be United States District \nJudge for the District of Connecticut?\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, I wish to discuss the Agricultural Act of \n2014, otherwise known as the farm bill.\n  I sincerely appreciate the Agriculture Committee chairwoman's and \nranking member's work in moving the process forward.\n  I have made it a priority to keep Pennsylvania's agricultural \nindustry and our rural economies strong to support Pennsylvanian \nfamilies.\n  Agriculture is the Commonwealth's largest industry. Pennsylvania's \nfarm gate value--that is cash receipts to growers--is about $5.8 \nbillion. Agribusiness in Pennsylvania is a $46.4 billion industry. \nSeventeen and one-half percent of Pennsylvanians are employed in the \nfood and fiber system. What does this mean?\n  It means that we must have a five-year farm bill.\n  The farm bill creates economic opportunities in our rural areas and \nsustains the consumers and businesses that rely on our rural economy.\n  This farm bill would reduce the deficit by approximately $23 billion \nthrough the elimination of some subsidies, the consolidation of \nprograms and producing greater efficiencies in program delivery.\n  Furthermore, dairy farmers deserve the best dairy program possible. \nThe Senate bill contains many improvements that I support. Dairy is \nPennsylvania's No. 1 agricultural sector. The dairy industry annually \ngenerates more than $1.8 billion in on-farm cash receipts, which \nrepresent about 32 percent of Pennsylvania's total agricultural \nreceipts.\n  There are so many other important items that come out of having a \nfive-year farm bill.\n  I am especially thankful to the chairwoman and ranking member for \ninclusion of a provision to establish cooperative lending pilot \nprojects to aid administration of microloans. These projects will help \nprovide business planning support and financial management expertise to \nfarmers to ensure their success in order to foster economic development \nin agriculture and sustain farm profitability.\n  Making risk management and crop insurance products work better for \nPennsylvanians, especially small farmers, specialty crop farmers and \norganic farmers, is very important. Providing funding through risk \nmanagement, conservation and agricultural marketing agencies to \nunderserved states, the Agricultural Management Assistance, AMA, \nprogram helps to make the farm bill more equitable among regions. I \ngenuinely appreciate the chairwoman's and ranking member's work to \nenhance the Agricultural Management Assistance program, including \nsupport for organic transition assistance. The improvements in this \nbill to crop insurance delivery are important.\n  We have worked to address the unique concerns of specialty crop \nfarmers and beginning farmers, and we have done so in a bipartisan way. \nSpecialty crops are very important to Pennsylvanian agriculture. The \nSpecialty Crops Research Initiative, SCRI, Specialty Crops Block Grant \nprogram and Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Snack Program all advance the \nspecialty crops industry, playing a key role in ensuring that this \nimportant agricultural sector receives continued acknowledgement in the \nfarm bill. These programs remain strong under this bill.\n  In addition, the Nation's organic industry has grown exponentially \nfrom $3.6 billion in 1997 to $29 billion in 2010, with an annual growth \nrate of 19 percent from 1997-2008. In 2008, Pennsylvania was ranked 6th \nin number of organic farms with 586 and 3rd in sales at $212.7 million.\n  I also support the improvements in promotion programs within the farm \nbill.\n  Through research, we develop more efficient and effective farming \nmethods. Research also helps producers maintain a competitive edge in \nthe global market by fighting threatening diseases and pests.\n  I am pleased that the farm bill invests in relevant and targeted \nresearch and maintains the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service \nprograms that work to eradicate the invasive species that threaten our \nnation's forests and farms.\n  The farm bill's forestry programs are essential for assisting forest \nlandowners in managing threats and enhancing stewardship. I am pleased \nthat the farm bill continues important forestry programs so that forest \nowners can continue to create new economic opportunities. I am also \ngrateful to the chairwoman and ranking member for working with me to \nfix USDA's Biopreferred program to even the playing field for \nPennsylvanian forestry products. Revenues from Pennsylvania's forest \nproducts industry exceed $5.5 billion annually. Over 10 percent of the \nState's manufacturing workforce is involved in the forest products \nindustry.\n  I am appreciative to the committee for the inclusion of my provision \ndirecting USDA to work with the Food and Drug Administration toward the \ndevelopment of a standard of identity for honey, a tool which will \npromote honesty and fair dealing and serve the interest of consumers \nand Pennsylvania's honey industry. The majority of our honey is \nimported, but because there is no standard, contaminated, low-quality \nhoney continues to pass through customs and undercut our domestic \nproduct. Pennsylvania is a major player in the honey industry. Honey \nbee pollination can be directly attributed to the production of about \n$60 million of agricultural produce in Pennsylvania annually.\n  I am committed to keeping Pennsylvania's rural communities strong and \nsupport rural development programs that provide access to capital for \nrural businesses to provide economic opportunities and create jobs. A\n\n[[Page S998]]\n\nrural community's viability in attracting and keeping businesses is \noften directly related to the condition of its infrastructure and \nfacilities. USDA's Rural Development programs empower rural \ncommunities, transform local economies and preserve the quality of life \nin small towns across the Commonwealth. A rural economic development \nprogram that saves and creates jobs in rural economies and improves \nrural life is extremely important for Pennsylvanian families.\n  Farmers are the original stewards of the land and continue to lead \nthe charge in protecting our natural resources. I believe the voluntary \nconservation programs in the farm bill provide important tools to help \nfarmers comply with Federal and State regulations while keeping farmers \nin business. I am committed to making conservation programs more \nefficient, effective and relevant to farmers.\n  Conservation programs are an extremely important resource for many \nPennsylvanian farmers. I worked with my Senate colleagues to support \nenhancements to conservation programs through this process in an effort \nto ensure that these remodeled programs would better serve the needs of \nPennsylvanians.\n  Pennsylvania's watersheds contribute more than half of the fresh \nwater flowing to the Chesapeake Bay. While Pennsylvania does not border \nthe bay, activities in the Commonwealth profoundly affect the bay's \nhealth. The bay's tributaries, such as Susquehanna and Potomac Rivers, \nare important to the region's economy, culture and outdoor recreation.\n  Under the 2008 farm bill, the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Initiative, \nCBWI, provided essential support to farmers facing Federal and State \nregulations concerning water quality and helped to meet demand for \nconservation programs. In advance of the Agriculture Committee's \nconsideration of the 2012 farm bill, I introduced the Chesapeake Bay \nWatershed Fairness Act, which among other things reauthorized the CBWI, \nbecause I know Pennsylvania farmers used this program very well.\n  I am grateful that the 2014 farm bill contains portions of this \nlegislation which are aimed at equipping farmers with the tools \nnecessary to better meet water quality goals. To reduce the number of \nconservation programs, the farm bill consolidates four different \nprograms into one that will provide competitive funds to regional \npartnerships and will also provide conservation funding directly to \nproducers. CBWI was one of the programs that got folded into this new \nprogram.\n  I worked very closely with other Senators from the watershed to \nstrengthen the conservation title to better benefit our region. \nTogether we secured significant policy improvements. The current bill \nfocuses on the most critical conservation areas and will help farmers \nin the Chesapeake Bay watershed participate in conservation programs so \nthat they can help the region meet water quality standards.\n  Pennsylvania's agricultural producers and forest land owners use the \nEnvironmental Quality Incentives Program, EQIP, to implement \nconservation practices, which might otherwise be cost prohibitive, to \nprotect valuable natural resources.\n  Further, the Farmland Protection Program, FPP, protects prime \nfarmland from development. FPP is rolled into a new Agriculture Lands \nEasement, ALE, Program to help keep working lands preserved as farm \nland. I support USDA in its efforts to craft the rules of this program \nto allow flexibility so that States are allowed to use their own \neasement terms and conditions as long as they are consistent with the \nprogram purposes, in order to certify successful entities like the \nPennsylvania Department of Agriculture's Bureau of Farmland Protection \nand improve the efficiency of this program.\n  While I do not mention all of the farm bill conservation programs, I \ndo believe that each serves an important purpose.\n  My constituents, and all Americans, deserve some certainty and having \na farm bill will put us in that direction. A comprehensive farm bill is \nsomething that I fought for years to enact and I certainly support the \ngoal of a comprehensive Farm bill to provide long-term certainty for \nour farmers.\n  Chairwoman Stabenow deserves a lot of credit for her tireless work to \nget this bill across the goal line. She managed the very difficult task \nof negotiating a bill that advanced without some of the most egregious \nand draconian proposals, including $39 billion in Supplemental \nNutrition Assistance Program, SNAP, cuts that the House had passed.\n  However, this farm bill contains cuts to SNAP that will be \ndevastating for many of my constituents. There are 1.7 million SNAP \nrecipients in Pennsylvania. I support changes in SNAP to increase \naccountability like stopping lottery winners from continuing to receive \nassistance and cracking down on retailers and recipients engaged in \nbenefit trafficking.\n  But this farm bill will adversely impact many children, seniors, \npeople with disabilities and working families in Pennsylvania.\n  According to the Greater Philadelphia Coalition Against Hunger, the \nSNAP cut in this farm bill will cause 175,000 Pennsylvanian households \nto lose, on average, $65 for food each month. These same households \nalready saw a cut to their monthly benefits just 3 months ago when the \nAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act, ARRA, increase in benefits \nexpired.\n  My guest for the 2014 State of the Union was Tianna Gaines-Turner, a \nPhiladelphia woman who knows all too well the challenges working \nfamilies face. Tianna lost her job in December and is the mother of a \nnine-year-old and twin six-year-olds. Her husband works in a minimum \nwage job. Tianna participates in a research and advocacy project \nfounded by the Center for Hunger-Free Communities at Drexel University: \n``Witnesses to Hunger.''\n  In 2008, Dr. Mariana Chilton provided cameras to 42 single mothers in \nPhiladelphia, simply asking that they use them to take pictures to tell \nus about their lives and their children. These Witnesses to Hunger, \nseeing the opportunity to spread awareness and create change, accepted \nDr. Chilton's challenge and started documenting the poverty and hunger \nthat they face on a daily basis. Living it each day, these remarkable \nmothers understand the trials of hunger and raising a family more than \nanyone else. The Witnesses to Hunger inspire me and challenge me to do \nmore in the Senate. I am incredibly grateful for the guidance they \nprovide.\n  Tianna wrote me a letter that said:\n\n       Our voices and pictures show our pain, struggles. When \n     you're voting, close your eyes and think of the picture of my \n     children. Their hunger pains rest in your hands.\n\n  Another Witness to Hunger, Angela Sutton's son Jahzaire wrote me a \nletter that said:\n\n       I was told that you were cutting food stamps and I want to \n     know why? I need food stamps so I can eat to be big and \n     strong. So I can become Senator one day.\n\n  Every child deserves adequate food so that the light inside them can \ncontinue to burn brightly. It is an impossible situation to raise a \nfamily and have to make the choice between heating a home or putting \nfood on the table. Recent research from Children's HealthWatch \ndemonstrated that improved SNAP benefit levels also have a positive \nimpact on children's health. Children in families receiving SNAP were \nsignificantly more likely to be classified as ``well'' than were young \nchildren whose families were eligible but did not receive SNAP.\n  Hunger and food insecurity is an unfortunate and preventable reality \nfor many Pennsylvanians. Hunger affects working families, children, and \nolder Americans across the Nation and not one community across this \ncountry is Hunger Free. Nearly half of all SNAP participants are \nchildren and 76 percent of families receiving SNAP have at least one \nemployed member. Cutting SNAP is not a way to address the deficit.\n  Moody's Analytics estimates that in a weak economy, every $1 increase \nin SNAP benefits generates $1.72 in economic activity. In fact, \neconomic importance is demonstrated in part by Walmart, which on \nJanuary 31, 2014 put out updated expectations for its fourth quarter. \nIts report stated:\n\n       Despite a holiday season that delivered positive comps, two \n     factors contributed to lower comp sales performance for the \n     14-week period for Walmart U.S. First, the sales impact from \n     the reduction in SNAP (the U.S. government Supplemental \n     Nutrition Assistance Program) benefits that went into effect \n     Nov. 1 is greater than we expected . . .\n\n\n[[Page S999]]\n\n\n  CBO rated an increase in SNAP benefits as one of the two most cost-\neffective of all spending and tax options it examined for boosting \ngrowth and jobs in a weak economy.\n  About 94.6 percent of Federal spending goes directly for food; \nadministrative costs are low. SNAP's error rates stand at record lows; \nfewer than 2 percent of SNAP benefits are issued to households that do \nnot meet all of the program's eligibility requirements.\n  I am thankful that The Emergency Food Assistance Program will receive \nincreased funding under this bill, but there is no way for our already-\nstrained food banks to make up for the increased demand they will see \ndue to the SNAP cuts in Pennsylvania.\n  Therefore, I could not in good conscience vote for this bill.\n  I want this Senate to think about the children of the Witnesses to \nHunger and all others who face hunger in this Nation--and what more we \ncan do to help them succeed in the face of low wages, unemployment or \nunderemployment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/24/senate-section/article/S999-1", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S999]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TRIBUTE TO 2014 OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALIST DAVID WISE\n\n  Mr. HELLER. Madam President, today I wish to extend well-deserved \ncongratulations to Nevada's own David Wise, a Sochi Olympic athlete who \nwon gold in this year's debut sport of halfpipe skiing. Motivated by \nsupport from his family and the Nevada community, David triumphed this \nyear in Russia to bring home one of the United States' nine gold \nmedals.\n  Despite difficult conditions in Sochi that proved challenging for \nthese experienced athletes, David outperformed his skilled opponents by \nscoring a 92 on his first run in the halfpipe. As an American and \nNevadan, I am honored that David represented our Nation proudly and \nbrought home the gold.\n  During his free time, David enjoys spending time with his wife \nAlexandra and their 2-year-old daughter Nayeli. David's accolades reach \nfar beyond his athleticism and victories on the slopes. As a believer \nin service, David frequently supports a number of charities, including \nseveral water projects in the Dominican Republic. This community \nservice extends to his local community, where he runs a youth group at \nhis family's local church.\n  Driven by his purpose founded in sport, service, and family, David \nembodies the spirit of an exemplary athlete that the Nevada Family is \nproud to call our own. I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating \nthis remarkable individual as we show our pride and support for all of \nhis accomplishments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/24/senate-section/article/S999-2", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S999]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JAMES LaROSA\n\n Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I wish to honor the life of a \nremarkable West Virginian who was taken from us on February 15, 2014. \nJames Dominick LaRosa, known to his friends and family as Jim, was a \ntrue pioneer developer who never forgot his roots as he helped enrich \nNorth Central West Virginia into a thriving, vibrant and beautiful \nregion of the Mountain State. As we mourn the loss of a truly special \nperson, I join all West Virginians in keeping in our thoughts and \nprayers Jim's only son, Jimmy Joe, his daughter-in-law, Leigh Ann, and \nhis three grandchildren, Lauren Louise, Natalie Nicole and James Lee.\n  A native of Harrison County, which neighbored my local area in Marion \nCounty, Jim was driven and motivated at an early age. Anyone who met \nhim immediately recognized that there was a bright future ahead for \nJim. In 1944, he graduated from Washington Irving High School in \nClarksburg, WV and then attended West Virginia University. After \ngraduating in 1948 with a degree in business administration, he learned \nthe fundamentals of business in his father's small surface mining \ncompany. At the ripe age of 35, James assumed the position of president \nof his father's company.\n  During this time, his entrepreneurial temperament took flight. Jim's \nunwavering dedication to the area's communities, accompanied with his \ninnovative visions and inspirational spirit, helped improve the \nregion's quality of life, enhanced medical accessibility, built \nmultiple businesses and recreational facilities, created jobs, \nincreased local revenue, boosted visitor access, and most of all, \ncreated a positive image of the North Central region.\n  Many of Harrison County's most well-known areas and attractions can \nbe attributed to the vision and discipline of Jim LaRosa, including the \nPete Dye Golf Course, Bridgeport Hill and the Eastpointe and Newpointe \nShopping Centers. He also focused on projects that underscored his many \ninterests, especially his Italian heritage, quality food access, the \nperforming arts and theater, interior decorating and animals.\n  Time and again, Jim showed how greatly an individual can contribute \nto his community through passion, commitment and hard work.\n  He not only played the role of pioneer developer, but he also served \non several boards of directors, such as the Clarksburg Chamber of \nCommerce, Lowndes Bank and the West Virginia Coal and Advisory \nCommission. In addition, he served on the original board of the West \nVirginia Surface Mining and Reclamation Association and the Director's \n100 Club for WVU Athletics.\n  During his life, Jim received countless awards to honor his \naccomplishments and his commitments to West Virginia's North Central \nregion. He received the Distinguished West Virginian from two \nGovernors. He also received an honorary doctorate degree of humane \nletters from Salem College in 1984. In 1985, our dear Senator Robert C. \nByrd recommended to President Reagan that Jim should be a member of the \nChristopher Columbus 500th Jubilee Commission, which consisted of 35 \nAmericans of Italian descent, in celebration of the 500th year of the \ndiscovery of America.\n  Jim's remarkable foresight, coupled with his leadership skills and \nhis well-deserved accomplishments, has consistently enriched the \ncommunities of North Central West Virginia and across the Mountain \nState.\n  Jim's imprint will always be marked in the countless businesses, \nfacilities, centers and improvements that he established over years of \nhard work and dedication. He will be greatly missed by the people whose \nlives he touched.\n  West Virginians cannot thank Jim enough for the steadfast commitment \nand positive influence he's had on our great State. Jim LaRosa will \nalways be remembered as a truly gifted and exceptional West Virginian. \nAnd though he will be greatly missed, his legacy will always live \non.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/24/senate-section/article/S999-3", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S999-S1000]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DR. KISHORE CHALLA\n\n Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I wish to congratulate one of \nWest Virginia's most dedicated and talented cardiologists, Dr. Kishore \nChalla, on receiving the 2014 Heart of Gold Award, which was presented \nby the West Virginia American Heart Association. There is no one more \nqualified, more compassionate or more devoted than Dr. Challa, who has \nbeen practicing in West Virginia for more than 20 years.\n  A native of India, Dr. Challa has called the Mountain State his home \nsince 1989, and his unwavering commitment to the cardiology field at \nSouth Charleston Cardiology, where he continues to practice today, has \nconsistently saved West Virginian lives across our State. We cannot \nthank him enough for continuing to deepen his roots in the Mountain \nState. His significant contributions, positive influence and medical \nexpertise have helped boost the quality of our medical community as \nwell as improved the health and well-being of many, many West \nVirginians.\n  Dr. Challa's integrity and work ethic know no bounds in a field where \nlong hours and often times emotional, demanding and traumatic \nexperiences become routine. Most cannot imagine the pressure and stress \nphysicians endure on a daily basis, and Dr. Challa's calm, \ncompassionate and enjoyable personality should inspire us all to always \nfocus on the good and the positive. Regardless of the day, Dr. Challa \ntreats all of his patients, staff and friends with kindness and \nrespect, and that is why I am truly proud to call him my friend.\n  Dr. Challa is also no stranger to prestigious awards, including the \nDistinguished West Virginian award, which was created to honor those \nwho have contributed significantly to West Virginia and those who have \nbrought positive attention to our great State. His\n\n[[Page S1000]]\n\ndedication to his patients, his commitment to the West Virginia \ncommunity, and his passion of cardiology have made West Virginia a \nbetter place.\n  It is fitting that Dr. Challa was presented with the Heart of Gold \nAward, for he once stated that in his field, ``helping people is \ninstant gratitude and it's all worth it.'' So today, I congratulate a \nfriend--and a remarkably intelligent and gifted cardiologist--on \nreceiving such an esteemed honor.

Tireless work was undertaken to ensure this project happened.\n  The staff and members of Bogue Falaya have served others with \ncompassion and care, without hesitation, and they prioritize teaching \nchildren about Jesus, the Scriptures, and helping others.\n  Many are told today that sharing one's religious beliefs are taboo. \nHowever, as the oldest church in St. Tammany Parish, Bogue Falaya has \ncontinued to share its beliefs. The congregation has grown, a testament \nto the efforts of Pastor Jake Roudkovski and those who work with him. \nBogue Falaya has been a cornerstone for spiritual guidance in St. \nTammany, and I recognize the efforts of all members of the church \ncommunity as the congregation continues in Christ's footsteps.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/24/senate-section/article/S1000-2", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1000]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NEW HOPE BAPTIST CHURCH\n\n Mr. VITTER.

The church is part of the \nhistorical tour of Gretna and is located next to the site of the first \nschool for African-American children in the city. New Hope has served \nas beacon of light and a place where people in the community can come \nto rejuvenate their faith.\n  It is my honor to recognize New Hope Baptist Church on this \nanniversary, and I offer my best wishes for many more years of faithful \nservice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/24/senate-section/article/S1000-3", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1000]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING TIM LILLEBO\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, earlier this month, Oregonians--\nand indeed all those who cherish America's natural treasures--lost one \nof their most ardent champions, Tim Lillebo. Today, I wish to join his \nwife Karen, his father Tom and a multitude of friends and colleagues in \nmourning the passing of this true son of Oregon.\n  Tim will be remembered as someone with a deep-felt love of Oregon's \nmagnificent wild places. Those of us in Congress who had the honor to \nmeet Tim and get to know him were impressed by his vast knowledge of \nOregon, his personal history as a timber faller and an unmatched \npassion for Oregon's mountains and rivers.\n  He was not your stereotypical lobbyist. More comfortable in hiking \nboots than wing-tips, Tim would have much rather been out hunting elk \nin the Strawberry Mountains than tracking down Members of Congress. He \nwas, in many ways, like former President Teddy Roosevelt--someone who \nliked to test himself against the elements, whether it was rowing down \nthe John Day or Owyhee rivers or hiking into the Oregon's backcountry \nto camp among his beloved Ponderosa Pines.\n  Tim Lillebo was uniquely suited to help heal the differences between \nrural and urban residents. As a product of both Prairie City in Eastern \nOregon and Salem in Western Oregon, he was at home on either side of \nthe mountains, simultaneously maintaining a local's knowledge of the \nbackcountry and an insider's perspective of the legislative process.\n  Tim and I did not always see eye-to-eye on forest management \npolicies. But our differences were never personal, never acrimonious. \nHe could disagree but was never disagreeable. As issues relating to \nFederal forests management changed, Tim adapted. He helped plan \nthoughtful restoration projects that improved forest health and \nprotected rural communities, and did it with an air of collaboration. \nWithout sacrificing his convictions and wilderness advocacy, he led by \nexample in proving there were sometimes agreements in this often \ndivisive issue. When he testified for my original Eastside Oregon \nforestry bill, he made it very clear that he strongly supported \nlegislation to increase thinning restoration projects and at the same \ntime it was necessary to protect old growth. One of those projects, the \nGlaze Meadow restoration project outside Sisters, OR, would not have \ngotten off the ground if Tim had not done the heavy lifting.\n  I will miss Tim Lillebo, both his wise counsel and his ready smile, \nalong with his love of our State and his ability to bring people \ntogether to solve difficult problems. Our country could use more \ncitizens like Tim.\n  On behalf of his family and friends, and his fellow Oregonians, I \nwant to express my profound appreciation for the life and labors of Tim \nLillebo.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/24/senate-section/article/S1000-4", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1000]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/24/senate-section/article/S1000-5", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1000]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/24/senate-section/article/S1000-6", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1000]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n\n              Enrolled Bills and Joint Resolutions Signed\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 3, 2013, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on February 14, 2014, during the \nadjournment of the Senate, received a message from the House of \nRepresentatives announcing that the Speaker had signed the following \nenrolled bills and joint resolutions:\n\n       S. 25.

A bill to protect all school children against harmful and \nlife-threatening seclusion and restraint practices; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to introduce a \nbill to support teachers, paraprofessionals and especially students, \nstudents with challenging behaviors.\n  Last week I released a report titled ``Dangerous Use of Seclusion and \nRestraints in Schools Remains Widespread and Difficult To Remedy: Ten \nCase Studies.'' This report is the product of a 6-month investigation \nby my HELP Committee staff\n  The report highlights the continued use of seclusion and restraints \nin schools, the lack of information families have about these \npractices, and the inability, in many cases, of families to stop the \nuse of them on their children.\n  We found that in many cases, families may not know their children are \nbeing secluded and restrained. In some cases children are being \nsecluded and restrained for months at a time, multiple times a day, \nsometimes for many hours, all without the knowledge of their families.\n  We also found that families do not have the tools to stop these \npractices. Provisions of some of our education laws, such as the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act, prohibit families from \nseeking redress and relief from the use of seclusion and restraints \nwith their children unless they exhaust their due process options, \nwhich can take months or even years. This often leaves families with no \nchoice but to remove their children from school in order to protect \nthem.\n  Finally, the report found it is almost impossible for families to \ngather the information they need to prove harm and to stop the use of \nseclusion and restraints. The lack of access to information causes \nfamilies to give up on their schools and there are many cases where \nfamilies move to a new city or even out of state.\n  These events are not isolated incidents, as some claim. In March \n2011, the U.S. Department of Education published the ``Civil Rights \nData Collection Report'' that showed there were over 66,000 occurrences \nof seclusion and restraints during the 2009-2010 school year. In other \nwords, there were 66,000 times when children were put at risk of \ninjury, psychological trauma and death.\n  These incidents occur everywhere, even in my own state of Iowa. Last \nyear, in a public residential school, at least three young women were \nsecluded for up to 23 hours a day--in one case, for as long as nine \nmonths. If it were not for the good work of my state's Protection and \nAdvocacy agency, Disability Rights Iowa, that practice might have \ncontinued indefinitely.\n  These practices aren't just ineffective, they can cause harm. Take \nfor example 8-year-old Isabel Loeffler, who\n\n[[Page S1004]]\n\nwas subjected to restraint and seclusion when she was living in Iowa. \nIsabel was locked in a seclusion room for up to three hours at a time \non over 100 different occasions. She was held from behind and forced to \ndraw with crayons, sometimes with four staff members holding her. When \nIsabel failed a task, she was secluded or restrained. The use of these \npractices made her behaviors worse, not better, so her parents withdrew \nher from school.\n  Injuries, both physical and psychological, are horrible enough, but \nat times the use of seclusion and restraints results in death. Jonathan \nKing was secluded in an 8-by-8-foot concrete room in his Georgia school \nfrom the time he was a kindergartener. During one school year Jonathan \nwas placed in a seclusion room, unobserved, 19 times over the course of \n29 days for over an hour and a half.\n  His parents did not know this was happening to him.\n  On the day he died, his teacher had given him a rope to hold up his \npants before she secluded him. Jonathan, who hated wearing a belt, had \nthreatened to kill himself before. While he was in seclusion that day \nhe hung himself with that rope. Jonathan was just 13-years-old.\n  It is time to put a stop to these abuses. We need make sure schools \nhave access to the practices to serve our children well. The data show \nthat too many teachers do not have the tools they need to help children \nwith challenging behaviors. Too many parents do not know how their \nchildren are being treated at school. And too many children are being \nmentally and physically scarred because of the use of these harmful \npractices and the lack of knowledge about positive alternatives.\n  So I have come to the floor, today, to urge my colleagues to join \nwith me in stopping these unconscionable practices. I come to ask that \nwe work to provide teachers and administrators with the knowledge and \nskills they need to teach children in safe, supportive environments and \nto stop these violations of basic human rights. It is time to stop the \nsystematic use of restraint and seclusion in our schools.\n  In the United States, we have regulations to protect people in \nhospitals, in nursing homes, and in psychological facilities from \nrestraint and seclusion. But not in our schools. The last frontier for \nprohibiting seclusion and allowing restraint only in emergency \nsituations is our classrooms.\n  This is why, today, I am introducing the Keeping All Students Safe \nAct. This bill prohibits the use of seclusion as well as mechanical and \nchemical restraints in schools. Period. Complete prohibition of these \npractices that have no educational or therapeutic benefits for \nchildren.\n  My bill also places strict limits on when, how, and by whom physical \nrestraints may be used. Physical restraints could only be used in \nemergency situations. Not for so-called treatment. Not as discipline. \nNot as negative reinforcement. For emergencies only.\n  My bill would also create greater transparency so parents will know \nwhen an emergency situation happens and when a restraint has been used. \nIt requires that schools meet with parents to explain the emergency and \nto plan for how to avoid emergencies in the future.\n  In addition, the bill allows families to file a civil action even if \nthey have not exhausted their due process rights under IDEA. This will \ngive families more power to stop the use of seclusion and restraints \nwith their children.\n  There has been a lot of debate on whether it is right to implement a \ncomplete ban on seclusion in schools. I answer with an unequivocal yes. \nPutting a child in a locked room without supervision is absolutely \nwrong. Because when children are locked up, they frequently hurt \nthemselves in frustration. Sometimes they hit their bodies against the \nwall until they are bruised and bloodied. Sometimes they vomit. \nSometimes, as in the case of Jonathan King, they die.\n  Something is seriously wrong when a child suffers post-traumatic \nstress disorder after attending school. To lock a child up with no \nsupervision is dangerous and, in many instances, can amount to acute \npsychological torture.\n  Proponents of the use of seclusion and restraints call them \n``effective practices'' or ``useful techniques.'' But they are not. A \nchild does not learn how to hold herself still, to listen more \nattentively, or to do her work by having her teacher lock her up, strap \nher down, or sit on her. Using euphemisms and politically correct terms \nto describe these practices does not disguise their barbarity and \nharmfulness. By no stretch of the imagination can sitting on a child be \nabout educating.\n  There are alternatives. We know that school-wide, preventive \npractices can reduce and eliminate the use of seclusion and restraints. \nTen years ago, at the Centennial School in Lehigh, PA, a school that \nserves children with the most challenging behaviors, the use of \nrestraints was pervasive; over 1,000 occurrences per school year. Now, \nthrough the leadership of Dr. Michael George and the systematic use of \npreventive strategies, restraints are used less than 5 times a year and \nonly in the most severe of emergency situations, only by trained \npersonnel, and never as punishment or behavior management.\n  The Keeping All Students Safe Act will make positive behavioral \ninterventions more widely available for educators. It will provide \nsupports to schools to improve the school climate and culture through \nevidence-based practices and data-driven decision-making. The bill \ncalls for better data collection on the use of seclusion and restraints \nin order to document their occurrence and efforts to eliminate them. \nThe bill calls for mandatory reporting so that parents will know why, \nwhen, and how physical restraints are used on their children.\n  We know that teachers want to teach and to keep all their students \nsafe. Let us give them the skills and knowledge to prevent challenging \nbehaviors, and when they occur, to respond to them in the most \neffective ways possible.\n  If Isabel's teachers had the support, knowledge and training that the \nKeeping All Students Safe Act will make available, they could have \nidentified the interventions she needed to be successful. They could \nhave known what reinforcements worked for her. And they could have \nknown what triggers would make her behavior worse. Instead of locking \nher in a closet, where she wet herself and hit herself in the head, \nIsabel's teachers could have fundamentally improved her educational \nexperience, helping her to reach her potential.\n  All children have the right to be safe. Parents entrust schools to \nprotect their children and help them to flourish. Let us make good on \nthat trust by prohibiting seclusion and making the use of restraint so \nuncommon that it is only used in emergency situations.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nremove the 96-hour physician certification requirement for inpatient \ncritical access hospital services; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I started my public service career \nfighting for rural health. In a State that has many rural hospitals, \nthe rural health care delivery system is especially important to \nKansas. One of my first speeches was to rural hospitals. Since that \ntime, I have been beating the drum, so to speak, for our rural areas \nabout how important it is to focus on rural health.\n  I have always said that people in rural towns deserve the same access \nto care and level of treatment as their urban counterparts. I have made \nit my mission to protect our rural health system and patient access to \nthe best possible care. I am honored to serve as the cochair of the \nSenate Rural Health Caucus where I work with my colleagues to fight for \nour rural health care system every day.\n  Unfortunately, these days it feels as though rural health care, and \nall of those involved in it, face an uphill battle. Over the past few \nyears, the rural health system has continued to face even more \nchallenges.\n  Funding for rural health care programs has been targeted again and \nagain. This year the Senate Finance Committee held a markup with \nregular order where we considered some of the rural extenders that are \nabsolutely vital to our rural communities. Regrettably, we have more \nwork to do. We have to convince and educate our colleagues, this \nadministration, and everyone else about the importance of rural health \ncare. We have been successful in protecting some of the ideas I have \nchampioned, especially on the rural extenders side, but we have more \nwork to do. As this process moves forward, we need to ensure we follow \nregular order on the floor of the Senate and for any pay-fors for the \ndoc fix package. While I was pleased with some of the additions that \naddressed rural health care in the package passed out of committee, I \nhave concerns that these issues were not included or addressed in the \nmost recent package introduced in the House and in the Senate.\n  In addition to ensuring rural health is part of any moving \nlegislation, I wish to ensure it is a package that is offset and paid \nfor, and this has to be done before I can support it. But the bottom \nline is that we, the Senate, need to return to regular order and ensure \nthat practice does continue.\n  As will many of my colleagues in the Senate, I will continue to \nvigorously fight to rein in Federal spending and to\n\n[[Page S1008]]\n\nreduce the deficit. In order to address this fiscal crisis, I think \nCongress must enact basic structural changes to entitlement programs \nthat will strengthen and preserve these programs for future generations \nwhile protecting current participants. Without real tangible reform and \ncuts in Federal spending, we will bankrupt the country. At the same \ntime, we need to ensure that any of those policies we put in place do \nnot result in a disproportionate impact on our rural health care system \nor restrict patients' access to the care they need. As I started saying \ntoday, this is going to be an uphill battle. But I, for one, am ready \nto lead the charge.\n  As a member of both the Finance and HELP Committees, as well as the \ncochair of the Rural Health Caucus, I have tried to be a leader in the \ndiscussion about the need to address the entire health system.\n  I have made it a point that within our health care system \ndiscussions, we need to talk about the differences between our rural \nareas and the care and treatment provided in those rural settings and \ntheir urban counterparts. We need to address common misconceptions \nabout funding challenges in rural communities before taking a Lizzie \nBorden ax to the funding streams.\n  Throughout my career in public office, I have made it a point to \nalways fight for Kansas and rural health care providers. This has been \none of my top priorities in Congress. I understand the important role \nof rural health in America and continue to advocate for policies that \nprotect and preserve these benefits.\n  Most recently, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services--CMS--\nhave made some changes that will be particularly harmful to rural \nhealth. More specifically, their changes will force doctors into a \nguessing game about their patients. The condition of payment changes \nCMS is making would require the physician, and no other level provider, \nto not only predict at the time of admission to the critical access \nhospital that the patient will require hospital care for more than two \nmidnights, but also that the patient can be cared for and discharged in \nless than 96 hours. This is an extremely narrow CMS window for the \nphysician to make a determination about that patient's future needs--\nextremely difficult, if not impossible. A physician may certify that \nthey expect the patient to be treated and discharged within 96 hours, \nbut, unfortunately, the patient's situation may change and they may \nneed to be kept longer. The physician's concern will be that they have \nfailed to meet the terms of their certification according to CMS. This \nis likely to lead to premature discharges and readmissions, both of \nwhich CMS has taken actions to minimize.\n  A CEO for one of our critical access hospitals in Council Grove, KS, \nwrites:\n\n       This new ``condition of payment'' rule causes potential \n     conflicts with what is best for the patient, causes issues \n     for the physician in having to predict outcomes at admission \n     in complex cases, and may cause increased expense for \n     medically unnecessary transfers to more costly care centers.\n\n  Today I am introducing the Critical Access Hospital Relief Act of \n2014. My bipartisan legislation would remove the condition of payment \nfor critical access hospitals that requires a physician to certify that \neach patient will be discharged or transferred in less than 96 hours. \nThis is another example of having to tell CMS, ``If it isn't broken, \nthen there is no need to fix it.'' We need to focus on ensuring rural \npatients have access to their health system, not coming up with \nbureaucratic ways to make it harder for patients in rural areas to get \nquality care from their doctors.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor the Critical Access Hospital Relief \nAct of 2014.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/24/senate-section/article/S1008-1", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1008]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 360--TO AUTHORIZE TESTIMONY AND REPRESENTATION IN \n                        UNITED STATES V.
