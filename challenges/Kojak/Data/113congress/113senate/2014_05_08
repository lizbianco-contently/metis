Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 332, H.R. \n3474.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 332, H.R. 3474, to amend \n     the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow employers to \n     exempt employees with health coverage under TRICARE or the \n     Veterans Administration from being taken into account for \n     purposes of the employer mandate under the Patient Protection \n     and Affordable Care Act.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, following my remarks and those of the \nRepublican leader, the Senate time until 11:15 a.m. will be equally \ndivided and controlled.\n  There will be a series of votes beginning at 11:15 today and another \nseries of votes at 1:45. This is to confirm a number of nominations. \nThere could be as many as nine votes. We will see what happens as the \nday goes on.\n  Yesterday I filed cloture on S. 2262, the energy efficiency bill. As \na result, the filing deadline for all first degree amendments is today \nat 1 p.m.\n\n\n                             Obstructionism\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, anyone who watches the Senate on C-SPAN \nknows that the desks in the Senate Chamber are split between Democrats \nand Republicans. But when I come to the Senate Chamber anymore, we \nshouldn't have just Democrats and Republicans; we should have \nobstructionists.\n  With the Democrats, there are 55 of us. With the Republicans, \nanymore, there are six or seven on a good day. There are \nobstructionists of about 40, for sure, on any day.\n  The legislators--Republicans who, like Senate Democrats, are tired of \nall the useless obstruction, who want to get things done for Americans, \nand the obstructionists--the guardians of gridlock, as the Republican \nleader has proudly called himself--are playing politics and constantly \ngrinding the wheels of the Senate to a standstill, a stop.\n  Over the last few months, I have spoken with Republicans who are fed \nup with obstructionism in this body. I\n\n[[Page S2832]]\n\nhave spoken with them in my office when they come to see me, on the \nSenate floor, and in various places. So these Republicans always have \nthe same message from me: We came to the Senate to get things done, so \nlet's work together. I am happy to work with them, as we did a few \nmonths ago with the Child Care and Development Block Grant. That is who \nI have always been in this Chamber. When I was the whip, my Republican \ncolleagues knew I was someone they could talk to and work with to get \nthings done.\n  It is a shame the Republican leader has decided that being the \n``proud guardian of gridlock''--his words, not mine--is more important \nthan working with us to get things done for the American people.\n  The Shaheen-Portman energy efficiency bill before the Senate is a \nperfect example. They brought their bipartisan legislation to the floor \nlast September. Regrettably, a Republican Senator on a one-man crusade \nagainst health benefits for Senate staffers filibustered the bill. But \nSenators Shaheen and Portman didn't give up. Instead, they worked with \nDemocrats and Republicans for seven months to strengthen the bill, \ngaining more bipartisan support along the way.\n  This legislation will give our country more energy independence, \nprotect our environment, and save American families money on their \nenergy bills. It also creates 200,000 jobs that can't be exported.\n  When the legislation was finalized, Senators Shaheen and Portman were \nready to bring the bill to the Senate floor. In anticipation of the \nbill's consideration, Republicans who worked on this bill came to speak \nwith me prior to the Easter recess. They told me the bill, which now \nincludes 10 Republican-supported amendments, was ready for passage. \nThey requested that I fill the legislative tree to ensure the bill \nwould pass.\n  I repeat: Republican Senators wanting to pass this bipartisan bill \nasked me to bring the bill to a vote as soon as possible--as is.\n  And that is what I did.\n  For those Republicans acting in good faith, passage of the energy \nefficiency legislation was most important. Unfortunately, the \nobstructionist wing of the Republican caucus has decided once again to \nblock this bill. But this time it is not the junior Senator from \nLouisiana bringing a bipartisan bill to a screeching halt; it is the \nguardian of gridlock himself, my friend, the Republican leader.\n  Senators Portman, Ayotte, Collins, Hoeven, Isakson, Murkowski, and \nWicker have done good work on this legislation. What a shame they will \nsee their efforts scrapped by my friend the Republican leader.\n  This isn't the first time he has steamrolled members of his own \ncaucus. For example, the Senate considered a bipartisan transportation \nbill. Subcommittee Chairwoman Patty Murray and Ranking Member Susan \nCollins worked for months on that legislation. Notwithstanding the \nbipartisan support for the bill or Senator Collins' hard work, the \nRepublican leader single-handedly dismantled the bill.\n  There are many other examples.\n  After the legislation was blocked, the senior Senator from Maine was \nquoted as saying that she had never seen the Republican leader work so \nhard to defeat a member of his own caucus.\n  If my Republican counterpart wants to keep blocking his own Senators' \nbipartisan efforts, go ahead. But it is not good for the country.\n  Eventually, members of his caucus will break from the gridlock to get \ntheir constituents the help they need, just as a handful of Republicans \ndid with the extension of unemployment benefits.\n  Let me just say this. I am pleading to Republicans to help us work. \nLet's get things done. This is a good bill that deserves to pass. I \ninvite my friend the Republican leader to listen to Members of his own \ncaucus who worked so hard on this legislation.\n  I know back home in Kentucky the Republican leader said it wasn't his \njob to create jobs, but most of us around here disagree with him and \nwant to work to create jobs. In this bill 200,000 jobs will be created.\n  So I say to my friend from Kentucky, honor your Members' efforts and \nthe bipartisan compromise that created this legislation and allow us to \nvote on Shaheen-Portman. Bring this unnecessary obstruction to an end \ntoday and pass this energy efficiency legislation. It is what Democrats \nwant. It is what Republicans want. More importantly, it is what the \nAmerican people want and need.\n\n\n        Measures Placed on the Calendar--H.R. 2824 and H.R. 3826\n\n  Mr. President, there are two bills at the desk due for a second \nreading.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will read the bills by \ntitle for a second time.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2824) to amend the Surface Mining Control and \n     Reclamation Act of 1977 to stop the ongoing waste by the \n     Department of the Interior of taxpayer resources and \n     implement the final rule on excess spoil, mining waste, and \n     buffers for perennial and intermittent streams, and for other \n     purposes.\n       A bill (H.R. 3826) to provide direction to the \n     Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency \n     regarding the establishment of standards for emissions of any \n     greenhouse gas from fossil fuel-fired electric utility \n     generating units, and for other purposes.\n\n  Mr. REID. I object to further proceedings with respect to these \nbills.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  The bills will be placed on the calendar.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                      Welcoming the Guest Chaplain\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we are all pleased today to welcome \nPastor Trevor Barton to the Senate as he delivered the opening prayer.\n  Pastor Trevor, as everyone calls him, serves as lead pastor at Hawk \nCreek Church in London, KY. He is a laid-back guy, not big on fancy \ntitles--the kind of pastor who would rather be preaching in blue jeans \nthan a suit.\n  But under his leadership, Hawk Creek has exploded from a tiny \nfellowship to a congregation of well over 1,000 souls. I hear some \nparishioners drive all the way from Tennessee and Virginia just to \nlisten to his sermons. Apparently, Pastor Trevor's parishioners aren't \nthe only ones who have had a long commute to Hawk Creek. I hear the \npastor sometimes drove in from almost an hour and a half away in \nLexington. He did it so he could be close to his two young sons \nShepherd and Greyson and to his wife Allison as she worked on a \nresidency at UK Hospital.\n  Still, Pastor Trevor has developed important ties with the community \nin and around London. Hawk Creek does a lot of work with the \nAppalachian Children's Home. His church also has an important \npartnership with the local jail. Pastor Trevor's sermons are piped in \nlive and loud every Sunday for the inmates to hear. One of my staffers \ntold me she heard of Hawk Creek performing a baptism for about 70 \ninmates in a parking lot of that jail.\n  I think that says a lot about Hawk Creek Church, and it underscores \nsomething today's guest Chaplain once said: Whether ``you've messed up \nin the past, present, future, you are welcome'' in his church.\n  So I am proud to introduce Pastor Trevor today. We have been pleased \nto have him here as he dignified our proceedings with a prayer.\n  Earlier this week, the Supreme Court did the right thing by affirming \nhis right to do so. I am delighted to welcome this fellow Kentuckian as \nhe carries out this proud American tradition\n\n\n                             Senate Debate\n\n  Mr. President, the American people sent us to Washington to debate \nserious issues. They expect us to take our jobs seriously, to develop \neffective solutions to the issues that matter to them. That is our \ncharge. Throughout our Nation's history, the Senate has been the place \nwhere the weightiest issues have been discussed and debated and, in \nmany cases, resolved.\n  It is where we wrestle with whether to go to war. It is where we pass \nlandmark bipartisan legislation such as the Civil Rights Act, the GI \nbill, and the Welfare Reform Act. But over the past several years, and \nvery vividly in the past several months, that proud history has started \nto erode.\n  Instead of a forum for debate and resolution of the most pressing \ndomestic and international issues facing our Nation, it has become \nfodder for late-night TV. When the American people turn on C-SPAN these \ndays they do not\n\n[[Page S2833]]\n\noften see a majority party driving serious debate on the issues of the \nday. They hear bizarre monologues about greased pigs and a couple of \nKansans the majority leader seems to be thinking about all the time. \nThey see a daily display of absurd political theater that has almost no \nrelevance at all to their daily lives.\n  It is quite disgraceful. But it is no surprise either since the \nDemocratic majority clearly ran out of ideas a long time ago. Their \nrefusal to engage in serious debate is just another symptom of that. \nSenate Democrats are afraid to expose their party's empty playbook, so \nthey play games instead. They fill the time with aimless diatribes \nagainst private citizens and legislative theatrics that are more about \nsatisfying their liberal patrons than addressing the real concerns and \nanxieties of the American middle class.\n  It is all about revving up the far left for them, so they will show \nup in November and save the President's Senate majority. That is the \nhope, at least.\n  But the larger point is this: As Washington Democrats seek to \npreserve their hold on power, they are becoming increasingly untethered \nfrom the daily concerns of average Americans.\n  That is why you are seeing the Senate lose its sense of purpose. That \nis why you are not seeing any real debates. Instead of listening to the \nneeds of the middle class, they dance to the tune of the left. That is \nwhy you see Senate Democrats pushing legislation that would cost up to \n1 million jobs--at a time when the middle class is practically begging \nus to create jobs. That is why you see Senate Democrats basically \nboasting that their legislative agenda was drafted by campaign \nstaffers--with no shame at all. And that is why you see Senate \nDemocrats killing job creation bills the House sends us, without even \nso much as a vote.\n  No wonder the American people are so disgusted with Washington. \nWouldn't you be? The majority's antics this week were particularly \nshameful. They shook their fists and declared that global warming was \nthe most important issue of our age--that to stand in the way of their \npreferred solutions would be, at best, immoral. They shouted it from \nthe rooftops and, presumably, sent emails to leftwing supporters to let \nthem know just how serious they were and how Republicans were somehow \nholding things up.\n  What they did not tell their supporters was that the Democrats' own \nmajority leader, who also spoke forcefully on the issue yesterday, has \nbeen blocking the Senate from voting on global warming for years. Why? \nBecause he does not want his fellow Senate Democrats to have to take a \ntough vote and because he knows it would never pass a Chamber Democrats \ncontrol anyway.\n  As I said, almost everything has become a show in the Senate now. The \nneeds of the middle class are simply lost in the shuffle, and the \ninstitution itself is trivialized, it is diminished. The Senate used to \nbe a place where we would discuss the pressing issues of the day. We \nwould be able to do so again if the Senate floor were not being used as \na campaign studio.\n  On Iran, Republicans have tried for months to debate and vote on \nadditional sanctions to put an end to its nuclear program. We know a \nhuge bipartisan majority would vote for increased sanctions if the \nmajority leader would only allow the bill to come to the floor. But he \nwill not. Just as he stopped us from voting to approve the Keystone XL \nPipeline yesterday, resulting in headlines such as this one from the \nAP: ``Democratic leader blocks Senate vote on Keystone.''\n  ``Democratic leader blocks Senate vote on Keystone.''\n  In fact, at a time when we should have been debating energy, the \nmajority leader refused to allow a single Republican amendment on \nenergy this week--not a one. As I have noted in recent days, the \nRepublican-led House has offered Democrats 125 rollcall votes on their \namendments since last July. Here in the Senate, the majority leader has \nallowed us nine--nine--rollcall votes on Republican amendments since \nJuly.\n  But let me put a finer point on that. Democrats in the House have \nreceived more than twice as many rollcall votes on energy-related \namendments alone as we have received on all amendments since July. That \nis not the way this body was meant to function. It is disrespectful to \nthe millions of American citizens represented on the Republican side of \nthe aisle. They deserve a chance to be heard.\n  The way the Senate operates these days is a travesty--no real debate, \nno amendments, no respect for the millions of Americans represented by \nthe minority party. It has become an arm of the Democratic Senatorial \nCampaign Committee. We owe the American people so much more than that.\n  It is time to focus on the middle class again--to let go of the \nobsession with the far left and the next election. It is time for the \nSenate to be the Senate again.\n\n\n                       Honoring Our Armed Forces\n\n                       Sergeant Jeremy R. Summers\n\n  Mr. President, I want to speak today about a brave young U.S. Army \nsoldier from my home State of Kentucky who was lost in battle. SGT \nJeremy R. Summers, of Brooksville, KY, perished on July 14, 2011, from \nwounds suffered when the enemy attacked his unit with small-arms fire \nin the Paktika Province of Afghanistan. He was 27 years old.\n  For his service in uniform, Sergeant Summers received many awards, \nmedals, and decorations, including the Bronze Star Medal, the Purple \nHeart Medal, two Army Commendation Medals, the Army Achievement Medal, \nthe Army Good Conduct Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, the \nAfghanistan Campaign Medal with Bronze Service Star, the Global War on \nTerrorism Expeditionary Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service \nMedal, the Korean Defense Service Medal, the Army Service Ribbon, three \nOverseas Service Ribbons, the NATO Medal, and the Combat Action Badge.\n\n  Kenneth Michael Summers, Jeremy's father, says this about his son:\n\n       He never hesitated to make a new soldier feel welcome into \n     the unit. There was one soldier who said he was so scared \n     because he was a newbie, but Jeremy stepped up and helped \n     him. [The other soldier] said for that, he was so thankful \n     and would never forget Jeremy. That was a common story when \n     soldiers told us about their experiences with Jeremy.\n\n  Jeremy was not only thoughtful and willing to help others, he was \nalso a dedicated and committed servicemember, and I am sure it was due \nin part to his following the example that was set for him. Both \nJeremy's father and mother, Laura Jo Summers, served in the Army. \nJeremy, who graduated from Bracken County High School in Brooksville in \n2002, enlisted in the Army in March of 2005 and served for 6 years.\n  At the time of his deployment to Afghanistan, he was serving as a \nU.S. Army forward scout observer and was assigned to Headquarters and \nHeadquarters Company, 2nd Battalion, 506th Infantry Regiment, 101st \nAirborne Division, based out of Fort Campbell, KY. Previously Jeremy \nhad deployed to both Iraq and Korea.\n  Jeremy was a voracious reader and loved to watch scary movies. He was \nknown to indulge in a practical joke or two to scare his friends. \nJeremy was also a bright student in school, who earned a degree in \ncomputer engineering after his first tour of duty. Jeremy asked his \nparents for advice about reenlisting and decided to continue serving \nhis country in uniform.\n  Sergeant Summers has followed not only the tradition of his parents \nbut also the tradition of service of so many brave Kentucky men and \nwomen who have worn our country's uniform.\n  ``He felt more comfortable in the military lifestyle than he did as a \ncivilian,'' Jeremy's father recalls. ``I reckon it was only fitting . . \n. since he started life as a military brat and ended as an honorable \nsoldier.''\n  Speaking for his family, Jeremy's father continues on to say this:\n\n       Jeremy was a good listener, a great friend, an awesome \n     brother and a terrific son. I wish all of you could have \n     known him like we did. He is still one of our hearts' \n     greatest treasures.\n\n  Mr. President, we are thinking of Sergeant Summers' family today \nafter the loss of one of their hearts' greatest treasures. These \ninclude his parents, Kenneth Michael and Laura Jo Summers; his \ngrandparents Joyce Wagoner and Mary Fowler, his siblings Austin Hunter \nand Jessica Elizabeth Summers, and many other beloved family members \nand friends.\n  My colleagues and I here in the Senate extend our greatest sympathies \nand\n\n[[Page S2834]]\n\ncondolences to the Summers family for the loss of their son, brother, \ngrandson, and friend Jeremy. We are proud of him for following the \nexample set by his parents and volunteering to wear an American \npatriot's uniform.\n  We are deeply humbled and honored to be the beneficiaries of his life \nof service and his ultimate sacrifice. Without the bravery of men such \nas SGT Jeremy R. Summers, our Nation would not be free.\n\n\n                       Reservation Of Leader Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nleadership time is reserved.\n  Under the previous order, the time until 11:15 a.m. will be equally \ndivided between the two leaders or their designees.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                           Barron Nomination\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor to discuss a \npending nomination, that of Harvard Law School Professor David Barron \nto a seat on the First Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  This nomination is exceptionally controversial and was voted out of \nour committee, the Judiciary Committee, on a 10-to-8 vote. Even a \ncursory look at Professor Barron's record reveals views on the \nConstitution and on federalism that are well outside the mainstream. \nBut I want to put all those views aside and speak about this nomination \nfrom another point of view.\n  So today I discuss Professor Barron's service as Acting Assistant \nAttorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel in 2009 and 2010.\n  According to multiple media sources, while heading up the Office of \nLegal Counsel, Professor Barron was instrumental in formulating the \nlegal arguments that this administration used to justify the targeted \nkilling of American citizens by drone strikes.\n  According to press reports, Professor Barron wrote at least two legal \nopinions laying out those arguments. We also know the Department of \nJustice relied on the legal arguments Professor Barron formulated to \njustify the targeted killing of an American citizen in a tribal region \nof Yemen in September 2011.\n  In a May 2013 letter to the chairman of our Judiciary Committee, the \nAttorney General wrote that ``since 2009, the United States, in the \nconduct of U.S. counterterrorism operations against Al-Qaeda and its \nassociated forces outside of areas of active hostilities, has \nspecifically targeted and killed one U.S. citizen.''\n  According to press reports, that individual was the first American \ncitizen placed on the CIA's disposition matrix, better known as the \nkill list. However, the Attorney General conceded that three additional \nAmericans located outside the United States have been killed by drone \nstrikes since 2011.\n\n  According to the Attorney General's letter, these Americans were \nkilled even though they ``were not specifically targeted by the United \nStates'' as part of a counterterrorism operation.\n  But today I am not debating Professor Barron's legal arguments \nrelated to the drone strikes. The fact is that Senators aren't in a \nposition to make an informed judgment about the nominee because of the \nway this administration has handled the issue, so I wish to address our \nconstitutional duty with respect to the nomination.\n  Article II, Section 2, instructs us to give advice and consent on the \nPresident's judicial nominees. That is not a procedural technicality, \nit is a constitutional imperative. These happen to be lifetime \nappointments, and the men and women we confirm to the Federal bench \nplay a vital role in the life of our Republic.\n  It is my view this body cannot, as things stand today, fully and \nappropriately discharge its constitutional duty to advise and consent \nwith respect to this nominee. I will briefly address some recent \ndevelopments in the courts that lead me to that conclusion.\n  On April 21 of this year, the Second Circuit issued an opinion in a \nFreedom of Information Act lawsuit brought by two New York Times \nreporters and the American Civil Liberties Union against the Department \nof Justice, the Department of Defense, and the CIA. That lawsuit began \nin December 2011 after the administration denied a Freedom of \nInformation Act request from the New York Times for documents on the \nadministration's targeted killing of American citizens outside this \ncountry. Specifically, the Times requested ``a copy of all Office of \nLegal Counsel memorandums analyzing the circumstances under which it \nwould be lawful for United States armed forces or intelligence \ncommunity assets to target for killing a United States citizen who is \ndeemed to be a terrorist.''\n  The administration refused to provide anything in response to that \nrequest by the New York Times. In fact, initially the administration \nwouldn't even acknowledge that any responsive documents even existed, \nbut as the litigation developed, the Department of Justice identified a \nsingle document but claimed it was exempt from disclosure under FOIA. \nThat document is the so-called OLC-DOD memorandum.\n  Essentially, according to the Second Circuit, that is Professor \nBarron's memo providing the legal justification for targeted killing of \nAmerican citizens abroad with drones. Basically, the court reasoned \nthat because the administration had leaked and then officially released \nthe so-called Department of Justice White Paper on the drone program, \nthe administration then waived any basis for withholding the Barron \ndrone memo under the Freedom of Information Act. Therefore, the Second \nCircuit ordered the administration to produce a redacted copy of this \nBarron drone memo to the New York Times.\n  The Second Circuit's opinion confirms that Professor Barron wrote \nthis drone memo. However, according to press reports going as far back \nas September 2010, Professor Barron had written at least one other \ndrone memo on the targeted killing of Americans while he was at the \nOffice of Legal Counsel. That second memo wasn't addressed by the \nSecond Circuit's opinion and hasn't been disclosed publicly.\n  We also don't know whether Professor Barron wrote or was involved in \nproducing other materials related to the drone program that have yet to \nbe provided to the full Senate. For example, the Second Circuit has \nidentified two additional memos from the Office of Legal Counsel that \nit ruled were not subject to disclosure under the Freedom of \nInformation Act. Moreover, according to some media reports, there are \nquite a few additional memos on the drone program. In fact, the Second \nCircuit opinion repeats the ACLU's contention that there may be as many \nas 11 total memos related to this drone program.\n  This fact didn't escape the Second Circuit. In sending the case back \nto the district court for further litigation, the circuit left open the \npossibility that there might be other documents subject to disclosure \ndown the road. The court said, after giving the government another \nchance to submit additional reasons for withholding the documents: \n``The district court may, as appropriate, order the release of any \ndocuments that are not properly withheld.''\n  Let me be very clear. My colleagues should be on notice that more of \nthese documents very well may be made public down the road. In my view, \nthat is all the more reason for the full Senate to receive all \nmaterials on the drone program, written by and related to Professor \nBarron, from the Office of Legal Counsel and do it now before Members \ndecide and are held accountable for their vote on this nominee.\n  It is impossible to overstate the importance of these materials to \nour consideration of Professor Barron's nomination. The memos and \nwhatever other materials Professor Barron drafted as the acting head of \nthe Office of Legal Counsel provides the legal framework for the \nadministration's policies related to killing American citizens abroad. \nWe know this because the administration itself has said so. In \ntestimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, CIA \nDirector Brennan testified that advice from the Office of Legal Counsel \non the drone program ``establishes the legal boundaries in which we can \noperate.''\n  Once again, let me be clear. The Senate cannot properly discharge its \nduty to advise and consent on this nomination without having a full \npicture of this nominee's legal philosophy. A very legitimate question \nis, How can the Senate predict what kind of a judge he will be if we \ndon't know what kind of a lawyer he has been?\n  The Senate simply cannot evaluate whether this nominee is fit for a \nlifetime appointment to one of the Nation's most important courts \nwithout\n\n[[Page S2835]]\n\ncomplete access to his writings. It is even more important now that we \nknow some of those writings concern perhaps some of the most \ncontroversial issues the Office of Legal Counsel has addressed in \nrecent years; that is, the use of drones to kill American citizens \nabroad.\n  Time and again this President and even this Attorney General have \npromised transparency. They have made these promises to us. They have \nmade promises to the American people. We all know in our oversight \ncapacity of trying to get information out of this administration that \nthey haven't delivered on these promises.\n  In that letter from the Department of Justice to Chairman Leahy that \nI mentioned just a few minutes ago, the Attorney General claimed this \nadministration ``has provided an unprecedented level of transparency as \nto how sensitive counterterrorism operations are conducted.'' The \nAttorney General also wrote that the administration was taking all \nsteps to ensure that congressional committees ``are fully informed of \nthe legal basis'' for targeted killings of American citizens.\n  Again, those assertions aren't accurate when it comes to this \nnominee's track record at the Department of Justice. If press reports \nare accurate, this administration hasn't made all the relevant \nmaterials available to all Members of this body yet. I am not the first \nMember of this body to point this out.\n  I give several of my Democrat colleagues credit for publicly drawing \nattention to this administration's shortcomings in respect to this \nadministration sufficiently giving us information. I agree with them \nthat this nomination cannot go forward until this body, every Member of \nthis body, is given access to any and all secret legal opinions this \nnominee wrote on this critical issue of the constitutional basis for \nthe President subjecting an American to killing by drone without trial. \nEvery legal opinion this nominee wrote related to this issue ought to \nbe made available. I wholeheartedly concur in the sentiment of my \ncolleagues, some of them Democrats, on this issue.\n  Again, I think all Senators should bear in mind that these documents \nmay very well become public in the future. Are Senators who are up for \nreelection in a few short months ready to vote on this nominee without \nknowing the full extent of his writings on a topic as serious as the \nkilling of an American citizen by a drone? Are those Senators ready to \ngo home to face their constituents and explain that they cast a vote on \nthat nominee without knowing all of the facts?\n  On Tuesday the administration announced it will provide the full \nSenate access to the Barron drone memo that it was ordered to make \npublic by the Second Circuit.\n  Is this what the most transparent administration in American history \nlooks like, disclosing a memo that a court has already ordered it to \ndisclose?\n  Keep in mind this administration agreed to the disclosure only after \nthe Second Circuit order and a threat from the American Civil Liberties \nUnion. Is that transparency?\n  In fact, I am having a bit of a flashback to a statement I made \nbefore this body just last week about another judicial nominee. That \nnominee led the administration's effort to stonewall congressional \noversight into the murder of four Americans at our diplomatic mission \nin Benghazi. That nominee refused to comply with congressional \nsubpoenas and assisted the administration's unlawful withholding of \ndocuments from Congress. The Benghazi documents that should have been \nturned over years ago weren't released until a judge forced the \nadministration to turn over those documents by issuing a court order in \na Freedom of Information Act lawsuit.\n  Just like the memos I have been talking about today, I am starting to \nsee a pattern, and I am starting to understand what this administration \nmeans by the word ``transparency.'' It means ``show me a court order \nfirst.''\n  Incidentally, I have been for more transparency at the Office of \nLegal Counsel for years, and even more so since January, when President \nObama threatened to aggressively use Executive orders to circumvent \nCongress. It is the job of the Office of Legal Counsel to ensure that \nExecutive orders are constitutional.\n  On January 31 I wrote the Attorney General to ask him to disclose the \nOffice of Legal Counsel's work related to Executive orders issued by \nthe President. I still haven't received a response.\n  I will also note that Professor Barron himself has gone on record \npublicly and urged increased transparency at his former workplace, the \nOffice of Legal Counsel, and for that we ought to give him due credit.\n  In fact, the nominee said this about the OLC--the Office of Legal \nCounsel:\n\n       OLC should follow a presumption in favor of timely \n     publication of its written legal opinions. Such disclosure \n     helps to ensure executive branch adherence to the rule of law \n     and guard against excessive claims of executive authority.\n\n  It couldn't be said any better by me in regard to the letter I wrote \non January 31. He went on to say:\n\n       . . . transparency also promotes confidence in the \n     lawfulness of government action.\n\n  That is a very admirable standard. I would like to call it the Barron \nstandard, and I hope the administration follows the Barron standard \nwith respect to informing the full Senate about this nominee's work in \nthe Office of Legal Counsel. The administration's offer to disclose the \nmemo it was already ordered to make public by a court isn't good \nenough, and it shouldn't be good enough for the other 99 Senators, \nbecause this is already their legal obligation.\n  The administration must turn over not only the memo addressed by the \nSecond Circuit, but every legal opinion from the Office of Legal \nCounsel written by and related to Professor Barron on this issue. Given \nthe lack of clarity thus far, I call on the White House to provide \nevery Senator with access to all Barron materials related to the \nadministration's drone program.\n  I am also calling on the White House to comply with the Second \nCircuit's order and release to the public--not just to Senators--a \nredacted copy of the Barron drone memo that it addressed in its \nopinion. This is the administration's legal obligation.\n  Our obligation, as Senators, is to ensure our constituents have full \naccess to information a Federal Court has ordered to be made public \nbefore we vote on the nomination. Without full disclosure to the full \nSenate of all materials on this nominee's involvement in the legal case \nfor the administration's drone program, this nomination should not \nproceed.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                             Energy Savings\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the \nEnergy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act.\n  While there is much more to be done on energy issues, we have an \nopportunity with this bill to make strides in increasing energy \nefficiency across many sectors of our economy--from schools and homes \nto commercial buildings, industry, and manufacturing.\n  I commend my colleagues, Senators Shaheen and Portman, for their \ntireless efforts to craft a bipartisan energy efficiency bill that has \nthe support of a diverse range of businesses and environmental and \nlabor groups. This demonstrates the broad consensus that being smarter \nabout how we use energy will help strengthen our economy, create jobs, \nimprove our energy security, and protect our environment. Investing in \na cleaner, more efficient energy system is one of the fastest, most \ncost-effective ways to increase our global competitiveness, support job \ngrowth, and save families and businesses money through improved \nefficiency and reduced energy consumption.\n  I have been particularly focused on addressing the burden of high \nenergy costs on families and businesses in my home State of Rhode \nIsland. One of the most pressing, far-reaching, and complex challenges \nwe face in Rhode Island is the high cost of energy to power and heat \nhomes and businesses. Rhode Island and the New England region face \nsignificant energy transmission and distribution challenges, which \nresults\n\n[[Page S2836]]\n\nin consumers and businesses in the region experiencing some of the \nhighest, most volatile energy costs in the country. These high energy \ncosts are hurting Rhode Island families and businesses, threatening the \ngrowth of our economy, and reducing our competitiveness.\n  After paying their monthly home energy bills, Rhode Island families, \nwho have been hit particularly hard during this period of high \nunemployment, are left with few resources to meet other basic needs. \nHigh energy costs also place Rhode Island businesses, manufactures, and \nindustrial users at a competitive disadvantage. To revitalize Rhode \nIsland's rich manufacturing history, we must find ways to lower energy \ncosts.\n\n  These were among the issues explored when I welcomed Secretary Moniz \nto Providence last month as part of the Administration's outreach on \nthe Quadrennial Energy Review. Secretary Moniz had the opportunity to \nhear directly from Rhode Islanders impacted by high energy costs and \nengage in a dialogue of potential solutions.\n  While I continue working with my New England colleagues to find long-\nterm solutions to ensure an affordable, cleaner, and more reliable \nenergy system for the region, one of the things we can do to help \nfamilies and businesses in our States right now is to pass the Shaheen-\nPortman energy efficiency bill.\n  Addressing the existing energy infrastructure constraints in New \nEngland is just one piece of the puzzle. Energy efficiency will also be \nan important tool in reducing demand, lowering energy costs, and \naddressing and maintaining the reliability of our energy system.\n  Improved efficiency not only saves families and businesses directly \non their energy bills, but by also reducing demand, it helps to \nalleviate stress on the power system and can help mitigate volatile \nprice spikes in the New England region, as we witnessed over the last \nseveral months.\n  I would also like to take a moment to speak about an amendment I have \njoined Senators Coons and Collins in filing to this bill to reauthorize \nthe Weatherization Assistance Program. I, along with Senator Collins, \nyearly lead the fight in the Senate for funding for the Weatherization \nand State Energy Programs. This amendment would reauthorize and enhance \nthese two well-established, cost-effective energy programs that support \njobs, contribute to the Nation's economic recovery, and help meet \nimportant goals, such as improving energy efficiency and lowering \nenergy costs.\n  I know that we have many supporters of the Weatherization and State \nEnergy Programs here in the Senate, and I look forward to continuing to \nwork with each of you to ensure that these important programs remain \nsuccessful in improving energy efficiency, creating jobs, and reducing \nthe overall cost of heating and powering our homes and businesses.\n  While we should certainly do much more to advance our national energy \npolicy--and I hope that we can take greater steps very soon--I urge my \ncolleagues to join me now in supporting the Shaheen-Portman energy \nefficiency bill.\n  I once again commend those two Senators for their extraordinarily \nthoughtful, conscientious, and determined leadership. Now we must \nfollow their example and pass this legislation.\n\n\n                           BARRON NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, earlier today, the ranking member requested \nthat the administration provide materials relating to Anwar Al-Awlaki \nso that all Senators would be able to properly evaluate Mr. Barron's \nnomination. The administration has now made available unredacted copies \nof any memo issued by Mr. Barron regarding the potential use of lethal \nforce against Anwar Al-Awlaki. I hope and expect that all Senators will \nreview these materials today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I would note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Booker). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/08/senate-section/article/S2836-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2836-S2837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, we are again voting to overcome \nRepublican filibusters of four highly qualified judicial nominees. The \nnominees are Judge Robin Rosenbaum to fill an emergency vacancy on the \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit; Indira Talwani to fill \na vacancy on the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts; \nJames Peterson to fill an emergency vacancy on the U.S. District Court \nfor the Western District of Wisconsin; and Nancy Rosenstengel to fill \nan emergency vacancy on the U.S. District Court for the Southern \nDistrict of Illinois.\n  Before proceeding with the qualifications of these four judicial \nnominees, I would like to address some questions regarding the \nnomination of David Barron. Mr. Barron has been nominated to fill a \nvacancy on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. There have \nbeen press accounts that Senate Republicans are placing a hold on Mr. \nBarron's nomination because they are seeking access to a Justice \nDepartment memorandum regarding Anwar Al-Awlaki, an Al Qaeda leader who \nwas killed by a U.S. drone strike in Yemen.\n  Since Senate Republicans have blocked every single judicial nominee \nthis year from receiving an up-or-down vote, it comes as no surprise \nthat they would attempt to block Mr. Barron as well. This is nothing \nnew. As for the Justice Department memo, the majority leader and I have \nurged the administration to make the memo available to all Senators, \nand the administration has agreed. All Senators can review it for \nthemselves. All members of the Judiciary Committee were previously able \nto review this memo, and now that his nomination is before the full \nSenate, it makes sense that all Senators will have that opportunity.\n  I am confident that once we proceed with Mr. Barron's nomination, \nSenators will vote to confirm him. He is brilliant nominee who is \ncurrently a professor at Harvard Law School. He is a nationally \nrecognized expert on constitutional law, the separation of powers, \nadministrative law, and federalism. He clerked on the U.S. Supreme \nCourt for Justice John Paul Stevens. Justice Stevens has such high \nregard for Mr. Barron that the Justice attended his nomination hearing.\n  Mr. Barron has been an outstanding law professor and public servant. \nHe has the credentials, expertise, and temperament to make an \noutstanding judge. As the acting head of the Department of Justice's \nOffice of Legal Counsel in the beginning of the Obama administration, \none of Mr. Barron's first actions was to withdraw several of the \ntorture memos that OLC issued during the Bush administration that found \n``enhanced interrogation techniques'' lawful, including sleep \ndeprivation, stress positions, and waterboarding.\n  Mr. Barron has stood up for the rights of gay and lesbian students. \nIn 2005, he coauthored amici briefs in the case Rumsfeld v. FAIR, which \nchallenged the Solomon Amendment. The Solomon Amendment provided that \nif an institution of higher education denies military recruiters or \nROTC programs access to campus, the entire institution would lose \ncertain Federal funds. Until 2011, the Department of Defense \ndiscriminated based on sexual orientation, and many universities did \nnot permit discrimination on campus. In response to a question for the \nrecord from Senator Grassley on the issue, Mr. Barron said: ``With \nrespect to my participation along with other faculty members and my \ndean as amici in Rumsfeld v. FAIR, I believed it was important as a \nfaculty member at Harvard Law School to help in the effort to ensure \nthat gay and lesbian students at my institution continued to have equal \nopportunities to seek legal employment.''\n  Mr. Barron is truly an outstanding nominee, and I hope all Senators \nwill support his nomination when it comes up.\n\n[[Page S2837]]\n\n  Today, we will vote to end the filibusters of four other very highly \nqualified nominees.\n  Judge Robin Rosenbaum has been nominated to fill an emergency vacancy \non the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. She has served \nsince 2012 as a U.S. district judge in the Southern District of \nFlorida, where she was previously a U.S. magistrate judge. Prior to her \njudicial service, she served as an assistant U.S. attorney in the \nSouthern District of Florida from 1998 to 2007. Judge Rosenbaum has \npreviously practiced at Holland & Knight, LLP, and as a trial attorney \nin the U.S. Department of Justice, Civil Division. In 1998, she served \nas a law clerk to Judge Stanley Marcus of the U.S. Eleventh Circuit \nCourt of Appeals. She has the bipartisan support of her home state \nsenators, Senator Nelson and Senator Rubio. The Judiciary Committee \nreported her nomination by voice vote to the full Senate on March 6, \n2014.\n  Indira Talwani has been nominated to fill a vacancy on the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the District of Massachusetts. She has worked in \nprivate practice at Segal Roitman, LLP, since 1999 and has been a \npartner at the firm since 2003. She has previously practiced at the law \nfirm of Altshuler Berzon LLP, where she was also a partner. After \ngraduating from law school, Ms. Talwani served as law clerk to Judge \nStanley Weigel of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of \nCalifornia. She has the support of her home State senators, Senator \nWarren and Senator Markey. The Judiciary Committee reported her \nfavorably to the full Senate by voice vote on February 6, 2014.\n  James Peterson has been nominated to fill an emergency vacancy on the \nU.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin. He has \nworked in private practice at Godfrey & Kahn, S.C., since 1999, where \nhe has been a shareholder since 2007. Mr. Peterson has served as lead \ncounsel on at least 15 civil cases that have been litigated to \njudgment. He has also actively participated in nine jury trials, three \nof which he was lead counsel. Mr. Peterson has briefed and argued civil \nappeals at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, the \nFederal Circuit, and the Wisconsin Supreme Court. He has also authored \ntwo amicus briefs at the U.S. Supreme Court. In addition to his legal \npractice, Mr. Peterson has served as an adjunct instructor at the \nUniversity of Wisconsin Law School. The ABA Standing Committee on the \nFederal Judiciary unanimously rated Mr. Peterson ``well qualified'' to \nserve on the Western District of Wisconsin Court, its highest rating. \nHe has the bipartisan support of his home State senators, Senator \nJohnson and Senator Baldwin. The Judiciary Committee reported him \nfavorably to the full Senate by voice vote on February 6, 2014.\n  Nancy Rosenstengel has been nominated to fill an emergency vacancy on \nthe U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois. She has \nserved since 2009 as the clerk of court to the U.S. District Court for \nthe Southern District of Illinois. She previously served for 11 years \nas a career law clerk to Judge G. Patrick Murphy of the U.S. District \nCourt of the Southern District of Illinois. As a career law clerk, she \nassisted Judge Murphy in hundreds of civil and criminal cases. She also \nworked in private practice at Sandberg, Phoenix, & von Gontard as an \nassociate from 1993 to 1998. She earned her B.A. cum laude from the \nUniversity of Illinois in 1990. She earned her J.D. with honors from \nthe Southern Illinois University Law School in 1993, where she was as \nan editor on the Southern Illinois University Law Journal. She has the \nbipartisan support of her home State senators, Senator Durbin and \nSenator Kirk. The Judiciary Committee reported her nomination by voice \nvote to the full Senate on March 6, 2014.\n  Each of these nominees has the experience, judgment, and legal acumen \nto be good judges in our Federal courts. I thank the majority leader \nfor filing cloture petitions, and I hope my fellow Senators will join \nme today to end these filibusters so that these nominees can get \nworking on behalf of the American people.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I ask unanimous consent that all time be yielded back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Tribute to Charlotte Linsner\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I am here this afternoon to pay tribute \nto an exceptional woman in my hometown. She is retiring from a career \nof aiding victims of domestic violence across Northwest Kansas. \nCharlotte Linsner in Hays, KS, is concluding more than 25 years of \nservice to Options Domestic and Sexual Violence Services with half of \nher time in the role as its executive director.\n\n  Back home, especially in the rural parts of our State where doors are \nleft unlocked and most people know everyone else, we often think that \ndomestic violence doesn't occur on our streets or in our homes or to \npeople in families that we know. Unfortunately, that is not the \nreality, and the evidence clearly indicates that is not the case.\n  Since Options opened its doors 30 years ago under the name of \nNorthwest Kansas Sexual and Domestic Violence Services, 18,000 Kansans \nin 18 northwest counties have been assisted in seeking a safe \nenvironment. There are locations in Hays and Colby, and in addition to \nproviding direct assistance, Options has been instrumental in raising \nawareness of domestic and sexual violence in our corner of the State.\n  Almost from the very beginning Charlotte was there working to help \nthose in need. She has offered compassion and strength and hope to \nthose who walked through Options' doors or called the hotline. Her \ncoworkers use words to describe her such as ``passion'' and \n``spunkiness'' and ``one of the nicest people.'' From my time living in \nHays and visiting Options, I can attest to those attributes. These \ncharacteristics are what make Charlotte so very effective in her job. \nThose who come to Options are bruised physically and emotionally, and \nthey find among the staff at Options understanding and expertise. \nEffective leadership has made this an effective organization.\n  Last year our State's attorney general presented Options with the \nOutstanding Victims Service Organization for 2013, an award at its 16th \nAnnual Crimes Victims' Rights Conference. Mindful that domestic and \nsexual violence is a scourge not just throughout Northwest Kansas but \nthroughout our State and society, Charlotte told the audience:\n\n       Options accepts this award in honor of all advocates and \n     domestic/sexual programs across the State. Advocates go to \n     work each day to find safety for victims.\n\n  Charlotte would be the first to say that great things cannot happen \nthrough one person's work alone. So I also wish to commend all who \nstaff Options, who sit on its board of directors, who raise money, and \nthe outside groups and individuals who tirelessly work to protect the \nvulnerable in our communities. I also want to acknowledge her husband \nLarry and her four children, who have supported her as she has devoted \nso much of her life and so much of her time to helping other families.\n  Charlotte is retiring but not until July 1, and for as long as she is \non the job she is hard at work to solidify her agency's mission. She \nwill lead a capital campaign with the goal of $250,000, and once the \nday comes, she will mentor the new executive director. Not only that \nbut she plans to still work once a month at the shelter house as an \nadvocate, which is how she started her career.\n  Charlotte leaves huge shoes to fill for the next executive director, \nbut with the foundation that Charlotte and others have laid throughout \nthe community in community partnerships and generous benefactors, \nOptions will be helping those in need--our neighbors, our friends, \nsometimes even our relatives--for years to come.\n  Thank you, Charlotte. Best wishes. I am glad you live your life in a \nway that is committed to helping others.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, with regard to the \nHamamoto nomination, the motion to reconsider is considered made and \nlaid upon the table, and the President will be immediately notified of \nthe Senate's action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                           Syrian Atrocities\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Thank you, Madam President.\n  Madam President, I rise this afternoon to discuss the recent events \nin Syria and the United States' response to the crisis.\n  Yesterday I had the opportunity to meet with President Ahmad Jarba of \nthe Syrian National Coalition to hear firsthand about the Assad \nregime's intolerable violations of international law and human rights \nnorms. I will begin by reviewing the situation as it stands today.\n  More than 3 years since the fighting first began, the conflict in \nSyria rages on. The fighting has driven more than 2.4 million refugees \nout of the country and displaced 6.5 million more Syrians inside of \nSyria itself. The violence is so terrible that the United Nations has \nstopped estimating the death toll. According to the Syrian Observatory \nfor Human Rights, at least 150,000 Syrians have been killed. This \nconflict has had a disproportionate effect on children in Syria. A Save \nthe Children report indicates that at least 1.2 million children have \nfled to neighboring countries while about 10,000 have died in the \nviolence.\n  The Assad regime has used every available tactic to terrorize the \nSyrian people. Some civilians have resorted to eating grass as \ndesperately needed humanitarian and food aid has been withheld from \nbesieged communities. The whir of helicopter blades above portends \nbarrel bomb strikes that we have heard so much about that could easily \nland on a school, a hospital or an apartment block. For example, on \nApril 30, Assad's air force dropped a barrel bomb on an elementary \nschool in Aleppo. This attack killed 25 children. This kind of activity \nby the Assad regime is, in a word, intolerable.\n  Yesterday the remaining opposition fighters in Homs, once an \nopposition stronghold, were evacuated under U.N. supervision. If my \ncolleagues here in the Senate have not yet seen the images of Homs, I \nwould urge each of them to take a look at them. The ancient city of \nHoms is absolutely destroyed. In the midst of this, Mr. Assad declared \nhis candidacy for reelection. Although presidential elections in Syria \nhave never been free and fair, this one that he has declared his \ncandidacy for is a farce, and we can add other words to that as well. \nThis is an attempt by Mr. Assad to legitimize the extension of his \nbrutal rule.\n  Bashar al-Assad lost his legitimacy a long time ago. What concerns me \nand so many others is this: Assad believes he is winning. He believes \nhe can starve, bomb, and terrorize the Syrian people into submission. \nIn light of all this it is incumbent upon the United States to take \naction to change or at least to help to change the momentum on the \nbattlefield. Our national security interests are clear and have become \neven more clear in recent days. First, the Iranian regime's status as \nthe world's leading state sponsor of terrorism is well established, and \nits proxies have perpetrated attacks against the United States, Israel, \nand our allies. Emboldened by the Iranian regime's support, Hezbollah \nhas conducted attacks against U.S. targets and western interests. The \nAssad regime has been an important conduit between Iran and Hezbollah. \nAs such, they are fighting side-by-side with the regime forces in Syria \nand providing the regime much needed supplies and financial assistance.\n  It is also abundantly clear that Russia simply does not share our \ninterests in the region. I guess that is an understatement. Russia has \ncontinued to back the regime. It has consistently\n\n[[Page S2840]]\n\nblocked U.S. actions in the U.N. Security Council, including efforts to \ninvoke chapter VII authorization to enforce existing Security Council \nresolutions 2118 and 2139. Russia continues to provide the regime \nmateriel assistance, including ammunition, weapons, airplanes, and \nspare parts that are keeping the regime afloat. From Syria to Ukraine, \nit is clear that President Putin's approach to foreign policy is rooted \nin old Cold War regrets.\n  The administration has taken steps to respond to the protracted \nconflict in Syria. Let me outline a few. First, on chemical weapons: \nThe agreement negotiated last fall has led to the vast majority of the \nSyrian regime's declared chemical weapons stockpiles being removed from \nSyria. Taking most of these dangerous weapons off the table was a great \nstep forward. However, I remain concerned about reports that the regime \ncould keep the remaining 8 percent of those chemical weapons as an \ninsurance policy.\n  Equally, if not more, concerning are indications that the Assad \nregime retains secret stockpiles of chemical weapons that we cannot \naccount for. Further, the regime's use of chlorine gas attacks to \nterrorize Syrian civilians demonstrates categorically that Assad will \nnever abide by the spirit of that agreement--even an agreement that has \nled to that 92-percent removal. Here is what he won't fully agree to: \nto stop using chemical weapons against his own people in clear \nviolation of international law.\n  Second, on humanitarian assistance, the administration has supported \nincreasing efforts to reduce the suffering. The State Department and \nUSAID must be commended for mobilizing a tremendous aid effort. \nAmerican taxpayers have contributed over $1.7 billion in humanitarian \nassistance both inside of Syria and in its neighborhood. This important \nassistance has fed, clothed, vaccinated, and sheltered Syrians \ndisplaced by the fighting. However, the humanitarian crisis remains, as \nDavid Milliband put it, ``a defining humanitarian emergency of this \ncentury.'' So much more remains to be done just on the humanitarian \nchallenge in and of itself.\n  Since the beginning of this conflict I have been calling for a more \nrobust response by the United States. Yesterday I met with Mr. Jarba, \nthe president of the Syrian National Coalition. While we discussed the \nsituation in Syria and while we know this situation is terribly \ncomplicated, his bottom line message to me--and I am sure he will be \naddressing this with other American officials as well--and his message \nwas very clear: Without significant support from the United States of \nAmerica, the fighting will continue and a political solution will not \nbe reached.''\n  We must act to change the battle's momentum and to fundamentally \nshift Mr. Assad's calculus. As long as he believes that there are no \nreal consequences for his actions, he will continue to defy the U.N. \nSecurity Council. Consequently, I have sent a letter to President Obama \ntoday which asks him to consider some next steps.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that my letter to the \nPresident dated today be printed in the Record.\n\n                                         United States Senate,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 8, 2014.\n     Hon. Barack Obama,\n     President of the United States, The White House, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. President, In recent weeks, Bashar al-Assad's \n     reign of terror has intensified. His forces have used \n     starvation as a war tactic by refusing to deliver \n     desperately-needed food assistance to opposition-controlled \n     areas, bombed an elementary school in Northern Aleppo killing \n     17 children, rained barrel bombs on residential areas in \n     violation of UN Security Resolution 2139, and regained the \n     former opposition-stronghold of Homs. Meanwhile, he has \n     declared his intention to run for President. The United \n     States has clear national security interests in Syria, in \n     stabilizing the region, ending Assad's slaughter of \n     civilians, and confronting the Iranian regime and Hezbollah. \n     [However, Assad clearly believes he has the upper hand on the \n     battlefield.\n       First, I commend the work you and your administration have \n     already done to help the people of Syria, a country that \n     journalist Nicholas Kristof called the ``world capital of \n     human suffering.'' The State Department and USAID have \n     mobilized a remarkable humanitarian aid effort thus far. \n     American taxpayers have provided substantial assistance to \n     help those suffering in Syria and the refugee communities in \n     the region. Your administration's agreement with Russia to \n     destroy Syria's chemical weapons has since resulted in the \n     removal of 92.5 percent of Syria's declared stockpile. \n     However, the humanitarian crisis is only expanding as the \n     conflict rages on, and Assad has been deploying chlorine gas \n     to terrorize Syrian civilians and circumvent the chemical \n     weapons agreement.\n       The U.S. State Department recently highlighted Syria's \n     critical importance to the United States' strategic, long-\n     term interests in its 2013 Country Reports on Terrorism. The \n     State Department's findings that civilians in Syria were \n     primarily the target of terrorist violence are deeply \n     troubling. The report found that Iran and Hezbollah provided \n     critical support to Assad's regime by radically boosting \n     Assad's capabilities and exacerbating the conflict. The \n     report also noted that the Syrian conflict ``empowered ISIL \n     [the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant] to expand its \n     cross-border operations in Syria, and dramatically increase \n     attacks against Iraqi civilians and government targets in \n     2013.''\n       I remain firmly convinced that a more robust U.S. strategy \n     is needed to change the balance of power on the ground and \n     prevent either of two scenarios from occurring. First, that \n     Bashar al-Assad could bomb and starve out any opposition and \n     thus retain his grip on power in Syria.\n       Second, as members of your administration have warned, that \n     terrorist organizations could take advantage of the chaos in \n     Syria to establish a new safe haven, like a new Pakistani \n     FATA, from which to launch attacks against U.S. interests.\n       Yesterday, I met with President Ahmad Jarba, to hear \n     firsthand about the situation on the ground. I urge your \n     administration to continue efforts to help the Syrian \n     opposition bring Assad's tyrannical rule to an end and to \n     stave off extremist influence. The State Department's \n     commitment of $27 million in non-lethal assistance should be \n     expanded to include additional assistance for the opposition \n     Assistance Coordination Unit and local councils, which are \n     the face of the opposition for Syrian civilians. With U.S. \n     assistance, the opposition can ramp up its efforts to deliver \n     humanitarian assistance and basic services to communities \n     inside Syria.\n       I am aware of reports that American-made anti-tank rocket \n     systems have made their way to a group of moderate Syrian \n     rebels. Whatever the origin of these systems, I believe their \n     provision can help change the momentum on the ground. \n     However, to take down Assad's helicopters and bombers, the \n     opposition forces need anti-aircraft weapons. If your \n     Administration judges that there are sufficient safeguards \n     available to track and disable such weapons remotely, I would \n     support their deployment to trusted, vetted Free Syria Army \n     commanders. I fully understand the risks of introducing more \n     of these weapons to the region. However, as long as the \n     regime enjoys control of the skies over Syria, its aircraft \n     will continue regularly and indiscriminately raining bombs \n     and killing Syrian civilians en masse. Little else would have \n     such a profound impact on the balance of power on the \n     battlefield.\n       The international community has clear interests in \n     stabilizing the region and preventing future atrocities. UN \n     Security Council Resolution 2139 requires that ``all parties \n     immediately cease all attacks against civilians, as well as \n     the indiscriminate employment of weapons in populated areas, \n     including shelling and aerial bombardment, such as the use of \n     barrel bombs. . . .'' Since the resolution's adoption on \n     February 22, Human Rights Watch has documented at least 85 \n     barrel bomb strikes in Aleppo alone. This is intolerable.\n       I ask that your Administration resume its advocacy for an \n     invocation of Chapter 7 of the UN Charter. Assad continues to \n     violate Security Council Resolution 2139 by deploying barrel \n     bombs against civilians. A tailored and conditional Chapter 7 \n     resolution to respond to the regime's willful disregard of \n     the UN Security Council and the laws of war would not only \n     hold Assad accountable but would also force Russia to take a \n     stand on Assad's continued attacks on civilians.\n       The Senate has repeatedly voiced its concern regarding the \n     deepening conflict in Syria. In July 2013, the Senate Foreign \n     Relations Committee reported out S. 960, the Syria Transition \n     Support Act, which authorized lethal assistance to vetted \n     elements of the Syrian opposition. In the bill's findings, \n     the Committee noted that it was vital to the United States' \n     national security interests to limit the threat posed by \n     extremist groups in Syria. Last month the full Senate agreed \n     to S. Res. 384, which expressed the Senate's condemnation of \n     the Syrian humanitarian crisis.\n       The sheer scale of war crimes, human rights abuses, and \n     regional destabilization in the Syrian crisis is, as David \n     Miliband of the International Rescue Committee put it, ``a \n     defining humanitarian emergency of this century.'' As such, \n     it deserves the United States' attention and carefully-\n     considered action. I thank you for your leadership on this \n     important issue and stand ready to help bring this conflict \n     to an end.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Robert P. Casey, Jr.,\n                                            United States Senator.\n\n  Mr. CASEY. I thank the Chair.\n  Let me outline some of what I set forth in the letter. First, I asked \nthat the President seriously consider allowing the deployment of lethal \nassistance to the moderate military opposition. A serious effort to \nhelp narrow the gulf between the moderate opposition and\n\n[[Page S2841]]\n\nthe better-trained and better-equipped extremist fighters would not \nonly boost morale in the Free Syrian Army but could actually change the \nmomentum of the battle. Yesterday President Jarba expressed his \ncommitment to continuing to fight extremist forces. He made that \ncommitment to me, and I am sure he would reiterate it to others. There \nis no question that there are risks here, but the greater risk is \nallowing Syria to fall into the hands of extremists and to allow the \nregime to murder thousands more Syrians and prevail in this conflict. \nIf the administration judges that it has the confidence in Mr. Jarba's \npledges and that we have conducted sufficient vetting of key opposition \ncommanders, it should either consider allowing our partners in the \nregion to supply lethal aid or consider providing such weapons \nourselves.\n  I have not and will not advocate for American boots on the ground in \nthis conflict, but giving moderate opposition forces the assistance \nthey need to stem Assad's reign of terror and drive back foreign \nextremist fighters is in our national interest.\n  Second, my letter urges President Obama to resume the push for a \nchapter 7 authorization in the United Nations. Getting Russia to agree \nto U.N. Security Council resolutions 2118 and 2139 was a difficult \ntask, far more difficult than it should have been considering \ninternational law is clear about the deployment of chemical weapons and \nthe use of humanitarian assistance as a tool of war. Enforcement of \nthese resolutions is critical. If Assad does not make good on his \ncommitment to turn over 100 percent--not 92 percent--100 percent of his \nchemical weapons caches, there should be consequences. If he continues \nto starve and barrel bomb Syrian children, there must be consequences.\n  Pressing for a chapter 7 authorization would help us hold both Mr. \nPutin and Mr. Assad to their commitments. It would also pave the way \nfor the United Nations to ramp up its cross-border humanitarian \nassistance, which is desperately needed inside of Syria.\n  When we met yesterday, President Jarba was clear: There will be no \nmomentum behind a political solution until the momentum on the \nbattlefield changes. I have believed that for a long time. The United \nStates has an opportunity not only to help end the suffering in Syria \nbut to send a strong message to those who support the Assad regime, \nincluding Russia, Iran, and Hezbollah.\n  I strongly urge the administration to consider the high stakes of \nallowing this conflict to continue unabated, and I ask that the \nadministration strongly consider supporting a more substantial effort \nto properly train and equip the moderate Syrian opposition so they can \nreject extremist forces, defeat the regime, and begin to rebuild Syria.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Collins on the Introduction of S. 2307 are \nprinted in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills and \nJoint Resolutions.'')\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n\n\n                          Peterson Nomination\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. Madam President, I am pleased to recommend \nto the Senate James D. Peterson to be the U.S. district judge for the \nWestern District of Wisconsin.\n  Jim has deep roots in Wisconsin, having earned a bachelor's, \nmaster's, and Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison before his \nfirst career as an associate professor of film studies at Notre Dame \nUniversity. After a number of productive and successful years of \nacademic life, his restlessness for intellectual challenge was \nenergized when his wife Sue Collins interested him in the law as she \nwas teaching legal writing at Valparaiso University Law School. They \nboth returned to Wisconsin, where they each obtained their law degrees \nfrom the university.\n  Jim is currently the leader of the law firm Godfrey & Kahn's \nIntellectual Property Litigation Working Group and has handled a wide \nvariety of commercial and constitutional disputes. He has served as a \nlocal counsel in two dozen patent disputes in the Western District of \nWisconsin. In addition, he has appeared before the Wisconsin Supreme \nCourt, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, and the Court of Appeals \nfor the Federal Circuit, which hears appeals of patent cases from \ndistrict courts across the country.\n  This experience is important for the Western District of Wisconsin, \nwhich oversees many complex intellectual property cases. Since 2007 the \nWestern District of Wisconsin has ranked among the top 25 most popular \nfor patent litigation, largely due to the court's speed--commonly \nreferred to as the ``rocket docket.''\n  Jim is also the author of numerous academic publications, many of \nwhich I had an opportunity to review during his application process. \nRight after law school he saw firsthand the challenges and requirements \nassociated with being a judge when he served as a law clerk to Hon. \nDavid G. Deininger of the Wisconsin Court of Appeals. He has had a \nchallenging and successful career as a legal practitioner. I have no \ndoubt that he will, as a Federal district court judge, excel in yet \nanother career for which he is well suited.\n  Jim has my full support, and I am happy to recommend him to the \nSenate for swift confirmation.\n  I would like to conclude by thanking my colleague Senator Baldwin for \nthe bipartisan process that resulted in the selection of this well-\nqualified jurist who will serve Wisconsin's Western District well.\n  The Western District is currently facing a judicial emergency. U.S. \ndistrict judge Barbara Crabb has continued to serve on the bench \ndespite retiring 4 years ago, and I sincerely appreciate her dedication \nin the State of Wisconsin during this vacancy.\n  I have full confidence that with Jim's expertise and experience, he \nwill now be able to fill this void.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hirono). The Senator from Wisconsin.\n\n\n                          Peterson Nomination\n\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Madam President, I rise this afternoon to urge my \ncolleagues to confirm James Peterson for the United States District \nCourt of the Western District of Wisconsin.\n  I will start where my colleague left off, which is to state that I am \nproud to have worked with Senator Johnson to put in place a nonpartisan \nFederal Nominating Commission and a process for moving judicial \nnominations forward, because the people of Wisconsin deserve to have \nexperienced and highly qualified judges working for them, and they \ndeserve to have judicial vacancies filled on a timely basis.\n  Addressing vacant Federal judgeships in Wisconsin has been a top \npriority of mine since I was sworn into the Senate last year. I thank \nSenator Johnson for working to find common ground with me on this very \nimportant issue for Wisconsin.\n  Together, we believe James Peterson will be an outstanding Federal \ndistrict judge, and his experience, qualifications, and expertise will \nserve the Western District of Wisconsin and our Nation very well.\n  James Peterson was among those recommended by our nominating \ncommission, and together Senator Johnson and I submitted his name to \nthe White House for consideration. I am so pleased President Obama \nnominated him to serve and that his nomination was reported out of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee.\n  For the last 14 years Jim's professional life has been devoted to the \npractice for the firm Godfrey & Kahn in Madison, WI, where he is the \nleader of the firm's intellectual property litigation working group. \nHis work on behalf of his firm's national clients has been \nsubstantially before the U.S. District Court for the Western District \nof Wisconsin.\n  Outside of his practice Jim is a leader in the Western District Bar \nAssociation, the mission of which is to work with attorneys, the court, \nand the public to facilitate the just, speedy, respectful, and \nefficient resolution of all matters before the court--qualities that \nhave been the hallmarks of the Western District of Wisconsin. In an \neffort to foster the next generation of great lawyers, Jim is a member \nof the adjunct faculty of the University of Wisconsin Law School where \nhe has taught copyright law and public speaking workshops.\n  I am proud to join Senator Johnson in supporting this nomination, and \nI\n\n[[Page S2842]]\n\nam proud to come before my colleagues and ask my colleagues to confirm \nthis judgeship. Mr. Peterson's confirmation today will end a vacancy \nthat has lasted for more than 5 years and has been declared a judicial \nemergency. We are most grateful for the tireless commitment of soon-to-\nbe really retired Judge Barbara Crabb who has filled in during this \nvacancy, and we are very grateful for her commitment.\n  Senator Johnson and I agree on this nomination to the U.S. District \nCourt for the Western District of Wisconsin, and our joint support \nshould send a strong message to the entire Senate that he is the right \nchoice for this judgeship. I urge my colleagues to confirm James D. \nPeterson so he can serve the people of Wisconsin and our Nation.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Energy Efficiency Amendment\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I rise to offer an amendment to S. 2262 \nthat would prevent the Environmental Protection Agency from a massive \nregulatory outreach. I understand under current procedure we are not \nallowed to do that, but I will explain it so when I can bring this \namendment up, people will already know about it and join me in voting \nfor it. It is similar to an amendment I offered last September to the \nenergy efficiency bill. Unfortunately, the Senate majority leader \nblocked amendments from being considered. I am hoping that doesn't \nhappen this time.\n  My amendment is simple and straightforward. It promotes the right of \neach State to deal with its own problems. It returns the regulation of \nregional haze to where it properly belongs: in the hands of State \nofficials who are more familiar with the problem and know the best way \nto address it. I hope my colleagues will support my effort.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency's move to partially disapprove of \nthe State of Wyoming's regional haze will create an economic and \nbureaucratic nightmare that will have a devastating impact on western \neconomies. The decision by the EPA ignores more than a decade's worth \nof work on this subject by officials in my home State and seems to be \nmore designed to regulate coal out of existence than to regulate haze. \nThe haze we most need to regulate, in fact, seems to be the one that is \nclouding the vision of the EPA as it promotes a plan that would impose \nonerous regulations on powerplants that will, in turn, pass those \nincreased costs in the form of higher energy prices on to consumers. \nThese are the middle-class folks we keep talking about. It will also \nincrease the cost for manufacturers, and that will drive them overseas, \nso that will eliminate jobs. So we are talking about a lot of impact.\n  That tells me the EPA's purpose is to ensure that no opportunity to \nimpose its chosen agenda on the Nation is wasted. It doesn't seem to \nmatter to them that their proposed rule flies directly in the face of \nthe State's traditional and legal role in addressing air quality \nissues.\n  When Congress passed the 1977 amendments to the Clean Air Act to \nregulate regional haze, it very clearly gave the States the lead \nauthority. Now the EPA has tossed them in the backseat and grabbed the \nsteering wheel to head this effort in its own previously determined \ndirection. That isn't the kind of teamwork and cooperation Congress \nintended.\n  The goal of regulating regional haze is to improve visibility in our \nnational parks and wilderness areas. The stated legislative purpose for \nthat authority is purely for aesthetic value and not to regulate public \nhealth. Most importantly, the EPA shouldn't be using regulations to \npick winners and losers in our national energy market. The cost for \nthis rule is in the billions, and the bureaucratic evaluation says it \nwill still have little or no actual effect. Why would we force the \nspending of billions for little or no actual effect?\n  This is a State issue, and Congress recognized that States would know \nhow to determine what the best regulatory approach would be to find and \nimplement a solution to the problem. The courts then reaffirmed this \nposition by ruling in favor of the States' primacy on regional haze \nseveral times. The EPA ignored all of that clear precedent and, \ninstead, handed a top-down approach that ignored the will and expertise \nof the State of Wyoming and other States.\n  This inexplicable position flies in the face of Wyoming's strong and \ncommonsense approach to addressing regional haze in a reasonable and \ncost-effective manner.\n  I invite everybody to come to Wyoming. We have the clear skies. \nPeople can see more miles there than people can see here. Of course, a \nlot of it out here is humidity, I think. But we do not have the \nregional haze they are talking about. The EPA's approach will be much \nmore costly and have a tremendous impact on the economy and the quality \nof life not only in Wyoming but in neighboring States as well. Clearly, \nwe cannot allow this to happen.\n\n  Every family knows when the price of energy goes up, it is their \neconomic security--costing more--as well as their hopes and dreams for \nthe future that are threatened and all too often destroyed.\n  The EPA's determination to take such an approach would be \nunderstandable if it would create better results than the State plan. \nIt does not. That is another reason why it makes no sense for the EPA \nto overstep its authority under the Clean Air Act to force Wyoming to \ncomply with an all-too-costly plan that in the end will provide the \npeople of Wyoming and America with no real benefits.\n  The plan does not even take into account other sources of haze in \nWyoming such as wildfires. Wildfires are a problem on Wyoming's plains \nand mountains every year. It is a major cause of haze in the West. It \nmakes no sense for the EPA to draft a plan that fails to take into \nconsideration the biggest natural cause of the very problem they are \nsupposed to be solving.\n  The Forest Service could do a lot of prevention if forest plans did \nnot get delayed.\n  The State of Wyoming has spent over a decade producing an air quality \nplan that is reasonable, productive, cost-effective, and focused on the \nproblem at hand. The EPA has taken an unnecessary and unreasonable \napproach that violates the legislatively granted job of State \nregulators to address this issue. We cannot afford to increase the cost \nof energy to families, schools, and vital public services by \nimplementing an EPA plan that will not adequately address the issue of \nregional haze.\n  I know my colleagues will see the importance of this matter and \nsupport my amendment that will stop the EPA in its tracks and end its \ninterference with Wyoming's efforts to address this issue. It only \nmakes sense to me that Wyoming's plan be given a chance to work. It is \nmore than a 10-year effort, and it will make a difference, and not at \nthe cost that will be imposed.\n  It is only fair, and it is the right thing to do. I ask for the \nsupport of my colleagues.\n  I thank the Chair and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Election Spending\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, as I think most Americans know, about 4 \nyears ago the Supreme Court rendered a decision, which I happen to \nbelieve is one of the worst in the history of the Supreme Court, and \nthat is their decision regarding Citizens United. As a result of that \ndecision, what they said is corporations are people and individuals \ncould spend an unlimited--unlimited--sum of money in elections. By \n``unlimited,'' I mean hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars, if \nnot billions of dollars--quite as much as they want through independent \nexpenditures.\n  I think many Americans observed the repercussions of that decision \njust last month. A gentleman named Sheldon Adelson, one of the \nwealthiest people\n\n[[Page S2843]]\n\nin this country, worth many billions, held what was called the Adelson \nprimary in Nevada. What he did was invite prospective Republican \ncandidates for President to come to Nevada to chat with him, to tell \nhim their views; and if he decides to support one of those candidates, \nthey will end up receiving, in all likelihood, hundreds of millions of \ndollars.\n  But it is not just Sheldon Adelson. Probably even more significantly, \nwhen we talk about the impact of Citizens United and we talk about the \nflood of money coming in from the billionaire class to the political \nprocess, it is important to talk about the Koch brothers.\n  I understand there has been a lot of criticism of Majority Leader \nReid because he has talked about the Koch brothers, but I think the \nmajority leader is exactly right. The issue is not personal. I don't \nknow if the Koch brothers are nice guys or not nice guys; that is not \nthe issue.\n  The issue is the impact this billionaire family, the second \nwealthiest family in America, is having on the political process; and, \nsecond of all, and even more importantly, what do they stand for? Who \nare they? Why are they pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into the \npolitical process?\n  I have a problem, to tell you the truth--whether somebody is a \nrightwinger or leftwinger--I have a real problem with these rich guys \nspending huge sums of money.\n  But at the end of the day what is important to understand is what do \nthey want? Why are they spending so much money in politics? Why are \nthey supporting candidates throughout this country, running for the \nSenate, running for the House? Clearly they will be heavily involved in \nthe next Presidential election. What do they stand for? That is the \nissue.\n  It disturbs me very much, by the way, that the media hasn't been \ntalking about that. What do these guys stand for? What do they want?\n  Many Americans know the Koch brothers provided the main source of \nfunding for the creation of the tea party--that is fine--and many \nAmericans know the Koch brothers want to repeal the Affordable Care \nAct. They have run a lot of ads supporting candidates who want to \nrepeal the Affordable Care Act. That is their view, and that is fine as \nwell.\n  But what I think most Americans don't know is the Koch brothers want \nto repeal virtually every major piece of legislation that has been \npassed in the past 80 years to help the middle class, to help working \nfamilies, to help the elderly, to help the children, to help low-income \npeople. Their view, their ideological view, is that we should eliminate \nor substantially cut back on all of those programs.\n  In 1980, David Koch, one of the Koch brothers, was the vice \npresidential candidate of the Libertarian Party. In fact, he helped \nfund the Libertarian Party in that year. I want to read to you and \ndiscuss with you a few of the excerpts from the 1980 Libertarian Party \nplatform that David Koch ran on. People may think: Well, that was back \nin 1980. But do you know what. It is my impression their views haven't \nchanged one iota; that they are funding many organizations all over \nthis country that essentially espouse those very view views David Koch \nran on in 1980.\n  This is the first quote that was in the 1980 Libertarian Party \nplatform David Koch ran on as a vice presidential candidate and helped \nfund. He said: ``We favor the repeal of the fraudulent, virtually \nbankrupt, and increasingly oppressive Social Security system.''\n  That is their view. That shouldn't surprise anybody. These guys do \nnot believe government should be involved in health care, in retirement \nsecurity. It is totally consistent with what they believe.\n  But when Americans see ads on television paid for by David Koch, I \nhope they understand these guys eventually want to see--probably not \ntomorrow--the repeal of Social Security. They want to privatize it, \nthey don't want it to exist.\n  What is the reality? The reality is the overwhelming majority of the \nAmerican people disagree with the Koch brothers. The reality is Social \nSecurity is probably the most successful Federal program in the history \nof our country. For more than 78 years, in good times and in bad, \nSocial Security has provided every single benefit owed to every \neligible American without delay. That is in good times, bad times, \nrecession, boom, whatever it was. Before Social Security was created, \nnearly half of seniors lived in poverty. Today, while still too high, \nthat number is 9.1 percent. We have gone from 50 percent down to 9.1 \npercent largely because of Social Security.\n  The main point is according to virtually every poll I have seen, \nincluding the latest National Journal poll on the subject, 76 percent \nof the American people do not want to cut Social Security at all, an \nissue you and I were involved in. They do not want to cut Social \nSecurity. They sure as heck do not want to repeal Social Security.\n  So when you see the ads on television being paid for by the Koch \nbrothers, understand where they are coming from in terms of Social \nSecurity.\n  Let me give another quote, and this is an exact quote from the 1980 \nplatform of the Libertarian Party, David Koch, vice presidential \ncandidate: ``We favor the abolition of Medicare and Medicaid \nprograms.''\n  Abolition, what does that mean? It means if you are a senior citizen, \n70 years of age, you are not feeling well, you go to the doctor, the \ndoctor diagnoses you with cancer, you are not going to have Medicare \nthere for you. If you don't have a lot of money, how are you going to \nget the health care you need? Well, you know what. You may not, because \naccording to the Koch brothers, the Federal Government should not be \ninvolved in public health insurance programs such as Medicare and \nMedicaid.\n  What happens if you are a low-income person? What happens if your kid \nis on the Children's Health Insurance Program, called Dr. Dynasaur in \nVermont--I don't know what it is called in Hawaii--but it covers all of \nthe States in this country. Millions of kids are getting their health \ninsurance through the Children's Health Insurance Program. What is the \nKoch brothers' view? We should eliminate it. The Federal Government \nshould not be involved in health insurance.\n  According to the latest polls I have seen on this subject, 81 percent \nof the American people do not want to cut Medicare benefits at all and \n60 percent of the American people don't want to cut Medicaid benefits \nat all, because they understand that in these tough times it is \nterribly important that we have guaranteed health care programs for our \npeople. Yet the view of the Koch brothers is we should end Medicare and \nMedicaid.\n  So, again, when you see ads on television, understand who is paying \nfor them.\n  We have been discussing the minimum wage bill. The Presiding Officer \nand I agree it is absolutely imperative that we raise the minimum wage. \nI think $10.10, the bill we had on the floor last week, is a start. I \nwould go farther, but I think most Americans understand a family \nbreadwinner and a family who is making all of $7.25 an hour or $14,000 \nor $15,000 a year is not a wage upon which anyone can live.\n  Yet when you read the platform David Koch ran on--and again, their \nsuccess has been that where their ideas were thought to be pretty crazy \nand kooky in 1980--he got 1 percent of the vote and ran because they \nthought Ronald Reagan was much too liberal in 1980--today these ideas \nare increasingly becoming mainstream. They are in the Ryan budget \npassed by the Republican House. They are reflected by actions in the \nSenate by my Republican Senate colleagues.\n  One example is when we talk about the minimum wage, some of us think \nwe have to raise it. Their view, what the Koch brothers said in 1980, \nand I believe it is their view today:\n\n       We support repeal of all laws which impede the ability of \n     any person to find employment, such as minimum wage laws.\n\n  So this is not a debate about whether you raise the minimum wage to \n$10.10. You do what they are doing in Seattle, WA, over a period of \ntime raising it to $15 an hour, whether you raise it to $9 an hour, \nthat is not their debate. Their debate is we should repeal the concept \nof the minimum wage.\n  What does that mean in real terms? It means that in high-unemployment \nareas of this country where workers are desperate for jobs, if an \nemployer says: I am going to give you 3 bucks an hour, and you say: I \ncan't live on 3\n\n[[Page S2844]]\n\nbucks, and the employer says: Well, I have 20 other people who are \nprepared to take the job, that is their goal. They do not believe the \nFederal Government should be involved in providing at least a minimum \nwage for the workers of this country.\n  They believe, among other things, that we should abolish the U.S. \nPostal Service, and I want to get into that. Their view is, again, the \nPostal Service, a Federal Government program--not a question of having \na debate, how do you strengthen the Postal Service, what do you do, and \nwhat do you not do--they want to abolish the U.S. Postal Service.\n  Let me go to another quote from David Koch, which I think maybe is \nthe most interesting of all. This is where they are coming from. This \nis their philosophy:\n\n       We oppose all government welfare, relief projects, and \n     ``aid to the poor'' programs. All these government programs \n     are privacy-invading, paternalistic, demeaning, and \n     inefficient. The proper source of help for such persons is \n     the voluntary efforts of private groups and individuals.\n\n  I want to put into English what they say. What they are saying is \nthey want to get rid of food stamps, they want to get rid of all \nnutrition programs, all affordable housing programs, Meals On Wheels \nPrograms, which help vulnerable seniors, congregate meal programs, Head \nStart--which obviously are important to millions of working families \nand their children.\n  So you ask: Well, what happens if I am hungry and there is no food \nstamp program because they want to get rid of all of these programs, \nbecause they think the Federal Government should not be involved in \nthese issues? What do we do when people are hungry when they can't find \njobs?\n  Well, they can go to their local church, they can go to their local \ncharity. Maybe they will get some help, maybe they won't. In other \nwords, we are back to the days of Charles Dickens. We are back to the \ndays of Charles Dickens where ordinary people and lower income people \nhave no rights and no benefits. The only way they get help is if some \ncharity is there to dole out some money.\n  I don't believe that is where the American people are, and I don't \nbelieve that is what the American people want.\n  Back In 1980, the Libertarian Party had a rather bold proposal, and \nthey said: ``We support the eventual repeal of all taxation.''\n  Essentially what they are saying is no more government. That is it. \nNo more government.\n  There is going to be a vote in a few minutes, and I am going to \nseesaw, and I will be back on this issue. But I wanted to point out to \nwhat degree these folks, who are worth at least $80 billion, whose \nwealth increased last year by $12 billion, who have indicated they are \nprepared to spend as much as it takes to elect people who to some \ndegree or another--I am not sure all of the candidates they support \nagree with everything they say, but they know what they are doing. They \nare smart.\n  They are spending huge sums of money to create an America in which \nthe wealthiest people will get huge tax breaks while working families, \nthe middle class, the elderly, the children, and the sick will be left \nout on the street all by themselves. That is not the vision of America \nthe American people believe in. I doubt there are 5 or 10 percent of \nthe American people who believe in that vision, maybe less than that.\n  But when you have $80 billion, and you are worth that much and can \nspend unlimited sums of money, you will have a huge impact on the \npolitical process, and you will have candidates who talk about this \nperspective, who defend this point of view, because that is where their \nmoney or campaigns comes from, rather than talking about the needs of \nworking families or ordinary Americans.\n  Let me make this last point, and that is this: It was 34 years ago \nthe Koch brothers said:\n\n       We urge the repeal of Federal campaign finance laws, and \n     the immediate abolition of the despotic Federal Election \n     Commission.\n\n  They have come so far in 34 years that that is now the position of a \nnumber of Republicans, including, as I understand it, the chairman of \nthe National Republican Party.\n  What does that mean? It means if you repeal all campaign finance \nlaws, the Koch brothers and other billionaires will not just be able to \nspend as much as they want on independent campaign expenditures, they \nwill be able to give money directly to the candidates of their choice.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time for debate has expired.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Let me conclude by saying: I hope everybody pays \nattention to what the Koch brothers stand for.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/08/senate-section/article/S2844-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2844]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nNOMINATION OF INDIRA TALWANI TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE \n                  DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

ROSENSTENGEL TO BE U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE \n                SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to the vote on the Rosenstengel \nnomination.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I rise to speak in support of Nancy \nRosenstengel's nomination to serve as a District Court judge in the \nSouthern District of Illinois.\n  Ms. Rosenstengel has the experience, integrity and judgment to be an \noutstanding member of the Federal bench. She has been nominated to fill \nthe judgeship in the East St. Louis courthouse that was left vacant by \nthe retirement of Judge G. Patrick Murphy last December. This vacancy \nhas been designated as a judicial emergency, and I am glad that the \nSenate is moving forward to fill it.\n  Ms. Rostenstengel knows the East St. Louis Federal courthouse well. \nShe currently serves as the Clerk of Court for the Southern District, a \nposition she has held for the last 5 years. In this capacity, she \nserves as the chief administrative officer for the court and handles \nthe day-to-day management of its functions. She has received widespread \npraise for her skillful handling of the court's operations and \npolicies.\n  Previously, Ms. Rosenstengel worked in private practice at the law \nfirm Sandberg, Phoenix and von Gontard, and she served for 11 years as \na judicial law clerk to Judge Murphy, the judge she has been nominated \nto replace. As Judge Murphy's career law clerk, Ms. Rosenstengel \nassisted him in hundreds of civil and criminal proceedings. It is hard \nto imagine better training for a judgeship than the work Ms. \nRosenstengel performed for over a decade at Judge Murphy's side.\n  Ms. Rosenstengel was born in Alton and currently lives in Belleville. \nShe received her B.A. from the University of Illinois in Urbana-\nChampaign and her J.D. from Southern Illinois University School of Law.\n  Ms. Rosenstengel's nomination is historic. No woman has ever before \nserved as an Article III Federal judge in the Southern District of \nIllinois. Upon confirmation, Nancy Rosenstengel will be the first. And \nshe will do an outstanding job serving the people of the Southern \nDistrict. She was recommended to me by a bipartisan screening committee \nthat I established to review judicial candidates for the Southern \nDistrict. I was proud to recommend her name to the President, and I \nappreciate the support of my colleague Senator Kirk for her nomination.\n  Ms. Rosenstengel had her hearing before the Judiciary Committee in \nJanuary. In February, she was reported out of committee by a unanimous \nvoice vote. In short, she is an outstanding nominee and I urge my \ncolleagues to support her confirmation.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to yield back all \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  All time is yielded back.\n  Under the previous order, the question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Nancy J. Rosenstengel, of Illinois, to be \nUnited States District Judge for the Southern District of Illinois?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I yield back all time on the nomination.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is, Will the Senate \nadvise and consent to the nomination of Theodore Reed Mitchell, of \nCalifornia, to be Under Secretary of Education?\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The President will be immediately \nnotified of the Senate's action.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, earlier today the Senate confirmed Indira \nTalwani to fill a judicial vacancy on the District Court for the \nDistrict of Massachusetts.\n  Ms. Talwani's nomination came after she was recommended to me for \nthis position by the Advisory Committee on Massachusetts Judicial \nNominations. The Advisory Committee is comprised of distinguished \nmembers of the Massachusetts legal community, including prominent \nacademics and litigators, and is chaired by former Massachusetts \ndistrict court judge Nancy Gertner. The Advisory Committee's \nrecommendation reflects the strength of Ms. Talwani's resume, the \nexceptionally warm reviews she received from those who have worked with \nher, and the firm conviction of the Massachusetts legal community that \nshe will make an excellent district court judge.\n  Indira Talwani is the daughter of immigrants from India and Germany. \nShe graduated with honors from Harvard University, and was later named \nOrder of the Coif at Boalt Hall School of Law at the University of \nCalifornia, Berkeley. Immediately after law school, Ms. Talwani spent 1 \nyear serving as a law clerk to Judge Stanley A. Weigel on the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Northern District of California, building \npractical experience that will serve her well as a district court \njudge. She subsequently worked for several years as an associate and \nlater as a partner at the firm Altschuler, Berzon, Nussbaum, Berzon & \nRubin in San Francisco, before moving in 1999 to join Segal Roitman, \nLLP in Boston, where she is currently a partner.\n  Ms. Talwani has an impressive track record as a litigator, having \nrepresented clients in matters before the Massachusetts State trial \ncourts and appeals courts, as well as the district court to which she \nhas been nominated, the Federal Courts of Appeals, and the U.S. Supreme \nCourt.\n  In addition to her broad credentials and wide litigation experience, \nMs. Talwani has developed particular expertise in legal issues that \nrelate to employment. She is the associate editor of a treatise on the \nFamily and Medical Leave Act compiled by the American Bar Association. \nHer work representing an investment advisor whistleblower who was \nallegedly retaliated against for reporting accounting irregularities to \nher supervisor earned her the distinction of being named one of \nMassachusetts Lawyers Weekly's Top 10 Lawyers for 2010, and she \nrecently won a victory in that case on appeal before the U.S. Supreme \nCourt.\n  Ms. Talwani is also committed to public service, providing pro bono \nrepresentation to indigent clients. She has worked with Greater Boston \nLegal Services to ensure that low income clients have access to \ncounsel.\n  Ms. Talwani's nomination is strongly supported by the Asian American \nLawyers Association of Massachusetts. Asian Americans are a fast-\ngrowing segment of our State's population, and that growth is reflected \nin our State bench--which currently has 10 Asian American judges. \nRemarkably, when confirmed, Ms. Talwani will be the first\n\n[[Page S2847]]\n\nindividual of Asian descent to serve on the Federal bench in \nMassachusetts.\n  Indira Talwani is a first-rate litigator with impressive credentials. \nHer unique professional and personal background will bring important \nperspective to the Federal bench in Massachusetts. I am proud to have \nrecommended her to President Obama, and I have no doubt that she will \nhave a long and distinguished career on as a member of the judiciary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/08/senate-section/article/S2847-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2847]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                             ENERGY POLICY\n\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, as has been discussed much this week, I \nbelieve our Nation needs a comprehensive energy policy that allows us \nto develop our own domestic resources and use existing resources more \nefficiently. The United States is blessed with an abundance of natural \nresources and we have to act to ensure an affordable, stable supply of \nenergy needed to power our economy by developing them responsibly. \nDemocrats and Republicans must work together to develop concrete \npolicies that will lower prices, expand domestic production, and reduce \nour dependence on foreign sources of energy and minerals.\n  That is why the debate we are having in the Senate this week is so \nimportant. As a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, I have seen how much work has gone into the Energy Savings \nand Industrial Competitiveness Act so far and have enjoyed being part \nof that process. This committee also has oversight over many of the \nother important, responsible energy policies we have been debating this \nweek. That is why I was disappointed to see a procedural step taken by \nthe majority yesterday blocking consideration of any amendments--even \namendments related to the very legislation we are considering today. I \nsincerely hope that prior to the cloture vote on this bill we can find \na bipartisan path forward to vote on related amendments such as the \nKeystone XL Pipeline.\n  Earlier this week I filed two commonsense amendments that I hoped \ncould be and would be included in the debate this week. These \ninitiatives would expand renewable energy development across the West \nand put the brakes on job-killing regulations that threaten to \ndrastically increase our constituents' electric bills at a time when \nmiddle-class families across this country have already been forced to \ntighten their belts. Both of these amendments are consistent with the \ngoals of the legislation before us today and are worthy of \nconsideration, I believe, by this body.\n  My first amendment, No. 2987, mirrors legislation I introduced in the \nSenate last December, the Energy Consumers Relief Act. This initiative \nwould help protect Americans from new billion-dollar EPA regulations \nthat may increase energy prices and, of course, destroy jobs.\n  The United States, and especially my home State of Nevada, continues \nto grapple with high unemployment, with record numbers of Americans \nunderemployed, and with families struggling to make ends meet. Instead \nof advocating for policies that would put people back to work, the \nObama administration continues to develop rules that will increase \nAmericans' utility costs, causing companies to lay off employees and \nstifle economic growth.\n  Just last month the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers put forth a \nnew rule that will significantly expand Federal regulatory authority \nunder the Clean Water Act. This rule would have a chilling effect, \nparticularly out West where our water resources are scant and \nhydropower plays a significant role in our energy portfolio. Just this \nweek I visited with local irrigation managers and our rural electric \ncooperatives in my office, and they expressed strong concerns that the \nsubstantial regulatory costs associated with changes in jurisdiction \nand increased permitting requirements will result in bureaucratic \nbarriers to economic growth, infrastructure development, and energy \nproduction.\n  These are the types of administrative actions Congress must rein in. \nMy amendment would specifically require the EPA to be transparent when \nproposing and issuing energy-related regulations with an economic \nimpact of $1 billion or more. Additionally, it would prohibit the EPA \nfrom finalizing a rule if the Secretary of Energy, in consultation with \nother relevant agencies, determines the rule would cause significant \nadverse effects to the economy.\n  All we are talking about here is transparency and accountability. \nAmerican taxpayers deserve nothing less from their government. It is \nimportant to note that this initiative passed the House with \noverwhelming bipartisan support last year. The Senate should do the \nsame.\n  My second amendment, No. 2992, on which I teamed up with my friend \nfrom Montana, Senator Jon Tester, to craft, is an initiative we have \nbeen working on for many years. The Public Lands Renewable Energy \nDevelopment Act is a strong bipartisan proposal that will help create \njobs, progress towards energy independence, and preserve our Nation's \nnatural wonders by spurring renewable energy development on public \nlands.\n  In Nevada we need jobs, not policies that make job creation more \ndifficult. Energy is one of our State's greatest assets, and I believe \ncontinuing to develop renewable and alternative sources are important \nfor Nevada's economic future.\n  Geothermal and solar production in my State is an integral part of \nthe United States's ``all of the above'' energy strategy. In fact, my \nhome State of Nevada is often called the Saudi Arabia of geothermal. \nOur Nation's public lands can play a critical role in that mission, but \nuncertainty in the permitting process impedes or delays our ability to \nharness their renewable energy potential.\n  Under current law permits for wind and solar development are \ncompleted under the same process for other surface uses, such as \npipelines, roads, or power lines. The public land management agencies \nneed a permitting process tailored to the unique characteristics and \nimpacts of renewable energy projects. This initiative develops a \nstraightforward process that will drive investment towards the highest \nquality renewable sources.\n  In addition, the legislation establishes a revenue sharing mechanism \nthat ensures a fair return for all. Since Federal lands are not \ntaxable, State and local governments deserve a share of the revenues \nfrom the sales of energy production on public lands within their \nborders. These resources will help local governments deliver critical \nservices and develop much-needed capital improvement projects, such as \nroad maintenance, public safety, and law enforcement. Additionally, \nrevenues will be utilized to support fish and wildlife conservation \nprojects and to increases outdoor recreation, such as hunting, fishing, \nand hiking activities that serve as a critical economic engine in the \nrural parts of my State.\n  There is no doubt alternative sources of energy are a critical \ncomponent of our ``all of the above'' energy future. While we work to \ndevelop and perfect alternative technologies, we need to secure our \neconomy now by having an energy policy that respects the cause of the \nproblem--supply and demand.\n  I hope the Senate can put partisan politics aside and have the \nopportunity to vote on related amendments to this bill--like those I \nhave just discussed today. These strong bipartisan proposals will rein \nin harmful regulations and spur domestic energy production. Congress \nshould take this opportunity to take a major step forward in \nimplementing 21st century energy policies that will create jobs and \nkeep consumer energy prices low.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                        Remembering Jim Oberstar\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor today to \nhonor the life of a truly remarkable man--a devoted husband, a loving \nfather and grandfather, a dedicated friend, and a true public servant. \nJim\n\n[[Page S2848]]\n\nOberstar was a man of purpose and grit who never stopped fighting for \nthe people of his district, the people of northeastern Minnesota.\n  His resilience was the resilience of the people he represented. He \nwas one of those rare people who was just as comfortable in the Aurora, \nMN, parade in khakis and tennis shoes as he was at the French Embassy. \nOne unique thing about Jim Oberstar was that he always broke into \nFrench at a moment's notice, and he would literally speak French at the \nFrench Embassy and in Paris, but he might also speak French at the \nAurora parade, even though no one else there spoke French.\n  Whether he was biking the Mesabi Trail or fishing on Sturgeon Lake or \nhanging out with some of his constituents at Tom & Jerry's Bar in \nChisholm--which is where he grew up--he always loved northern Minnesota \nand the people he represented.\n  Jim never lost sight of where he came from or the values he grew up \nwith. He knew that, among other things, his job in Washington was to be \nan advocate, and he approached every day with a fierce but disciplined \nurgency of purpose. What I loved most about him was that, in a day of \nsound bites and quick fixes, he was never afraid to give that long, \nlong explanation of why he voted for something or why he thought it was \nimportant to his constituents.\n  As the Star Tribune noted this week, Jim was always a popular \neditorial guest and meetings with him were the ``equivalent of a \ngraduate school seminar.''\n  When I think about Jim, I first think--as someone whose roots are \nalso in northern Minnesota, whose grandpa worked in the mines--about \nhow he fought hard to keep the mines open when times were tough, back \nwhen things were bleak and people were hurting.\n  Like my own grandpa, Jim's dad was Slovenian, and he was proud of \nthat. And Jim's dad, like my own grandpa, was also an underground \nminer. They were part of a generation of immigrants who toiled hundreds \nof feet underground day after day to mine the iron ore that built this \nNation and kept the world free in World War II.\n  It was a hard, hard life--long days and treacherous conditions, their \nfamilies living in fear of that dread whistle that meant another miner \nhad been injured or killed. Jim knew that sound well because he lived \nthrough it.\n  So when Jim got to Congress, he fought tirelessly to not only keep \nthe mines open but to protect the rights of the workers and to improve \nsafety.\n  During his first years in the House, Jim pushed for legislation that \ncreated the Mine Safety and Health Administration. Today, thanks to the \nhard work of Congressman Jim Oberstar, mining conditions have greatly \nimproved.\n  That was bread-and-butter legislation for Jim--straightforward, \ncommonsense policies that made people's lives better. It sounds simple, \nbut we know in Washington today there are too many people who would \nrather score political points than get down to the hard work of \ngoverning. Not Jim Oberstar. He was a man of conviction.\n  In a business known for rewarding the expedient over the noble, he \nlived a life of principle. He played the long game, and he did it on \nbehalf of the American people. That is a great American, and that is a \nlegacy worth celebrating.\n  We lost Jim suddenly this week in the middle of the night in his \nsleep. The day before he had spent the day with his grandkids. He had \ngone to one of his grandchildren's plays. He had been going on long \nbike rides.\n  Even after he lost his election in 2010, he never let it get him \ndown. He took all that energy and zest for life and put it into his \nfamily, put it into the continuing work he did on transportation, put \nit into his friends and everything he loved to do.\n  We mourned him today, but we also celebrated the incredible gifts Jim \ngave to our country. It is awe-inspiring to think about how much time \nhe spent mastering Federal transportation policy: 47 years--nearly five \ndecades--11 as a staff member on the House Transportation and \nInfrastructure Committee and 36 as an elected representative. During \nthat time he literally changed the landscape of Minnesota and the \ncountry. His fingerprints can be found on just about every major \nfederally funded transportation project during the last five decades--\nroads, bridges, tunnels, rails, locks and dams, and bike paths.\n  Jim loved bike paths. He was a visionary. He was in front of everyone \non that. He would try to get money for bike paths, and people would \nlaugh at him: Bike paths? Who cares about bike paths?\n  Now everyone wants bike paths. Everyone wants bike paths in their \ncommunities.\n  Every American who flies in an airplane or drives on our Federal \nhighways can thank Jim Oberstar. Every American who bikes their bike \ntrails and hikes places such as the beautiful Lake Superior Trail in \nnorthern Minnesota or drives on our national highways and bridges \nshould remember him.\n  He was a treasure trove of facts, figures, and advice for every \nMember of Congress. He always used to kind of poke fun at the Senate \nbecause he claimed things came here and didn't get done. He would \nalways say: All that ever happens in the Senate is you ratify treaties \nand confirm judges.\n  One day, close to my own election, I was looking at the newspaper \nclips and I saw my name next to Jim saying that and I thought: Oh no, \nwhat has he said.\n  It was in the International Falls paper, and I got it out and he had \nsaid: Well, all the Senate ever does is confirm judges and ratify \ntreaties, but Amy is going to try to rescue this bill. She will try to \nget it done.\n  I was quite relieved.\n  One of the most memorable stories for me came on his last day in the \nHouse when Members came and told stories about him. There was a \nCongressman from Pennsylvania who talked about the time Jim visited his \ndistrict to celebrate the opening of a new bridge. He said that Jim \nstood up with no notes and recited in incredible detail almost every \ninfrastructure project that had ever been built in that district, along \nwith the name of every Congressman who had ever served in the district, \nwith all the right pronunciations, and he even included their middle \ninitials. He did it with no notes. The Congressman was in awe. He \nwalked back to his office, started looking back through the records and \nGoogling things, and it was no surprise to anyone that Jim was exactly \nright. That was Jim.\n  He loved politics. He thought of government as an honorable \nprofession, and he was so proud of the people who followed in his \nfootsteps, whether what he taught Senator Franken and me as we started \nrepresenting Minnesota or one of his favorites, the mayor of Duluth, \nDon Ness, who started working with him when he was 23 years old as a \nyoung aide or whether it was all the staff members who worked for him \nall those years. He was so proud of the people he taught, the people he \nmentored. He was so proud of the Members in Congress--Democrats and \nRepublicans--with whom he worked. He would so often work to get \namendments and get little projects for their districts, and then he \nwould let them take the credit when they went home.\n  I wish to end today with something Jim said in his farewell speech to \nCongress. He was reflecting on why he had originally run for office, \nand this is what he said:\n\n       [The reason] why I came is to serve the people, to meet the \n     needs of their respective families, and to leave this \n     district, leave this House, leave this nation a better place \n     than I found it.\n\n  There is no question that Jim Oberstar left this world better than he \nfound it. Through his incredible legacy of public service, he found \nimmortality in the beautiful children and grandchildren who were and \nare his family. He has left the world a better place. The youngest one, \na little baby we met today at the funeral, was recently adopted, and \nJim's daughter named him ``Jim.''\n  He left the world so much. He not only taught us how to win elections \nbecause he knew how to do that, he also taught us how to act and what \nto do when you lose an election.\n  He has found immortality in the hearts of those who knew him and the \nlives of countless more who never will, in the majestic grandeur of \nstately bridges and in the cool shadows of quiet bike paths, in the \nhardhats hanging in the lockers of hard-working miners who go home \nsafely at the end of\n\n[[Page S2849]]\n\nthe day. That is where you will find Jim Oberstar. That is where his \nlegacy lives on.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I thank Senator Klobuchar for her moving tribute to Jim \nOberstar. We both had the honor of speaking today at his funeral. We \nwere both honored by his wife Jean and by his family.\n  Jim served the Eighth District for 36 years as their Representative. \nHe served it for 11 years before that as a staffer on the Hill, as \nSenator Klobuchar said. As she said, he died last weekend in his sleep. \nI think Senator Klobuchar told me that the family said he wasn't 99 \npercent, he was 100 percent. So this came as a shock to all of us who \nknew Jim, and it obviously deeply saddened us all.\n  I announced for the Senate in February of 2007, and a few days later \nI had my first public event where I took questions from folks. This was \nat a coffee shop in St. James, MN, in the southwest corner of our \nState, in the First District.\n  The first question I got was from a woman asking if I believed there \nshould be term limits. From the way she asked it, I knew she thought \nthere should be term limits, and I thought: Great. My very first \nquestion and I don't agree with the person who is asking it.\n  So I said: No, I don't believe in term limits, and let me tell you \nwhy--Jim Oberstar. Jim has been Congressman for the Eighth District for \n33 years now, and he is chairman of the House Transportation and \nInfrastructure Committee, and he knows more about transportation than \nanybody else in the country.\n  Everybody in the coffee shop, including the woman, kind of went, \nyes--they nodded--yes, that makes sense.\n  Jim was a walking advertisement against term limits. He was the \nconsummate public servant, and it was all because he was a man who \nsought knowledge. He had a fierce curiosity about the world and an \nintense need to understand how it worked. All that enabled him to \naccomplish so much.\n  If Jim were here today, if he had one more chance to speak to all of \nus, first he would say how much he loved his family and his friends and \nthe people who worked for him. Then he would tell us the history of \nAmerican infrastructure, starting with the Erie Canal and how it opened \nMidwestern agriculture to Europe because, he would explain, it was 97 \npercent more efficient to ship those goods over water, down the Hudson \nand over to Europe, than before. He would tell us how the Erie Canal \nmade New York Harbor, New York City, made it what it is today. Then he \nwould take us through the transcontinental railroad, rural \nelectrification, the Interstate Highway System, and all the way to \nrural broadband. Then he would go back to the Roman aqueducts, which \nwere built by slave labor, and make an impassioned speech about the \nhistory of the labor movement. Jim sometimes had a tendency to go too \nlong, but it was because he believed that everyone was as curious about \nthe world as he was, and he was almost always wrong about that.\n  I once had the opportunity to speak before Jim at the naming ceremony \nfor the James Oberstar Riverfront Complex, the headquarters for the \nVoyageurs National Park in northern Minnesota. Since I was speaking \nbefore him, I took the opportunity to predict what Jim would talk \nabout. I said that he would tell us the legislative history of \nVoyageurs National Park; he would tell us about all the different \nstreams of funding for the park; he would tell us the history of the \nFrench voyageurs, the first White men in Minnesota; and that during \npart of the speech, Jim would speak in startlingly fluent French. \nEveryone laughed, including Jim, but that didn't stop Jim from telling \nus the legislative history of the park, all the different funding \nstreams, and all about the voyageurs--and that part in French--and \ndelighting in every word of it.\n  The first time I ever saw him chair, I went over to the House to see \nhim chair a committee on high-speed rail. He had witnesses from China, \nJapan, France, and some other European country. When it was time for \nhim to do his questioning, I learned that Jim had piloted every one of \nthose high-speed rail systems. Of course, when he questioned the French \nwitness he did it in French, and it was a tour de force--which I \nbelieve is French.\n  Jim understood the importance of infrastructure to our economy, to \neconomic development, and, as Amy was saying, for recreation. His \nlegacy will be in the ports, locks, dams, highways, bridges, and water \nsystems throughout our country, but it will also be in the bike paths \nin Minnesota and around the country.\n  Jim was an avid bike rider. He used to say he wanted to turn our \ntransportation system--the fuel--from hydrocarbons to carbohydrates.\n  Jim will leave a legacy, and, as I said, it all came from Jim's \nthirst for knowledge. The pages are here, and I would urge them to \nthirst for knowledge, not just information. Some people in this town--\nand in other places too--just look for enough information to achieve \nsome short-term goal. Jim sought knowledge, an understanding of how \nthings work. Because of that, he was able to get things done and was \nrespected by all of his colleagues on both sides of the aisle. Amy and \nI were both there the day that colleagues in the House paid tribute to \nhim, and it was both sides of the aisle equally.\n  We had a retirement tribute for Jim in Duluth in 2011, and Don Ness, \nthe mayor of Duluth--about whom Amy spoke briefly and who was at the \nservice today--told a story at that tribute that says everything about \nJim as a guy.\n  Don was 23 years old, and he had just been hired to be Jim's campaign \nmanager. Don's first thing to do with him was the Fourth of July \nparades. The Fourth of July parades on the Iron Range are a big deal, \nand there are a lot of them. There were six of them in 24 hours. This \nwas his big chance to impress his new boss, and he screwed up every bit \nof it.\n  The first thing he did was he was so obsessed with making \narrangements that he forgot to make his own hotel reservation on the \nRange. Don lived in Duluth. So he drove around the Range to get a room \nuntil 1:30 in the morning. He found one in Virginia, MN. He overslept \nand had to drive to Chisholm, and he was late. So he picked up Jim, and \nto make up the time, he drove fast and, of course, he got pulled over \nand got a ticket, which made them really late for this parade, and they \ngot put at the end, behind the horses, on a very hot, sweltering day.\n\n  All during the day, Donnie made one screw-up after another. He \noffended a local DFL activist. He lost Jim for about a half hour. Jim \nknew where he was, but he didn't know where Jim was. He left this black \ncar parked directly in the sun during the parade, and it became--well, \nyou know what that means.\n  Thankfully, after the fifth parade, there was going to be a 3-hour \nbreak and they were going to drive to somebody's house where they would \nbe able to eat and get in the air-conditioning and relax. Donnie \ndecided to put the signs in the trunk, and as he was doing it, as he \nwas closing it, he saw the keys in the car, locked in the car, and it \ntook them 90 minutes to find someone who could open the car, so they \nlost their break.\n  Donnie was a 23-year-old kid, and he was certain he was going to be \nfired. He felt he deserved to be fired. Jim had been calm with him all \nday, been nice to him all day, but he figured Jim was stuck with him \nuntil the end of the day and at the end of the day he would be fired. \nHe drives Jim home to Chisholm. It is 9 at night now. They get out of \nthe car, and he starts to apologize and says: I blew it today. I know \nthis was my chance, and I have blown it, and I will never be in public \nservice.\n  This guy is now--what term is he in now, Amy? His third? Yes, his \nthird term as mayor of Duluth. What did he get, 87 percent, or \nsomething like that?\n  But Jim stopped him and wouldn't let him finish. He stopped him and \nhe said: I am really proud of you. You had a tough day. We had a tough \nday. You had a lot of adversity. You had a lot of things to overcome \nand you never lost your head, which was really not true; Donnie was \npanicking the entire time, which is probably why Donnie made those \nmistakes.\n  But then he gave Don a big hug--that big Jim bear hug that so many \npeople talked about today. Then Don carried a\n\n[[Page S2850]]\n\nbag for Jim, and Jim one, too, up to the front porch, and Jim said, \nbefore Don went back to the car: I am proud of you. Don't worry about \ntoday. I am proud of you.\n  Don went back to the car, got in, with his head swimming, and he \ncouldn't believe the kindness, the warmth. As he started to back out, \nhe looked back and Jim was still on the porch, and he gave him this big \nwave and said: Happy Independence Day.\n  Minnesota lost a giant, the United States lost a giant this week, but \nwe also lost a good guy. He was a great guy--a great man and a good \nguy.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaine). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Moving Forward\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I hope my Republican colleagues will think \nlong and hard the next few days. We have made some progress this year--\nit has been limited but some progress--in passing a few bipartisan \nbills. We started with the Murray-Ryan budget, which was significant, \nand we were able to get that done. We were able to get the debt ceiling \nraised without the struggle we have had the last 5 years. We were able \nto pass an Omnibus spending bill, which is significantly important. We \nworked together to pass a childcare development block grant bill. And \nafter four or five attempts to end a filibuster, which we were unable \nto do, but finally we were able to do that, we got five stalwart \nRepublicans to join with us and we passed the unemployment extension \nbenefits.\n  Today, we have before us the Shaheen-Portman energy efficiency bill, \ncreating 200,000 jobs. It is a fine piece of legislation. It started \nout good, but it got better as the bill's sponsors worked together to \nincorporate 10 Republican amendments, joined by some Democrats, and it \nis a better bill now than it has ever been.\n  My Republican colleagues, for more than a year, have been asking: \nPlease let us vote again on Keystone. I personally oppose Keystone. I \nthink it is really bad to make oil out of the most dirty carbon stuff \nthere is, to ship it clear across the United States, and then to ship \nit overseas, which is what they would like to do. I oppose that. But if \nRepublicans think it would help get energy efficiency passed, let's \nvote on it, and that is what I have told everybody.\n  If they want a vote on Keystone, that was the agreement they made, \nlet us have a vote on Keystone, and then let the bill that was \nsponsored by 14 Democrats and Republicans--7 of each--to move forward. \nI want to be very clear with my Republican colleagues. The Keystone \nvote is on the table if they will simply stand by the agreement they \nhad a week ago with me. All it would do is to allow the Senate to move \nforward with a bipartisan energy efficiency bill.\n  The Republicans have stated and stated and stated they want a vote on \nKeystone. Good, let's take a vote on Keystone. Can't they take yes for \nan answer? The answer is: No.\n  We are involved in this shell game. If seven of my Democrats made an \nagreement with the Republican leader, I think it would be untoward of \nme to go to those Democratic Senators and say--for base politics--drop \nthe approval of what you believe in.\n  We have been through this before. There is no better example of that \nthan the Transportation appropriations bill led by Chairman Murray and \nRanking Member Collins. They worked so hard on that--lots of work they \ndid on it. Amendments were offered. But do you know what happened? The \nRepublican leader said: We are not going to pass that, and we didn't. \nThat is when Ranking Member Collins said: I have never known--I am \nparaphrasing, but this isn't far from an exact quote--I have never \nknown a leader to work so hard against one of their own.\n  All we are asking is for Republicans to drop their filibuster of this \nbipartisan bill sponsored by 14 Democrats and Republicans. The bill is \nsupported by the Chamber of Commerce, the Business Roundtable, the \nNational Association of Manufacturers, and many others.\n  Sadly, the Republican leader has said, in effect, if he can't get \neverything he wants--and right now that is a moving target--the \nRepublicans who worked on this bill are out of luck. This is not the \nspirit of compromise in which this body is supposed to operate, but \nunfortunately it is what we hear all too often from my friend the \nRepublican leader--nothing but endless obstruction and gridlock.\n  I know many Republicans are unhappy with the way things have been \ngoing. They talk to me. I am sure part of it is just to get this off \ntheir chest, but they want to change things around here. My message to \nthem is: The only thing standing in the way of our moving forward on \nenergy efficiency or other bipartisan legislation is to move forward on \nit. And if Keystone is the object of what they want done, let's get it \ndone.\n  I hope my Republican colleagues will think hard in the coming days \nabout the right thing to do. Do they want to continue waging \nobstruction, as we have seen on minimum wage and on pay equity? We know \nthe right answer is that we should move forward, and I hope in the days \nahead we will come together. It is really for the American people.\n  Mr. President, it is my understanding the motion to proceed to H.R. \n3474 is now pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. REID. There is a cloture motion I have brought to the desk and I \nask the Presiding Officer of the Senate to report that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to Calendar No. 332, H.R. 3474, an act to amend the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow employers to exempt \n     employees with health coverage under TRICARE or the Veterans \n     Administration from being taken into account for purposes of \n     the employer mandate under the Patient Protection and \n     Affordable Care Act.\n         Harry Reid, Ron Wyden, Robert Menendez, Patty Murray, \n           Barbara Boxer, Jon Tester, Debbie Stabenow, Maria \n           Cantwell, Bill Nelson, Thomas R.

I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum under \nrule XXII be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Affordable Care Act\n\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, there was a fairly remarkable hearing in \nthe House of Representatives yesterday in the Energy and Commerce \nCommittee, upon which I used to sit when I was there. It called \ntogether some of the Nation's biggest insurers to talk about the \nfailures of the Affordable Care Act as seen through the lens of the \ninsurance companies.\n  First up on the docket for Republicans was the claim that no one had \npaid their premiums, that people had signed up for plans, but a report \nwhich had been released by the Energy and Commerce Committee in the \nHouse suggested in fact only maybe about 60 percent of them actually \npaid their premiums.\n  So they asked representatives from WellPoint, Aetna, and other \ninsurance companies to confirm that fact, and of course they did not. \nWellPoint said, in fact, 90 percent of the people who signed up for \nWellPoint plans--the biggest insurer through the Affordable Care Act--\nhave paid their premiums. Aetna said the number for them is somewhere \nin the low to mid-80s. Both numbers are actually representative of what \npeople in the non-Affordable Care Act market pay with respect to their \npremiums.\n  When we dig deeper into the Energy and Commerce report, we found out \nthe\n\n[[Page S2851]]\n\nreason they suggested that only about 60 percent of the people had paid \ntheir premiums is because most people's premiums hadn't been due yet. \nThey didn't have to pay them when they had signed up for the plans in \nFebruary and March.\n  So they tried another tactic. They said: We have heard all these \nreports and news media representations that you are going to be \nincreasing premiums next year by double digits.\n  The insurers said: No, we have no idea what our premiums are going to \nbe next year. We don't have the data yet. In fact, we are starting to \nget the subsidies coming into our plans that help keep these premiums \naffordable for low- and middle-class individuals across the country.\n  It turned out to be an absolute disaster for Republicans on the \nEnergy and Commerce Committee because, as the insurers also pointed \nout, their profits have done pretty well, their stock prices have done \npretty well over the past several years, because the Affordable Care \nAct is working for patients and, as it turns out, for the insurance \ncompanies that have offered plans on the exchanges.\n  It is representative of a whole litany of complaints Republicans have \nregistered with respect to the Affordable Care Act's horror stories and \nworst-case scenarios which have simply not come true. I will take a few \nminutes to run through each of these arguments because I think it is \nimportant to have some context to understand that each one of their \nrepresentations has not come true. Thus, as they turn to their next \nseries of representations or challenges to the act, I think we can look \nback on history as a pretty good predictor of the future when it comes \nto Republicans' ability to prognosticate about an Affordable Care Act \nwhich is working now for millions of Americans.\n  The first thing they said is nobody is going to enroll. They said the \nWeb site was unfixable. Of course we know that is the easiest to debunk \nnow that we have 8 million people who have enrolled through the private \nexchanges and another 4 million to 6 million people who have enrolled \nvia Medicaid expansion, and 3 million young adults who are now on their \nparents' plan. In fact, enrollment far outpaced what initial \nexpectations were and beat the CBO estimates by 2 million people.\n  So clearly Republicans were wrong when they said nobody would sign up \nfor the Affordable Care Act. They were also wrong when they said the \nWeb site couldn't be fixed. There is no excuse for what happened in the \nfall of last year on the Web site, but it got up and running. Once it \ndid, people were able to get on in record numbers.\n  They said the Affordable Care Act was going to kill jobs. We have \ndone nothing but add jobs by the millions since the Affordable Care Act \nwas passed. There is a chart, which I don't have on the floor, that \nshows what has happened since the Affordable Care Act went into law: \nJob growth has continued unabated.\n  Specifically, Republicans said: It is going to result in people who \nwere working full time to move to part-time work. The Congressional \nBudget Office in a report which came out about 2 months ago said there \nis absolutely no economic evidence to suggest full-time work is \nshifting to part-time work. That is not a trend actually happening in \nthe economy. I understand there are anecdotes and stories which are \ntrue where employers have made that choice, but there is no broader \neconomic evidence that there is a shift from full-time work to part-\ntime work.\n  Republicans said it is going to cost too much. Sylvia Burwell was \nbefore the HELP Committee today, and she was very articulate in \nexplaining the simple fact that the Congressional Budget Office has \nrevised downward Federal health care expenditures by $900 billion over \nthe 10-year period from the passage of the Affordable Care Act to a \ndecade later. We are going to be spending $900 billion less than the \nCBO initially thought we would, in large part because of all the \nwellness, prevention, and pay-for-performance measures built into the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  Premiums are lower than expected on these exchanges, which saves $5 \nbillion in and of itself. The overall cost of the bill is 17 percent \nlower than what CBO initially estimated--huge savings for the Federal \nbudget and for the specific line items within the Federal health care \nact.\n  OK. Fine, they said, but young people aren't going to sign up. It is \nultimately going to be older, sicker people, and you will not have the \nright mix.\n  I think I said WellPoint was the biggest insurer. It is in fact the \nsecond biggest insurer. They said the average age of enrollment has \ncome down every single day in a meaningful fashion. The risk pool and \nthe product selection seem to be coming in the manner we had hoped. It \nis very encouraging right now.\n  Big companies such as United are going to be offering new plans on \nexchanges similar to those in Connecticut because they as well see the \nrisk pools are exactly as they had hoped.\n  But the uninsured will not sign up. This is just people who were \ninsured shifting to other plans which are perhaps better or cheaper for \nthem--bunk as well. The new Gallup survey, which is the best data we \nhave on the number of people who have or don't have insurance in this \ncountry, shows remarkable decreases over the last two quarters in the \nnumber of uninsured people in this country--frankly, numbers which \nalmost seem too good to be true--a 25-percent reduction in 6 months' \ntime with respect to the number of people without insurance in this \ncountry. One-quarter of the Nation's uninsured are now insured in the \nfirst 6 months of the full implementation of the Affordable Care Act.\n  Lastly, one of the biggest red herrings in this debate has been the \nissue of cancellations. No doubt there have been hundreds of thousands \nof plans all across the country that have been canceled since the \nAffordable Care Act was put into place, but Health Affairs, one of the \nmost respected, nonpartisan health journals in the country, did an \narticle, I believe a couple weeks ago, which said there is absolutely \nnothing different about the number of cancellations which happened in \nthe wake of the implementation of the act as compared to what had \nhappened in that same period before the implementation of the act; that \nthere is high turnover in the individual market.\n  While there are certainly some plans which were canceled by insurers \nbecause they didn't meet the requirements of the Affordable Care Act, \nthere wasn't a surge in cancellations compared with the number of \ncancellations which happened prior to the act.\n  So if we just go through--whether it is the claim that no one is \npaying their premiums or that rates are going to go up or that nobody \nwill enroll, that it will kill jobs, that it will cost too much or that \nyoung people will not sign up or that the uninsured will not sign up or \nthat cancellations are higher than normal--every single one of these \nclaims turns out to be wrong.\n  That is not to say this act and its implementation hasn't been \nwithout its significant warts. There are flaws in the bill. There have \nbeen big bumps in implementation, but the fact is that polls are \nstarting to show a growing acceptance and approval of the law amongst \nthe American public because they have listened to these claims that the \nsky is going to fall from Republicans, and not only has the sky not \nfallen, but 15 million or so people across this country have more \naffordable health care because of the Affordable Care Act. The \nuninsurance rate in this Nation has dropped by 25 percent. Taxpayers \nare saving $900 billion over the course of the 10-year period following \nthe passage of the bill.\n  I haven't even gotten into the quality metrics. Rates of hospital-\nacquired infections are down. The number of people who are readmitted \nto the hospital after a complicated surgery is dramatically down.\n  This is why we passed the Affordable Care Act. It hasn't lived up to \neveryone's expectation, but to the extent that the goal of the act was \nto reduce the number of people who are uninsured in this country, lower \nthe rate of growth of health care expenditures, and increase quality, \nthe data coming in on a day-by-day basis is overwhelming and impossible \nto ignore. More people have insurance, cost is coming down, and quality \nis getting better.\n  At some point the facts have to matter. As former Senator Moynihan \nsaid: Everybody is entitled to their own opinion, but you don't get to \nhave your own set of facts.\n\n[[Page S2852]]\n\n  Taxpayers, the uninsured, consumers of all stripes understand what \nthe true story is; that all of the Republican prognostications about \nthe failure of the Affordable Care Act have not come true in the past \nand they are not likely to come true in the future.\n  There is a lot of work to do to continue to make the Affordable Care \nAct better, and I hope every Senator is ready to do that work, but the \ndata and the numbers tell us that increasingly, on a day-by-day basis, \nthe Affordable Care Act works.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Markey). The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to \ntalk about the health care law. I have visited with people in my home \nState of Wyoming and people from around the country who come to \nWashington, and many of them want to talk about the health care law and \nthe side effects of the health care law. They want to talk about the \nhealth care law that the Democrats voted for unanimously in this body \nand Democrats on the other side of this building voted for \noverwhelmingly.\n  A little earlier today, one of my colleagues who is a supporter of \nthe law came to the floor to say it is working and everything is great.\n  I am here to say it is not and to dispute some of the comments made \nby my colleague because I am hearing from people whose care has been \naffected. Their lives have been affected, the ability to keep their \ndoctor has been affected, and the cost of their care and the cost of \ntheir insurance has gone up. Many have had their insurance canceled all \nbecause of the health care law.\n  One of the things the President promised the American people with the \nhealth care law--he said it would lower the cost of care, and people's \npremiums would go down $2,500 per family. He said he wanted to go after \nthis because health care spending was too high in the country, and the \nspending was going up. Yet we had a colleague say that the health care \nlaw is a success.\n  On May 5, just a few days ago, USA Today had a headline that said \n``Health Spending Up Most Since '80.'' Health spending is up. The \nPresident said it was going to go down because of his law, but it is up \nthe most since 1980.\n  The article says:\n\n       Health care spending rose at the fastest pace since 1980 \n     during the first three months of the year . . .\n\n  They say that ``Health care spending climbed at a 9.9% annual rate \nlast quarter''--almost 10 percent. That is not what President Obama \ntold the American people would happen.\n  I would point out that this is a drastic increase in spending when \nthe health care law was supposed to do just the opposite.\n  The Bureau of Economic Analysis reports higher spending in \nhospitals--the largest rise since the 1980's third-quarter. It is \nastonishing when the President promises the American people one thing \nand delivers another.\n  In this same Monday USA Today there is a Pew Research Center poll \nwhich is interesting. When you read about this, it says:\n\n       The poll of 1,501 adults, including 1,162 registered \n     voters, was taken April 23-27 . . . Other findings help \n     explain the Democrats' woes. By more than 2-1, Americans are \n     dissatisfied with the direction of the country. They remain \n     downbeat about the economy. They aren't persuaded that the \n     Affordable Care Act is going to help them and their families. \n     Even the president's supporters worry he is a political \n     liability for fellow Democrats.\n\n  I come to the floor today as a doctor who has taken care of patients \nfor 25 years in Wyoming, and my concern with health care is actually \n``care.'' The President became fixated, as did the Democrats, on the \nword ``coverage.'' Coverage doesn't actually make sure that people get \nthe care they need from a doctor they choose at a lower cost. That is \nwhat people wanted with the health care law. They don't want what was \npushed down their throats by the Democrats in the House and the Senate \nwho said they knew better than the American people.\n  I find it fascinating to see that in States run by Democrats around \nthe country--Maryland, Oregon, and Massachusetts--which have had the \nexchanges and have given up. They have said, no, our State exchanges \ndon't work and can't work. Massachusetts has been in play for a number \nof years, and they had to shut it down and turn it over to the Federal \nGovernment because of the mandates and complexities of the health care \nlaw--hundreds of millions of dollars that should have gone to care for \npeople. It should have gone to help people. Instead it has gone to \nconsultants and computer companies. It is not helping people. It is \nwasted.\n  Massachusetts, Oregon, and Maryland have given up. They said: We \ncan't even live under this health care law's mandates. Our computer \nsystems don't work. So let's turn it over to Washington. The American \npeople are fed up with turning things over to Washington.\n  It was interesting to hear my colleague from Connecticut talk about \nsome of the concerns and stories that we are sharing with the American \npeople about folks losing their jobs, part of their pay, and bringing \nhome smaller paychecks as a result of fewer hours at work.\n  I would like to share a situation that is now happening in Iowa. It \nwas reported a couple of weeks ago in the Ottumwa Courier. Iowa is a \nState where we have a Democratic Senator from Iowa who is a very active \nsupporter of the health care law. He was on the floor day after day \nabout how wonderful this health care law was during the debate.\n\n  Let's talk about what is happening in one community in that Senator's \nhome State in Eddyville. It says:\n\n       Faced with a nearly $138,000 increase in insurance costs \n     the Eddyville-Blakesburg-Fremont School Board--\n\n  We are not talking about a business here; we are talking about a \ncommunity school board--\n\n       this week approved reducing the hours of all para-educators \n     from about 37 to just 29 hours per week to avoid the \n     requirements of the National Health Care Act.\n\n  That is a side effect of the Obama health care law that every \nDemocrat in this Chamber voted for when that came up for a vote.\n  So they had some meetings.\n  The article goes on and says:\n\n       In February, Superintendent Dean Cook recommended cutting \n     12 special education para-educators and three more working as \n     librarians.\n\n  My colleague from Connecticut said none of this is happening and that \nthese are just incidental stories; don't pay attention to them.\n  The article goes on to say:\n\n       However, this week his recommendation instead was a choice \n     of either cutting eight para-educators or to reduce the hours \n     of all of para-educators (around 25 to 28 employees), for the \n     2013-14 school year.\n\n  One of the board members ``opted to reduce hours instead of cutting \njobs.'' This is a tough situation to put a school board in--reducing \nhours and cutting jobs.\n  The board member noted:\n\n       It just gets pretty tight when we have cut paras in the \n     past. Those people play key roles in running the schools.\n\n  The article goes on:\n\n       In fact, several teachers spoke to or wrote letters to the \n     board, providing a detailed account of the jobs that para-\n     educators perform, urging the board not to cut these \n     positions.\n\n  The article quotes one of the members of the board, Gay Murphy, who \nsaid: ``I feel very frustrated that our hands are tied with the health \ncare act.'' Fascinating. The board member has the same last name as the \nSenator who was down here on the floor saying: Oh, no; pay no attention \nto these important stories.\n  The article goes on to say that Gay Murphy ``asked that employees' \nhours be cut by working less days instead of less hours per day''--but \nstill cut the hours under the President's health care law--``so it \nwould be easier for employees to get a second job if needed.''\n  The President's health care law is cutting people's hours, and they \nare trying to find ways to make it easier for them to get a second job \nbecause their paychecks are being cut. Their take-home pay is being cut \nbecause of this health care law.\n  One other board member ``noted that quality employees may not stick\n\n[[Page S2853]]\n\naround for a 29-hour per week job and that special education students \nhave a need for more consistency that comes with full-time employees.''\n  This is a sad story, and it is happening in communities all across \nthe country. I think it is not a surprise that Republicans continue to \ncome to the floor to say there are huge side effects of the health care \nlaw, and for some people who may have been helped by the law, many \npeople are being hurt, and it is happening all across the country.\n  That is why when I heard my colleague mention on the floor that \npeople are getting used to it or there is an acceptance of the health \ncare law, I would just point out an article in the Washington Post:\n\n       Poll: Obamacare hits new low.\n       A new poll shows the public's opposition to Obamacare has \n     never been higher.\n\n  The Pew Research Center poll shows disapproval of the law hitting a \nnew high of 55 percent. It comes on the heels of several polls last \nweek that showed the law had very little, if any, bump after signups on \nthe health care exchanges exceeded the goals.\n  So here we are, an all-time low for approval of a health care law, \nand the reason is because people's lives have been impacted. They have \nbeen hurt by this health care law. There are side effects of the law. \nPeople who were promised they would be able to keep the coverage they \nhad--millions lost that coverage. They were told they could keep their \ndoctor if they wanted to keep their doctor, and many Americans lost \ntheir doctor. They were told the cost of their insurance would go down \nand it has instead gone up. They are paying higher premiums, higher \ndeductibles, and now people's paychecks are shrinking and their take-\nhome pay is less because of a health care law that remains very \nunpopular.\n  That is why I felt compelled to come to the floor to point out to the \nAmerican people, and to this body, that comments made previously by a \ncolleague were not, at least in my opinion, based on what I have seen, \nheard, and read, consistent with the real impacts of this health care \nlaw and the impacts on patients, on providers, and on taxpayers.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor and I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Energy Efficiency\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, we are considering the Shaheen-Portman \nenergy efficiency bill. That is what I believe this legislation is \ncalled. I think we went on the bill on Monday. Here it is late Thursday \nafternoon, and it is amazing that we haven't had a debate or a vote on \na single amendment in 3 days. Now we are finished for the week so we \nare not going to have any debate on any amendments or any votes \ntomorrow either. We are going to go the whole week without having been \nable to seriously consider the merits or problems with this bill, \nwithout being able to offer any ideas to improve or to change the \nunderlying text. It is unbelievable. But this is what has become \nroutine in the Senate.\n  I have offered four amendments. I fild four amendments I wish to \ndebate, I would like to have a vote on. I have cosponsored four other \namendments my colleagues have filed. I think, altogether, Republicans \nhave drafted and filed dozens of amendments; I don't know exactly how \nmany--there are dozens--in part because we haven't considered an Energy \nbill in this Chamber in 7 years. Things change in 7 years. Lots of \nthings change. After 7 years of not having a debate over energy policy \nin America--something that is so basic to our economy, so important to \nevery single family, every single business, everyone--it might be a \ngood idea to have a debate and to offer some amendments, to have a \ndiscussion and have some votes. But that is not the way the Senate \nfunctions. We can't do it. The majority party, the majority leader, \nwill not allow us to have amendments.\n  This isn't terribly recent. Over the last 10 months, since July of \nlast summer, the majority leader has permitted Republicans to have a \ngrand total of 8 amendment votes--8 votes in 10 months. The Senate is \nvirtually shut down. That is what has happened. It just so happens that \nduring that same period of time, the House Republicans, who are in \ncontrol of the House, permitted the minority party to have 136 votes. \nOf course, the irony is it is the House that has historically always \noperated under a kind of martial law approach where the majority party \ndictates all terms--always has. But during that 10-month period, they \nhave had 136 votes permitted to the minority party and we have had 8, \nand none on this Energy bill. None. Not one.\n  I truly don't understand why the majority party is so afraid of \nvotes. What is so horrifying about casting a vote on an amendment? But, \napparently, that is the case.\n  I will speak briefly about two of the amendments I have filed that I \nwould like to have a vote on. I am not asking for an outcome, by the \nway. I accept that. I don't have any right to expect any particular \noutcome, but I don't understand why we can't have a discussion, why we \ncan't have the debate, why we can't have the vote. By the way, Thursday \nafternoon, by now, we could have processed dozens of amendments. \nActually, Republicans, in the end, all we wanted was a handful.\n  I filed amendment No. 3037. It would prohibit the Department of \nEnergy from issuing new energy efficiency mandates on residential \nboilers. It is not very complicated. It is not the end of the world one \nway or the other, but on the margins, I think this matters a little bit \nto families.\n  I will tell my colleagues why. We all have residential boilers. These \nare our hot water heaters. We have them in our basements. We use them \nto heat water, to heat our house, in some cases, and to heat our water \nso we can take a hot shower. This is pretty common. We all have them.\n  The Department of Energy is in their periodic process of reviewing \nthe mandates they impose on the energy efficiency standards for the \nboilers. The only consideration in this review process is whether they \nwill make the mandates more stringent than they are today, make them \nadhere to a tougher standard than the standard they are forced to \nadhere to today.\n  Well, I think it would be better not to change the standard. That is \nmy opinion. The reason I hold that view is because the problem with a \nmore stringent energy efficiency requirement on these hot water heaters \nis it makes them more expensive. It doesn't matter much for really \nwealthy people, but for a middle-income family or a low-income family, \nit raises the cost of their home. It raises the cost of replacing a hot \nwater heater. There are a lot of folks who can't afford to have an \nunnecessary additional cost added to them.\n  By the way, I don't think we need to force consumers to conserve \nenergy. Everybody has an incentive to conserve energy, because energy \nis not free. So people are perfectly happy to pay a little more for \nmore energy efficiency for a product if they can recoup that added cost \nin the form of a lower energy bill over time. People get that. They \nwill make that decision. They will do it voluntarily. In fact, the only \nreason we need to mandate standards is if we want to force consumers to \npay bigger premiums than they can recoup. If we only want them to pay \nfor what they can save in the future, they do it voluntarily.\n  So, to me, this is one of those annoying little government mandates \nthat is not necessary, and it reduces consumers' choices and raises \ntheir costs, and I don't think it is a good idea, especially now during \ndifficult economic times when median wages have been declining, not \nrising. I don't think it is a good idea for the government to impose a \nnew cost such as this. So I have an amendment that would forbid the \nDepartment of Energy from ratcheting up the cost of an appliance we all \nhave in our homes.\n  I get the fact that not everybody agrees with me. That is fine. Some \npeople do want to impose this added cost for their own reasons, and \nthat is fine. What I don't understand is why we can't have the debate. \nWhy can't we have the discussion and then have a vote? Then I either \nwin or I lose, and\n\n[[Page S2854]]\n\nwe are done. But we don't do that. Apparently, the majority party is \nnot willing to allow Republican amendments.\n  I have another amendment. This one has bipartisan cosponsorship. I \nhave cosponsors who include Senator Coburn, Senator Flake--actually, it \nis Senator Coburn who introduced it initially. I am a cosponsor. This \namendment would eliminate the corn ethanol mandate from the renewable \nfuel standard.\n  What is that about? Well, existing law mandates that we take corn, \nconvert it into ethanol, and then the law requires that the ethanol be \nmixed with gasoline, and we all have to buy it when we fill up our \ntanks. The Presiding Officer may be aware that we now burn over 40 \npercent of all the corn we grow in America. Over 40 percent of it, we \nend up burning in our cars, by turning it into ethanol and mixing it \nwith our gasoline.\n  There were good intentions when this mandate was initially created. \nSome people thought it would be good for the environment. It turns out \nit is not; it is bad for the environment. It is not just me saying \nthis. The National Academy of Sciences, the Environmental Working \nGroup--everybody acknowledges it increases carbon emissions.\n  Members on the other side of the aisle thought the issue of carbon in \nthe atmosphere--CO2 releases--was so important they were \nhere around the clock in a dramatic display of political theater to \nmake this case. Well, here is an amendment that would reduce \nCO2 emissions because the ethanol requirement increases \nCO2 relative to where we would be if it didn't exist.\n  That is not the only problem with the ethanol mandate. It raises the \nprice of filling our tanks. This is expensive stuff. Having to mix it \nwith ordinary gasoline raises the cost of driving. Everybody has to \ndrive. So not only is it bad for the environment, but it is more \nexpensive for every single family who operates a vehicle.\n  That is not all it does. Because we are diverting 40 percent of all \nthe corn we grow to our gas tanks, it is not available in our cereals \nor in the food we feed to livestock, and so food prices are higher than \nthey need to be; they are higher than they would otherwise be because \nof this mandate.\n  That is not all. Everybody acknowledges that ethanol has a corrosive \neffect on engines, so it is doing damage to our engines, which shortens \nthe life of the engines; again, not that big a deal if a person is \nextremely wealthy and can kind of burn through cars. But for the vast \nmajority of people I represent, cars are a very expensive cost they \nincur, and having a policy that systematically damages that very \nvaluable asset doesn't make a lot of sense to me.\n  There is yet another reason. These ethanol mandates can have very \ndire consequences on some of our oil refineries, and that can cost us \njobs, and it threatens refineries in Pennsylvania. As a matter of fact, \nI got a letter from a Philadelphia AFL-CIO business manager, a fellow \nnamed Pat Gillespie, who wrote to me asking me to try to do something \nabout this, because it is threatening the jobs of the people he \nrepresents at the refineries where they work. I will quote briefly from \na portion of his letter:\n\n       The impact of the dramatic spike in cost of the RIN \n     credits--\n\n  That is the system by which the EPA enforces the ethanol mandate--\n\n       from four cents to 1 dollar per gallon will cause a \n     tremendous depression in . . . [our refinery's] bottom line \n     in 2013. Of course at the Building Trades, we need [the \n     refineries] to maintain and expand jobs.\n\n  He closed by saying: ``We need your help in this matter.''\n  I am trying to help. I am offering an amendment which would repeal \nthe corn ethanol mandate, together with my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle.\n  Again, I understand not everybody agrees with this. There are some \npeople who like the ethanol mandate. They think it is a good idea to \ngrow corn to end up burning it in our cars.\n  Why can't we have this debate? Why can't we have a vote? Why can't we \nresolve these issues on the Senate floor? But we do not. We spend the \nwhole week waiting and wondering whether we might be allowed to have \none or two amendments, only to find out, of course, as usual, we get \nnone.\n  So another week goes by with nothing productive being done on the \nSenate floor and legislation that could be a vehicle for a meaningful, \nrobust debate about energy policy in America--I have just given two \nexamples. We have dozens of subjects we could be debating. We did not \ninsist on having all of them. But a handful of ideas? It is shocking to \nme--shocking that we cannot allow the Senate to function, that Senator \nReid insists we cannot have an open amendment process.\n  It is disturbing because, of course, historically this was the body \nthat did exactly that, had the open amendment process, had the open \ndebate. This was the--I am chuckling because it seems so odd now, but \nhistorically the Senate was considered the world's greatest \ndeliberative body because we would deliberate. The Senate used to do \nthis. The way it used to operate is the majority party would control \nthe agenda, would decide what was on the floor and that is fair \nenough--but then, once the majority leader would decide what bill was \non the floor, then it would be open for debate, until essentially the \nbody exhausted itself and Members were finished offering amendments, \nand then we would have a final passage vote. Nothing even remotely \nsimilar to that is happening today.\n  I know a number of my colleagues, including the distinguished \nPresiding Officer, have served in the House. It is unbelievable to me \nthat now, for an extended period of time, the House is having much more \nrobust debate and far more amendment votes, by both the majority and \nthe minority party, than we are permitted to even consider in the \nSenate. This is a sorry state of affairs.\n  It has been 7 years since the last debate on energy policy. An energy \nefficiency bill has come to the floor, and energy efficiency amendments \nare not permitted to have a discussion or a vote. That is what the \nSenate has come to.\n  I urge my colleagues and urge the majority party, in particular, \nwhich controls this body, and urge the majority leader: Allow the \nSenate to function. Allow us to actually have a debate. Allow us to \nhave some amendments. It is actually not that excruciating to have a \nvote, and in a matter of a very short period of time, we could mow down \nlots of amendments and move on to the next important piece of \nlegislation.\n  Energy is a very important issue for our country, for our economy, \nfor every consumer, and it deserves to have a more serious \nconsideration than it is getting.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold his request.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. I withhold my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of my \ncolleague and friend from Pennsylvania and the discussion of why we are \nhere on a late Thursday afternoon.\n  We started off the week with an air of optimism that with the energy \nefficiency bill before us, we could get to that place where we could be \ndebating substantive issues of the day. As my colleague has noted, we \nhave not seen a real energy bill on this floor now for 7 years. When we \nthink about the energy landscape in this country and what has happened \nin 7 years' time--7 years ago, we were looking to build import \nterminals to receive LNG. Now we are debating--or hoping to debate--the \nexport of our LNG.\n  I have kind of put a target on my back, if you will, and said: Let's \ntalk about what is happening with our oil potential in this country and \nour opportunity as a nation to export our oil, given that next year we \nwill actually be producing more oil in this country than the county of \nRussia, than Saudi Arabia, but that is going to require some debate, \nsome discussion, some policy considerations.\n  If we cannot even get to the point where we can move forward on an \nenergy efficiency bill, how are we ever going to advance some of these \npolicy initiatives when it comes to our natural gas, when it comes to \nour oil or how we might be able to deal with issues such as nuclear \nwaste, where, quite honestly, until we can resolve these issues, they \nare going to be holding back our opportunity to advance in\n\n[[Page S2855]]\n\nthese areas. How are we going to build out the potential in this \ncountry for our renewables and how we integrate them into an outdated \nsystem? There are so many policy issues we have to talk about.\n  So when people suggest all we want to do is talk about energy, I am \none Senator who would love to do a lot of talking about energy. I would \nalso like us to be able to legislate on energy initiatives. I would \nlike us to update some of our energy policies, because as times have \nchanged, unfortunately some of our laws have not.\n  My colleague from Pennsylvania has mentioned there was a time when we \nwould have substantive debate. Take that back to the Energy bills that \nwere before us when I first came to the Senate back in 2003. We took up \nan energy bill at that time that was on the floor, I know, for multiple \nweeks; it may have been multiple months.\n  On July 25, 2003, we resumed consideration of the Energy bill. We had \na unanimous consent agreement at that time that more than 370--370--\nremaining amendments would be in order.\n  Now, 2003 may seem like a long time ago for some, but for me it seems \nlike just yesterday. Thinking about that, it is like: Wow. We were able \nto come to a UC on 370 amendments.\n  If we go back to the Energy Policy Act, if we look at the amendment \nlog, it shows that more than 130 amendments from Senators of both sides \nof the aisle were considered.\n  I think it speaks to the issues that were at play at the time. We are \nstill basing most of our energy policy, of course, on those 2005 and \n2007 energy acts.\n  I think it is important to recognize that when it comes to something \nas significant as our energy policy in this country, the debate is \nworthy, the debate is important, and legislating on these issues is \ncritically important.\n  I know there are conversations yet underway as to whether an \namendment opportunity will be made available, whether the four or five \namendments the Republicans have offered that are being considered by \nthe majority leader and the bill's sponsors of ShaheenPortman, whether \nwe will be able to reach a fair consideration for the processing of \nthose amendments. I would certainly hope we are able to do just that.\n  The energy efficiency bill, as I noted in my comments the day before \nyesterday, is good, sound policy. It is an important leg in the energy \nstool. When we talk about our energy resources and what we have \navailable domestically, what we are able to be producing--whether it is \nour fossil fuels, whether it is our renewable fuels, whether it is \nother alternatives--the recognition is that our most readily available \nenergy source is the one we do not waste. If we can be more efficient, \nif we can do more when it comes to conservation, this benefits all of \nus.\n  So let's figure out how we can move an energy efficiency bill. This \nis round No. 2 for us. Let us not allow the process to bog down a good \nbill and a bill that deserves to not only pass this body but to be \nworked through the body on the other side and to ultimately be signed \ninto law by the President.\n  I want to start work. I want to be legislating. I also recognize this \nhas been a difficult time for us all right now. We are not seeing a lot \nof legislation moving through this Senate, but I have been trying to \nuse the time I have, as the ranking member on the energy committee, \nwisely, trying to focus on those areas where we can critically examine \nthe energy policies we have in place and how we might refresh, how we \nmight reimagine the energy architecture we have.\n  Last year I released a pretty major report. We called it ``Energy 20/\n20.'' It is a blueprint that kind of lays out my view of a sound, \nrobust energy policy. I did not want a report that had taken a lot of \ntime and energy and effort and love and passion to just sit on \nsomebody's desk, so we have been working in this past year to flesh out \nsome of the details we outlined in the blueprint.\n  I have released now four separate white papers stemming from ``Energy \n20/20.'' The first one was on LNG exports. The second was on energy \nexports generally but also focusing on the specific issue of the \nprospect for oil exports. We released a very well-received white paper \non electric reliability, and then earlier this week I had an \nopportunity to release a white paper on the nexus between energy and \nwater. All of these are available on the energy committee's Web site.\n  I have given speeches on the floor. I have addressed small groups, \nlarge groups, basically anybody who will listen, not only in my State \nof Alaska but around the country. My colleagues and those who have been \nlistening have heard me say multiple times that what I am looking for, \nwhat I am hoping for, what I am trying to build are laws and policies \nthat will help us access our energy resources to be able to have a \npolicy that says our energy should be abundant, affordable, clean, \ndiverse, and secure.\n  I joke about it and say there is no acronym for that, but I have \narranged it alphabetically so you can remember it.\n  But when you think about these five components, when you incorporate \nthese all together--abundant, affordable, clean, diverse, secure--it \nmakes pretty good sense.\n  I think the effort we have engaged in, in the energy committee, has \nbeen a worthwhile effort, and I hope this broader conversation will \nforge consensus on what I think we recognize can be some tough issues.\n  I have been working hard, even though we are not moving a lot of \nbills through the floor right now, to try to advance the conversation \non so many of these issues I think are a priority.\n\n\n                   The Nexus Between Energy and Water\n\n  I would like to take a few minutes this afternoon to speak about the \nmost recent white paper I have released, and this is on the connection \nor the nexus between energy and water. I mentioned I had an opportunity \nto present this on Tuesday at the Atlantic Council here in Washington. \nIt is entitled, ``The EnergyWater Nexus: Interlinked Resources That Are \nVital for Economic Growth and Sustainability.'' It is a very timely \nsubject, very relevant to the current discussion of measures we can \ntake to support energy efficiency.\n  I think it is apparent, but it certainly bears repeating, that there \nare clear links between energy and water and water and energy. These \nfall into two categories. It sounds kind of simple, but it is water for \nenergy and energy for water. Without water much of our energy--\nelectricity included--cannot be produced. Our economy literally comes \nto a halt. Without energy--and particularly electricity--the treatment, \nthe transport, the distribution of water does not function either. That \nall seizes up as well.\n  So we have water and energy just inextricably linked, and I think it \nis important to acknowledge that the continued availability and \nreliability should not be taken for granted. I think sometimes this is \nthe part we fail to keep in perspective.\n  We are talking a lot about energy right now, but as we talk about \nenergy, let's talk about how that energy source intersects with water. \nIn an effort to produce this energy, how much water are we consuming? \nIn an effort to use that water, how much energy is being consumed to \nmove or treat? So, again, the nexus is tight.\n  When it comes to water-for-energy, an interesting statistic is that \nabout 41 percent of our freshwater withdrawals in the United States are \nattributed to cooling the vast majority of our powerplants. This also \nconsumes about 6 percent of our freshwater. Water is also routinely \nneeded to produce the various energy resources we rely on, whether it \nis oil, coal, gas, or uranium. According to the Congressional Research \nService, the production of biofuels has the highest water-intensity \nvalue, requiring 1,000 times more water than conventional natural gas. \nSo, again, understanding the intensity is important as we talk about \nour energy resources. Altogether, more than 12 billion gallons of \nfreshwater are consumed daily for the combined production of fuels and \nelectricity across the country.\n  Turning to energy-for-water, one study on a national scale found that \ndirect water-related energy consumption amounted to more than 12 \npercent of domestic primary energy consumption in 2010. That is \nequivalent to the annual energy consumption of about 40 million \nAmericans.\n  We are seeing new technology, and we are seeing that really with the \npotential to provide a paradigm shift. But\n\n[[Page S2856]]\n\nfrom today's vantage point, a steady population increase and the \nresource needs of a modern economy could make freshwater a limited \nresource in many parts of the country. We are certainly seeing that out \nin the West. Severe droughts in California and for that matter across \nmost of the Western United States only serve to underscore the risks. \nOut West, of course, hydroelectric power is a major contributor to \nclean and cost-effective electricity generation, particularly in \nWashington State, Idaho, and Montana. So if rivers and reservoirs are \nrunning low, this power-generation capacity is at risk.\n  I believe the recent and rapid expansion of our domestic energy \nproduction is very good for our Nation, particularly the growth in \nunconventional oil and gas production. What we have seen is that it has \ncreated jobs, it has generated revenues, it has revived local \neconomies, and it really does wonders for our energy security. As I \nmentioned, the United States is now producing and exporting more energy \nthan ever before. Our net energy imports are at a 20-year low. They are \nprojected to fall below 5 percent of total consumption by 2025.\n  With many new wells located in regions that have already experienced \nsome water shortages, we are seeing producers who are moving in a \ndirection to help ensure that there is going to be sufficient water \navailable for both the work they are doing and other regional needs. \nNew technological advancements and new methods to maintain a balanced \nuse of freshwater resources have been continuously emerging.\n  I think it is important to recognize that folks are appreciating that \nyou can't count on an unlimited supply of this water resource. \nUtilizing our technology to be smart, to be efficient, is going to put \neveryone in better stead.\n  Even in the case of conventional power generation stations, \ntechnological innovation and advances can assist in reducing--if not \neliminating--the overall amount of water that is required for cooling \npurposes. But, again, the key is technology. Continued research and \ndevelopment is at the heart of innovation and advancement.\n  The questions that are appropriate to ask are what can we do to \nensure an adequate supply of water and how can we responsibly minimize \nthe amount of water that is used for energy and then also energy for \nwater? Conservation, of course, can help reduce demand for both water-\nfor-energy and energy-for-water activities, but we have to recognize \nthat it can only go so far. As I just mentioned, innovative energy and \nwater use strategies, coupled with advanced technologies, are equally \nimportant when trying to optimize our limited supplies.\n  I have called on all stakeholders in the private sector as well as in \ngovernment to support R and demonstration of new technologies that \ncan really work to reduce our energy and water consumption.\n  Again, talking about the bill that is on the floor--energy \nefficiency--everything we can do to reduce our energy consumption as \nwell as our water consumption is all good. It is all good.\n  The genesis and sustainability of such efforts are highly reliant on \nopen and continuous information exchange between the parties. I have \nsuggested that the Federal Government not only can but should \nfacilitate this exchange of information on a national and international \nscale. It can do that by forming genuine partnerships with the \nstakeholders--including industry, utilities, and academia--and teaming \nup to advance a better understanding of the energy-water nexus, adopt \nbetter practices through technological innovations, and really learn \nfrom one another about the procedures and implementation strategies.\n  This dialogue should also include international perspectives on the \nenergy-water nexus, utilizing the experience and expertise from around \nthe world. We have seen technological advancements and great work going \non in Australia, the Gulf countries, Israel, and Singapore. The \ndevelopment of new and improved technologies can answer the needs of \nboth the domestic and international energy-water markets. This could \nmean opportunities for job creation--good jobs--in high-tech, R, and \nmanufacturing.\n  What I am advocating with this white paper and the proposals out \nthere is really better planning and better collaboration. I am not \nlooking for a top-down approach. I am not looking for more binding \nrules or mandates. I am certainly not advocating for the forceful \nimplementation of any new policies or directives to use certain \ntechnologies. The adoption of best practices should always be on a \nvoluntary basis.\n\n  But having said that, I do believe that if we can demonstrate savings \nand demonstrate efficiencies from new technologies and better resource \nmanagement approaches, the stakeholders are going to figure this out, \nand they are going to say this is a win-win for their own bottom line. \nThis makes sense for their customers. It is good to advance.\n  Along these lines, I have introduced energy-water legislation with \nSenator Wyden. We introduced it in January. Our bill is the Nexus of \nEnergy and Water for Sustainability Act--we call it the NEWS Act--and \nit features some plain old commonsense policy improvements. What a \nconcept.\n  Just think, in more ordinary times perhaps I would have even \nintroduced the proposed NEWS Act as an amendment to the bill we have \nbefore us. But what we have--S. 1971--is a short bill, a simple bill \nthat directs the Office of Science and Technology Policy to establish a \ncommittee or a subcommittee under the National Science and Technology \nCouncil to coordinate and streamline the energy and water nexus \nactivities of our Federal departments and agencies. We are asking this \npanel--which would be chaired by the Secretaries of Energy and \nInterior, and representatives would be brought in from these and other \nagencies--to identify all relevant energy-water nexus activities across \nthe Federal Government--because we know it is just a huge spaghetti \nmess here--and work together and disseminate the data to enable better \npractices and explore the relevant public-private collaboration. We \nalso call for OMB to submit a cross-cut budget that details these \nFederal expenditures related to energy-water activities. What we are \nlooking to do is to streamline these efforts not just to save water, \nnot just to save energy, but to save taxpayer dollars.\n  It is good. It is sensible. I think it is a rationed approach. I \nwould like to be able to legislate on this, and I hope we will get to \nthat point where we are beyond the energy efficiency bill, the Shaheen-\nPortman bill we have been trying so hard to work to advance not only \nthis week but for years now; where we are beyond arguing over whether \nwe are going to be able to move on some amendments; where we will take \nup with great energy and enthusiasm--pun intended--these initiatives \nthat will help our Nation to be more productive, to be more energy \nsecure, to have a stronger national security, and to have energy \npolicies that are current and sound.\n  I am one who tries to get up every morning optimistic, glass half \nfull, and I want to believe we will work out an arrangement so that we \ncan have a fair amendment process that allows Republicans to offer a \nsmall handful of amendments to be debated and voted on, that will allow \nus to move an energy efficiency measure that is important to our energy \npolicy and to demonstrate that perhaps we can do a little bit of \nlegislating, a little bit of governing, and advance the cause.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that my remarks be placed in an \nappropriate place in the Record and that I be able to complete my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Before I begin, I would like to take a moment to address \nsome proposals we have been hearing about in the tax space.\n\n\n                           Corporate Taxation\n\n  Some of us--myself included--were very concerned to hear the other \nday that a very big American corporation announced plans to merge with \na somewhat smaller but still large UK corporation and then have the \ncombined entity domiciled in the United Kingdom. Apparently, a desire \nto escape the high U.S. corporate tax was part of the motivation for \nthe merger. This type of transaction where a U.S. corporation escapes \nthe U.S. tax net is sometimes referred to as an inversion.\n  Broadly speaking, there are two different ways to address the problem \nof\n\n[[Page S2857]]\n\ninversions. The first way is to make it more difficult for a U.S. \ncorporation to invert. Just today we have read accounts of Members of \nCongress who propose doing just that. The second way is to make the \nUnited States a more desirable location to headquarter one's business. \nI believe the latter is by far the better way. That would mean lowering \nthe corporate tax rate and having a more internationally competitive \ntax code.\n  Under current law, U.S. corporations are taxed on their worldwide \nincome, but foreign corporations are subject to tax only on income \narising from the United States itself. In other words, we subject our \nown corporations to a worldwide tax system, while subjecting foreign \ncorporations to a territorial tax system. It is strange that the U.S. \nGovernment treats foreign corporations more favorably than American \ncorporations, but that is, nonetheless, what we do.\n  There is a danger, if the relatively unfavorable treatment of \nAmerican companies is ratcheted up--which seems to be the effect of \nsome of these anti-inversion proposals--that American companies will \nbecome even more attractive targets for takeover by foreign \ncorporations.\n  I don't know when my liberal friends will catch on and realize that \nsome of their approaches are just downright idiotic.\n  As important as it is to get the corporate tax rate down, no matter \nhow low we get the rate, we still need to replace our antiquated \nworldwide tax system. Instead of imposing arbitrary inversion \nrestrictions on companies retroactively and thereby further \ncomplicating the goal of comprehensive tax reform, we should first keep \nour focus on where we can agree. By uniting around the goal to create \nan internationally competitive tax code, we can keep American job \ncreators from looking to leave in the first place.\n  Successful tax reform can help reverse the trend and cause more \nbusinesses to locate in the United States, bringing more jobs to \nAmericans. Make no mistake. The trend is alarming. Just look at the \nnumber of U.S.-based firms, ranked by revenue, in the global Fortune \n500 over the past decade, and you will see a significant decline in the \nnumber. That, of course, means a lower tax base for the United States.\n  When are these people going to catch on?\n  As I just said, tax reform can be used to reverse that trend, make \nthe United States an attractive place to locate businesses and global \nheadquarters, and provide a base for more jobs in America.\n  As the ranking member of the Senate's tax-writing committee, that is \nwhere my focus is, and I will work with anyone, Republican or Democrat, \nto achieve that goal.\n  It is ridiculous the ways some of our people in this government \nbelieve we can solve this problem by making it even more intrusive on \nbusinesses, even more onerous and burdensome, and by thinking they can \nforce businesses to live in accordance with antiquated rules.\n\n\n                          Executive Overreach\n\n  Madam President, I rise to defend, on a separate matter, the \nseparation of government powers enshrined in our Constitution and the \nlawful prerogatives of the Senate, in which I have had the privilege \nand honor of serving now for nearly 38 years.\n  Just last week I spoke from this podium about the Obama \nadministration's blatant disregard of its constitutional obligations \nand in particular about how ideological devotion and political \nexpediency have again and again trumped the President's sworn duty to \nuphold the law. In the short time since then, the White House has \nprovided yet another egregious example of its willingness to disregard \nclear legal obligations in favor of playing partisan politics.\n  Just days ago we learned the Obama administration withheld \nparticularly significant information from disclosure to Congress, \ndespite a lawfully issued subpoena, during a House committee's \ninvestigation of the September 11, 2012, terrorist attack on the U.S. \nmission in Benghazi, Libya. One of these documents, an email from a \nsenior White House official, casts serious doubt about a number of the \nadministration's key assertions about the explanations it offered \nCongress and the American people regarding the cause and nature of \nthose attacks.\n  There are many important questions about Benghazi to which the \nAmerican people deserve answers; questions about how and why brave \nAmericans died in this terrorist attack, four brave Americans; \nquestions about the circumstances under which our Nation lost its first \nAmbassador in the line of duty in more than a generation; questions \nabout how the Obama administration advanced an admittedly false but \npolitically advantageous narrative about the attack during the home \nstretch of a heated election campaign.\n  I appreciate the efforts of my colleagues both in this body and in \nthe House of Representatives in seeking a fair and thorough \ninvestigation of this matter. What compels me to speak out goes beyond \nthe substance of this particular investigation, as critically important \nas that is. I am deeply troubled by the Obama administration's utter \ndisregard for essential legal and constitutional obligations. This \nlawlessness is made manifest in many different forms.\n  I wish to discuss this administration's long pattern of obstinacy in \nresponding to congressional investigations and how this abuse has \nbecome the latest front in a vital struggle against sweeping executive \nbranch overreach that has characterized President Obama's term in \noffice.\n  Congress's investigation into the Benghazi terrorist attack should \nhave been and could have been a collaborative endeavor aimed at \ndiscovering the truth. Indeed, President Obama publicly proclaimed he \nwas ``happy to cooperate in ways that Congress wants'' and promised \nthat his administration would share with congressional investigators \nall information connected to the administration's own internal review. \nSecretary Kerry likewise pronounced and promised ``an accountable and \nopen State Department'' that would provide truthful answers about all \ncircumstances relating to the Benghazi attack.\n  Unfortunately, the Obama administration has been anything but open \nand accountable, nor has the White House and/or the State Department \nshown much willingness to cooperate in a constructive fashion with \ncongressional investigations into the matter. Instead, this \nadministration has repeatedly rejected document requests from several \ncongressional committees, broadly asserting its unwillingness to turn \nover whole swaths of relevant material.\n  When congressional investigators responded with subpoenas, creating \nclearly defined and legally binding obligations for the administration \nto comply, Obama officials have continued to resist and in some cases \nhave refused to disclose entire categories of critical documents.\n  Throughout the investigation this administration has consistently \nemployed a strategy of minimal compliance. In many instances, executive \nofficials have heavily redacted the limited range of documents the \nadministration has in fact disclosed or forced congressional \ninvestigators through the cumbersome and perhaps unnecessary process of \nexamining documents they insist must remain in the administration's \npossession. Such methods, when reasonably employed, have historically \nallowed the executive and legislative branches to make mutually \nacceptable compromises, establishing arrangements that allow Congress \naccess to the information it needs but enable the administration to \nprotect legitimate interests and confidentiality.\n  Instead, President Obama and his subordinates have taken these \ntactics to the extreme, creating an unmistakable impression the \nadministration has something to hide. How could anybody look at what \nthey are doing and not realize that is what they are doing. At the very \nleast, it is clear that executive officials have deliberately slow-\nwalked this important congressional inquiry.\n  Indeed, the administration has managed to drag its feet and frustrate \ncongressional investigators for more than 1\\1/2\\ years since the \nBenghazi attack, limiting and delaying compliance for over 1 year since \nthe first subpoena was issued.\n  The Obama administration's most recent abuse--a particularly \negregious act--has been its long delay in releasing emails that were \nclearly responsive\n\n[[Page S2858]]\n\nto an earlier congressional subpoena. The administration only provided \nCongress these emails in mid-April after disclosing them as part of \ncompliance with an outside group's Freedom of Information Act request, \neven though the emails were undeniably relevant and responsive to a \nlawful congressional subpoena, a subpoena issued in the summer of 2013, \n7 months earlier.\n  This is the second time the Obama administration has simply passed on \nto Congress documents it has previously released to media and watchdog \ngroups, a weak attempt at complying with a congressional subpoena. Now, \nthat is an administration out of control, an administration not living \nup to the laws, an administration that is ignoring legitimate inquiries \nof the Congress, and an administration that seems to think it can get \naway with anything. More important, this episode demonstrates the \ncareless and intentionally evasive approach the administration has \ntaken in responding to congressional subpoenas. A simple FOIA request \nturned up multiple documents the administration admits are covered by a \nprior congressional subpoena and therefore should have been disclosed \nmonths earlier.\n  While the executive branch is obviously obliged to take all lawful \nrequests seriously, it is outrageous this administration would treat a \nroutine FOIA request from a private party with more care and serious \nattention than a lawfully issued subpoena from a coordinate branch of \nthe Federal Government. I might add a coequal branch of the Federal \nGovernment, the Congress of the United States.\n\n  I wish I could say the Obama administration's conduct and the \ninvestigations into the Benghazi attack represented an anomaly, a \nunique instance in an otherwise respectful record of good-faith efforts \nto cooperate with congressional investigations and to respect \nCongress's legitimate authorities. Unfortunately, that simply isn't the \ncase. Instead, we have experienced a pattern of obstruction, repeated \ninstances of bad faith in responding to lawful information requests and \nsubpoenas, and a fundamental disrespect of the laws and norms \nunderlying the Constitution's separation of government powers.\n  We have all witnessed such abuse in this administration's handling of \nother high-profile investigations, such as the botched gun-walking \nexercise in Operation Fast and Furious. We routinely observe such \nhostility in more ordinary matters, as this administration regularly \ndelays and often refuses to provide answers or produce information to \nMembers of Congress.\n  As the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, I see this all \nthe time, whether it is the refusal of the Treasury Department to \nexplain how it deals with its statutory debt limit or the failure of \nthe Department of Health and Human Services to respond to even the \nsimplest questions about ObamaCare implementation. We see this \nhostility most transparently when the administration openly challenges \nthe legitimacy of congressional investigations and when administration \nofficials display outright contempt for proper lines of congressional \ninquiry.\n  None of this is to say that some assertions of executive privilege \nare not reasonable or even valid. Past administrations have often \nasserted privilege claims before Congress, and sometimes--sometimes--\nthey have done so aggressively. This area of law has relatively few \njudicial precedents. It is largely defined by past practice in which \nthe distinction between legal requirements and prudential interests is \noften quite blurry. As such, we can expect some legitimate disagreement \nas to whether particular claims of executive privilege are within the \nbounds of reasonableness.\n  But fundamentally the text and structure of the Constitution \nenshrines a congressional right--and establishes a congressional duty--\nto investigate executive branch activities. That is how through the \nyears we have kept administrations straight. It is a very important \npart of our job on Capitol Hill.\n  Judicial precedents--as well as established practice between the \nlegislative and executive branches stretching all the way back to the \ninvestigation of the St. Clair expedition under President George \nWashington in 1792--also affirm the rightful authority of Congress to \nrequire Presidential administrations to produce information in response \nto congressional requests.\n  Since the great constitutional clashes of the Watergate period, \nspecific and binding precedents have detailed the requirement that \nadministrations must seek to accommodate congressional information \nrequests made in good faith, subject to adjudication by Federal courts. \nThe Obama administration's actions clearly fall short of these basic \nobligations. Its abysmal record--highlighted most recently in the \nBenghazi email controversy--has demonstrated that executive officials \nare not acting in good faith to comply with legitimate congressional \ninquiries.\n  The administration's public efforts to delegitimize congressional \ninvestigations endangers not only the relationship between the current \nWhite House and this Congress but more fundamentally undermines the \nseparation of government powers by attacking one of the most important \nchecks on executive overreach.\n  The administration's expansive justifications squarely contradict the \nSupreme Court's command in United States v. Nixon that ``exceptions to \nthe demand for . . . evidence are not lightly created nor expansively \nconstrued, for they are in derogation of the search for truth.''\n  Even more troubling, the Obama White House has even attempted to \nundermine our congressional investigatory power at its core. This isn't \nhyperbole. The current administration actually had the audacity to \nargue in Federal court that a committee of Congress was categorically \nbarred from asking the judiciary to enforce a subpoena that the \nexecutive branch had defied, a course of action implicit in the \nstructure of our Constitution, demanded by the Supreme Court's \njurisprudence, and recognized by courts for decades.\n  Thankfully, one of President Obama's own judicial appointees roundly \nrejected this astonishing claim, but that should give Members of this \nbody very little comfort. By challenging the very authority of Congress \nto investigate executive abuses, by challenging the obligation of a \nPresidential administration to accommodate congressional inquiries in \ngood faith, and by challenging the power of Federal courts to resolve \nsuch disputes, the Obama administration's actions represent a serious \nthreat to our constitutional structure.\n  Indeed, this particular effort to undermine essential institutional \nchecks and balances is part of a broader pattern of executive abuse--\none that includes the Obama administration's disregard for its \nobligations to enforce the law, its actions to exceed legitimate \nstatutory authority, its attempts to defy specific requirements of duly \nenacted law, and its efforts to usurp legislative power from Congress.\n  I spoke at length last week about many such abuses of executive power \nby the Obama administration. I will continue to do so because I believe \nkeeping the exercise of executive authority within lawful bounds is \nessential to the legitimacy of our government and to the liberties of \nour citizens. I recognize that doing so will require continual \nvigilance--by the courts, by the American people, and by those of us \nwho serve in Congress.\n  This latest episode with the Benghazi emails--as well as the \nPresident's new pen-and-phone strategy--demonstrates quite clearly that \nthe Obama administration has not shown any signs of relenting in its \nexecutive overreach.\n  This unprecedented pattern of executive abuse comes from a President \nwho promised unprecedented transparency and who regularly criticized \nhis predecessor's use of executive power, including in the context of \nexecutive privilege.\n  The administration's actions demand a redoubling of Congress' \ninvestigative efforts. I urge the majority leader to join the House to \nform a joint select committee on the Benghazi terrorist attack and its \naftermath.\n  I know many of my friends on the other side of the aisle--not to \nmention the Obama administration itself--have convinced themselves that \nthis investigation is simply a partisan exercise, apparently prompting \nthem to ignore the institutional struggle between Congress and the \nExecutive.\n  I just wonder: What would have happened had Robert C. Byrd been our \nmajority leader, as he was for so long? He\n\n[[Page S2859]]\n\nwould not have put up with this for 1 minute. He would have asserted \nthis institution's authority and this institution's responsibility--\nCongress' responsibility, if you will--to get to the bottom of this.\n  I served on the Iran-Contra special committee. It is not a bad thing \nfor us to investigate an administration that appears to be out of \nwhack, appears to be ignoring the basic tenets of the law, and appears \nto be hiding information from the public. Forget the public right now. \nHow about the Congress? It is hard to respect an administration that \nacts like this.\n  We should be eager to get to the bottom of the circumstances \nsurrounding the Benghazi attack, and my friends on the other side ought \nto quit trying to protect the administration when they know these are \nserious charges. These are serious matters. We have an obligation to \nget to the bottom of it, and let the chips fall where they may. There \nwere four deaths here of heroes.\n  All the Members of this esteemed body--whether Democrat or \nRepublican--should demand that Congress' institutional prerogatives are \npreserved and defended.\n  As members of the legislative branch, we have the fundamental right--\nand the accompanying duty--to exercise a lawful oversight function. \nWhen any Presidential administration engages in extreme resistance and \ndemonstrates an unwillingness to cooperate with legitimate \ncongressional investigations, we all--not just people on this side--\nhave an institutional obligation to defend our rightful constitutional \nprerogatives.\n  These executive abuses matter. The Obama administration has clearly \nand consistently overstepped its authorities and ignored its \nobligations under our Constitution and Federal law. This overreach \nthreatens the rule of law, and it undermines the governmental checks \nand balances necessary to secure our liberties as Americans.\n  President Obama promised unprecedented transparency that would \nrestore trust and confidence in government. But his administration's \nlawless actions have heightened the need for more robust and effective \ncongressional oversight.\n  As even a liberal Washington Post columnist opined earlier this week, \n``The Obama White House can blame its own secrecy and obsessive control \nover information'' for the heightened scrutiny of its questionable \nactivities.\n  Oversight investigations are a critical tool that Congress must use \neffectively to promote government accountability. The Obama \nadministration's escalating strategy of stonewalling, even to the point \nof ignoring legal obligations and longstanding norms, now threatens our \nrightful role in calling the executive branch to account.\n  Indeed, the basic assumption that underlies the Constitution's plan \nof government, as James Madison explained in Federalist 47 and 51, is \nthat:\n\n       The accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and \n     judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, \n     and whether hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may \n     justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny. . . . \n     But the great security against a gradual concentration of the \n     several powers in the same department, consist in giving to \n     those who administer each department the necessary \n     constitutional means and personal motives to resist \n     encroachments of the others.\n       The provision for defense must in this, as in all other \n     cases, be made commensurate to the danger of attack. Ambition \n     must be made to counteract ambition.\n\n  As Madison explained, it is incumbent upon each of us to insist on \nCongress' right and duty to investigate the executive branch, and to \nensure that the administration abides by the most basic--the most \nfundamental--requirements of our constitutional system.\n  We owe the American people--not to mention the families of those who \nperished--a meaningful investigation of the Benghazi attack, not just \nto find answers to remaining questions but to affirm that this is still \na Nation of laws and that the people's elected representatives are \nstill capable of pursuing the truth and holding the executive branch \naccountable for its actions.\n  This is a matter of great concern to me, and I am sure it is to a lot \nof people who are starting to realize that there is a stonewalling like \nwe haven't seen since Richard Nixon.\n  I don't know that the President has done this personally. I hope not. \nBut he has to look into it.\n  If he doesn't, then I think it is up to the majority in this body to \nhold the administration to account, with the help of the minority, and \nto not have them ignore, disregard, and treat with contempt the \nrightful oversight that we have an honor and an obligation to do up \nhere. This is really a very serious set of problems as far as I am \nconcerned. I hope the President will get after his people down there.\n  I think one of the problems is we have a lot of young people in the \nWhite House right now who haven't had the experience. On the other \nhand, some of these things are so deliberate that we can't blame it on \nlack of experience. These folks know and the people in the Justice \nDepartment know. To have withheld these emails the way they did, \nknowing they were crucial to any investigation, is something we should \nnot tolerate here in the Senate.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today to honor an upstanding \ncitizen from my home State, the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Pat Bell grew \nup in the heart of Appalachia and has spent his life working to better \nthe region and the lives of those who call it home. The Lake Cumberland \nArea Development District will honor him on May 22 when they name their \noffice building The Pat Bell Building.\n  Patrick R. Bell was born and raised in McCreary County, Kentucky. Pat \nwas always passionate about helping others, and once he finished his \nown education he began teaching in the McCreary County school system, \nrising to the position of school superintendent in the 1960s.\n  Following his tenure as superintendent, Pat was selected to be the \nLake Cumberland Area Development District's first executive director. \nIn this capacity Pat was able to increase the quality of life in the \nregion by organizing infrastructure projects and developing initiatives \nto increase economic activity.\n  Pat left the LCADD after 12 years at the helm, but he never lost his \ndesire to serve. In fact, his success at the LCADD led to his next post \nas the Director of the Lake Cumberland District Health Department. Pat \nserved as director from 1982 until his retirement in 1994, during which \nthe Lake Cumberland District Health Department expanded from five \nmember counties to 10.\n  His retirement was short lived, however. Never one to turn down an \nopportunity to serve his community, Pat accepted an appointment to \nbecome mayor of Columbia, KY. He then ran for, and won, a second term, \nwhich expired in 2010. Although he is once again in retirement, his \nfriends and family know him too well to rule out the possibility of \nfuture public service.\n  Pat Bell's seemingly unlimited capacity to serve others is an \ninspiration for us all. He truly has a servant's heart, and I ask that \nmy Senate colleagues join me in honoring him today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/08/senate-section/article/S2859-3", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2859-S2860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JIM SHARPE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I rise today to honor the long and \ndistinguished career of Jim Sharpe. Now retired, Mr. Sharpe opened his \nfirst business in Somerset, KY, in 1947. Since that time he's opened \nseveral more, pioneered the houseboat business, and has become an \nirreplaceable fixture in his community.\n  Lake Cumberland is known by many as the ``houseboat capital of the \nworld''--a designation that is owed in no small part to Jim Sharpe. Jim \nwas one of the first to pioneer the industry--building his first \nhouseboat in\n\n[[Page S2860]]\n\n1953. Much has changed since he sold that first 10-by 24-foot steel \nboat, and Jim has been there for it all, often leading the way. \nHouseboats are now much bigger--up to 20 by 100 feet--and are made of \naluminum and have on-board heating and cooling systems. One thing that \nnever changed, though, is Jim's passion for building his customer's \n``dream boat.''\n  Despite being one of the founding fathers of the industry, houseboats \ndo not constitute the totality of his life's work. Jim has owned and \noperated several other businesses in Somerset in addition to Sumerset \nMarine. In 1966, he developed Food Fair groceries, which he grew into a \nchain of 13 stores. Two year later, he opened Somerset's first fried \nchicken restaurant, Kettle Fried Chicken, and in 1974 he bought a car \ndealership, Pulaski Motor Company.\n  Although he is now retired, Jim still has plenty to keep him busy. \nJim and his wife of nearly 65 years Mary Jo have four children and nine \ngrandchildren, and he has also found time to pick up golf and travel \nthe country.\n  Jim Sharpe's drive and determination in his business, his commitment \nto his community, and his love of his family can serve as an example to \nus all. I ask that my U.S. Senate colleagues join me in honoring this \nupstanding Kentucky citizen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/08/senate-section/article/S2860-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CLINICAL LABORATORY FEE SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, I would like to engage my colleague, the \ndistinguished ranking member of the Finance Committee, in a short \ncolloquy regarding Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule payment reform \nprovisions included in the SGR patch bill, Protecting Access to \nMedicare Act.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Senator. I would be happy to engage my \ndistinguished colleague in a colloquy. Further, many thanks to him for \nhis leadership over the years on this issue.\n  Mr. BURR. I thank my colleague and commend his work and the work of \nhis staff in the development of this proposal. Reform of the Clinical \nLaboratory Fee Schedule is an important priority. The current system \ndoes not allow for changes in reimbursement for specific tests and \ninstead, cuts to lab reimbursement have been broad reductions to the \nfee schedule overall. This imprecise approach has hampered the ability \nof labs across the country to continue to innovate and improve the \ndiagnosis and treatment of disease. The Protecting Access to Medicare \nAct reforms this outdated approach and establishes a system requiring \nlaboratories to report market rates to establish Medicare \nreimbursement. It is my understanding that the intent of this provision \nis to ensure that Medicare rates reflect true market rates for \nlaboratory services, and as such, that all sectors of the laboratory \nmarket should be represented in the reporting system, including \nindependent laboratories and hospital outreach laboratories that \nreceive payment on a fee-for-service basis under the fee schedule. I \nask my distinguished colleague if this is his understanding of the \nintent of this provision as well.\n  Mr. HATCH. The Senator is correct. And I thank my good friend from \nNorth Carolina for raising this issue.

Madam President, I am filled with so much pride every \ntime our military veterans visit our Nation's Capital and have the \nopportunity to stand before the memorials built to honor them.\n  This weekend, 93 veterans from North Central West Virginia, escorted \nby 55 guardians, will be traveling to Washington, DC, to see the \nmemorials that commemorate their sacrifice and valor. This will mark \nthe very first Honor Flight from North Central West Virginia--which is \nmy hometown region of the ``Mountain State.''\n  Fifty World War II veterans, 42 Korean war veterans and one \nterminally ill Vietnam war veteran will fly from the small town of \nClarksburg, WV, to Reagan National Airport, and before they lift off on \na truly memorable and moving day, I look forward to greeting our vets \nbright and early at the local airport to wish them a safe trip to our \nNation's Capital. I also will express my deepest gratitude to these \nspecial men who helped keep America free and made the world a safer \nplace for liberty-loving people across our country and beyond our \nborders.\n  Upon their arrival, 30 Active-Duty sailors from the National Naval \nMedical Center and 8 marines from the USS West Virginia submarine will \naccompany the Honor Flight entourage during their daylong adventure.\n  These heroic West Virginians will travel to Washington to visit the \nWorld War II, Vietnam, Korean, FDR, Air Force, and Iwo Jima Memorials \nas well attend a ceremony at Arlington Cemetery.\n  While their step has slowed, their spirit is keen, their pride is \nundiminished, and their patriotism is immeasurable.\n  No matter the war, no matter the rank, no matter the duty, every one \nof these 93 veterans answered America's call and served our great \ncountry with the utmost valor. In our time of need, they stepped \nforward and said: I will do it--I will protect this country.\n  This trip to our Nation's Capital is just one way to say thank you.\n  But the West Virginia's North Central community has much more planned \nto show their gratitude for these devoted and courageous veterans. Upon \nthe Honor Flight's return Saturday evening, hundreds of West Virginians \nwill welcome home our returning vets, including National Guardsmen, \nCivil Air Patrol volunteers, Cub Scouts, Boy Scouts and our famous West \nVirginia University Mountaineer, Mike Garcia.\n  In addition, more than 155 band members from the Busy Bee Band and \nHoneybees of East Fairmont High School will perform a medley of \npatriotic songs, led by their band director and former marine, T.J. \nBean.\n  I want to express my gratitude to my hometown community for their \ntireless efforts to make this Honor Flight a reality. I especially \nthank Butch Phillips and all the people who have been instrumental in \nplanning and fulfilling this truly special experience for our 93 West \nVirginia veterans.\n  This generation of Americans was united by a common purpose and by \ncommon values--duty, honor, courage, service, integrity, love of family \nand country, and their triumph over oppression will be forever \nremembered.\n  Let us remember that these Honor Flights show tribute to all who have \nserved this great country, so may God bless the United States of \nAmerica and all the men and women who keep us free.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/08/senate-section/article/S2860-3", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2860-S2861]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           LOUISIANA GRAY DAY\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I wish to honor Louisiana Gray Day, \nthis Friday, May 9, and the thousands of Louisianians and Americans \nwith brain cancer and their families. Brain cancer is one of the most \nincurable forms of cancer and has an average survival period of only 1 \nto 2 years. It does not discriminate--striking men, women, and children \nof any race and at any age. Over 688,000 Americans are living with a \nprimary brain tumor and each year over 69,700 people are diagnosed with \nprimary malignant and nonmalignant tumors. Brain tumors are the second \nleading cause of cancer-related deaths in children under age 20, the \nsecond leading cause of cancer-related deaths in males ages 20 to 39, \nand the fifth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in females ages 20 \nto 39.\n  More so than any other cancer, brain tumors can have life-altering \npsychological, cognitive, behavioral, and physical effects. To help \nincrease awareness and advance medical research for the various forms \nof brain cancer, the month of May is recognized nationally as brain \ncancer awareness month. My State has adopted May 9 in particular as the \nday when the citizens of the State are encouraged to wear the color \ngray to raise brain cancer awareness.\n  Brain cancer has unfortunately affected many in my State. Today I\n\n[[Page S2861]]\n\nshare just one of these stories to increase awareness around this \ndevastating disease. Gary Leingang was diagnosed with glioblastoma, an \naggressive form of brain cancer, in June 2008. At the same time Gary \nwas fighting his cancer, his wife Mona was battling breast cancer. Gary \nstood by her side and took care of Mona when she was on chemo and \nrecovered. Unfortunately, Gary's fight with brain cancer ended on March \n9, 2010. Before he passed, he said he wanted to make sure something \ngood come out of his cancer. So, in his honor, his wife and children \nhave shared his story to advance scientific research and increase \nawareness within the medical community in supporting patients, their \nfamilies and caregivers afflicted with brain cancer. Last year, Mona \nworked with Louisiana lawmakers to establish Louisiana Gray Day on May \n9--Gary's birthday.\n  It is my hope that in recognizing May 9 we will honor Gary's legacy \nand all help to bring greater awareness for all those affected by brain \ncancer, and perhaps even prevent some brain cancer-related deaths in \nthe future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/08/senate-section/article/S2861-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2861]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      RECOGNIZING MYSTIC AQUARIUM\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I am proud to recognize that \ntoday, First Lady Michelle Obama presents Connecticut's Mystic Aquarium \nwith the Institute of Museum and Library Services' National Medal for \nMuseum and Library Services for 2014. This medal is the Nation's \nhighest honor conferred on museums and libraries for service to their \ncommunities, and I wish to convey my deepest congratulations and \nadmiration for Mystic Aquarium on this auspicious occasion.\nSince 1973, Mystic Aquarium has showcased the wonders of the world's \noceans through exhibitions, tours, classroom programs, and partnerships \nwith scientific organizations. In addition to worldclass offerings like \nits diverse collection of more than 4,000 animals ranging from sea \nlions to penguins, the aquarium boasts New England's only beluga whale \nhabitat, as well as an innovative exhibit that showcases underwater \nexploration through a partnership with famed explorer Dr. Robert \nBallard.\nThe aquarium maintains a laudable commitment to making a difference for \nmarine environments around the globe through research and direct \ninvolvement. The Marine Animal Rescue Program rehabilitates dozens of \ninjured seals every year, and a penguin task force has provided similar \nhelp to African penguins in South Africa. The aquarium's extensive \nresearch includes field observations on wild belugas in the Arctic and \ncloser to home, the aquarium enlists visitors in beach cleanup and \nmarine animal stranding and rehabilitation programs.\nWhat I find most meaningful about Mystic Aquarium's work, however, is \nits consistent focus on inspiring and serving the people of Connecticut \nand visitors from around the world. Of the Aquarium's 700,000 yearly \nvisitors, one in seven is a Connecticut K-12 student, and because \nschool budget constraints too often limit learning opportunities \noutside the classroom, the aquarium regularly offers complimentary \nadmission to students and teachers from economically disadvantage \ncommunities. The aquarium's deep investment in promoting scientific and \nenvironmental understanding among students of all ages and backgrounds \nis similarly reflected in its innovative programming for Native \nAmerican high school students and for young people with intellectual \ndisabilities.\nHaving attended numerous events at Mystic Aquarium, I can personally \nattest to the dedication of everyone there in serving Connecticut and \nimproving animal habitat across the world. I know how hard Dr. Stephen \nM. Coan, Dr. Ballard, and all of the aquarium's staff members and \nvolunteers work to support these goals. For its legacy of community-\nfocused education and environmental stewardship, I am proud to \ncongratulate Mystic Aquarium on its receipt of the great honor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/08/senate-section/article/S2861-2", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2861-S2863]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          SAMUEL J. HEYMAN SERVICE TO AMERICA MEDALS FINALISTS\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, people often wonder why they pay \ntaxes. Well, the short answer, former Associate Justice Oliver Wendell \nHolmes, Jr. famously wrote in a 1927 Supreme Court decision, is that \n``taxes are what we pay for civilized society,'' (Companniia General de \nTabacos de Filipinas v. Collector of Internal Revenue. The longer \nanswer is that people pay taxes for government goods and services that \nmake their families, businesses, communities, and the United States of \nAmerica stronger, safer, and more prosperous. The people who provide \ngovernment goods and services are public servants.\n  This week is Public Service Recognition Week, an opportunity to \nacknowledge and thank the 21.9 million men and women who work in local, \ncounty, State, and Federal Government. Each day, these people teach our \nchildren; patrol our borders and ports; protect our food, land, air, \nand water; care for our veterans and senior citizens; develop \ntreatments and cures for illness and disease; fight fires and respond \nto natural disasters; make our communities safer; help domestic \nmanufacturers compete abroad; enforce our laws and administer justice; \nadvance human understanding of the smallest particles, the vastness of \nthe universe, and the origin of life; and promote and defend American \nvalues and ideals abroad.\n  The knowledge, expertise, skill, and commitment of our public sector \nworkforce is one of America's greatest assets. No other nation can \nmatch our public workforce's professionalism and level of \naccomplishment. Yet, too often public servants are disparaged and \ndenigrated. Too often public servants bear the brunt of deficit \nreduction. Too often, public servants are asked to do more and more \nwith less and less. We need to strengthen and encourage our public \nworkforce. We should always strive to make government better, more \nresponsive, more efficient.\n  On May 6 I had the honor of delivering brief remarks at a breakfast \norganized by the Partnership for Public Service to announce the \nfinalists for the 2014 Samuel J. Heyman Service to America Medals. \nThese individuals and teams have been chosen for their commitment to \npublic service and because they have made ``a significant contribution \nin their field of government that is innovative, high-impact and \ncritical for the nation,'' according to the partnership.\n  I would like to take a few moments to talk about the finalists.

California Chrome \nwas the victor by 1\\3/4\\ lengths, and as a fellow horse owner, it gave \nme great pride to watch a Nevadan-owned horse win this coveted title.\n  Steve Coburn, an Army veteran, and Carolyn Coburn are both Douglas \nCounty residents who took a chance 5 years ago when they became part-\nowners in California Chrome's mother, Love the Chase, as an investment \nopportunity. Although Love the Chase failed as a thoroughbred in the \neyes of the industry, the Coburns and other co-owners decided to breed \nher, resulting in California Chrome, the humble-beginnings horse who \nturned out to be a champion.\n  California Chrome does not only win races, but he has become an \nintegral member of the Coburn family. Every few weeks, the Coburn's \nmade the drive from their rural Nevada home to watch their foal grow \ninto a champion and never had a doubt that he was special. His track \nrecord of 10 career starts and 6 first-place finishes proves their \npredictions right.\n  As a fellow horse enthusiast, I appreciate the unique roles horses \nplay as companion animals, as well as an important part of the \ncommercial horse racing industry.

But I take a very special pride in \nprojects that have made a big\n\n[[Page S2864]]\n\ndifference in local communities across my State.\n  Today, I would like to give an accounting of my work with leaders and \nresidents of Emmet County to build a legacy of a stronger local \neconomy, better schools and educational opportunities, and a healthier, \nsafer community.\n  Between 2001 and 2013, the creative leadership in your community has \nworked with me to secure funding in Emmet County worth over $4.5 \nmillion and successfully acquired financial assistance from programs I \nhave fought hard to support, which have provided more than $15.5 \nmillion to the local economy.\n  Of course my favorite memory of working together has to be the \ncommunity's commitment work to secure Harkin wellness grants. From \nincreasing physical activity to promoting workplace wellness and \neducating students about the dangers of tobacco, this funding has \nprovided the key to reducing health care costs and helping Iowans live \na longer, happier life. Through the five programs included in the \nLifestyle Challenge, participants lost a collective 3,467 pounds and \nclocked 23,911 hours of activity. Emmet County has been at the \nforefront of this effort, so I look forward to learning how they have \nimplemented healthier living in their community.\n  Among the highlights:\n  Investing in Iowa's economic development through targeted community \nprojects: In Northwest Iowa, we have worked together to grow the \neconomy by making targeted investments in important economic \ndevelopment projects including improved roads and bridges, modernized \nsewer and water systems, and better housing options for residents of \nEmmet County. In many cases, I have secured Federal funding that has \nleveraged local investments and served as a catalyst for a whole ripple \neffect of positive, creative changes. For example, working with mayors, \ncity council members, and local economic development officials in Emmet \nCounty, I have fought for over $1.3 million for the Iowa Great Lakes \nCommunity College for work on renewable energy programs, helping to \ncreate jobs and expand economic opportunities.\n  School grants: Every child in Iowa deserves to be educated in a \nclassroom that is safe, accessible, and modern. That's why, for the \npast decade and a half, I have secured funding for the innovative Iowa \nDemonstration Construction Grant Program--better known among educators \nin Iowa as Harkin grants for public schools construction and \nrenovation. Across 15 years, Harkin grants worth more than $132 million \nhave helped school districts to fund a range of renovation and repair \nefforts--everything from updating fire safety systems to building new \nschools. In many cases, these Federal dollars have served as the needed \nincentive to leverage local public and private dollars, so it often has \na tremendous multiplier effect within a school district. Over the \nyears, Emmet County has received $3.3 million in Harkin grants. \nSimilarly, schools in Emmet County have received funds that I \ndesignated for Iowa Star Schools for technology totaling $175,000.\n  Agricultural and rural development: Because I grew up in a small town \nin rural Iowa, I have always been a loyal friend and fierce advocate \nfor family farmers and rural communities. I have been a member of the \nHouse or Senate Agriculture Committee for 40 years--including more than \n10 years as chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. Across the \ndecades, I have championed farm policies for Iowans that include \neffective farm income protection and commodity programs; strong, \nprogressive conservation assistance for agricultural producers; \nrenewable energy opportunities; and robust economic development in our \nrural communities. Since 1991, through various programs authorized \nthrough the farm bill, Emmet County has received more than $1.4 million \nfrom a variety of farm bill programs.\n  Keeping Iowa communities safe: I also firmly believe that our first \nresponders need to be appropriately trained and equipped, able to \nrespond to both local emergencies and to statewide challenges such as--\nfor instance, the methamphetamine epidemic. Since 2001, Emmet County's \nfire departments have received over $660,000 for firefighter safety and \noperations equipment.\n  Wellness and health care: Improving the health and wellness of all \nAmericans has been something I have been passionate about for decades. \nThat is why I fought to dramatically increase funding for disease \nprevention, innovative medical research, and a whole range of \ninitiatives to improve the health of individuals and families not only \nat the doctor's office but also in our communities, schools, and \nworkplaces. I am so proud that Americans have better access to clinical \npreventive services, nutritious food, smoke-free environments, safe \nplaces to engage in physical activity, and information to make healthy \ndecisions for themselves and their families. These efforts not only \nsave lives, they will also save money for generations to come thanks to \nthe prevention of costly chronic diseases, which account for a whopping \n75 percent of annual health care costs. I am pleased that Emmet County \nhas recognized this important issue by securing $120,000 in wellness \ngrants.\n  This is at least a partial accounting of my work on behalf of Iowa, \nand specifically Emmet County, during my time in Congress. In every \ncase, this work has been about partnerships, cooperation, and \nempowering folks at the State and local level, including in Emmet \nCounty, to fulfill their own dreams and initiatives. And, of course, \nthis work is never complete. Even after I retire from the Senate, I \nhave no intention of retiring from the fight for a better, fairer, \nricher Iowa. I will always be profoundly grateful for the opportunity \nto serve the people of Iowa as their Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/08/senate-section/article/S2864-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2864-S2865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DICKINSON COUNTY, IOWA\n\n Mr. HARKIN.

But I was deeply disturbed by the discrimination and \nobstacles he faced every day. That's why I have always been a \npassionate advocate for full equality for people with disabilities. As \nthe primary author of the Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA, and the \nADA Amendments Act, I have had four guiding goals for our fellow \ncitizens with disabilities: equal opportunity, full participation, \nindependent living and economic self-sufficiency. Nearly a quarter \ncentury since passage of the ADA, I see remarkable changes in \ncommunities everywhere I go in Iowa--not just in curb cuts or closed \ncaptioned television, but in the full participation of people with \ndisabilities in our society and economy, folks who at long last have \nthe opportunity to contribute their talents and to be fully included. \nThese changes have increased economic opportunities for all citizens of \nDickinson County, both those with and without disabilities.

Madam President, today we honor the life and \nservice of Ernie Schoch, whose passing signifies a great loss to \nNevada. I send my condolences and prayers to Joann and all of Ernie's \nfamily in this time of mourning.\n  Ernie came to the United States to become a member of the U.S. Air \nForce. During his tenure in the Air Force, Ernie was a recipient of the \nprestigious Good Conduct Medal. Airmen awarded this medal must earn \ncharacter and efficiency ratings of excellent or higher throughout a 3-\nyear period of Active military service or for a 1-year period of \nservice during a time of war. As one of our Nation's servicemembers, he \nmade exceptional sacrifices for our country and deserves our deepest \ngratitude. I am both humbled and honored by not only his but his \nfamily's service to our great Nation.\n  Ernie and his wife Joann were exemplary volunteers throughout the \ncommunity. Their selflessness extends far beyond our Nation's military. \nHe was dedicated to supporting homeless veterans and worked with the \nU.S. Veterans Initiative and other organizations in his spare time. As \na member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I am proud to have \ncontinued his work through my own legislative proposals to help in \nassisting homeless veterans. His volunteerism brought so much to his \ncommunity, and rest assured his contributions will remain a lasting \nlegacy in the ``Silver State.''\n  I extend my deepest sympathies to Joann and all of Ernie's family. We \nwill always remember Ernie for his courageous contributions to the \nUnited States of America and to freedom-loving nations around the \nworld. His service to his country and his bravery and dedication to his \nfamily and community earn him a place among the outstanding men and \nwomen who have valiantly defended our Nation.\n  Ernie's wife Joann is a woman whom I am proud to call a friend. \nTogether, the two were an inseparable couple whose love for each other \nwas obvious to anyone who spent time with them. They enjoyed traveling \ntogether and sharing their stories with all who eagerly listened. When \nnot traveling or volunteering, Joann and Ernie opened their home \ngenerously to the many people who loved their company.\n  Throughout his life, Ernie maintained a dedication to the \npreservation of justice and integrity, which I am honored to commend. \nToday, I join the Clark County community and citizens of the ``Silver \nState'' to celebrate the life of an upstanding Nevadan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/08/senate-section/article/S2865-2", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2865-S2866]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   CONGRATULATING RABBI DR.

Through it all, Rabbi Gewirtz has \nkept the Young Israel community together. He represented the Orthodox \nJewish community locally and nationally with wisdom and integrity.

KAY SCHALLENKAMP\n\n Mr. THUNE. Madam President, today I honor Dr. Kay Schallenkamp \non her many accomplishments and upcoming retirement.\n  Dr. Kay Schallenkamp was born in Salem, SD. Her background includes \nthree degrees in communication disorders; a bachelor's degree from \nNorthern State University, a master's degree from the University of \nSouth Dakota, and a doctorate from the University of Colorado. Her \ncareer has spanned for over 40 years, and her dedication to education \nand the well-being of her students is unmatched.\n  Dr. Schallenkamp's career in higher education originated as a \nprofessor of communication disorders at Northern State University in \nAberdeen, SD, in 1973. She served as department chair from 1982 to \n1984, followed by an appointment as dean of graduate studies and \nresearch in 1984. Dr. Schallenkamp was named provost of Chadron State \nCollege in 1988, and in 1992 she was named provost of the University of \nWisconsin-Whitewater. Before making her way back to South Dakota, Dr. \nSchallenkamp served as the president of Emporia State University in \nKansas from 1997 to 2006.\n  Since her arrival at Black Hills State University, BHSU, in 2006, Dr. \nSchallenkamp has placed the needs of BHSU ahead of her own. Due to her \ndiligent work, BHSU is the State of South Dakota's third-largest \nuniversity. She has been vital in physical renovations across campus, \nincluding a key transformation and addition to the Student Union, the \nconstruction of the Life Sciences Laboratory, and updates to the campus \nresidence halls. Preparations are also being made for the addition of a \nnew residence hall and a remodel of Jonas Science Hall in partnership \nwith the Sanford Underground Research Facility in Lead, SD. Dr. \nSchallenkamp has served as the president for the last 8 years and in \nthat time BHSU has significantly grown.\n  Dr. Schallenkamp is retiring after a long and successful career to \nspend more time with her family. She and her husband Ken have two \ndaughters: Heather (Shad) in Kansas have two children, Alyssa and \nTyler. Jenni (Danny) Simon in North Carolina have two sons, Keenan and \nReece.\n  I am honored to recognize Dr. Schallenkamp for her accomplishments \nand wish her a happy retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/08/senate-section/article/S2866-2", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2866]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNIZING SALVE REGINA UNIVERSITY\n\n Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, in 1874, a financier named \nWilliam Watts Sherman and his wife Annie Wetmore decided to build a \nhouse on a plot of land Wetmore had inherited from her father in \nNewport, RI, just a few blocks from Sheep Point Cove. The couple hired \nthe respected architects H.H. Richardson and Stanford White, and chose \nthe popular Queen Anne's style, which employed steeply sloping \nrooflines, gables, broad porches, and deep entranceways. But, as is the \ncase with many in Rhode Island, they also wanted to put their own mark \non the property--something that would set it apart from their \nneighbors. So they added new materials, like stucco, shingles, stained \nglass windows, and an asymmetrical layout to draw the eye in unexpected \ndirections.\n  The house was both fashionable and altogether different, and a new \nstyle was born. So it is that ``Shingle Style,'' as it came to be \nknown, is traced back to Rhode Island and the William Watts Sherman \nHouse.\n  Today the home is one of more than 21 historic buildings on the \ncampus of Salve Regina University, which has sought to maintain the \nstructures and commission new buildings that complement Newport's \ndistinct architectural tradition. That is why Salve Regina University \nhas been selected for the Institute of Classical Architecture & Art's \nprestigious Arthur Ross Award for Stewardship. It joins previous \nrecipients that include the New York Botanical Garden in New York, \nMonticello, the Thomas Jefferson Foundation in Virginia, and the U.S. \nCommission of Fine Arts in Washington, D.C. The award recognizes the \nuniversity's ``astute and indefatigable effort'' to preserve its legacy \nfor future generations and expand upon the defining aesthetic of its \ncampus and surrounding neighborhood. I could not imagine a more worthy \nrecipient.\n  The story of William Watts Sherman House is one of many examples of \narchitectural innovation in the Ocean State, from ``stone-ender'' \nfarmhouses in Lincoln, to vast industrial spaces like Slater Mill in \nPawtucket, and to Gilded Age mansions like The Breakers in Newport. We \nsee our own history reflected back to us through these structures, and \nby preserving them we see more clearly how much has changed and why.\n  I am proud to see an institution that cares deeply about preserving \nNewport's architectural heritage receive worthy recognition. I applaud \nSalve Regina's dedication to Rhode Island's rich cultural history and \ncongratulate them on this prestigious honor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/08/senate-section/article/S2866-3", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2866]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/08/senate-section/article/S2866-4", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2866]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/08/senate-section/article/S2866-5", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2866-S2874]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nPROPOSED AGREEMENT FOR COOPERATION BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED \n   STATES OF AMERICA AND THE GOVERNMENT OF THE SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF \n       VIETNAM CONCERNING PEACEFUL USES OF NUCLEAR ENERGY--PM 42\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I am pleased to transmit to the Congress, pursuant to sections 123 b. \nand 123 d. of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. \n2153(b), (d)) (the ``Act''), the text of a proposed Agreement for \nCooperation between the Government of the United States of America and \nthe Government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam Concerning Peaceful \nUses of Nuclear Energy (the ``Agreement''). I am also pleased to \ntransmit my written approval, authorization, and determination \nconcerning the Agreement, and an unclassified Nuclear Proliferation \nAssessment Statement (NPAS) concerning the Agreement. (In accordance \nwith section 123 of the Act, as amended by title XII of the Foreign \nAffairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 (Public Law 105- 277), a \nclassified annex to the NPAS, prepared by the Secretary of State in \nconsultation with the Director of National Intelligence, summarizing \nrelevant classified information, will be submitted to the Congress \nseparately.) The joint memorandum submitted to me by the Secretaries of \nState and Energy and a letter from the Chairman of the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission stating the views of the Commission are also \nenclosed. An addendum to the NPAS containing a comprehensive analysis \nof Vietnam's export control system with respect to nuclear-related \nmatters, including interactions with other countries of proliferation \nconcern and the actual or suspected nuclear, dual-use, or missile-\nrelated transfers to such countries, pursuant to section 102A of the \nNational Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 403-1), as amended, is being \nsubmitted separately by the Director of National Intelligence.\n  The proposed Agreement has been negotiated in accordance with the Act \nand other applicable law. In my judgment, it meets all applicable \nstatutory requirements and will advance the nonproliferation and other \nforeign policy interests of the United States.\n  The proposed Agreement provides a comprehensive framework for \npeaceful nuclear cooperation with Vietnam based on a mutual commitment \nto nuclear nonproliferation. Vietnam has affirmed that it does not \nintend to seek to acquire sensitive fuel cycle capabilities, but \ninstead will rely upon the international market in order to ensure a \nreliable nuclear fuel supply for\n\n[[Page S2867]]\n\nVietnam. This political commitment by Vietnam has been reaffirmed in \nthe preamble of the proposed Agreement. The Agreement also contains a \nlegally binding provision that prohibits Vietnam from enriching or \nreprocessing U.S.-origin material without U.S. consent.\n  The proposed Agreement will have an initial term of 30 years from the \ndate of its entry into force, and will continue in force thereafter for \nadditional periods of 5 years each. Either party may terminate the \nAgreement on 6 months' advance written notice at the end of the initial \n30 year term or at the end of any subsequent 5-year period. \nAdditionally, either party may terminate the Agreement on 1 year's \nwritten notice. I recognize the importance of executive branch \nconsultations with the Congress regarding the status of the Agreement \nprior to the end of the 30-year period after entry into force and prior \nto the end of each 5-year period thereafter. To that end, it is my \nstrong recommendation that future administrations conduct such \nconsultations with the appropriate congressional committees at the \nappropriate times.\n  The proposed Agreement permits the transfer of information, material, \nequipment (including reactors), and components for nuclear research and \nnuclear power production. It does not permit transfers of Restricted \nData, sensitive nuclear technology, sensitive nuclear facilities, or \nmajor critical components of such facilities. In the event of \ntermination of the Agreement, key nonproliferation conditions and \ncontrols continue with respect to material, equipment, and components \nsubject to the Agreement.\n  Vietnam is a non-nuclear-weapon state party to the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Vietnam has in force a comprehensive \nsafeguards agreement and an Additional Protocol with the International \nAtomic Energy Agency. Vietnam is a party to the Convention on the \nPhysical Protection of Nuclear Material, which establishes \ninternational standards of physical protection for the use, storage, \nand transport of nuclear material, and has ratified the 2005 Amendment \nto the Convention. A more detailed discussion of Vietnam's intended \ncivil nuclear program and its nuclear nonproliferation policies and \npractices, including its nuclear export policies and practices, is \nprovided in the NPAS and in a classified annex to the NPAS submitted to \nyou separately. As noted above, the Director of National Intelligence \nwill provide an addendum to the NPAS containing a comprehensive \nanalysis of Vietnam's export control system with respect to nuclear-\nrelated matters.\n  I have considered the views and recommendations of the interested \ndepartments and agencies in reviewing the proposed Agreement and have \ndetermined that its performance will promote, and will not constitute \nan unreasonable risk to, the common defense and security. Accordingly, \nI have approved the Agreement and authorized its execution and urge \nthat the Congress give it favorable consideration.\n  This transmission shall constitute a submittal for purposes of both \nsections 123 b. and 123 d. of the Act.

Coverage of Agreement\n\n       a. Material, equipment and components transferred from the \n     territory of one Party to the territory of the other Party, \n     whether directly or through a third country, shall be \n     regarded as having been transferred pursuant to the Agreement \n     only upon confirmation, by the appropriate government \n     authority of the recipient Party to the appropriate \n     government authority of the supplier Party, that such \n     material, equipment or components shall be subject to the \n     Agreement.\n       b. With respect to the definition of ``Restricted Data'' in \n     subparagraph (R) of Article 1 of the Agreement, it is the \n     understanding of the Parties that all information on the use \n     of special fissionable material in the production of energy \n     from standard civilian reactors has been declassified or \n     removed from the category of ``Restricted Data.''\n       c. For the purposes of implementing the rights specified in \n     Article 5 and Article 6 of the Agreement with respect to \n     special fissionable material produced through the use of \n     nuclear material transferred pursuant to the Agreement and \n     not used in or produced through the use of equipment \n     transferred pursuant to the Agreement, such rights shall in \n     practice be applied to that proportion of special fissionable \n     material produced that represents the ratio of transferred \n     material used in the production of the special fissionable \n     material to the total amount of material so used, and \n     similarly for subsequent generations.\n       d. Material, nuclear material, equipment and components \n     subject to this Agreement shall no longer be subject to this \n     Agreement if:\n       (1) Such items have been transferred beyond the territory \n     of the receiving Party in accordance with the relevant \n     provisions of this Agreement and are no longer under its \n     jurisdiction or control anywhere;\n       (2) In the case of nuclear material, if the Parties agree, \n     taking into account among other factors an IAEA \n     determination, if any, in accordance with the provisions for \n     the termination of safeguards in the relevant agreement \n     referred to in paragraphs 2 or 3 of Article 9, whichever is \n     applicable, that the nuclear material is no longer usable for \n     any nuclear activity relevant from the point of view of \n     safeguards; or\n       (3) In the case of material (other than nuclear material), \n     equipment and components, it is agreed by the Parties.\n\n\n                             2. Safeguards\n\n       a. If either Party becomes aware of circumstances referred \n     to in paragraph 4 of Article 9 of the Agreement, either Party \n     (hereinafter ``the safeguarding Party'') shall have the \n     rights listed below, which rights shall be suspended if both \n     Parties agree that the need to exercise such rights is being \n     satisfied by the application of IAEA safeguards under \n     arrangements pursuant to paragraph 4 of Article 9 of the \n     Agreement:\n       (1) To review in a timely fashion the design of any \n     equipment transferred pursuant to the Agreement, or of any \n     facility that is to use, fabricate, process, or store any \n     material so transferred or any special fissionable material \n     used in or produced through the use of such material or \n     equipment;\n       (2) To require the maintenance and production of records \n     and of relevant reports for the purpose of assisting in \n     ensuring accountability for material transferred pursuant to \n     the Agreement and any source material or special fissionable \n     material used in or produced through the use of any material, \n     equipment or components so transferred; and\n       (3) To designate personnel acceptable to the other Party \n     (hereinafter ``the safeguarded Party''), who shall have \n     access to all places and data necessary to account for the \n     material referred to in paragraph 2, to inspect any equipment \n     or facility referred to in paragraph 1, and to install any \n     devices and make such independent measurements as may be \n     deemed necessary to account for such material. The \n     safeguarded Party shall not unreasonably withhold its \n     acceptance of personnel designated by the safeguarding Party \n     under this paragraph. Such personnel shall, if either Party \n     so requests, be accompanied by personnel designated by the \n     safeguarded Party.\n       b. The simultaneous application of safeguards with respect \n     to one Party by the IAEA and by the other Party is not \n     intended.\n       c. Upon the request of either Party, the other Party will \n     authorize the IAEA to make available to the Government of the \n     requesting Party information on the implementation of the \n     applicable safeguards agreement with the IAEA within the \n     scope of cooperation under this Agreement.\n       d. To the extent consistent with its applicable national \n     legislation and regulations, each Party shall ensure that all \n     information provided under this Section 2 of the Agreed \n     Minute by the other Party or the IAEA will not be publicly \n     disclosed, and will be accorded appropriate protections with \n     a view to providing the same level of protection accorded to \n     such information by the other Party or the IAEA. The Parties \n     shall consult regarding the appropriate protections for such \n     information.\n     FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:\n                                 ______\n                                 \n     FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF THE SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF VIETNAM:\n                                 ______\n                                 \n     [Presidential Determination No. 2014-08]\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                    Washington, February 24, 2014.\n     Memorandum for the Secretary of State, the Secretary of \n         Energy.\n     Subject: Proposed Agreement for Cooperation Between the \n         Government of the United States of America and the \n         Government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam \n         Concerning Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy.\n\n       I have considered the proposed Agreement for Cooperation \n     Between the Government of the United States of America and \n     the Government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam \n     Concerning Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy, along with the \n     views, recommendations, and statements of the interested \n     agencies.\n       I have determined that the performance of the Agreement \n     will promote, and will not constitute an unreasonable risk \n     to, the common defense and security. Pursuant to section 123 \n     b. of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. \n     2153(b)), I hereby approve the proposed Agreement and \n     authorize the Secretary of State to arrange for its \n     execution.\n       The Secretary of State is authorized to publish this \n     determination in the Federal Register.\n\n     Barack Obama.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               Nuclear Proliferation Assessment Statement\n\nPursuant to Section 123a. of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as Amended, \n  with Respect to the Proposed Agreement for Cooperation Between the \n Government of the United States of America and the Government of the \n   Socialist Republic of Vietnam Concerning Peaceful Uses of Nuclear \n                                 Energy\n\n\n                              INTRODUCTION\n\n       This Nuclear Proliferation Assessment Statement (``NPAS'') \n     relates to the proposed Agreement for Cooperation Between the \n     Government of the United States of America and the Government \n     of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam Concerning Peaceful Uses \n     of Nuclear Energy (the ``Agreement''). The Agreement is being \n     submitted to the President jointly by the Secretary of State \n     and Secretary of Energy for his approval and authorization \n     for signature.\n       Section 123a. of the Atomic Energy Act, as amended (the \n     ``Atomic Energy Act'' or ``Act''), provides that an NPAS be \n     submitted by the Secretary of State to the President on each \n     new or amended agreement for cooperation concluded pursuant \n     to that section. Pursuant to Section 123a., the NPAS must \n     analyze the consistency of the text of the proposed agreement \n     with all the requirements of the Act, with specific attention \n     to whether the proposed agreement is consistent with each of \n     the criteria set forth in Section 123.a. The NPAS must also \n     address the adequacy of the safeguards and other control \n     mechanisms and the peaceful use assurances contained in the \n     agreement for cooperation to ensure that any assistance \n     furnished thereunder will not be used to further any military \n     or nuclear explosive purpose.\n       With this statutory mandate in mind, this NPAS: (a) \n     provides background information on Vietnam's nonproliferation \n     policies and its civil nuclear program and aspirations (Part \n     I); (b) describes the nature and scope of the cooperation \n     contemplated in the proposed Agreement (Part II); (c) reviews \n     the applicable substantive requirements of the Act and the \n     Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978 (NNPA) and details how \n     they are met by the proposed Agreement (Part III); and (d) \n     sets forth the net assessment, conclusions,\n\n[[Page S2871]]\n\n     views, and recommendations of the Department of State as \n     contemplated by section 123a. of the Act (Part IV).\n\n\n   I. NUCLEAR PROGRAM AND NONPROLIFERATION POLICIES OF THE SOCIALIST \n                          REPUBLIC OF VIETNAM\n\n                                Overview\n\n       Vietnam has been carefully building the infrastructure \n     necessary to operate a safe and secure civil nuclear power \n     program. In January 2006, the Vietnamese government approved \n     the Strategy for Peaceful Utilization of Atomic Energy up to \n     the year 2020. This strategy included three main objectives:\n       To enhance applications of radiation and radioisotopes in \n     industry, agriculture, health care, environmental protection, \n     etc.\n       To construct and put the first nuclear power plant into \n     safe operation in 2020.\n       To build up national infrastructure for safe management of \n     radioactive materials and nuclear power plants.\n       This was followed by approval of a master plan for \n     implementation of the strategy in July 2007, completion of \n     the pre-feasibility study for the first nuclear power plant, \n     and approval of the first nuclear power plant project plan by \n     the National Assembly in 2009. An updated Master Plan for \n     Peaceful Utilization of Atomic Energy up to 2020 was approved \n     June 2010; the Direction for Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) \n     Development Plan up to 2030 was approved June 2010; and the \n     National Master Plan for Power Development for 2011-2020 with \n     the Vision to 2030 was approved July 2011.\n       In May 2013, Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung announced that \n     the government would set up a National Council for Atomic \n     Energy Development, tasked with identifying strategies and \n     priorities for the development of nuclear energy in the \n     country.\n       Vietnam has plans to have six reactors (6,000 MW) in \n     operation by 2025 and to develop a total of ten reactors \n     (10,700 MW) by 2030. Vietnam has entered into agreements for \n     cooperation on peaceful uses of nuclear energy with \n     Argentina, Canada, China, France, India, Japan, Russia, and \n     South Korea. Vietnam's Ministry of Industry and Trade (MOIT) \n     signed an agreement October 2010 with the Russian State \n     Atomic Energy Corporation ``Rosatom'' for the provision of \n     two pressurized water reactors (total of 2,000 MW) at Phuoc \n     Dinh in Ninh Thuan province. Vietnam PM Nguyen Tan Dung and \n     Japanese PM Naoto Kan released a Joint Statement October \n     2010, announcing that Vietnam had chosen Japan to supply two \n     additional reactors (total 2,000 MW) at Vinh Hai in Ninh \n     Thuan province. Feasibility studies are currently being \n     undertaken for both contracts in advance of selecting \n     specific reactor designs for these first four power reactors. \n     (The planned construction start date for the Russian reactors \n     has been pushed back three years to 2017.) In 2012, Vietnam \n     also signed an agreement with the Republic of South Korea to \n     initiate a joint preliminary feasibility study, which \n     commenced in June 2013.\n\n\n                      Nonproliferation Credentials\n\n       Under the Atomic Energy Law (No. 18/2008/QH12) (``Atomic \n     Energy Law''), Vietnam has prohibited researching, \n     developing, manufacturing, trading in, transporting, \n     transferring, storing, using, or threatening to use nuclear \n     or radiological weapons.\n       Vietnam has signed and ratified or acceded to and/or \n     brought into force the following key nonproliferation \n     treaties and instruments:\n       Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons: Acceded \n     June 14, 1982\n       IAEA Safeguards Agreement (published as INFCIRC/376, March \n     1990): Signed October 2, 1989; in force February 23, 1990\n       The Additional Protocol to its Safeguards Agreement \n     (published as INFCIRC/376 Add.1, September 26, 2012: Signed \n     August 10, 2007; in force September 17, 2012\n       Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material: \n     instrument of accession deposited October 4, 2012; in force \n     November 3, 2012\n       Amendment to the Convention on the Physical Protection of \n     Nuclear Material: instrument of ratification deposited \n     November 3, 2012\n       Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty: Signed September 24, \n     1996; ratified March 10, 2006\n       Treaty of Bangkok (Southeast Asian Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone \n     Treaty): Signed December 15, 1995; ratified November 26, 1996\n       In addition, Vietnam has committed itself to conclude the \n     International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of \n     Nuclear Terrorism.\n       Vietnam additionally has demonstrated its commitment to \n     prevent nuclear terrorism by its participation in the Global \n     Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism (GICNT) and in the \n     Nuclear Security Summit (NSS) process. Prime Minister Nguyen \n     Tan Dung participated in the first NSS in Washington, DC, in \n     2010, and the second NSS in Seoul, South Korea, in 2012. As \n     pledged at the April 2010 Nuclear Security Summit, Vietnam \n     completed conversion of the Dalat research reactor from \n     utilizing highly-enriched uranium (HEU) as fuel to utilizing \n     low-enriched uranium (LEU) in 2011. Its remaining HEU fresh \n     fuel (4.3 kg) was returned to Russia in 2007 and all the HEU \n     spent fuel (11 kg) was returned to Russia in 2013, rendering \n     Vietnam essentially free of any weapon-usable nuclear \n     materials.\n       In addition to the Dalat commitment, Vietnam fulfilled its \n     2010 NSS commitments to endorse the GICNT and to ratify the \n     Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material and \n     its 2005 Amendment. Vietnam has not yet ratified the \n     International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of \n     Nuclear Terrorism, but has informed the U.S. Embassy of its \n     intention to do so at the earliest opportunity. Vietnam and \n     South Korea announced at the 2012 NSS that the two countries \n     are working on a pilot project to establish within Vietnam a \n     system to track radiological materials using GPS technology \n     in cooperation with the IAEA. The project will contribute to \n     securing and preventing the theft of radiological materials.\n       Following signature of a Memorandum of Understanding \n     between the Department of Energy of the United States of \n     America and the Ministry of Finance of the Socialist Republic \n     of Vietnam Concerning the Cooperation to Prevent the Illicit \n     Trafficking in Nuclear and Other Radioactive Material on July \n     2, 2010, Vietnam and the United States have begun cooperative \n     projects under the Department of Energy's Second Line of \n     Defense program to deter, detect, and interdict illicit \n     smuggling of nuclear and other radioactive material.\n       The Department of Energy's International Nuclear Safeguards \n     and Engagement Program has partnered with Vietnam since 2004. \n     Vietnam is an active partner on nuclear infrastructure \n     development collaboration, including activities such as \n     radiation protection and health physics, research reactor \n     operations, environmental radiological surveillance, \n     radioactive waste management, implementation of the \n     Additional Protocol, and development of State Systems of \n     Accounting for and Control (SSAC) of nuclear material.\n       Vietnam has been a strong advocate for nonproliferation \n     through the United Nations. During Vietnam's tenure on the \n     United Nations Security Council in 2008-2009, Vietnam \n     supported measures to increase sanctions on Iran (UNSCR 1803) \n     and North Korea (UNSCR 1874), extend the mandate of the \n     UNSCR 1540 Committee (UNSCR 1810), and support nuclear \n     nonproliferation and disarmament (UNSCR 1887). In \n     September 2010, Vietnam, in partnership with the United \n     Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs, hosted a workshop \n     on implementing UNSCR 1540 for countries in Southeast \n     Asia.\n       Vietnam has established under its Atomic Energy Law a legal \n     regime for radioactive materials and nuclear equipment that \n     are subject to import and export control procedures.\n       Vietnam has been working with the U.S. Export Control and \n     Related Border Security Program (EXBS) since 2003. The bulk \n     of EXBS assistance to Vietnam to date has focused on \n     Commodity Identification Training, industry/enterprise \n     outreach, and maritime security activities. As Vietnam \n     currently lacks a comprehensive strategic trade management \n     law, the primary focus of near-term EXBS work will be \n     assisting Vietnam in developing the legal and regulatory \n     framework for managing strategic trade, including drafting a \n     strategic trade law, while continuing to develop capacity for \n     enforcement at seaports and borders.\n       The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) \n     conducted an International Consequence Management training \n     course in Hanoi November 2013 as part of Vietnam's \n     preparation for building a nuclear power plant. In addition, \n     NNSA is assisting Vietnam to set up an emergency operations \n     center and graphic information system to assist with sharing \n     information during an emergency.\n\n\n                  Nuclear Science and Technology Base\n\n       Vietnam has been working closely with the IAEA and \n     international partners to develop the technical expertise \n     needed to operate a safe and secure nuclear power program. \n     Recognizing the need for a technically trained domestic \n     workforce, Vietnam in 2010 approved the Master Plan on \n     Training and Developing of Human Resources in the Field of \n     Atomic Energy up to 2020 (Prime Minister Decision No. 1558/\n     QD-TTg) (the ``Plan''). Under the plan, Vietnam is upgrading \n     nuclear programs at six universities and developing a Nuclear \n     Science and Technology Center. The government is also \n     providing funds to send Vietnamese students, researchers, and \n     managers abroad for training. The plan aims to produce a \n     total of 2,400 engineers and 350 MA and PhD specialists in \n     nuclear power by 2020. In 2011, Vietnam set up a State \n     Steering Committee to direct the implementation of the plan. \n     Vietnamese university graduates are currently training in \n     Russia and Japan to become nuclear technicians.\n       In 2008, the Vietnam Agency for Radiation and Nuclear \n     Safety (VARANS) signed a cooperation agreement with the U.S. \n     Nuclear Regulatory Commission to share technical information \n     on nuclear energy as well as exchange information on \n     regulations, environmental impacts, and safety of nuclear \n     sites. This agreement was extended for another five years in \n     May 2013. Over the past ten years, VARANS has rapidly \n     expanded its staff to over ninety people, including \n     scientists and technical specialists.\n       Vietnam operates one research reactor (500 kW; VVR-M, IVV-\n     9) at the Institute of Nuclear Research in Dalat. The \n     original reactor, a TRIGA Mark II design (250 kW) provided by \n     General Atomics, became operational in 1963. From 1968 to \n     1975, the reactor was in extended shutdown. In 1974-1975, the \n     U.S.-origin HEU nuclear fuel (approximately 13 kg) was \n     removed and returned to the United States and the reactor was \n     decommissioned. Vietnam reconstructed the reactor in the \n     1980s with the assistance of the\n\n[[Page S2872]]\n\n     Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) and the reactor \n     became operational in 1983. According to the Vietnam Atomic \n     Energy Commission, the reactor has been operating for the \n     purposes of radioisotope production, neutron activation \n     analysis, fundamental and applied research, and manpower \n     training.\n       Vietnam is negotiating a contract with Russian \n     Atomstroyexport for the provision of an additional research \n     reactor for the Vietnamese Nuclear Science and Technology \n     Center. (No final decision has been made for the location of \n     this center.)\n\n\n                           Nuclear Fuel Cycle\n\n       Vietnam has affirmed that it does not intend to seek to \n     acquire sensitive fuel cycle capabilities but instead will \n     rely upon the international market. This political commitment \n     not to pursue enrichment and reprocessing was first included \n     in the Memorandum of Understanding between the Socialist \n     Republic of Vietnam and the United States of America \n     Concerning Cooperation in the Nuclear Energy Field, signed in \n     Hanoi on March 30, 2010 (the ``MOU''). In the MOU, Vietnam \n     affirmed its intent ``to rely on existing international \n     markets for nuclear fuel services, rather than acquiring \n     sensitive nuclear technologies, as a solution for peaceful, \n     safe and secure uses of civilian nuclear energy. . . .'' This \n     commitment has been reaffirmed in the preamble of the \n     proposed Agreement.\n\n\n                    Nuclear Regulations and Statutes\n\n       Vietnam passed an Atomic Energy Law in June 2008, which \n     took effect January 1, 2009. Key provisions address:\n       Establishment of the national nuclear regulatory authority\n       Licensing and permitting regime\n       Enforcement, assessment, and inspection\n       Security and safeguards\n       Physical protection and safety\n       Control over orphan sources\n       Emergency preparedness and response\n       Safe transport of radioactive material\n       Import and export controls\n       Waste management and spent fuel management\n       Decommissioning\n       Civil liability for nuclear damage\n       Criminal and civil offences and penalties\n       Insurance\n       In June 2010, Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung signed \n     Decision No. 45/2010/QD-TTg, which provides regulations on \n     nuclear control in support of the Atomic Energy Law. Vietnam \n     is in the process of further updating its Atomic Energy Law.\n       Vietnam acceded to both the Convention on Early \n     Notification of a Nuclear Accident and the Convention on \n     Assistance in the Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological \n     Emergency on October 30, 1987. Vietnam acceded to the \n     Convention on Nuclear Safety on July 15, 2010, and Vietnam \n     deposited its instrument of ratification for the Joint \n     Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the \n     Safety of Radioactive Waste Management with the IAEA on \n     October 9, 2013. It came into force for Vietnam on January 7, \n     2014.\n       Vietnam is currently considering whether to accede to the \n     Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage and \n     whether to ratify the Convention on Supplementary \n     Compensation for Nuclear Damage.\n\n\n II. NATURE AND SCOPE OF THE COOPERATION CONTEMPLATED BY THE PROPOSED \n                               AGREEMENT\n\n       Article 2.2 of the proposed Agreement describes in general \n     terms the kinds of cooperative activities envisaged. These \n     include:\n       Development of requirements for power reactors and fuel \n     service arrangements for the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.\n       Development of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam's civilian \n     nuclear energy use in a manner that contributes to global \n     efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation.\n       Research, development, and application of civilian nuclear \n     power reactor technologies and spent fuel management \n     technologies.\n       Promotion of the establishment of a reliable source of \n     nuclear fuel for future civilian light water nuclear reactors \n     deployed in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.\n       Civilian nuclear energy training, human resource and \n     infrastructure development, and appropriate application of \n     civilian nuclear energy and related energy technology, in \n     accordance with evolving IAEA guidance and standards on \n     milestones for infrastructure development.\n       Research and application of radioisotopes and radiation in \n     industry, agriculture, medicine, and the environment.\n       Radiation protection and management of radioactive waste \n     and spent fuel.\n       Nuclear safety, security, safeguards, and nonproliferation, \n     including physical protection, export control, and border \n     security.\n       Other areas of cooperation as may be mutually determined by \n     the Parties.\n       Article 3.1 of the proposed Agreement further specifies the \n     types of information concerning the peaceful uses of nuclear \n     energy that may be transferred. Fields that may be covered \n     include the following:\n       Research, development, design, construction, operation, \n     maintenance, and use of reactors, reactor experiments, and \n     decommissioning.\n       The use of material in physical and biological research, \n     medicine, agriculture, and industry.\n       Fuel cycle studies of ways to meet future world-wide civil \n     nuclear needs, including multilateral approaches to \n     guaranteeing nuclear fuel supply and appropriate techniques \n     for management of nuclear wastes.\n       Safeguards and physical protection of material, equipment, \n     and components.\n       Health, safety, and environmental considerations related to \n     the foregoing.\n       Assessing the role nuclear power may play in national \n     energy plans.\n       The Agreement states that restricted data, sensitive \n     nuclear technology, sensitive nuclear facilities, or major \n     critical components of such facilities shall not be \n     transferred under the Agreement (Articles 3.3 and 4.1).\n       Transfers of special fissionable material to Vietnam under \n     the Agreement shall be low-enriched uranium, except small \n     quantities for use as samples, standards, detectors, targets, \n     or for other agreed purposes (Articles 4.1 and 4.4). Any such \n     transfers of low-enriched uranium may not be in excess of the \n     quantity that the Parties agree is necessary for the \n     activities envisaged (Article 4.3).\n       The Agreed Minute, under ``Coverage of Agreement,'' \n     provides that material, equipment, and components transferred \n     from the territory of one Party to the territory of the other \n     Party, either directly or through a third country, shall be \n     regarded as having been transferred pursuant to the Agreement \n     only upon confirmation by the recipient Party that such items \n     will be subject to the Agreement.\n       The proposed Agreement will have a term of 30 years from \n     the date of its entry into force and shall continue \n     thereafter for additional periods of five years. Either Party \n     may, by giving six months written notice to the other Party, \n     terminate this Agreement at the end of the initial 30 year \n     period or at the end of any subsequent five-year period. \n     Additionally, the proposed Agreement may be terminated at any \n     time by either Party on one year's written notice to the \n     other Party (Article 16.3). In the event of termination of \n     the Agreement, key nonproliferation conditions and controls \n     provided for in the Agreement will continue in effect as long \n     as any material, equipment, or components subject to the \n     Agreement remains in the territory of the Party concerned or \n     under its jurisdiction or control anywhere, or until such \n     time as the Parties agree that such material, equipment, or \n     components are no longer usable for any nuclear activity \n     relevant from the point of view of safeguards (Article \n     16.4).\n\n\n                      III. SUBSTANTIVE CONDITIONS\n\n       The proposed Agreement meets the applicable requirements of \n     the Atomic Energy Act and the NNPA. Section 123 of the Act, \n     as amended by the NNPA, sets forth certain substantive \n     requirements that must be met in agreements for cooperation. \n     Sections 402 and 407 of the NNPA set forth supplementary \n     requirements. The provisions contained in the proposed \n     Agreement satisfy these legal requirements as follows:\n       (1) Application of Safeguards: Section 123(a)(1) of the Act \n     requires a guaranty from the cooperating party that \n     safeguards in perpetuity will be maintained with respect to \n     all nuclear materials and equipment transferred pursuant to \n     an agreement for cooperation and with respect to all special \n     nuclear material used in or produced through the use of such \n     transferred nuclear materials and equipment, so long as the \n     material or equipment remains under the jurisdiction or \n     control of the cooperating party, irrespective of the \n     duration of the other provisions of the agreement or whether \n     the agreement is terminated or suspended for any reason.\n       This requirement is satisfied by Articles 9 and 16 of the \n     proposed Agreement. Article 9.2 stipulates that source or \n     special nuclear material (referred to in this Agreement as \n     ``special fissionable material'') transferred to Vietnam \n     pursuant to this Agreement and any other nuclear material \n     used in or produced through the use of any material (which \n     under the Agreement includes source material, special nuclear \n     material, byproduct material, radioisotopes other than \n     byproduct material, moderator material, or any other such \n     substance so designated by agreement of the Parties), \n     equipment, or components transferred shall be subject, to the \n     extent applicable, to the Agreement between Vietnam and the \n     IAEA for the application of safeguards in connection with the \n     Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (``NPT''), \n     signed on October 2, 1989, which entered into force on \n     February 23, 1990, and an Additional Protocol thereto signed \n     on August 10, 2007, which entered into force on September 17, \n     2012. Article 9.4 provides for ``back-up'' safeguards in the \n     event the IAEA safeguards agreement with Vietnam is not being \n     implemented. Article 9 is one of the articles of the \n     Agreement that, pursuant to Article 16.4, continues in effect \n     so long as any material, equipment, or components subject \n     thereto remains in the territory of the United States of \n     America or Vietnam or under the jurisdiction or control of \n     either Party to the Agreement anywhere, unless that item is \n     no longer usable for any nuclear activity relevant from the \n     point of view of safeguards.\n       (2) Full-Scope Safeguards: The requirement for full-scope \n     safeguards as a condition of cooperation mandated by section \n     123 a.(2) is met by Article 9.1 of the proposed Agreement.\n       (3) Peaceful Use: The requirement of section 123 a.(3) of \n     the Act for a guaranty against explosive or military uses of \n     nuclear materials and equipment transferred and special \n     nuclear material produced through the use of such items is \n     met by Article 8 of the proposed Agreement. It is not \n     necessary to include a peaceful uses guarantee with respect \n     to sensitive nuclear technology transferred under the \n     Agreement or special nuclear materials (referred to in the \n     proposed\n\n[[Page S2873]]\n\n     Agreement as ``special fissionable materials'') produced \n     through the use of sensitive nuclear technology transferred, \n     as would otherwise be required by section 123 a.(3), because \n     Article 3.3 of the proposed Agreement provides that sensitive \n     nuclear technology shall not be transferred under the \n     Agreement.\n       (4) Right of Return: The requirement in section 123 a.(4) \n     of the Act that, in the event of a nuclear detonation by a \n     non-nuclear weapon state cooperating party, the United States \n     has a right to the return of any nuclear materials and \n     equipment transferred pursuant to an agreement for \n     cooperation and any special nuclear material produced through \n     the use of such transferred items is met by Articles 11.1 and \n     11.2 of the proposed Agreement. This right would be triggered \n     if Vietnam should detonate a nuclear explosive device, does \n     not comply with the provisions of Articles 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9 of \n     the Agreement, or terminates, abrogates, or materially \n     violates its IAEA safeguards agreement.\n       Article 11.4 of the proposed Agreement requires that a \n     Party, in determining whether to exercise its rights under \n     Article 11.1 based on a ``material violation,'' shall \n     consider whether the facts giving rise to the right to take \n     such action in accordance with Article 11.1 were caused \n     deliberately. In the event that Party finds such material \n     violation not to be deliberate, and to the extent that it \n     judges that such material violation can be rectified, the \n     non-breaching Party is obligated to endeavor, subject to its \n     national legislation and regulations, to afford the breaching \n     Party an opportunity to cure the material violation within a \n     reasonable period.\n       (5) Retransfer Consent: The requirement of Section 123 \n     a.(5) of the Act for a guaranty by the cooperating party that \n     ``any material or any Restricted Data and any production or \n     utilization facility transferred pursuant to the agreement or \n     any special nuclear material produced through the use of any \n     such facility or material'' will not be transferred to \n     unauthorized persons or beyond the jurisdiction or control of \n     the cooperating party without prior U.S. consent is met by \n     Article 5.2 of the proposed Agreement. A retransfer consent \n     right over Restricted Data (``RD'') is not provided because \n     RD transfers are prohibited under Article 3.3 of the \n     Agreement.\n       (6) Physical Security: The requirement of Section 123 a.(6) \n     of the Act for a guaranty that adequate physical security \n     will be maintained with respect to any nuclear material \n     transferred pursuant to an agreement of cooperation and any \n     special nuclear material used in or produced through the use \n     of nuclear material, production facility, or utilization \n     facility transferred pursuant to such agreement is met by \n     Article 7 of the proposed Agreement.\n       (7) Enrichment/Reprocessing/Alteration Consent Right: The \n     requirement of section 123 a.(7) of the Act for a guaranty \n     that ``no material transferred pursuant to the agreement for \n     cooperation and no material used in or produced through the \n     use of any material, production facility, or utilization \n     facility transferred pursuant to the agreement will be \n     reprocessed, enriched or (in the case of plutonium, uranium \n     233, or uranium enriched to greater than 20 per cent in the \n     isotope 235, or other nuclear materials which have been \n     irradiated) otherwise altered in form or content without the \n     prior approval of the United States,'' is met by Article 6 of \n     the proposed Agreement. Article 6.1 provides that \n     ``(m)aterial transferred pursuant to the Agreement and \n     material used in or produced through the use of material or \n     equipment so transferred shall not be reprocessed unless the \n     Parties agree.'' Article 6.2 further specifies that \n     plutonium, uranium 233, high enriched uranium, and irradiated \n     source material or special fissionable material transferred \n     pursuant to the Agreement or used in or produced through the \n     use of material or equipment so transferred shall not be \n     altered in form or content, except by irradiation or further \n     irradiation, unless the Parties agree. Article 6.3 specifies \n     that uranium transferred pursuant to the Agreement or used in \n     or produced through the use of any material or equipment so \n     transferred shall not be enriched after transfer unless the \n     Parties agree.\n       Article 6 also satisfies Section 402(a) of the NNPA, which \n     states that, except as specifically provided in any agreement \n     for cooperation, no source or special nuclear material \n     exported from the United States after the date of the NNPA \n     may be enriched after export without the prior approval of \n     the United States for such enrichment.\n       (8) Storage Consent Right: The requirement of Section 123 \n     a.(8) of the Act for a guaranty of a right of prior U.S. \n     approval over facilities for the storage of specified nuclear \n     materials is met by Article 5.1 of the proposed Agreement.\n       (9) Sensitive Nuclear Technology: The requirement of \n     section 123 a.(9) of the Act pertains to situations that may \n     result when sensitive nuclear technology is transferred \n     pursuant to a Section 123 agreement for cooperation. Article \n     3.3 of the proposed Agreement provides that sensitive nuclear \n     technology shall not be transferred under the Agreement, and \n     Article 4.1 provides that sensitive nuclear facilities and \n     major critical components thereof shall not be transferred \n     under the proposed Agreement. Accordingly, the requirement in \n     Section 123 a. (9) is not relevant to the proposed Agreement, \n     and the requirement in Section 402 (b) of the NNPA precluding \n     the transfer of major critical components of facilities for \n     uranium enrichment, nuclear fuel reprocessing, or heavy water \n     production unless an agreement for cooperation ``specifically \n     designates such components as items to be exported pursuant \n     to [such] agreement'' is also satisfied.\n       Environmental: Article 12.2 of the proposed Agreement \n     requires the Parties to consult, with regard to activities \n     under the Agreement, to identify the international \n     environmental implications arising from such activities and \n     to cooperate in protecting the international environment from \n     radioactive, chemical, or thermal contamination arising from \n     peaceful nuclear activities under the proposed Agreement and \n     in related matters of health and safety, thereby satisfying \n     the requirements of section 407 of the NNPA.\n       Article 10 of the proposed Agreement is not required by the \n     Act or the NNPA, but it is consistent with these laws. It \n     provides that the parties may, by mutual agreement, arrange \n     for a third party to exercise U.S. consent rights with \n     respect to particular items subject to the agreement if the \n     third party already enjoys the same consent rights over those \n     items. All applicable provisions of U.S. law, including \n     Section 131 of the Act governing subsequent arrangements, \n     would have to be satisfied. Similar provisions have been \n     included in all post-NNPA agreements for cooperation, \n     although they have never been applied.\n       Proportionality: For the purpose of implementing rights \n     specified in Articles 5 and 6 of the proposed Agreement, \n     ``produced'' special nuclear material is defined in terms of \n     proportionality in the Agreed Minute to the Agreement. Thus, \n     if U.S. nuclear material is used in a non-U.S. reactor, the \n     special nuclear material produced will be attributed to the \n     U.S. in the proportion of the U.S. nuclear material to the \n     total amount of nuclear material used, and similarly for \n     subsequent generations. It has been our consistent view that \n     Sections 123 and 127 of the Act allow this concept of \n     proportionality to be used in determining the reasonable \n     application of U.S. consent rights. We are aware of no course \n     of practice or legislative history to the contrary. \n     Agreements negotiated since the enactment of the NNPA in 1978 \n     generally contain a similar proportionality provision.\n       In sum, the proposed Agreement satisfies all the \n     substantive requirements specified for agreements for \n     cooperation by the Act and the NNPA.\n\n\n                             IV. CONCLUSION\n\n       Entry into force of the proposed Agreement will put in \n     place a framework for mutually beneficial civil nuclear \n     cooperation between the United States and Vietnam, and \n     provide a foundation for continued collaboration on nuclear \n     nonproliferation goals.\n       On the basis of the analysis in this NPAS and all pertinent \n     information of which it is aware, the Department of State has \n     arrived at the following assessment, conclusions, views, and \n     recommendations:\n       1. The safeguards and other control mechanisms and the \n     peaceful use assurances in the proposed Agreement are \n     adequate to ensure that any assistance furnished thereunder \n     will not be used to further any military or nuclear explosive \n     purpose.\n       2. The Agreement meets all the legal requirements of the \n     Act and the NNPA.\n       3. Execution of the proposed Agreement would be compatible \n     with the nonproliferation program, policy, and objectives of \n     the United States.\n       4. Therefore, it is recommended that the President approve \n     and authorize the execution of the proposed Agreement; and \n     that the President determine that the performance of the \n     proposed Agreement will promote, and will not constitute an \n     unreasonable risk to, the common defense and security.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                       The Secretary of State,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 18, 2014.\n\n     Memorandum for the President\n     From: John F. Kerry, Secretary of State, Ernest Moniz, \n         Secretary of Energy.\n     Subject: Proposed Agreement for Cooperation Between the \n         Government of the United States of America and the \n         Government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam \n         Concerning Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy.\n       The United States and Vietnam have completed negotiations \n     of a proposed Agreement for Cooperation Between the \n     Government of the United States of America and the Government \n     of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam Concerning Peaceful Uses \n     of Nuclear Energy (the ``Agreement''). If you authorize \n     execution of the Agreement, it will be signed by \n     representatives of the United States and Vietnam. After \n     signature, in accordance with Sections 123 b. and d. of the \n     Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the ``Act''), the \n     Agreement must be submitted to both houses of Congress for a \n     review period of 90 days of continuous session. Unless a \n     joint resolution of disapproval is enacted, the Agreement may \n     be brought into force upon completion of the review period.\n       The proposed Agreement provides a comprehensive framework \n     for peaceful nuclear cooperation with Vietnam based on a \n     mutual commitment to nuclear nonproliferation. The United \n     States and Vietnam would enter into it in the context of a \n     stated intention by Vietnam to rely on existing international \n     markets for nuclear fuel services rather than acquiring \n     sensitive fuel services, and a stated intention by the United \n     States to support those international markets in order to \n     ensure reliable nuclear fuel supply for Vietnam. These \n     intentions are explicitly stated in the preamble to the \n     Agreement.\n\n[[Page S2874]]\n\n       The Agreement will have an initial term of 30 years from \n     the date of its entry into force, and will continue in force \n     thereafter for additional periods of five years each. Either \n     Party may terminate the proposed Agreement on six months \n     advance written notice at the end of the initial 30 year term \n     or at the end of any subsequent five year period. \n     Additionally, either Party may terminate the proposed \n     Agreement on one year's written notice.\n       The Agreement permits the transfer of information, \n     material, equipment (including reactors), and components for \n     nuclear research and nuclear power production. It does not \n     permit transfers of restricted data, sensitive nuclear \n     technology, sensitive nuclear facilities, or major critical \n     components of such facilities. In the event of termination of \n     the Agreement, key nonproliferation conditions and controls \n     continue with respect to material, equipment, and components \n     subject to the Agreement.\n       Vietnam is a non-nuclear-weapon State party to the Treaty \n     on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Vietnam has in \n     force a comprehensive safeguards agreement and an Additional \n     Protocol with the International Atomic Energy Agency. Vietnam \n     is a party to the Convention on the Physical Protection of \n     Nuclear Material, which establishes international standards \n     of physical protection for the use, storage, and transport of \n     nuclear material, and has ratified the 2005 Amendment to the \n     Convention. A more detailed discussion of Vietnam's intended \n     civil nuclear program and its nuclear nonproliferation \n     policies and practices, including its nuclear export policies \n     and practices, is provided in the Nuclear Proliferation \n     Assessment Statement (``NPAS''), and in a classified annex to \n     the NPAS submitted to you separately. An addendum to the NPAS \n     containing a comprehensive analysis of the export control \n     system of Vietnam with respect to nuclear-related matters, \n     including interactions with countries of proliferation \n     concern and the actual or suspected nuclear, dual-use, or \n     missile-related transfers to such countries, pursuant to \n     section 102A of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. \n     403-1), as amended, is being submitted to you separately by \n     the Director of National Intelligence.\n       In accordance with the provisions of section 123 of the \n     Act, the proposed Agreement was negotiated by the Department \n     of State, with the technical assistance and concurrence of \n     the Department of Energy. The proposed Agreement has also \n     been reviewed by the members of the Nuclear Regulatory \n     Commission. The Commission's views are being submitted to you \n     separately.\n       In our judgment, the proposed Agreement satisfies all \n     requirements of U.S. law for agreements of this type.

A bill to prevent international violence against women, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to join with my colleagues, \nSenators Boxer, Kirk, Menendez, and Shaheen, in introducing the \nInternational Violence Against Women Act of 2014. This bill makes \nending violence against women and girls a top diplomatic priority. It \nwould permanently authorize the State Department's Office of Global \nWomen's Issues and the position of the Ambassador-at-Large for Global \nWomen's Issues.\n  It requires the administration to develop and implement an annual \nstrategy to prevent and respond to violence against women and girls for \neach of the next 5 years. This legislation will ensure that the efforts \nbegun under President George W. Bush and continued by President Barack \nObama to combat gender-based violence will be a priority for future \nadministrations as well.\n  We have witnessed great strides in women's equality in our own \ncountry and in much of the developed world over the past century. \nAcross vast swaths of the globe, however, violence against women and \nforced marriages are everyday occurrences. One out of three women \nworldwide will be physically, sexually or otherwise abused during her \nlifetime, with rates reaching 70 percent in some countries.\n  This violence ranges from domestic violence to rape and acid \nburnings, to dowry deaths and so-called honor killings. Such violence \nis often exacerbated in humanitarian emergencies and conflict settings. \nViolence against women and girls is a human rights issue, a public \nhealth epidemic, and a barrier to solving global challenges such as \nextreme poverty, HIV/AIDS, and conflict.\n  The world has just seen an appalling example of women and girls being \ntreated as property and bargaining chips in Nigeria, where the \nterrorist group Boko Haram kidnapped nearly 300 school girls and is \nthreatening to sell them into sexual slavery and into forced marriages. \nTragically, there are reports that some have already been sold into \nchild marriages. Boko Haram's leaders said the girls should get married \nand never be educated. He has said:\n\n\n[[Page S2877]]\n\n\n       I will marry off a woman at the age of 12. I will marry off \n     a girl at the age of 9.\n\n  In fact, the very name of this terrorist group roughly translates to \nthe phrase ``Western education is sinful.'' Sadly, this is a viewpoint \nthat is not just limited to terrorist leaders, though it is difficult \nto think of a more egregious example of abuse against girls than what \nwe have just witnessed in Nigeria. The International Center for \nResearch on Women says that one in nine girls around the world is \nmarried before the age of 15, a harmful practice that deprives girls of \ntheir dignity and often their education, increases their health risks, \nand perpetuates poverty. The practice of preventing women from \nattaining their full potential by targeting them for violence and early \nmarriage is still far too common in far too many countries around the \nworld.\n  The International Violence Against Women Act ensures that our country \nwill take a leadership role in combating these problems. It establishes \nthat it is the policy of the United States to take action to prevent \nand respond to violence against women and girls around the globe and to \nintegrate and coordinate efforts to address gender-based violence into \nU.S. foreign policy and foreign assistance programs.\n  Specifically, our bill will foster efforts in four areas. First, it \nwill increase legal and judicial protections by supporting laws and \nlegal structures that prevent and appropriately respond to all forms of \nviolence against women and girls, including honor killings and forced \nmarriages. For example, our bill will support our State Department's \nwork with other countries to help those nations reform their legal \nsystems by providing technical expertise and model laws and building \nthe capacity of their police and judges.\n  Second, our bill will increase efforts to build health sector \ncapacity, integrating programs to address violence against women and \ngirls into existing health care programs focused on children's \nsurvival, women's health, and HIV/AIDS prevention.\n  Third, our legislation will focus on preventing violence by changing \ncommunity norms and attitudes against the acceptability of violence \nagainst women and girls.\n  Fourth, our bill will focus on reducing females' vulnerability to \nviolence by improving their economic status and educational \nopportunities. Efforts would include ensuring that women have access to \njob training and employment opportunities and increasing their right to \nown land and property, allowing them potentially to support themselves \nand their children.\n  Our bill will require the U.S. Strategy to Prevent and Respond to \nGender-Based Violence Globally to identify 5 to 20 eligible low- and \nmiddle-income countries for which comprehensive individual country \nplans would be developed. The bill requires that at least 10 percent of \nU.S. assistance to prevent and respond to violence against females be \nprovided to nongovernmental organizations, with priority given to those \nheaded by women.\n  As the Presiding Officer well knows, violence has a profoundly \nnegative impact on the lives of women and girls. In addition to being a \npressing human rights issue, such violence contributes to inequality \nand political instability, making it a security issue as well as a \nmoral issue for all of us.\n  I am committed to working with my colleagues to end violence against \nwomen and girls and to provide the assistance and resources necessary \nto achieve this goal, and I am pleased to be the principal cosponsor of \nSenator Boxer's bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. McCASKILL (for herself, Mr. Blunt, Mr. Levin, and Mr. \n        Rockefeller):\n  S. 2308. A bill to designate Union Station in Washington, DC, as \n``Harry S. Truman Union Station''; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am truly delighted that my colleagues \nfrom Missouri, Senators McCaskill and Blunt, have today introduced \nlegislation to name Washington, DC's Union Station after our 33rd \nPresident Harry Truman, legislation of which I am proud to be an \noriginal cosponsor.\n  It is long overdue that we honor President Truman in this way. While \nmuch, in life and in politics, loses its luster as time passes, the \nTruman Presidency has only grown in stature and historical significance \nover the decades. There are many reasons for this, but let me focus on \njust a few.\n  First, history has shown the significance and wisdom of Truman's \nleadership in forging America's post-war foreign policy consensus. \nTruman and America understood the hard lesson of World War II: that a \nfailure to engage in the world could have tragic consequences for our \nNation, for our friends and allies, and for humanity. He understood the \nimportance to the free world of helping to rebuild our chief enemies in \nthat war, Germany and Japan. He understood the importance of working \nacross party lines to build and maintain a consensus for these policies \nso that they did not depend on any one President or party to continue.\n  We in Michigan are especially proud of the role that our Senator \nVandenberg, a Republican, played in helping to build this consensus \nalong with a Democratic President. Their hard work resulted in one of \nour Nation's most lasting and important achievements, ensuring \nAmerica's enduring role in leading a rising tide of freedom around the \nworld.\n  A second aspect of the Truman legacy is his commitment to open, \nethical and responsive government. He achieved public notice in the \nSenate as chairman of a committee tasked with fighting fraud and waste \nin defense contracting during World War II. He was among the earliest \nWashington politicians to call for lobbying reform. Ever since Truman's \ntime, any government official who has sought to deflect responsibility \nor accountability in that time-honored political tradition of buck-\npassing has suffered in comparison to the Truman policy that ``The Buck \nStops Here.''\n  Lastly, I will mention this: Harry Truman was a simple man. He was \nregularly described as ``plain''--and to his detractors, this was no \ncompliment--but he wore it as a badge of honor. He understood that this \nNation was built on the hard work, dedication and commitment of \nordinary working people--because he came from ordinary working people. \nHe talked straight, often bluntly. He demonstrated that one could rise \nto the highest office in the land based not on clever rhetoric or by \ncurrying favor, but by charting the best course for our Nation and \nclearly explaining that course to the people we all serve. He proved \nthat wisdom is in the power of our ideas--nothing more and nothing \nless.\n  It was a train that carried Harry Truman on his ``Give 'em Hell, \nHarry!'' whistle-stop tour during the 1948 campaign. It was from a \ntrain that he held up that famous headline--``Dewey Defeats Truman''--\nthat serves to this day as a rallying cry for the underdog. He rode the \ntrain from Union Station a lot, going home to be with his beloved wife \nBess. So naming the train station of our Nation's capital, within sight \nof the Capitol where he served so well, is a fitting tribute.\n  I join my Missouri colleagues in urging the Senate to adopt this \nlegislation and pay due honor to President Harry Truman.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself and Mr. Manchin):\n  S. 2310. A bill to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint \ncoins in commemoration of Mother's Day; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nMother's Day Commemorative Coin Act. I am proud to be joined by Senator \nManchin in this important effort.\n  Mother's Day is a special event for all West Virginians because this \nannual tribute to mothers began in our state. In 1908, a West Virginia \nwoman by the name of Anna Jarvis petitioned her local church to declare \nMay 9th as Mother's Day. She hoped that this holiday would serve as a \nday to remember and honor our mothers, and to promote peace and \nunderstanding. Within a year, all 46 States celebrated Mother's Day in \nsome fashion, and in 1914, Congress and the President declared the \nsecond Sunday of May ``Mother's Day.'' This May 9 will mark the \ncentennial for the national recognition of Mother's Day, and this bill \nprovides an opportunity to commemorate this important holiday and \nfurther recognize the\n\n[[Page S2878]]\n\nmillions of American mothers whose essential role in all of our lives \ncanna be overstated.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would recognize Mother's Day \nby authorizing the Treasury to mint a commemorative Mother's Day coin. \nProfits generated from the sale of these coins would be donated to the \nSt. Jude Children's Research Hospital and the National Osteoporosis \nFoundation. St. Jude Children's Research Hospital has advanced cures \nfor catastrophic pediatric diseases through research and treatment; and \nthe National Osteoporosis Foundation is considered our Nation's leading \nvoluntary health organization.\n  In the U.S. alone, 10 million people have osteoporosis, and 80 \npercent of those who suffer from this disease are women. This \nlegislation not only honors our nation's mothers, but also helps to \nraise funds to fight a serious disease that disproportionately impacts \nwomen. Thousands of mothers and their children have benefited from the \nefforts of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and the National \nOsteoporosis Foundation, and they are well-deserving of our support. \nTherefore, I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation to \nhonor every mother in our country.\n  I can think of no better way to celebrate Mother's Day than by \nhelping to promote the health of American mothers and their children.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED:\n  S. 2312. A bill to amend titles 5, 10, and 32, United States Code, to \neliminate inequities in the treatment of National Guard technicians, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I introduce the National Guard \nTechnician Equity Act to address inconsistencies in the dual-status \ntechnician program.\n  Over 48,000 National Guard dual-status technicians serve our nation. \nThey are a distinct group of workers--as civilians, they work for the \nreserve components, performing administrative duties, providing \ntraining, and maintaining and repairing equipment. However, as a \ncondition of their civilian position, they are also required to \nmaintain military status--attending weekend drills and annual training, \ndeploying overseas, and responding to domestic disasters and \nemergencies--thereby creating their ``dual-status.''\n  As a result, dual-status technicians are caught between the \nprovisions that govern the Federal civilian workforce and the military \nin numerous ways. First, under existing law, a dual-status technician \nwho is no longer fit for military duty must be fired from their \ntechnician position, even if they are still fully capable of performing \ntheir civilian duties. This bill would give technicians the option of \nremaining in their civilian position if they have 20 years of service \nas a dual-status technician, so that the experience and skills of these \ndedicated employees will not be lost.\n  Second, dual-status technicians do not have the same appeal rights as \nmost other Federal employees, including those civilians in other \nDepartment of Defense positions. Federal employees who are covered by a \ncollective bargaining agreement have the right to file a grievance and \nproceed to arbitration, or file a case with the Merit Systems \nProtection Board, MSPB. Currently, dual-status technicians may appeal \nto the Adjutant General in their state, but not to any neutral third \nparty. This bill would allow them to also appeal to the MSPB for \ngrievances unrelated to their military service.\n  Third, most reserve component members are able to obtain health care \ncoverage through the TRICARE Reserve Select program. However, dual-\nstatus technicians are ineligible, despite their mandatory military \nstatus and reserve service, because they can participate in the Federal \nEmployees Health Benefit Program, FEHBP. FEHBP plans can be more \nexpensive than TRICARE Reserve Select, thereby adding costs and \nlimiting health care options for these Guard technicians. My \nlegislation simply calls for the Government Accountability Office to \nstudy the feasibility of converting the coverage for National Guard \ndual-status technicians from FEHBP to TRICARE Reserve Select.\n  The National Guard Technician Equity Act also allows technicians to \nreceive overtime pay and requires the Secretary of Defense to report to \nCongress on the adequacy of leave time provided to Federal employees \nwho are members of the National Guard for required military training.\n  I urge my colleagues to support and cosponsor the National Guard \nTechnician Equity Act, and join me in pressing for inclusion of \nprovisions of this bill in the National Defense Authorization Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/08/senate-section/article/S2878-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 440--RECOGNIZING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF TEACHERS TO THE \n     CIVIC, CULTURAL, AND ECONOMIC WELL-BEING OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. BEGICH (for himself, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Johnson of South Dakota, Ms. \nStabenow, Mr. Warner, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Coons, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Brown, \nand Mr. Cardin) submitted the following resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.
