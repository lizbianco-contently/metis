Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 384, S. \n2363, the Hagan sportsmen's legislation.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 384, S. 2363, a bill to \n     protect and enhance opportunities for recreational hunting, \n     fishing, and shooting, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, following my remarks and those of the \nRepublican leader, the Senate will be in a period of morning business \nuntil noon, with the time equally divided and controlled between the \ntwo leaders or their designees. The Republicans will control the first \n30 minutes and the majority will control the next 30 minutes.\n  At noon the Senate will proceed to the consideration of H.R. 803, the \nWorkforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. At 2:30 p.m. there will be \nthree rollcall votes on amendments and passage of the bill.\n\n\n                Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act\n\n  Mr. President, this afternoon the Senate will consider and pass the \nbipartisan Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. While the \nunemployment rate has steadily declined since the recession and more \nthan 9 million private sector jobs have been created, too many \nAmericans are still unemployed or lack the tools necessary to compete \nfor today's jobs. That is why this legislation, which updates and \nstreamlines our Nation's job training and local workforce development \nprograms, is so vital.\n  This legislation is very complicated, very complex, and it is vital. \nIt proves the mere fact that even though this legislation is \ncomplicated, complex, and vital, we can pass it. This act will help \nimprove training and educational opportunities for those Americans \nlooking for a job or to advance their careers. It will also help \nbusinesses grow and strengthen local economies across the whole \ncountry. In Nevada tens of thousands have benefited from the job \ntraining placement and educational programs funded by the Workforce \nInnovation and Opportunity Act. Many found their first job while others \nwere able to reenter the workforce, and still others took advantage of \nthe programs to improve their skills. For all of them it meant a \npaycheck, and for some of them it meant a raise to support their \nfamilies. This legislation is also an example of how the Senate can and \nshould function.\n  I repeat, this legislation is not a walk in the park. It is extremely \ncomplicated. It shows how Congress can operate when both sides are \nwilling to compromise and work in good faith to craft legislation that \nwill help improve the lives of Americans.\n  It has not been easy. This program was last authorized in 1998. Think \nof how much the world has changed over the last 16 years. Look at the \nInternet. It has transformed training and education programs and even \nthe way most Americans look for work.\n  Over the past 16 years there have been several attempts to \nreauthorize this legislation, and they have all fallen short. After 16 \nyears of attempts, it is even more impressive that Chairman Harkin, \nSenators Murray, Alexander,\n\n[[Page S3950]]\n\nand Isakson, along with their counterparts in the House, were able to \nforge a bicameral, bipartisan agreement. Congratulations to each of \nthese Senators and the House Members who worked with them. They worked \nin a bipartisan, bicameral way, which resulted in successful \nlegislation.\n  In basketball they say if you are not doing well, you just have a lot \nof off days and that the best way for a shooter to get his rhythm back \nis to sink a couple of baskets. I hope this theory proves true in the \nSenate. It is time we sank a couple of baskets. It is time for us to \nstart working together so we can get things done. Hopefully, by \nwitnessing the success of a good bipartisan bill such as this, the \nSenate will get its rhythm back.\n\n\n            Unanimous Consent Agreement--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the \ndisposition of H.R. 803, which is the Workforce Innovation and \nOpportunity Act, the Senate proceed to executive session to consider \nCalendar Nos. 499, 501, and 787; and that the Senate proceed to vote on \nthe confirmation of the nominations in the order listed; further, if \nany nomination is confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered \nmade and laid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate, and \nthat no further motions be in order to the nominations; that any \nstatements related to the nominations be printed in the Record and that \nPresident Obama be immediately notified of the Senate's action and the \nSenate resume legislative session.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Keystone Pipeline\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Influence--it is a word we hear a lot these days, \nespecially from our friends on the other side who suddenly feel the \nneed to convince their constituents that they are ``moderate'' \nDemocrats, despite the voting records that say just the opposite. These \nSenate Democrats can't stop boasting about how much supposed influence \nthey have on energy issues, but it is a baffling claim to the rest of \nus because it is so hard to point to what they have actually \naccomplished.\n  Take the Keystone Pipeline. The Senate Democrats I am referring to \nclaim to have so much influence within their party to get it approved, \nbut the evidence actually leads to the opposite conclusion; that they \nhave almost none at all. When it comes right down to it, they have not \neven been able to secure a serious, gimmick-free floor vote from the \nmajority leader to approve the Keystone Pipeline. That should be the \nbare minimum.\n  The events that transpired yesterday only underscore the point. \nYesterday afternoon several of my Republican colleagues again tried to \npass the Keystone Pipeline. Once again, the Democratic leadership \nblocked the bill, and the so-called moderate Democrats simply stood by \nwhile their own party blocked this important job-creation legislation. \nThey didn't even put up a credible fight.\n  It is disappointing, but it is no surprise because Washington \nDemocrats have blocked approval of this shovel-ready, job-creation \nproject for years now, even though it would create thousands of well-\npaying American jobs, even though it would help our struggling economy, \neven though it would increase North American energy independence, and \neven though the Obama administration has admitted that constructing the \npipeline would have almost zero significant impact on the environment.\n  In other words, the Senate Democratic leadership is obstructing \nconstruction of the Keystone Pipeline for one main reason--to please \ntheir patrons on the far left. Let's be clear about something. The only \nreason they are able to get away with it is because so-called moderate \nDemocrats let them, the same so-called moderates who claim to have so \nmuch influence around here.\n  The bottom line is these so-called moderates can't have it both ways. \nThey can't credibly claim to have influence on issues such as these, \neven as they let their party leaders shoot down almost every effort to \nachieve the things they claim to want, such as Keystone.\n  Frankly, it is hard to see how we could ever hope to get a Keystone \nbill over to the President's desk and signed into law while Democrats \nrun the Senate, especially when the so-called moderates stand idly by \nas the President has yet another meeting with the anti-Keystone jobs \nlobby tonight. The President is meeting with an anti-Keystone \nfundraiser today and will be hearing from an organization with a \nmission to stop these important jobs. He needs to hear from Americans \nacross the country who are desperate for work in the Obama economy. \nPreaching to the choir is not going to get that done.\n  Ironically enough, the President will be meeting with these same \nanti-Keystone interests right after holding a pep rally with Senate \nDemocrats--his reliable anti-Keystone backstop in Congress.\n  I think it is time to put aside the charade. The American people have \nalready had to suffer through more than 5 years of delay and \nobfuscation on this pipeline. The bureaucrats and the experts have \nstudied it to death over and over and over, and every time we learn \nbasically the very same thing: There is a ton of upside to building \nKeystone and minimal substantive downside.\n  It is time to end all the politically motivated delays and get \nserious around here. It is time for Democrats who claim to support \nthese important jobs to stand up to the party bosses and stand with \ntheir constituents and not just talk about doing it. We owe it to the \nAmerican people to get these Keystone Pipeline jobs approved as soon as \npossible.\n  Unfortunately, it seems increasingly clear that will never happen \nunder the current Democratic-run Senate, but one way or another, we \nneed to get this done.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, in a moment some of my colleagues will come \nto the floor and ask to enter into a colloquy and discuss an issue that \nis important to many of us, especially to those of us who represent \nStates in the West and Midwest.\n  The issue I wish to speak about has to do with something that over \nthe past 5 years the Obama administration has been particularly active \nin pursuing.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will my friend allow me to ask a question \nthrough the Chair?\n  Mr. THUNE. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I was in my office when I heard the statement by the \nRepublican leader about Keystone. I direct this question to the Senator \nfrom South Dakota, who is a fine Senator and understands energy issues.\n  We agreed to have a vote on Keystone. My friend, the Republican \nleader, keeps misdirecting the matter. We can have a vote on Keystone. \nThat was part of the deal we made. We had a bipartisan bill, Portman-\nShaheen. They worked on that bill for months, since last fall. They put \nin amendments that people wanted.\n  Jeanne Shaheen came here yesterday and said: Let's have a vote on \nKeystone, but just as long as we can have a vote on energy efficiency. \nShe even suggested we could have a vote using the McConnell rule--a 60-\nvote threshold--on both of them.\n  This is so transparent that my friend the Republican leader is doing \nthe bidding again of the Koch brothers, who own the first or second \nlargest tar\n\n[[Page S3951]]\n\nsands holding which exists in the world.\n  I say to my friend from South Dakota: Why can't we just have a vote \non both of those--energy efficiency and on Keystone?\n  Mr. THUNE. I say through the Chair to the majority leader, the offer, \nas I understand it, that was put forward by the majority leader with \nrespect to the energy efficiency bill was that this bill would be \npassed with no amendments. There would be no debate, no amendments, and \nthen somewhere down the road we might get the vote on the Keystone \nPipeline. Well, it strikes me at least, as many of my colleagues on \nthis side have been pointing out now for some time, that the way in \nwhich the majority leader is running the floor and calling up \nlegislation, preventing amendments to be offered, to be debated and \nvoted on, denies the rights not only of us as Senators but ignores the \nvoices of the people we represent.\n\n  So for the majority leader to say we will pass this bill without any \namendment--energy is an important issue in many of our States. It is \nimportant in my State of South Dakota. It is important to a lot of \nMembers on our side and I would suggest to a lot of Members on the \nleader's side who would like to have an opportunity to debate some \namendments on energy if we are going to have an energy bill on the \nfloor. The leaders came down and said no amendments, no debate, you \npass this. We will jam this bill down without amendment, and then \nsometime we will get to the vote on Keystone.\n  We would love to get a vote on Keystone. The leader can call that up \nat any time. We have been saying for some time we ought to have a vote \non Keystone. There is broad bipartisan support for it in the Senate. \nThere are a lot of Democrats who support the Keystone Pipeline. But \nwhat the leader is suggesting again is he is going to put a bill up, \nfill the amendment tree, and prevent Republicans from offering \namendments. We don't think that is the way the Senate ought to operate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend from South Dakota, it is \nso transparent what is going on here. They are hung up on procedure. If \nthis Keystone vote is so important to them, let's have a vote on it. \nThat is what I was told when we brought up, for the second time, the \nenergy efficiency bill. In fact, I was told by our Republican leader \nwho was pushing that bill to go ahead and fill the tree; we have \nalready worked out all the amendments. The bill is different when we \nfirst brought it; we put all the amendments in it.\n  So, again, we get right where we need to be to pass substantive \nlegislation and here they come. The Republicans walk in here dealing \nwith procedure. If this Keystone is such a big deal, let's vote on it. \nLet's vote on energy efficiency which is a bipartisan bill. But, no, \nthey can't do that. They can't do that because we wouldn't be able to \noffer more amendments.\n  Now, remember, the Republicans, who were part of that arrangement on \nthe energy efficiency bill, Shaheen-Portman, thought it was a good \nbill. But again, I repeat, if this is such a big deal to the \nRepublicans, why do they get hung up on procedure? Let's vote on both \nof them. Let the cards fall where they may.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I would say to the distinguished majority \nleader that we on this side believe that when we bring an energy bill \nto the floor to talk about energy, we ought to talk about energy. Now, \nhe may suggest there were certain things incorporated in the bill that \nsome of his Members wanted, maybe even perhaps some of our Members \nwanted, but we have a lot of Members on this side who have been shut \nout, who haven't had an opportunity to offer amendments now for the \npast year. We can come to the floor every day and talk about the fact \nthat since July of last year there have only been votes on 9 Republican \namendments and 7 Democratic amendments, out of 1,500 that have been \nfiled. This is insanity.\n  We would love to get a vote on the Keystone Pipeline, but we also \nthink there are a lot of other energy issues that are important to this \ncountry, and if we bring an energy bill to the floor of the Senate, the \nhistorical practice in this institution has been that it is open to \namendments. All Members get an opportunity to offer amendments. There \nare issues in addition to the Keystone Pipeline that are critically \nimportant to jobs and to the economy and to the energy security in this \ncountry. So the way the leader has suggested that this ought to work \nisn't simply about an argument on procedure. This is about whether the \nSenate is going to function in a way where the views of the millions of \npeople we represent--those of us here would love to offer amendments on \nthese bills and are being prevented from doing it.\n  So I would simply say to the leader that this is not simply about the \nKeystone Pipeline. This is about the broader debate on energy--what it \nmeans for jobs, what it means for our economy. We are in a place now \nwhere we are not even getting votes in committee. Appropriations bills \nare being pulled back at the committee level because Democratic Members \ndon't want to vote on amendments that Republican Members might offer. \nThat is not the way this place is supposed to work.\n  So I appreciate the majority leader's understandable frustration, but \nit is a frustration that is grounded in the way he is running this \ninstitution, not in anything our side is doing.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, no one needs to take my word for it. Take \nthe word of one of the most senior Republicans in this body, the senior \nSenator from Tennessee. He came to the floor a few days ago and said--\non the appropriations bills we hear this plaintive plea: Let's have \nsome votes. So the Senator from Tennessee said: Why don't we have the \nvotes? What has been established around here is that we have 60 votes \non anything that is controversial and 50 votes on everything else, and \nthat is what the Senator from Tennessee said. Let's just go ahead and \nwork through the bills.\n  There is no better example of that than Dodd-Frank, a bill that the \nRepublicans hate. It passed. On the 24th amendment that we voted on, on \nthat bill, Senator Durbin offered an amendment on swipe fees, and he \nwas told it was going to be 60 votes. Everything else had been 50. So \nhe had to do his with 60 votes. That is how things work here.\n  The Republicans don't want to have votes. They want to have issues on \nprocedure. We could finish every one of those appropriations bills--\nevery one of them--if we followed what Lamar Alexander suggested and \nwhat we Democrats have suggested.\n  So it is interesting. It is interesting. Energy issues--it is just a \nbuzzword for ``let's take care of the oil companies some more.'' That \nis what this is all about. They want to protect big oil. Now, if they \nwant to have all the appropriations bills pass, let's pass them. All we \nhave to do is follow what I have suggested and what Senator Lamar \nAlexander has suggested. That is what we should do.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would simply offer a consent \nagreement that the majority leader objected to when he pulled the \nShaheen bill a while back. It was pretty simple and pretty easily \nunderstood. This is the consent that was offered when the majority \nleader, as I said, pulled the Shaheen-Portman bill a while back. This \nis what I said:\n\n       I propose a different unanimous consent agreement. I ask \n     unanimous consent that the only amendments in order be five \n     amendments from the Republican side related to energy policy \n     with a 60-vote threshold on adoption of each amendment. I \n     further ask that following the disposition of those \n     amendments, the bill be read a third time, and the Senate \n     proceed to vote on the passage of the bill, as amended, if \n     amended.\n\n  Now, that gives the majority leader what he was asking for on the \nlast bill: 60-vote thresholds. It gives him amendments from our side \nrelated to energy policy, and it would have led to a vote on Keystone.\n\n  So I would propound that unanimous consent requestagain. It sounds to \nme as though we may be getting somewhere if the majority leader really \nwants to give us a chance to have a Keystone vote here on the Senate \nfloor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object to my friend's \nsuggestion, I would ask that it be modified to have a vote on Keystone \nand have a vote on Shaheen-Portman--60-vote threshold, of course.\n\n[[Page S3952]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Will the Republican leader modify \nhis request?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object, we didn't get \namendments on Shaheen-Portman. So what the majority leader is now \nsaying is he wants to pass a kind of comprehensive energy bill dealing \nwith a variety of different subjects without any amendments at all as a \ncondition for having a vote on Keystone with five amendments related to \nthe subject.\n  I can remember when we used to vote around here. In fact, his Members \nhave only had seven rollcall votes in a year. He has one Member from \nAlaska who has never had a rollcall vote on the floor his entire Senate \ncareer.\n  So I think rather than these UCs going back and forth, maybe we ought \nto talk about how to work this out and see if maybe the Senate could \nactually start voting on things again. I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to the original \nrequest?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, let's not have revisionist history. Let's \nhave real, valid history.\n  Shaheen-Portman was worked on for weeks last fall. Shaheen and \nPortman worked on this new version of the bill for months, and they \nworked out many amendments in the committee. They came to me and said \nthey have all this worked out--Shaheen and Portman and a number of \nother Senators. I said: Great.\n  So before one of our recesses, the day we were getting ready to \nleave, they came to me and said: What we need to know and what would be \neven better is if we had a sense-of-the-Senate resolution on Keystone.\n  I said: We already agreed to what we are going to do. The bill is \ndifferent with all of this input, such as the Workforce Investment Act, \nwhich we will take up this afternoon. So I came back and said: OK, we \nwill have a sense-of-the-Senate; that is fine. And we are going to do \nthis as soon as we get back.\n  We came back and then I was told: Well, we don't want a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution; we want an up-or-down vote here.\n  I said: OK, let's do it. And that is when that still wasn't good \nenough. That still wasn't good enough because they want the issue.\n  The energy efficiency bill is a good bipartisan bill. It is like the \none we are going to work on this afternoon. It is a complex bill, but \nthe differences have been worked out, and we should go ahead and vote \non it.\n  So if they really care about Keystone--if this is such a big deal--\nthe Republican leader said we have been working on this for 5 years. \nThe time has come. Let's belly up to the bar where we vote, and let's \nvote on it. But in the process, let's also do the bipartisan energy \nefficiency legislation that Jeanne Shaheen has put her heart into.\n  So that is where we are: another obstruction, diversion to keep us \nfrom really voting on things. They want the issue. They are focused on \nprocedure. And what the American people want is for us to do things. \nThey want the minimum wage raised. They want unemployment benefits \nextended for the long-term unemployed. They would like it so that a man \nworking doesn't make more money than a woman who does the same work. \nThe American people believe they should not be burdened with college \ndebt which is larger than any other debt. It is $1.3 trillion now. They \nhave stopped us from doing that based on procedure. Why don't we work \non things that will help the American people?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the exchange between the \nmajority leader and myself come out of our leader time in order not to \ntake further time of the Members.\n  Mr. REID. I agree to that. That is fine.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/25/senate-section/article/S3952-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3952-S3955]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EPA OVERREGULATION\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, as I mentioned previously, my colleagues \nand I intend to enter into a colloquy on the floor of the Senate to \ntalk about an issue that is important to many of our States. The \nSenator from Wyoming, the Senator from North Dakota, and the Senator \nfrom Kansas are all very much impacted, as are our constituents, by the \nEPA's pursuing and being particularly active in issuing misguided and \nill-conceived proposals that will do little more than overregulate and \nburden hard-working Americans, businesses, and families. One of the \nworst of these overreaches is the Obama EPA's proposal to significantly \nexpand its authority to regulate small wetlands, creeks, stock ponds, \nand ditches under the Clean Water Act.\n  If the EPA's proposal goes through, the Federal Government could \nexpand its regulatory authority from navigable waters such as lakes and \nrivers to the ditches on your grandfather's property or the dry creek \nbed behind your house. That is what we are talking about. This could \nlead to untold compliance costs and bureaucratic wrangling for ordinary \nfamilies and literally cripple farmers and businesses.\n  The EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers proposed Clean Water Act \njurisdictional rule seeks to redefine ``waters of the United States'' \nwhich would effectively eliminate the Clean Water Act's ``navigable \nwaters'' provision. Congress specifically referenced ``navigable \nwaters'' in the Clean Water Act to guarantee limits to Federal \nauthority.\n  Bodies of water currently deemed ``waters of the United States'' are \nsubject to multiple regulatory requirements under the Clean Water Act, \nincluding permitting and reporting, enforcement, mitigation, and \ncitizen suits. Despite strong bipartisan opposition in Congress, the \nEPA and the Corps have relentlessly pursued an expansion of the \ndefinition of ``waters of the United States.''\n\n       Additionally, the EPA is pressing forward despite two \n     recent Supreme Court cases that expressly rejected the \n     Agency's broad assertions of regulatory authority and made it \n     clear that not all bodies of water are subject to Federal \n     jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act.\n\n  -If the EPA's power grab is left unchecked, few bodies of water will \nbe able to escape the regulatory reach of the Obama EPA.\n  This proposed new definition could apply to a countless number of \nsmall wetlands and creeks that are typically regulated at the State \nlevel. More specifically, the proposed rule extends the reach of \nFederal regulatory authority by adding ``interstate wetlands'' and all \n``adjacent waters'' to the definition of ``Waters of the United \nStates.''\n  It also deems all tributaries to be categorically jurisdictional, and \nfor the first time ever ditches--ditches--are defined as jurisdictional \ntributaries. This is cause for concern. This should be disturbing and \ntroubling to all Americans--subjecting roadside, irrigation, and storm \nwater ditches to regulation under the Clean Water Act, which would have \npractical consequences not fully evaluated by the EPA.\n  These bodies of water are hardly navigable and are, in many cases, \nseasonal or sporadic depending on the weather. The proposal also states \nthat the EPA could regulate water on a case-by-case basis--dangerous \ndevelopment for a regulatory agency. The American public is right to be \nwary of the EPA granting itself such discretion. A case-by-case \napproach is confusing and will inevitably lead to even more litigation.\n  This proposal exceeds the established authority of the EPA by \ninfringing upon what has long been a State responsibility under the \nClean Water Act. All States--my State of South Dakota, Senator Roberts' \nState of Kansas, Senator Hoeven's State of North Dakota--have an \ninherent interest in providing for the well-being of their citizens and \nbusinesses and ensuring safe and enduring water resources that play a \nlarge role in achieving that end.\n  My home State of South Dakota's No. 1 industry is agriculture. We \nhelp to feed the world. This cannot be done without clean and \ndependable sources of water for our farmers and ranchers. This \nexpansion of the EPA's regulatory authority would have significant \neconomic impact for property owners who would likely be hit with new \nFederal\n\n[[Page S3953]]\n\npermits, compliance costs, and threats of significant fines.\n  Agriculture is a time-sensitive business, and the burdens this \nproposal would place on South Dakota farmers would strain the ability \nof producers to fertilize, to plant, and to irrigate when the seasons \nand weather conditions dictate. Rather, permits and regulations would \nbind the ability of producers to get their crops in when they need to \nand limit what they could do to ensure successful yields.\n  Tourism is also a vital industry in my State of South Dakota. The \nBlack Hills, which are home to Mount Rushmore, draw nearly 3 million \nvisitors each year. The rugged beauty of the Black Hills depends upon \nthe responsible water management of the State and county governments. \nAccording to a letter I just received from the Pennington County Board \nof Commissioners, which includes much of the Black Hills, their ability \nto manage the water resources in the Black Hills area is greatly \nthreatened by the EPA's proposed rule.\n  Similarly, South Dakota's thriving hunting industry is sustained in \npart by practical and responsible water management, allowing ducks and \npheasants to thrive in prairie potholes and creeks. These are connected \nto waters already responsibly managed by the State of South Dakota. \nAnother layer of Federal regulation will only add needless costs to \nprotecting these waters.\n  Additionally, cities in my State are already struggling to grow under \nnew taxes and regulations imposed by the Obama administration. The \nEPA's latest overreach would provide environmental groups with yet \nanother powerful tool to delay and prevent development and interfere \nwith land use activities on property owned by homeowners, small \nbusinesses, and municipalities.\n  I have heard from South Dakotans in nearly every industry, and the \ncommon consensus is this: This rule is bad for business--certainly in \nplaces such as South Dakota and Kansas and North Dakota and Wyoming \nbut, I would argue, all across this country.\n  So I am proud to stand with my colleagues on the floor today in \nsupport of legislation that would stop the EPA's proposed Clean Water \nAct jurisdictional rule and protect farmers, ranchers, and homeowners \nacross the country from the latest regulatory overreach by the Obama \nadministration.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from North Dakota, I think, will carry on \nwith the colloquy between our colleagues from the Midwestern part of \nthe country and speak to the impacts of this ill-proposed rule on the \npeople they represent in their respective States.\n  I yield for the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator form North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we be allowed \nuntil 10:28 a.m. for the purposes of the colloquy.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be here this morning with \nthe distinguished Senator from South Dakota, as well as the esteemed \nSenators from both Kansas and Wyoming, to talk about this regulation \nthat is clearly an overreach by the EPA. It needs to be addressed. We \nhave measures to address it.\n  As the Senator from South Dakota said so well, this is a regulation \nthat is a huge problem for our farmers and ranchers, but really, as he \nsaid, we have been hearing from almost every industry sector that this \nis a big-time problem that needs to be addressed, and needs to be \naddressed now.\n  So, as I said, we have legislation both in committee--I have \nlegislation in the Appropriations Committee, in the Energy and Water \nSubcommittee, that would address it--and the good Senator from Wyoming \nhas legislation that he has filed, and he is requesting a floor vote.\n  But in both cases, whether it is in committee or here on the floor, \nwhat we are saying is give us a chance to vote on this issue. This is \nan important issue for the American people and Senators need to \nindicate where they stand. I do not know why everybody should not be \nproud to do that--to vote on this regulatory overreach and to address \nthis challenge for the American people. It is a very straightforward \nissue.\n\n  That is what we are here to discuss and debate this morning, and we \nsincerely hope, as we continue to highlight this very important \nproblem, the leadership of this body is going to step up on behalf of \nthe American people and allow--allow--the Senate to address it through \nits rightful duty, which is to vote on issues important to the American \npeople.\n  To continue this important dialog, I turn to the Senator from Kansas \nand ask for his comments on behalf of his constituents in his State in \nterms of what he is hearing and the problems this waters of the U.S. \nproposed regulation put forward by the EPA creates in the great State \nof Kansas.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator for \nyielding. I thank Senator Hoeven for his leadership on this issue and \nfor bringing this issue to the attention of all Members, more \nespecially those of us in our conference, but this should be a \nbipartisan effort.\n  I rise today to join my colleagues in discussing yet another--yet \nanother--job-stifling and unjustified regulation proposed by this \nadministration.\n  The EPA, the Army Corps of Engineers, and the Department of \nAgriculture--what? the three horsemen of the regulatory apocalypse--\nhave proposed a rule that after careful review and study we believe \nwould allow the EPA to further expand its control of private property--\ncontrol of private property--under the guise of the Clean Water Act.\n  They claim that the proposed ``Waters of the United States'' rule \n``simply clarifies their scope of jurisdiction.'' Well, here is the \ncatch: The ``clarification'' is from categorically classifying so-\ncalled ``other waters'' as regulated, even if the water cannot be \nnavigated and was previously outside of their authority.\n  This proposal is another example of why many Kansans, many farmers \nand ranchers from Wyoming, South Dakota, North Dakota, feel their way \nof life is under attack by the Federal Government's overreach and \noverregulation.\n  To date, the Kansas associations of grain and feed, agribusiness \nretailers, ethanol producers, soybeans, wheat growers, pork producers, \nlivestock, watersheds, golf course superintendents, and the Kansas \nCooperative Council all have opposed this rule. Similar organizations \nin Wyoming and North Dakota and South Dakota and all across farm \ncountry have also been in contact with their Senators. These \norganizations and their members fear the EPA will use this rule to \nfurther regulate farmers and ranchers, as well as other normal land \nuses, such as building homes.\n  If finalized, this rule could have the EPA requiring a permit for \nordinary fieldwork or for the construction of a fence or for even \nplanting crops near certain waters.\n  Kansans are justifiably worried that the permits would be time-\nconsuming, costly, and that the EPA could ultimately deny the permits, \neven for longstanding and normal practices--even practices that help \nthe environment.\n  A friend of mine, Kansas farmer Jim Sipes--he is out there in Manter, \nKS; that is way out there; that is way out there by the Colorado \nborder; he still has not gotten much rain after 3 years--he explains \nhis view and said: ``The only thing that is clear and certain is that, \nunder this rule, it will be more difficult to farm and ranch, or make \nchanges to the land--even if those changes would benefit the \nenvironment.'' He knows what he is talking about.\n  For the folks back home, the issue of the EPA trying to control more \nwater, whether it is actually ``navigable,'' is not new. We have had \nthis before. We have been down a similar road before with the agency \nwanting to regulate all of the water in the country, even small farm \nponds, I would tell my colleagues, that no self-respecting duck would \never land on.\n  Now, I think maybe there is a file, I say to Senator Hoeven--I think \nthere is a file down there in the basement of the EPA. It must be a big \none: rural fugitive dust; the navigable waters situation; endangered \nspecies, so there is the taking of farmers' ground to force\n\n[[Page S3954]]\n\nthem to plant native prairie grass to save the lesser prairie chicken, \nwhich we cannot even find; and on and on and on and on. I think it must \nbe labeled: What Drives Farmers and Ranchers Crazy. And about every \nsecond foggy night, why, somebody pulls open that file and we go \nthrough the whole thing again. It is not as though we have not done \nthis before on this issue.\n  After personally calling on the EPA and Army Corps to withdraw the \nproposed rule, I want to make sure the expansion of regulatory \njurisdiction over ``Waters of the United States''--let's shelve it for \ngood. Let's shelve it for good.\n  Last week I joined the distinguished Senator from Wyoming Mr. \nBarrasso and the majority of our caucus in introducing straightforward \nlegislation that prohibits the Administrator of the EPA and the \nSecretary of the Army--the Secretary of the Army, for goodness sakes--\nfrom finalizing the rule or trying a similar regulation in the future. \nPut the file back. Just file it away. Maybe put it somewhere where the \nhard drive is that Lois Lerner lost.\n  We will continue working here in the Senate, as well as the House, to \neither convince the administration to back off of this proposal or, if \nnecessary, to block the agencies from moving forward. We have stopped \nthis type of foolishness before, and I expect we will be successful \nagain.\n  I thank my colleagues for their arduous efforts.\n  I say to Senator Hoeven, thank you for leading this effort.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I would like to thank, again, the Senator \nfrom Kansas. He is somebody who has been involved in agriculture for--\nwell, he is still a very young man--he is somebody who has been \ninvolved in agriculture for a long time and certainly understands what \ngoes into farming.\n  Think about it. Farmers and ranchers work the land, but that is also \ntheir home. Who knows the land better? Who knows the streams and the \npotholes and the ditches and the roads, who knows their land better \nthan a farmer or a rancher? And who is more concerned about it? Really. \nWho is more concerned about it? That farmer or somebody who works at \nthe EPA here in Washington, DC? That is important to think about as we \nlook at this kind of regulatory overreach that goes to the very private \nproperty rights that are the foundation of this country.\n  I thank the Senator from Wyoming for his leadership and for the \nlegislation he has put together that he has filed and that we should be \nvoting on right now that I am very pleased to cosponsor.\n  I would ask the Senator from Wyoming for his comments on this issue \nand his legislation.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I would like to thank my friend and \ncolleague, the former Governor of North Dakota, now the Senator from \nNorth Dakota, who knows these issues very well. And I would like to \nthank the Senator from Kansas, who talked about the administration's \noverreach and overregulations and the impact it has on the economy of \nthe United States.\n  There is very disturbing news out this morning reported by Reuters. \nThe headline: ``Bad to worse: US economy shrank more than expected in \nQ1 [of this year].'' U.S. economy shrank more than expected in Q1 of \nthis year.\n\n  The U.S. economy contracted, not grew, not stayed the same but \ncontracted at a much steeper pace than previously estimated in the \nfirst quarter. The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that gross \ndomestic product fell at a 2.9-percent annual rate, the economy's worst \nperformance in 5 years--worst performance in 5 years.\n  It is because of the overreach, the overregulation that is coming out \nof this administration. That is why I rise in support with my \ncolleagues and my colleagues who have very serious concerns about the \nEPA's proposed Clean Water Act jurisdictional rule.\n  Many if not all of these colleagues recently joined me in introducing \nthe Protecting Water and Property Rights of 2014 Act. In fact, 34 \nSenators have cosponsored this bill. More continue to join the \nimportant effort. They have joined this effort because this important \nand consequential legislation restricts the expansion of Federal \nauthority by this EPA, which the EPA is trying to use to encompass all \nwet areas of farms, of ranches, suburban homes all across America.\n  More specifically, this bill eliminates the administration's proposed \nrule to implement the expansion of such Federal authority. Through this \nrecently proposed rule, Federal agencies are attempting to expand the \ndefinitions of waters of the United States. They want to include \nditches and other dry areas where water flows only for a short duration \nafter a rainfall, but the government wants to control even that.\n  Federal regulations have never defined ditches and other upland \ndrainage features as waters of the United States, but this proposed \nrule does. It will have a huge impact on farmers, on ranchers, on small \nbusinesses that need to put a shovel in the ground to make a living. \nThe rule amounts to a Federal user fee for farmers and ranchers to use \ntheir own land after it rains.\n  It forces suburban homeowners to pay the EPA and Army Corps to use \ntheir backyards after a storm. Let's be clear what is proposed in this \nrule. It takes money away from family farmers and ranchers who just \nwant to grow crops, raise cattle, and it taxes suburban middle-class \nfamilies who just want to recreate in their own backyard without Uncle \nSam bankrupting them for the privilege.\n  This is the worst thing I think we can do to Americans in this \neconomy, an economy, as I say, that is shrinking--a shrinking economy, \nnot just stagnant, not just sitting there but actually shrinking. That \nis why my legislation is endorsed by the American Farm Bureau, as well \nas the American Land Rights Association. It is because they know how \ndevastating this rule is to farmers, to ranchers, to homeowners, and to \nother small businesses.\n  Despite what this administration may say and has said about providing \n``flexibility''--they use that word--for farmers and ranchers in the \nproposed rule, the farmers and ranchers of America are not deceived. \nThey will not be misled by this administration. According to the June \nedition of the publication National Cattlemen, an article entitled: \n``EPA's Ag Exemptions for WOTUS''--waters of the United States.\n  Let me point out that the National Cattlemen--it is the trusted \nleader and definitive voice of the beef industry, the trusted leader \nand definitive voice of the beef industry, and the official publication \nof the National Cattlemen's Beef Association. What that front page \narticle says is:\n\n       Although agriculture exemptions are briefly included, they \n     do not come close--\n\n  Do not come close--\n\n     to meeting the needs of the cattlemen and women across the \n     country.\n\n  The president of the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, McCan, \nstated in the article:\n\n       For example, wet spots or areas in a pasture that have \n     standing water, under this rule could potentially be \n     affected. We now need permission to travel and move cattle \n     across these types of areas.\n\n  The article lists some other major areas of agriculture not exempted \nby the EPA's proposed rule:\n\n       Activities not covered by the exemptions include \n     introduction of new cultivation techniques, planting \n     different crops, changing crops to pasture, changing pasture \n     to crops, changing cropland to orchards and to vineyards and \n     changing crop land to nurseries.\n\n  Congress never intended the Clean Water Act to be used this way. The \nSenate, under Democratic control, never brought legislation such as the \nClean Water Restoration Act to the floor that would have removed the \nword ``navigable'' from the Clean Water Act. Why? Because they knew it \nwould have been defeated.\n  In fact, 52 bipartisan Members, a bipartisan group, a majority of the \nSenators voted for the Barrasso amendment that rejected the EPA's \nproposed guidance to seize all State waters during the Water Resources \nDevelopment Act. Yet this proposed rule by the administration is \ncircumventing Congress by effectively writing ``navigable'' out of the \nClean Water Act.\n  Just as troubling as ignoring Congressional intent, the proposed rule \ndisregards the fundamental tenet embodied in two decisions of the U.S. \nSupreme Court. Those are decisions that limit Federal jurisdiction. It \nis particularly troubling that the proposed rule allows the Army Corps \nand EPA to\n\n[[Page S3955]]\n\nregulate waters now considered entirely under State jurisdiction.\n  This unprecedented exercise of power will allow the EPA to trump \nStates rights and wipe out the authority of State and local governments \nto meet local land and water use decisions. It is particularly \ntroubling when we have seen no evidence--no evidence at all--that the \nStates are misusing or otherwise failing to meet their \nresponsibilities. Enormous resources will be needed to expand the Clean \nWater Act Federal Regulatory Program.\n  Not only will there be a host of landowners and project proponents \nwho will now be subject to the Clean Water Act's mandates and the cost \nof obtaining permits, but an increase in the number of permits needed \nwill lead to longer delays in actually getting the permits. Increased \ndelays in securing permits will impede a host of economic activities in \n50 States, cost thousands of American jobs.\n  Farming and ranching, commercial and residential real estate \ndevelopment, electric transmission, transportation projects, bridge \nrepairs, energy development, and mining will all be negatively \naffected. This is at a time when the United States has seen our economy \nshrink. The Reuters story today talks about shrinkage much more than \npredicted previously. Regulations such as this continue to damage \nAmerica, damage our country, damage our families, damage our \ncommunities, damage the hard-working men and woman who want to go to \nwork, put food on the table for their kids, raise their families, and \ngo to work, but yet we have an administration that does not seem to \nsee, is blinded by a role of big government. They are blinded from \nseeing the impact these onerous, expensive, burdensome regulations are \nhaving on the American public and certainly on our economy, as pointed \nout today in this news release from Reuters about the shrinking of the \nAmerican economy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming for his \nleadership on this important issue and pick up on a point he just \nexpressed: Why are we not demanding in this body that we vote on \nlegislation to address this proposed regulation?\n  As he said so clearly and eloquently, this is an issue this Congress \nrejected. So now when one of the agencies, the EPA, goes around \nCongress to set up a proposed regulation that does something the \nCongress expressly rejected, why in the world are we not voting? It is \nour responsibility and our right to do so.\n  America's farmers and ranchers and entrepreneurs go to work every day \nto build a stronger nation. Thanks to those hard-working men and women, \nwe live in a country where there is affordable food at the grocery \nstore, where a dynamic private sector offers Americans the opportunity \nto achieve a brighter future. In these difficult economic times, the \nFederal Government should be doing all it can to empower those who grow \nour food and those who create jobs. Yet instead regulators are stifling \ngrowth with burdensome regulations that generate cost and uncertainty.\n  Look at the economic data, as the Senator from Wyoming said, that \ncame out this morning. What are we doing stifling that entrepreneurial \nactivity, that entrepreneurship, that creativity that makes the \nAmerican economy go? This proposed regulation is an example of that. It \ntouches almost every industry.\n  We are talking about our farmers and ranchers, but it goes across all \nindustry sectors. The proposed rule by the Army Corps of Engineers and \nthe Environmental Protection Agency to regulate the waters of the \nUnited States is exactly the type of regulation that is hurting our \neconomy, hurting our entrepreneurs, hurting our farmers, and our \nranchers.\n  The waters of the United States rule greatly expands the scope of the \nClean Water Act, regulations over America's streams and wetlands. If we \ntake a look at a chart I brought, I know it is a little hard to see, \nbut it demonstrates the incredible reach of this proposed regulation.\n  If we look at the chart, we can see it is a real power grab that will \nenable the EPA to stretch its tentacles far into the countryside and \nfar beyond.\n  It is not just our farmers and ranchers and water in a ditch or water \nin a field that is there for maybe 1 week when it rains and the rest of \nthe time it is dry, it affects construction, it affects powerplants, it \naffects stormwater drainage. I cannot think of anything it is not going \nto affect.\n  Is that how our country works now? Instead of the people who are duly \nelected to pass laws for this country, we stand here and we do not get \nto vote on any of these issues we were elected to vote on, and someone \nwho is not elected at the EPA or the Corps, they put regulations in \nplace that affect virtually every single American. Is that how this \nworks now? Is that what it has come to?\n  Because that is exactly what is happening. That is exactly what is \ngoing on. The Supreme Court has found that Federal jurisdiction under \nthe Clean Water Act extends to navigable waters. I do not think anyone \nis arguing about the EPA's ability to regulate the Missouri River or \nother navigable bodies of water--rivers, lakes--but the Supreme Court \nalso made clear that not all bodies of water are under the EPA's \njurisdiction.\n  So under a significant nexus determination, the EPA has decided: We \ndo not care what the Supreme Court said. We are going to make sure they \nare all under our jurisdiction, not pursuant to any law. We are going \nto put a regulation in place that enables us to do whatever we want \nwith any body of water, not just navigable bodies of water.\n  Again, that is what I have tried to show on this chart. Ephemeral \nstreams, tributaries, all waters deemed adjacent to any navigable body, \nincluding dry ditches, including water in fields that may be there for \na short period of time, runoff from storm sewers, you name it.\n  That is not the intent of the law. That is not the intent of the \nSupreme Court ruling. That is why it is so important that we address \nit. That is what we propose to do. In the legislation we put forward, \nboth on the floor, in the bill filed by the Senator from Wyoming, the \nlegislation I have offered in Energy and Water, we straightforwardly, \nwe simply and straightforwardly address this regulation.\n  How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I would have no objection as long as equal \ntime is added to the block that follows for the Democrats.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, that is our point. We understand that \npeople bring different points of view to this deliberative body, but \nthe point is this: This is an important issue that affects virtually \nall Americans, that affects our economy, that affects our farmers, our \nranchers, our businesses, the energy sector. You name it.\n  When we have something of this importance, we have an absolute \nresponsibility to the people of this country to show where we stand on \nthe issue, meaning we have a responsibility to vote on this and the \nother important issues before this body. That is what we are asking \nfor.\n  We are saying everybody has a right to bring their point of view and \ntheir opinion, but we all have a right and a responsibility to vote on \nthese important issues. That is what we are asking for, a vote on this \nimportant issue for the benefit of the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, it is our understanding that Democrats \ncontrol the next 32 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Democrats control the next 30 \nminutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/25/senate-section/article/S3955-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3955-S3956]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. CARDIN.

I was listening to my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle talk about the proposed rule for the waters of the United States, \nand I am somewhat curious as to where they get a lot of their \ninformation because if they read the proposed rule--and I point out \nthat this is a proposed rule--it specifically excludes from waters of \nthe United States certain ditches, wastewater treatment plants, ponds, \net cetera. I am going to get into the specifics. But if you listen to \ntheir points on the floor, you would think all ditches are covered \nunder the proposed rule--which is now subject to comment--and that is \nnot the case.\n  I would urge those who are interested to please read the proposed \nrule and determine for yourself the fact that it does not include many \nof the examples given by the opponents in clarifying the waters of the \nUnited States.\n  Last week I had a roundtable discussion with a group of scientists \nand concerned citizens dealing with the progress we have made in the \nChesapeake Bay. The Chesapeake Bay is critically important--not to just \nthose who live in the watershed; it is the largest estuary in our \nhemisphere. There is more coastline on the Chesapeake Bay than on the \nentire west coast of the United States. It is a national treasure and \nhas been declared that by many Presidents. It is iconic to Maryland and \nsupports a diversity of aquatic life which is important to our lives \nand to our economy. Mr. President, $1 trillion of our economy is based \non the Chesapeake Bay.\n  Starting in the 1980s, we recognized that we had a responsibility to \ndo what we could to preserve and clean up the quality of the water \nwithin the Chesapeake Bay. Starting with Maryland, Pennsylvania, \nVirginia, and now expanding to Delaware, West Virginia, New York, the \nDistrict of Columbia, and the Federal Government, we have a Chesapeake \nBay agreement. The most recent, the fourth one, was recently signed. It \nrecognizes that we have a real challenge to deal with the quality of \nthe water in the bay.\n  We have asked our farmers to do more, and we have provided help to \nthem in the farm bill for conservation practices. We have asked \ndevelopers to do more by preserving more pervious surfaces and dealing \nwith the loss of acreage of forest land. We have asked local \ngovernments to do more as far as dealing with wastewater treatment \nfacility commitments. We have had a partnership between the government \nand private sectors. All stakeholders are involved because we believe \nwe all have responsibilities. We are not asking one segment to do it \nalone. All of us are working together.\n  But, quite frankly, the regulation of the waters of the United States \ndirectly affects the success we are going to have in cleaning the \nChesapeake Bay. So the issue we are talking about with the waters of \nthe United States and clarifying that has a direct impact.\n  I might also tell you that climate change has a direct impact. Those \nof us who live in the watershed area, yes, we can do our responsibility \nfor reducing our carbon footprint, but we need to get our country \nengaged in reducing our carbon footprint. We need to do that for many \nreasons--we need to do that for public health; we need to do that for \nnational security.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that the Naval Academy, the Aberdeen \nProving Ground, Pax River--all critically important to our national \ndefense--are located on our coasts in Maryland and are subjected now to \nmore flooding as a result of sea level increases which, in part, are \nthe result of our activities with climate change. All we ask is that we \nfollow the science.\n  Le me talk for a moment about waters of the United States because I \nheard what my colleague said. I have to take us back to 2001 when the \nSupreme Court issued two decisions concerning the navigable waters and \nthe waters of the United States and added confusion. What this \nadministration is trying to do, what we are trying to do is restore the \nauthority that we all thought was in the law before the two Supreme \nCourt decisions. That is all we are doing--trying to go back to what \neveryone understood were the regulations of the waters of the United \nStates because the freshwater supply coming into the Chesapeake Bay is \ncritically important to the health of the Chesapeake Bay. So if water \ngoes into the streams, it goes into the bay, and that is of concern to \nus, and that needs to be regulated under the Clean Water Act.\n  I will quote from the preamble of the proposed regulation that has \nbeen submitted. The preamble says:\n\n       The SWANCC and Rapanos decisions resulted in the agencies \n     evaluating the jurisdiction of waters on a case-specific \n     basis far more frequently than is best for clear and \n     efficient implementation of the CWA. This approach results in \n     confusion and uncertainty to the regulated public and results \n     in significant resources being allocated to these \n     determinations by federal and state regulators.\n\n  That is why we had this proposed rule--to clarify the law that gives \ncertainty. How many times have I heard from my constituents: Let us \nknow what the rules are so that we can do our business. That is exactly \nwhat this proposed rule is all about.\n  The National Farmers Union issued this statement:\n\n       NFU has long advocated for increased certainty surrounding \n     Clean Water Act requirements for family farmers and ranchers \n     in the wake of complicating Supreme Court decisions. Today's \n     draft rule clarifies Clean Water Act jurisdiction, maintains \n     existing agricultural exemptions and adds new exemptions, and \n     encourages enrollment in U.S. Department of Agriculture \n     conservation programs.\n\n  That is their quote. The reason that is--there are 56 conservation \npractices that are specifically exempt from this regulation, so if \nfarmers are participating in these conservation practices, they don't \nhave to worry about the issues to which some of my colleagues referred.\n  Let me quote from the proposed regulation itself. The regulation says \nthat the following are not waters of the United States: waste treatment \nsystems, including treatment ponds or lagoons; prior converted \ncropland; ditches that are excavated, and it gives certain conditions; \nditches that do not contribute flow, either directly or through another \nwater, to the waters of the United States, so we have exempted ditches; \ncertain artificially irrigated areas are exempted; artificial lakes or \nponds created by excavating and/or diking dry land; artificial \nreflecting pools or swimming pools created by excavating and/or diking \ndry land; small ornamental waters created by excavating and/or \ndiking dry land; water-filled depressions; groundwater, including \ngroundwater drained through subsurface drainage systems; and gullies \nand rills and non-wetland swales.\n\n  If you listen to my colleagues, they would tell you that if, as a \nfarmer, you have a ditch on your property that is just on your \nproperty, that you are using for irrigation on your property, it would \nbe subject to this regulation. It would not be. It is specifically \nexempt.\n  Here is the point.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CARDIN. Let me finish my point.\n  Here is the point. This is a proposed regulation. So if you think \nfurther clarification is needed, there is an extended comment period. \nIf you think we need to make further clarifications on issues--what we \nare trying to get at are practices that affect water that will go into \nour streams and rivers and in my case end up in the Chesapeake Bay \nwatershed, which in trying to clean up the bay we have to deal with.\n  The success of the Chesapeake Bay Program is that all stakeholders \nare involved. We use the best science. We need everyone doing their \nfair share. Therefore, if your activities contribute to water flowing \ninto the Chesapeake Bay watershed through our streams and rivers, yes, \nyou are regulated under the Clean Water Act. But if you have a self-\ncontained ditch that is not involved in that and are using it for \nirrigation, absolutely not. If you participate in the conservation \nprograms, you don't have to worry about a new set of regulations. That \nis what this does.\n  Our true leader on this has been Senator Whitehouse. I thank him very \nmuch on the climate change issues, on the environmental issues. He has \nbeen on the floor every day.\n  I want to make sure my colleagues have a chance to express their \nviews on this issue. It is critically important.\n  I yield for my colleague from Rhode Island.\n\n[[Page S3957]]\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I would ask, would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I would be pleased to yield for a question, but let \nme make one point first.\n  I think it is not insignificant that each Senator who spoke against \nthis proposed regulation hails from a landlocked State. Coastal States \nsuch as Maryland and Rhode Island have quite a different perspective \nbecause we have bays--in Senator Cardin's case, the Chesapeake Bay; in \nmy case, Narragansett Bay.\n  You don't have to look much farther than the Gulf Coast to see an \nexample of what happens when landlocked States up the river overload \nflowing waters with chemicals, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, that \nhave a beneficial use as fertilizer in those landlocked, upland States, \nbut when they run off and come down into smaller tributaries and end up \nin the mighty Mississippi River and stream down through the middle of \nour great country and out into the Gulf of Mexico, they create, \nliterally, dead zones in which nothing lives because the water has \nbecome anaerobic, meaning it does not carry enough oxygen to support \nlife. Some of these can be vast dead zones, and very often they result \nin fish kills and crab kills because the species don't have a chance to \nget out of the way. Suddenly, they are strangling, they are suffocating \nin their own waters. That is not something we can overlook.\n  I am willing to listen to my colleagues with upland, landlocked \nagricultural States tell me how important it is that they be able to \nload up with fertilizer, grow their crops, and do all of those things. \nI appreciate and understand that point of view. That is not the only \npoint of view. There are sister States for which that creates a real \nproblem, and it is not fair to come to this conversation and assume \nthat we have nothing to say, that our coasts have no stake in these \ndecisions, and that there is only one side to this argument; that is, \nhow much stuff you can dump out on your agricultural properties. That \nisn't fair, it isn't accurate, it is not scientific, and it is not good \nfor our country. I think we need to have a good debate in which the \ncoastal States and their imperatives and their perils are also part of \nthe equation.\n  I yield for Senator Hoeven's question.\n  I ask that the time used for Senator Hoeven's question be charged \nagainst Republican time.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I thank the Senator from Maryland and the Senator from \nRhode Island for coming to the floor and making exactly the type of \npoint I am making.\n  Thank you for being here. This is the debate we should have, and it \nshould be vigorous, as it is. We should have all Members, whether they \nare from a coastal State or an inland State, and we should debate every \naspect of this proposed rule. This is important to them. This is \nsomething that affects American people regardless of what State they \nlive in. We should have this debate, and then we should vote on this \nissue.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I yielded to the Senator for a question.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. My question to you is, very simply, first, EPA, in order \nto provide exemptions, has to maintain that they have jurisdiction in \nall these areas. That is the very point I am making to the point made \nby the Senator from Maryland. EPA is now deciding where they have \njurisdiction and where they don't. We are not. And they are doing it \nfar beyond the scope of the Supreme Court's rule.\n  So my question is, If they can decide where they are going to give \nexemptions, how can you say they are not exerting jurisdiction?\n  To the good Senator from Rhode Island, every downstream State can \nallege the issue you made in your earlier point. I understand that. But \nto both of you, my point is, let's have this debate and then let's vote \non behalf of the American people. Would the Senators agree that is what \nwe should be doing in this body?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Reclaiming the floor, let me say that--first, a \nlittle bit of history as to how we got here because I think that bears \nvery much on the Senator's questions. We had quite a clear set of \nregulations under the Clean Water Act. Most everybody understood them. \nThere was a standard operating practice that had developed, and into \nthat relatively stable situation came these two Supreme Court decisions \nthat Senator Cardin referred to, and they cast a constitutional and \nstatutory pall over the scope of the EPA's authority for nonnavigable \nwaters. But--and the Supreme Court gets to do this if they want--they \nprovided very little clarity. So there was vast uncertainty about what \nwas going on now in the wake of these decisions.\n  So Members of Congress, businesses, agricultural groups, \nenvironmental groups, and many other stakeholders asked for this \nrulemaking. They asked for this rulemaking so that the administrative \nagency that was going to enforce these provisions could be given the \nfirst cut at figuring out how they apply. That is what they did in this \nrulemaking. They answered the call that came from Congress, \nagricultural interests, environmental interests, and they came up with \na proposed rule. The rule preserves and reiterates all of the current \nwater exemptions and exclusions that preexisted, and it adds even new \nclarification that excludes certain water features--as Senator Cardin \npointed out--and excludes them outright.\n  This is the clarification that Congress asked for. This is the \nclarification that agricultural and environmental interests asked for. \nAnd I would submit to my friend Senator Hoeven that if he doesn't like \nthis result, he should wait until there is actually a result, \nparticipate in the administrative process, and let the EPA know what \nhis feelings are.\n  If they come out with a final rule--this is just a proposed rule--\nthat he finds intolerable for his landlocked upland agricultural \ninterests, then we will have that debate and we will have an actual \nrule to argue about. But while he has an open invitation from EPA that \nsays, let me know what your thoughts are and we will consider changing \nour rule, we shouldn't trump that process. They are the experts in this \ntype of enforcement. We are going to hand it back to them, anyway, \nbecause we legislate very broadly.\n  So let's let them do the process. Let's let them come up with the \nrule, and then I am ready for this debate all day long. But don't \nforget our coastal States. Don't forget our bays.\n  Mr. CARDIN. If the Senator will yield for one moment, I also want \nSenator Hoeven to understand the history.\n  Shortly after the Supreme Court decision many of us filed because \nthere needed to be clarification. We had urged Congress to do that. But \nit was opposition from the Republicans that prevented us from \nconsidering that legislation. They blocked us from considering a \ncongressional clarification as to the Supreme Court decision, and now \nwe are faced with a situation in which the administration is doing what \nit must do; that is, to provide, under its own authority, where it can \nact, clarification that it so desperately needed.\n  As Senator Whitehouse has said, what this regulation is about is \nclarifying the confusion by the Supreme Court decision as to what is \nregulated or not. As a result, landowners don't know whether they can \ndo this or not. They don't know. That is the worst of all worlds, when \nyou don't have certainty as to how you need to act, and that does cause \nspeculation that in many cases is not true. But they don't know what \nthe rules are.\n  So, quite frankly, what the administration rule is patterned after is \na lot of discussion we had in the Congress of the United States shortly \nafter the Supreme Court decision as to trying to codify the practice \nbefore the Supreme Court decision. There didn't seem to be a lot of \npeople upset with the manner in which the EPA was regulating the waters \nof the United States prior to the two Supreme Court decisions in 2001. \nThat is what the regulation is aimed at--getting us to before the point \nof the Supreme Court decision and where Congress was trying to \nlegislate but blocked by Republicans shortly after the decision.\n  I think Senator Whitehouse is exactly right. What we should be doing \nnow if we have concerns is expressing them. First, it might be helpful \nto read the regulation and see what is in it and what is not in it, \nwhat is regulated and what is not regulated. If there are things in \nhere we think are wrong, that\n\n[[Page S3958]]\n\nis what a comment period is about. Let's wait until we get the final \nregulation and then, yes, we will have a debate, I am sure, at that \ntime, which is appropriate, and then we can debate exactly what the \nregulation says.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. May I ask the Senator from Maryland to comment on \nanother point.\n  We are having a conversation right here and right now on the floor \nabout a specific EPA regulation. But those of us who are here on the \nfloor a lot and those of us who pay attention to these issues can't not \nsee this conversation in the context of a larger conversation that is \ntaking place in the Senate. That causes me to inquire: When will a \nRepublican come to the floor and ever support EPA on anything? When \nwill that happen?\n  I was just speaking in the House at a hearing, and Representative \nElijah Cummings, the ranking member of the committee that I was \ntestifying before, pointed out that they were coming up on the House \nRepublicans' 500th vote attacking the environment in the House. Now, we \nknow they have tried to repeal ObamaCare 50-plus times--but 500 \nattacking environmental regulations? I can't not see this in that \nlarger context of a party that has simply thrown over its proud \nenvironmental history and just consistently takes the position of the \npolluter almost as a reflex.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Senator Whitehouse is exactly right. We were together in \nthe hearing in the Environment and Public Works Committee, where we had \nmany previous administrators from the Environmental Protection Agency. \nThere were those who served under Democratic administrations and \nRepublican administrations.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. If I remember correctly, we had four from Republican \nadministrations.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Four from Republican administrations--and as was pointed \nout in the hearing where we were talking about the Clean Air Act, it \nwas passed by bipartisan support in Congress and signed into law by \nPresident Nixon, and it was a proud moment.\n  We have done many analyses that show the regulations issued under \nclean water and clean air pay back dividends far in excess of \ncompliance costs, such as 40 to 1. There are people who can breathe and \nnot have to worry about an asthma attack because we have clean air. \nThere are those who don't get sick because of pathogens that may be in \nour drinking water or people getting sick just bathing on our shores. \nWe reduced that, and the number of premature deaths we have eliminated.\n  The public health benefit of the Clean Water Act and Clean Air Act \npays back multiple dividends to people of this country, and that is why \nthis has never been a partisan issue. Quite frankly, the Chesapeake Bay \nProgram--the partnership--has never been a partisan issue in Maryland.\n  Some of our strongest benefactors--the people who have caused us to \nhave this type of unity--have been Republican leaders in our State, \nalong with Democratic leaders. We don't even know the party it ought to \nbe. This has been a public calling because we know the seriousness of \nthe issue.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency has a long history of nonpartisan \nactivities in order to protect the public health of the people of this \ncountry, and it is extremely disappointing that there is no cooperation \nat all.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. It is an anomaly. It is a historical anomaly that the \npresent-day Republican party finds itself in this position where they \nwill only come to the floor to attack and try to discredit the EPA. The \nonly time they come to talk about the EPA is to oppose what the EPA is \ndoing. They will never come to the floor and admit climate change is \nreal and we should do something about it. They will never do that. The \nposition that is articulated most frequently on this floor is the \nposition that climate change is a hoax. Even young Republicans think \nthat idea is preposterous, but that is as far as we get in trying to \nhave a conversation on that issue. The other side has just gone dark on \ndealing with climate change. They simply won't discuss it or they send \nout as their champions the people who claim it is not real. That makes \nthings a little bit awkward. And always--always--where there are two \nsides of the ledger, they look just at the one side. They look just at \nthe polluters' side. They look just at the upland farmers and their \nnitrogen and their phosphorus, and they won't look at what that means \nto our coastal bays and coasts and harbors. They look only at the money \nthat a polluter has to spend to clean up their powerplant, and they \ndon't look at the savings to the rest of the public from that cleaned-\nup powerplant.\n\n  Senator Cardin mentioned the savings from the Clean Air Act and the \nClean Water Act. I can be specific about the Clean Air Act savings. It \nis $30 in value to all regular American families for every $1 the \npolluters had to spend to clean up their act. So for every $1 spent by \npolluters to clean up their act, it paid $30 in benefit to the American \npublic. Yet they will only look at the $1. They never talk about the \nrest. They have blinders on that oblige them only to consider the point \nof view of the polluters. I never hear anything else.\n  I urge and I challenge my colleagues to get out of that trap. The \nAmerican people are not with you on this. You are wrong on the science. \nThis general attack on the environment at this stage in our history \nwill stain the party's brand if it is not corrected. They have got to \ncome back and join the debate on a platform of fact and in a context of \nwillingness to look at both sides of the ledger.\n  Madam President, I see colleagues on the floor who I am sure seek \ntime, so I will yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). Senator from Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/25/senate-section/article/S3958-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3958-S3960]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I rise to discuss the current crisis in \nIraq. In particular, I wish to discuss an important question: Would \nCongress need to approve any U.S. military combat action in Iraq?\n  Last week, the President summoned congressional leadership to the \nWhite House to discuss the deteriorating situation in Iraq and a \npotential U.S. response. Press reports of the meeting had Members \nquoting the President as saying he had all necessary authority for \nmilitary action already, and some accounts had the congressional \nleaders also agreeing that the President had necessary authority.\n  I do not believe this President--or any President--has the ability \nwithout congressional approval to initiate military action in Iraq or \nanywhere else, except in the case of an emergency posing an imminent \nthreat to the United States or its citizens.\n  I also assert that the current crisis in Iraq, while serious and \nposing the possibility of a long-term threat to the United States, is \nnot the kind of conflict where the President can or should act \nunilaterally. If the United States is to contemplate military action in \nIraq, the President must seek congressional authorization.\n  Let me point out that the White House has been in significant \nconsultation with congressional leadership and Members in the past \nweeks, and that consultation is important and it is appreciated. But it \nis not the same thing as seeking congressional authority. That has yet \nto be done, and it must be done if the United States intends to engage \nin any combat activity in Iraq.\n  A word about the law. The Framers of the Constitution had a clear \nunderstanding regarding decisions about war. Congress must act to \ninitiate war. A war, once initiated, is then managed by the President \nas Commander in Chief.\n  The principal drafter of the Constitution, Virginian James Madison, \noften explained why the allocation of power was drawn in this way.\n\n       The constitution supposes, what the History of all \n     Governments demonstrates, that the Executive is the branch of \n     power most interested in war, and most prone to it. It has \n     accordingly with studied care vested the question of war to \n     the Legislature.\n\n  The Framers did understand that a President must be able to act in an \nemergency to protect the United States or its citizens even prior to \ncongressional approval. That is especially the case in the day when \nMembers of Congress, upon the recess, would ride horses back to Vermont \nor wherever they lived. The President had to be able to act if the \nUnited States or an\n\n[[Page S3959]]\n\nembassy or a naval ship was under attack. But even in those \ncircumstances, the Framers understood that in an emergency a President \ncould act but would then still need to seek formal congressional \napproval of any military action that had been taken.\n  It is important to understand that this basic allocation of power is \nnot just about constitutional phrases. It is about underlying values.\n  First, the requirement for congressional approval ensures that \nAmerican troops will not be sent into combat without a clear political \nconsensus that the mission is worthwhile. It would be the height of \npublic immorality to order servicemembers to risk their lives when the \nNation's political leadership has not done the work to reach a \nconsensus about the value of a mission.\n  Secondly, the requirement of congressional approval to initiate war \nalso guarantees that there will be a public process of debate and \nvoting by which the citizenry can also become educated about what is at \nstake and whether America should take the grave step of authorizing war \nto protect the national interest. Congress, as the decisionmaker, as \nthe initiator, as the declarer of war, supports these important \nunderlying values.\n\n  Applying that law to Iraq, the current situation is very troubling. \nCongress authorized war in Iraq in 2002. In 2008, President Bush signed \nan agreement with Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki to cease combat \noperations and withdraw U.S. troops by the end of 2011. After President \nObama became President, he worked with Iraq and was willing to have \nU.S. troops stay past 2011 to provide continued assistance to the Iraqi \nsecurity forces if they desired it, but the Iraq Government would not \nprovide the immunities and other security assurances that were \nnecessary for the United States to stay. They basically communicated \nthat they did not want us to stay. So the U.S. military ceased combat \noperations and departed in 2011. By all accounts the U.S. combat role \nstopped at that moment.\n  In the years since 2011, Prime Minister Maliki has governed Iraq in a \nway that has exacerbated tensions between the country's ethnic groups. \nIn particular, instead of building an Iraq for all Iraqis, the Maliki \ngovernment has preferred the Shia population with the support of Iran \nand marginalized--even oppressing--the Sunni and Kurdish populations, \nand these regrettable actions have weakened the support for the \ngovernment and have created fertile ground for Sunni extremism.\n  The fanatic Sunni organization ISIL has grown in its campaign to \ntopple the current Syrian Government and now seeks to do the same in \nIraq as part of its plan to establish a larger single Sunni caliphate \nfrom Lebanon to Iraq. ISIL is a well-armed and well-funded organization \nof jihadists. While their primary motive is the toppling of governments \nin the region, there is little doubt that they will seek in the future \nto strike western targets in Europe and in the United States. This \nexplains the current concern and the current debate in this body about \nhow to counter the threat ISIL poses. While ISIL terrorists pose a \nconcern, it is important to point out that there is nothing in current \nlaw that would allow the President to take military action against them \nwithout congressional approval.\n  Let's look at current law.\n  Congress passed an authorization for the use of military force \nimmediately after the 9/11 attacks to allow action against those who \nperpetrated the attacks on that day. ISIL had no connection with the 9/\n11 attacks. ISIL did not form until 2003. Both the Bush and Obama \nadministrations have broadly interpreted that AUMF to allow attacks \nagainst Al Qaeda or associated forces, but ISIL is not Al Qaeda, nor is \nit an associated force. While it forged a temporary alliance with Al \nQaeda in 2004, 3 years after 9/11, it is now an avowed enemy of Al \nQaeda and is viciously battling Al Qaeda in Syria as we speak. It would \nbe a wholly unprecedented stretch to suggest that the 2001 AUMF now \nwould justify military action against ISIL in Iraq.\n  Congress acted in 2002 to authorize military action in Iraq to topple \nthe regime of Saddam Hussein. All combat operations ceased in 2011 and \neven the administration now maintains the Iraqi AUMF is obsolete and \nshould be repealed. Clearly the 2002 AUMF would not support unilateral \naction against ISIL.\n  In some instances a President relies upon a treaty ratified by \nCongress that requires the United States to come to the military \ndefense of an ally, but there is no such treaty obligating America to \ndefend Iraq in this instance.\n  Finally, there is not yet an imminent threat to the United States \nthat would allow the President to take unilateral military action \nagainst ISIL. The administration rightly points out that the growth of \nISIL could prove a threat to the United States in the medium or long \nterm, but they pose no imminent threat to the United States today. Of \ncourse, should ISIL threaten the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, the President \ncould take emergency military action and rescue American personnel, and \nall of us are watching carefully and all of us will support action to \nprotect the lives of our diplomatic personnel.\n  I conclude, from looking at all the authorities, that the President \ncannot initiate unilateral military action in Iraq with the sole \nexception of acting promptly if needed to secure American Embassy \npersonnel. The dangerous situation of ISIL in Iraq is exactly the kind \nof situation where the President must not only consult with Congress \nbut he also must seek congressional approval for any proposed military \naction.\n  We know seeking congressional approval for military action is very \nchallenging and it is contentious, and it is supposed to be. While this \noften frustrates the Executive, it is how the system is supposed to \nwork. When Presidents follow the rule, it generally works out for the \nbest. Let me use the recent example of Syria. When the President did \nfollow the basic form, it worked out in a way where something positive \nhappened--not everything we might want but something positive. The \nPresident laid down a clear red line: The United States believes it \nwould be wrong for Syria to use chemical weapons in violation of the \n1925 Geneva Convention against their use. In August 2013 Syria crossed \nthat red line and did use chemical weapons against men, women, and \nchildren, civilians. The President weighed what to do. He didn't act \nunilaterally. He came to Congress seeking authority to punish the Assad \nadministration for using chemical weapons and to deter their use in the \nfuture.\n  As a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, we had extensive \nhearings and then we voted to grant military authority to the President \nto take action in those circumstances. As you know, it was contentious \nin the body. The matter never came to a full vote on the Senate floor \nor the House floor; but after the Foreign Relations Committee \nauthorized the President to use military force, Syria then stepped up \nfor the first time, acknowledged they had a chemical weapons stockpile, \nessentially acknowledged they had used it, and then committed through \ninternational organizations at the U.N. to destroy one of the largest \nchemical weapons stockpiles in the world. That accomplished the mission \nthe President had put on the table to deter future use of chemical \nweapons. There is no better deterrent of that stockpile of chemical \nweapons than their complete destruction, and as of now the entire \ndeclared chemical weapons stockpile of Syria has been destroyed. Work \nis underway to determine whether there are undeclared elements of the \nstockpile that still must be destroyed. The fact of the destruction of \nthis chemical weapons stockpile, one of the largest in the world, \nhappened because the President followed the rules, came to the Senate, \nwe acted to support military force, and then that led to this important \nbreakthrough.\n  I met 2 weeks ago with officials connected with the Israeli \nGovernment and they described what a game changer it is in the region \nfor Syria's neighbors, Turkey, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, to have that \nchemical weapons stockpile removed. So the President followed the rule, \ncame to Congress, and while the Syrian civil war is not over and still \nis carrying on in a horrific way, that huge stockpile of weapons of \nmass destruction is now gone.\n  That teaches me and tells me: Let's learn from it.\n  The President should come to Congress if military action is \ncontemplated in Iraq, and he has an excellent opportunity before him to \ninitiate\n\n[[Page S3960]]\n\nthat discussion right now. All know that the 2001 authorization passed \nin the days after 9/11 to enable us to go after the attack perpetrators \nis badly in need of an update after 13 years. Despite its facial \nlanguage only allowing military action against those complicit in the \n9/11 attacks, it has been broadly interpreted to authorize a global war \nagainst Al Qaeda or associated forces so long as they pose a threat to \nthe United States or any of its dozens of ``coalition partners.'' That \nAUMF 13 years later has no geographic limitations. It has no expiration \ndate. Members of the administration have testified in Senate hearings \nthat they expect the war declared in that AUMF may go on for the next \n25 or 30 years.\n\n  I wasn't here in 2001, but I have no doubt that the Members of \nCongress who voted for that authorization never would have contemplated \nwar lasting into the 2030s or 2040s, and the American public has never \nexpressed support for such a notion of perpetual war.\n  But the threat posed to the United States and our allies by nonstate \nterrorist organizations, whether it is ISIL or Al-Qaeda or Boko Haram \nor Al Nusra or others, is real and it has grown; and the very nature of \nthe threat is quite different from the old notion of nation state \nmilitary power that was our standard challenge even through the end of \nthe 20th century.\n  In a speech in May of 2013 to the National Defense University, \nPresident Obama recognized that the administration and Congress have to \nwork together to examine and update the 2001 AUMF in order to narrow \nits scope, clarify what it allows, and make it suitable for the new \nchallenges that are before us. I have heard many of my colleagues in \nthis body say exactly the same, but there has been no progress on this \nnecessary update. The administration has made no proposal. There is no \nAUMF revision under active consideration in either House. Strangely, \nwhile all acknowledge the authorization needs an update, we drift from \ncrisis to crisis--Syria, Iraq, POW exchanges--without grappling with \nthe underlying document that initiated our entrance into war 13 years \nago.\n  We cannot afford further delays in tackling this important task. So \nas I conclude, I encourage all of us, Congress and the administration, \nto embark on the work of updating the 2001 authorization to reflect the \ncurrent dimensions of our security challenges. The administration \nshould send to Congress a proposal for a revised and narrowed \nauthorization that specifies how the United States should seek to \ncounter threats posed by groups such as ISIL. There will be a role for \nthe military and there will be a role for counterterrorism activities \ncarried out by our intelligence agencies. There will be a role for \ndiplomacy and there will also be a role for development assistance to \neliminate the conditions of desperation that so often breed fanaticism. \nBut it is time for those roles to be clearly described so they can be \npublicly debated and ultimately adopted by Congress.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Thank you very much, Madam President, and I \nthank my colleague from the Foreign Relations Committee for a very good \nspeech on a critical issue that our Nation faces right now.\n  On July 16, 1945, the first atomic bomb was exploded at the Trinity \nsite in New Mexico. For residents of the Tularosa Basin, it marked the \nbeginning of decades of cancer, chronic illness, and suffering that \ncontinues to this day.\n  Next month there will be a candlelight vigil organized by the \nTularosa Basin Downwinders Consortium. Folks will once again gather as \nthey have done now for each year for the past 5 years. They will stand \nshoulder to shoulder, they will light candles, and they will remember. \nThey will remember that an injustice was done and has yet to be \nrighted.\n  The Trinity explosion paid little attention to surrounding \ncommunities. Radioactive debris fell from the sky, killing cattle, \npoisoning water, poisoning food, the air we breathe. The damage was \ndone and would remain long after the test was finished, for \ngenerations. The suffering it caused is very real and so is the \nsadness, disappointment, and anger. Attention was not paid then, but it \nmust be paid now.\n  That is why I have introduced legislation in this Congress to amend \nthe Radiation Exposure Compensation Act to recognize the Trinity site, \nto include the New Mexicans who have suffered for decades, who still \nwait for justice, who still wait for compensation from the Federal \nGovernment for their injuries almost 70 years later--still waiting.\n  We cannot change the past. We cannot restore the lives of those who \nhave passed away or erase the years of health problems, the years of \nsuffering endured by too many and for too long, but fair compensation \nwill make a difference and provide badly needed help.\n  The original RECA legislation required years of work on the ground. \nMy father helped lay the groundwork for RECA a quarter of a century \nago. Through his work with radiation exposure survivors and their \nfamilies, compiling stories and records and histories of victims, the \nTularosa Basin Downwinders Consortium continues this critical work and \nI encourage them to keep up the fight.\n  This is a bipartisan effort and driven by simple fairness for \nAmerican citizens who should have been helped but were ignored instead. \nOur bill would expand the downwind exposure area to include seven \nStates from the Trinity and Nevada test sites and would include Guam \nfrom the Pacific side. It would also help post-1971 uranium miners to \nbe eligible for compensation and it would fund a critical public health \nstudy of those who live and work in uranium development communities.\n  I will continue to push for this legislation. It is the right thing \nto do, and we should get it done.\n  When folks gather in Tularosa and stand together as candles flicker \nin the New Mexico sky, we will take a moment and remember those who \nhave been affected by cancer, who have been brought down by radiation-\nrelated diseases, and we will remember those who passed away and those \nwho continue to suffer. We offer our prayers and support to those who \nare still fighting. We stand with you. We know you have suffered. We \nknow justice has not been done, and we will not rest until it is.\n  I wish to commend the Tularosa Downwinders Consortium, folks such as \nTina Cordova and the late Fred Tyler, who will be greatly missed--great \nadvocates, dedicated, committed, and refusing to give up. Thank you for \nmaking your voices heard, making your stories known, and for not giving \nup the fight. Together we will work for fairness until the day comes \nthat we can stand together in Tularosa and light candles of celebration \nthat justice has been done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/25/senate-section/article/S3960-2", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3960-S3961]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          FREEDOM OF RELIGION\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I wish to talk today about a couple of \nissues. This first issue I will address concerns the first freedom and \nthe First Amendment in this country, a matter which people in other \nparts of the world are seeing in jeopardy, and that is freedom of \nreligion.\n  I read an article from the BBC about the current status of Meriam \nIbrahim. Just 2 days ago she was acquitted of her death sentence in \nSudan, and many people in this building and around the world applauded \nher release. She was sentenced to death because she would not disavow \nher Christian faith. In fact, for months she had been held in prison. \nShe gave birth to a child while she was in prison, and she had a young \nchild with her while she was in prison. The birth of the baby, and then \nthe early months of the baby's life, was the determining factor as to \nwhen she would be first beaten and then hanged because she would not \ndisavow her faith.\n  Two days ago, she and her two children were set free. She is the wife \nof a naturalized U.S. citizen. She had been imprisoned by this \ngovernment, and unfairly so. Many of my colleagues have been working to \nsecure her release. Last month Senator Ayotte and I sent a letter to \nSecretary Kerry urging him to offer and provide political asylum for \nher immediately. We should not have to provide asylum for her\n\n[[Page S3961]]\n\nfamily. Her husband is a U.S. citizen, and because of that both her \nchildren are U.S. citizens. Because of her faith, she had been \nsentenced to death.\n  The State Department wondered how much jurisdiction it had in this \ncase, and so Senator Ayotte and I sent another letter to both the State \nDepartment and Homeland Security--that agency has the ability to allow \npeople to leave a country or come into a country.\n  On Monday, it looked as though the situation was moving in the right \ndirection. She had reportedly been acquitted and was set free. She was \nallowed to join her husband and their children at the airport, but \nyesterday when they tried to leave the airport, news outlets reported \nshe was rearrested. I hope by rearrested they mean she was detained for \npaperwork, but the Sudanese Government needs to let her go.\n  If they are so concerned about the issue of faith and don't want \nsomeone there who is willing to promote another faith--or at least live \nanother faith--they should at the very least let her leave the country. \nI think asylum in the United States for her U.S. citizen husband, her \nU.S. citizen children, and her is appropriate. That way the danger they \nfeel they face by someone who is willing to profess another faith would \nbe gone.\n  I cannot imagine why the Sudanese Government would not allow her to \nleave the country, and I encourage them today to release them.\n  NBC News reported:\n\n       The NISS, a shadowy and feared institution, said on its \n     Facebook page that Ibrahim and her family had been attempting \n     to travel to the U.S. with documents from the Embassy of \n     south Sudan, which split from its northern neighbor in 2011 \n     after years of civil war. It said she was carrying a U.S. \n     visa, and that her attempts to use the documents were \n     considered a ``criminal offense.''\n\n  Apparently the documents were purportedly--at least according to this \nnews report--from South Sudan. But those documents should have been \nenough to let her leave and should not have been considered another \ncriminal offense.\n  These authorities have told reporters that Meriam Ibrahim was using a \nvalid travel document issued by the Embassy of South Sudan, and then \nsuddenly her valid travel documents were deemed not valid.\n  The State Department, I hope, is doing everything it can to work with \nthe Sudanese Government to ensure that this family is able to come back \nto the United States. This continued harassment over someone's faith \nhas to end. We need to be doing everything we can. Her husband is a \nU.S. citizen and her children are U.S. citizens. This is an American \nfamily and Sudan should let them leave and let them leave now.\n  If this were the only time something such as this happened, it would \nbe a terrible problem, but this injustice takes place in so many \ncountries around the world. Apparently the one faith you can't profess \nis the Christian faith.\n  When news of Meriam's death sentence came to light, it was about the \nsame day there were reports of another American citizen, Pastor Saeed \nAbedini, who had been beaten badly in a hospital in Iran. He was there \nbecause of his faith. He was taken to an Iranian prison that was \nnotoriously known as the most dangerous prison you could possibly be in \nin Iran.\n  Last year I joined with 11 of my colleagues--at the time Secretary \nClinton was leaving--urging Senator Clinton to use every resource we \nhad to release him as well. Our government condemned the Iranian \nGovernment for his prosecution.\n  He converted to Christianity as a teenager before moving to the \nUnited States with his wife. He established some churches that were \nunderground churches in that country.\n  In 2009, he was arrested for so-called Christian activities. He was \nreleased on bail. He agreed not to continue his work with the \nunderground churches, but as he was traveling back and forth between \nthe United States and Iran in recent years, he was working to establish \nnonreligious orphanages in Iran.\n  In September of 2012, he was detained after he lawfully came into \nIran through Turkey. He is now serving an 8-year jail sentence on \ncharges related to his Christian faith, and all the while he has been \ninterrogated intensely and beaten to the point where he was taken to \nthe hospital and then he was beaten in the hospital. After that, he was \ntaken to the most dangerous prison you could take a person to in Iran.\n  The activities I have just described cannot be allowed to continue. I \ndon't know how we can move forward with talks with the Iranians and not \nask them for such a simple gesture that would allow this U.S. citizen \nto come back to the United States--and don't kill him in one of your \nprisons or hospitals. It would show a sign of a good-faith effort as we \ncontinue to have these discussions.\n  I hope the President will step forward, along with the Secretary of \nState, and talk about these grave abuses of human rights.\n\n  Last year the Senate Foreign Relations Committee reported out a \nbipartisan bill to appoint a special envoy for the purpose of promoting \nreligious freedom among religious minorities in the Near East and South \nCentral Asia. The House has already passed this bill.\n  This continued violence--particularly against Christians--against all \nreligions that governments are in disagreement with is deeply \ndisturbing. It defies the freedoms we hold dear.\n  When people's rights to their own religious beliefs are abused in the \nMiddle East or Sudan or anywhere else, the United States of America \nshould be the first country to step up and say: We are going to do \nwhatever we can to ensure more religious freedom, and in this \nparticular case, to ensure that the Ibrahim family--in prison in \nSudan--is able to leave and Pastor Abedini is able to leave Iran.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/25/senate-section/article/S3961-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3961-S3962]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. The other matter I wish to talk about for just a few \nminutes deals with the disappointing answer Senator Alexander and I got \nthis week from a request we made several days ago about a processing \ncenter near St. Louis where the employees have stepped forward and \nbasically said this was a processing center for the Affordable Care \nAct. One group that may not be able to afford the Affordable Care Act--\namong many others--may be the taxpayers. These employees stepped \nforward and said they were really not doing anything.\n  The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported this morning:\n\n       Whistleblower allegations last month that claims workers \n     slept, read or played games at Wentzville invoked a flurry of \n     questions from Missouri's congressional delegation.\n\n  Moving on with their story, they cite one of the whistleblowers as \nsaying:\n\n       We played Pictionary. We played 20 Questions. We played \n     Trivial Pursuit.\n\n  She estimated she processed six applications the entire month of \nDecember.\n  CMS, while not acknowledging any of those allegations, said it ``has \nadjusted Serco's work to accommodate changing operational needs.'' That \nis sort of a nonanswer answer.\n  If we want the government to work more effectively, the government \nhas to be responsive to the Congress.\n  Mr. President, I unanimous consent to have my letter printed in the \nRecord.\n  This letter is dated June 17, but we had to call them yesterday to \nsee if they were ever going to respond. They stamp-dated this a few \ndays ago, but we certainly have not received anything.\n  I understand the Affordable Care Act is not going the way the \nadministration had hoped, but that doesn't mean they can continue to \npretend there are applications where there are no applications or work \nwhere there is no work or contracts that have not performed.\n  This is a British company that was already in trouble with the \nBritish Government that has not performed there. It appears to be one \nof the considerations to get a $1.25 billion contract here.\n  I wish to have answers to these questions. I know many in the \nCongress wish to have answers to their questions. They wish to ask \nquestions rather than to have to listen to whatever information the \nadministration would like to give.\n  I think the entire Missouri congressional delegation is interested in \nthis, as are people who are wanting the taxpayers to be protected and \nfor people to have access to health care they can afford and that meets \nthe needs of their family.\n\n[[Page S3962]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n         Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for \n           Medicare and Medicaid Services\n                                    Washington, DC, June 17, 2014.\n     Hon. Roy Blunt,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Blunt: Thank you for your letter regarding the \n     recent news story about employees of Serco, a contractor to \n     the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), which \n     provides eligibility support for the Federally-facilitated \n     Marketplace (Marketplace). CMS is committed to working with \n     Serco, and all of CMS's contractors, to ensure that federal \n     funds are spent appropriately and that performance \n     expectations are clear and monitored. We closely monitor the \n     work Serco is doing regarding the number of employees it has, \n     including staff allocation by job function, and we are \n     confident that the balance is appropriate.\n       On April 22, CMS was notified by Serco of a request for an \n     interview with KMOV, a local news station in St. Louis, \n     Missouri, regarding the allegations of misconduct at its \n     Wentzville, Missouri facility. Upon learning about the \n     allegations, CMS formally requested Serco to conduct a \n     compliance investigation for the purpose of reviewing the \n     allegations of inappropriate employee conduct at its \n     Wentzville, Missouri facility as cited in the news story and \n     to take any necessary steps to address them. At this time, \n     CMS does not have any knowledge of similar allegations taking \n     place at any of Serco's other facilities.\n       Regarding adjustments of Serco staffing levels in response \n     to Marketplace workload, total Serco workforce numbers and \n     patterns vary and are adjusted based on the needs of the \n     contract. Currently, Serco has approximately 3,000 employees \n     stationed among its four locations. The number of Serco staff \n     is reviewed on a regular basis by CMS and adjustments to \n     staffing levels are made as appropriate based on the workload \n     and requirements of the contract. Over the course of open \n     enrollment, and now after open enrollment, CMS has adjusted \n     Serco's workforce to accommodate changing operational needs. \n     For example, CMS adjusted the workforce to process more paper \n     applications last fall, when HealthCare.gov had technical \n     problems, and then again for calling consumers to help them \n     take the necessary steps to complete their enrollment.\n       For oversight purposes, CMS monitors Serco's performance \n     through a range of contractually required reports, meetings \n     and site visits. CMS receives daily production and staffing \n     reports from Serco, and communicates with Serco \n     representatives daily to discuss operations and policy \n     guidance to ensure adequate staffing levels and operational \n     priorities. CMS has also conducted site visits across all \n     four Serco facilities and is in constant communication with \n     Serco's management team.\n       Regarding the question of oversight or other actions to \n     ensure compliance with contract terms, in accordance with \n     Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 42.15, CMS will complete \n     an annual evaluation of Serco utilizing the Contractor \n     Performance Assessment Reporting System at the end of the \n     base period. In the event of inappropriate activity related \n     to payments already made to Serco, CMS would take recourse \n     that is legally and contractually allowed.\n       Concerning document production and consumer notifications, \n     since October 1, 2013, Serco has handled more than 1 million \n     documents related to the Marketplace and made 1.4 million \n     outbound phone calls to Marketplace applicants. Serco \n     performs a number of duties for CMS other than processing \n     initial paper applications. Serco workers also are involved \n     with verifying information, processing exemptions, resolving \n     conflicts of information, and calling consumers to obtain \n     missing information or necessary documentation.\n       Finally, in consideration of whether Serco would be granted \n     a one-year option period at the end of the contract's one-\n     year base period, CMS will conduct a review of the quality of \n     the work currently being performed by the contractor, \n     determine whether the contractor has met the terms and \n     conditions of the contract thus far, and assess if the \n     requirement covered by the option continues to fulfill an \n     existing government need. CMS's review will fulfill all of \n     the conditions prescribed in FAR 17.207, Exercise of Options.\n       I understand your concerns and appreciate you bringing them \n     to my attention. will also provide a copy of this response to \n     Senator Lamar Alexander. Once again, thank you for your \n     letter and do not hesitate to contact me if you have any \n     further thoughts or concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Marilyn Tavenner,\n                                                    Administrator.\n\n  Mr. BLUNT.

Madam President, the Senator from Texas is on his way \nto the floor to talk about Meriam Ibrahim. He has been regularly joined \nby other Senators, including Senators Ayotte, Rubio, Inhofe, Shaheen, \nand Coons and many others who share my deep concern. Hundreds of \nTennesseans have written and called my office about this situation.\n  I am outraged by this blatant attack on religious freedom, and I join \nmy colleagues in demanding that the President and the State Department \nact immediately to help Ms. Ibrahim.\n  Meriam found herself in this situation because she was born to a \nMuslim father and an Ethiopian Orthodox Christian mother. Meriam's \nfather abandoned the family when Meriam was 6 years old, so she was \nraised as a Christian. Meriam later married Daniel, an American \ncitizen, who is also a Christian. The Sudanese Government considers \nMeriam a Muslim, even though she is a devout Christian.\n  When Meriam was ordered to renounce her faith, she refused. For that \ncrime, the Sudanese Government condemned her to death. She was \nconvicted and sentenced to receive 100 lashes and then be hanged. To \nmake matters worse, she was pregnant with her daughter when this \nhappened. Her son is less than 2 years old and was forced to live in a \nwomen's prison outside Khartoum, where they were held until Monday. \nMonday we learned Meriam was to be released, but that was a celebration \nthat was short-lived because yesterday she and her family were detained \nat the airport.\n  President Obama and the State Department should immediately demand \nthat the Sudanese Government follow their own court's orders and \nrelease Meriam and her family. The harassment and targeting of this \nfamily must stop immediately. The State Department should be prepared \nto act quickly to help them leave Sudan as soon as possible.\n  Occasionally we wonder if words spoken on this floor matter, but in \nthis case I believe they have. This is an outrageous incident that has \nseared the conscience of Americans and people all over the world. I \nknow in Tennessee many families care about it. I wish to thank Senator \nCruz as well as Senators Ayotte and Rubio and Inhofe and Shaheen and \nCoons--Senators on both sides of the aisle--who have used this forum, \nthis tribunal, to talk about the case of Meriam Ibrahim and her plight. \nIt is our hope that the attention, the spotlight placed on this matter \nwill help her be released and that our administration will continue its \nefforts to register our strong concern.\n  I am here to express the feelings of hundreds of Tennesseans but also \nto congratulate Senator Cruz and the other Senators on both sides of \nthe aisle who have done such an effective job of letting the world know \nabout Meriam Ibrahim and her plight.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp).

Madam President, I rise today to discuss a heartbreaking \ntragedy that has focused the attention of people across America and \npeople across the world. I rise today to discuss the plight of Meriam \nIbrahim. Meriam is a young wife and a young mother. Meriam has two \nchildren. She has a son Martin, who is 20 months old, and she has a \nnewborn baby girl Maya, who was just recently born.\n  Now, the birth of a little girl should be a cause for celebration. \nBut I am sorry to tell you, Madam President, that Meriam gave birth to \nMaya while in leg irons in a prison in Sudan.\n  Meriam is married to a U.S. citizen, Daniel. Her two children are \nAmerican citizens. Why was Meriam in leg irons in a prison cell in \nSudan? She was\n\n[[Page S3963]]\n\nthere because the Government of Sudan had sentenced her to receive 100 \nlashes and to hang by the neck until dead for the crime of being a \nChristian.\n  That is Meriam's only crime in Sudan, and for that crime she was \nsentenced to be tortured and executed.\n  Meriam was told by the Government of Sudan that if she would merely \nrenounce Jesus Christ, she would be spared that horrible sentence. But \nMeriam told her captors that she would not and could not renounce \nChrist.\n  All of us value the religious liberty that is protected here in \nAmerica that is precious to each and every one of us, and yet I would \nventure, very few, if any of us, have been tested in our faith the way \nMeriam has.\n  Now, 2 days ago, we had cause for celebration. Two days ago, the \nGovernment of Sudan--responding to the international outcry that this \nyoung wife and mother would be tortured and murdered for being a \nChristian--released Meriam. There were many prayers of thanksgiving 2 \ndays ago.\n  Yet, Madam President, I am very sorry to tell you that yesterday, \nwhile Meriam was at the airport preparing to leave and come to America \nwith her husband and her two little babies, armed thugs came to the \nairport and seized Meriam. She is back in a prison in Sudan.\n  This is wrong. This is an outrage. This calls for prayers across this \ncountry. And this calls for U.S. leadership.\n  I would humbly call upon President Obama to speak out for Meriam. \nThere is no one who has a bully pulpit like the President of the United \nStates. This is a case that cries for Presidential leadership. Her \nhusband is an American from New Hampshire. Her babies are Americans. \nAnd this is a grotesque example of religious persecution. I would note \nthat this should not be a cause for partisan division. Indeed, in this \nChamber, I am pleased to have joined with Senator Shaheen, a Democrat \nfrom New Hampshire, and Senator Ayotte, a Republican from New \nHampshire, in legislation that would provide immediate relief for \nMeriam to allow her to come to America.\n  It is my hope this body can operate quickly in a bipartisan, in a \nunanimous manner, to act on that legislation so we can stand together. \nI am encouraged that so many of my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle have stood and fought for Meriam. We need to speak with one \nuniform voice.\n  I hope, in particular--I would urge, in particular--President Obama \nto stand and add his clear voice, to say to the Government of Sudan: \nFree Meriam Ibrahim.\n  I would ask everyone watching this to lift her up in your prayers and \nto speak out.\n  Sudan, 2 days ago, responded to the international pressure and \nreleased her. Now that they have apparently had a change of heart and \nforcibly captured her, we need to speak even louder. We need to speak \nfor Meriam Ibrahim because it is wrong for anyone--especially this \nyoung wife and mother--to be subject to torture and murder for being a \nChristian. That is unequivocally wrong, and we need to speak in one \nvoice.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/25/senate-section/article/S3963-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3963-S3964]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXPORT-IMPORT BANK\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I come to the floor today to talk \nabout the Export-Import Bank--the program that is a vital tool of U.S. \nmanufacturers and small businesses across the United States of America \nto help them grow jobs and gain access to international markets.\n  There has been a lot written in the last 24, 48 hours about this \nbecause there has been a lot of discussion about people who have \npreviously supported the program--maybe voted for it five or six \ntimes--and now all of a sudden have either amnesia or have forgotten \nwhat is so important about this program.\n  I am here this morning to talk about this issue because I believe it \nis so vital to the U.S. economy and to the economic opportunities and \nchallenges we face.\n  The Export-Import Bank basically gives assistance in the form of \nsecuritizing loans that are sought by the private sector when a U.S. \ncompany tries to sell a product overseas.\n  You can imagine that if you are a U.S. manufacturer--and you could be \ninvolved in lots of different things; in our State, there is everything \nfrom aviation to grain silos to music stands to agricultural products--\nwhen you go and say, well, we want to sell to Ethiopia or we want to \nsell to a South American country or we want to sell to an Asian \ncountry--for example, a small businessperson in the State of Washington \nsays: Well, OK, I have found a customer in one of those countries for \nmy product--and I will use grain silos as example because there is a \ncompany in our State that now sells grain silos to 82 different \ncountries around the globe--that customer in that country says: Well, \nhow am I going to finance this deal? It is not exactly like this \nsophistication is present in every one of these developing countries. \nYet we want U.S. products to be sold into these developing countries.\n  I guess we could sit back on our laurels and just think it is all \ngoing to happen on its own and let the Europeans sell products into \nthat market or let the Chinese sell products into that market or we \ncould hustle--which is what the United States of America does--and we \ncan figure out a way to secure those deals when those customers have a \nchallenge of financing within their country.\n  Now, it does not mean that the Export-Import Bank finances all of \nthose deals. It means it provides, in a lot of cases, security so that \nwhen a private bank does finance the sale of that deal, there is \ncertainty and predictability.\n  Why is that important? Well, as one vice president of a bank that \noperates in 19 different States and the District of Columbia told us: \nMost banks, even those as large as--in this case--PNC, cannot alone \ntake risks for helping a U.S. company sell in countries with \ngovernments that may be less stable than the United States of America.\n\n  It makes sense. Right. Look at what we are seeing around the globe. \nWe are seeing lots of change. You cannot count on a deal and account \nfor the capricious nature of governments. If someone stiffs me in \nPittsburgh, I will just go to a court in Pittsburgh and win a judgment \nagainst these individuals. Well, you cannot practically expand that to \na government in Africa or in Asia. You cannot go to a court system here \nin the United States and say: Hey, that government failed to pay on \nthat particular customer deal that was enacted. But you can, with the \nhelp of the Export-Import Bank, secure those loans and make sure that \npayment is received.\n  That is why so many small businesses across the State of Washington \nlike and have used this program in conjunction with the private banking \nindustry.\n  For example, there is a company: Manhasset music stands. I love that \ncompany because it makes music stands somewhat like this podium I am \nspeaking in front of that is used for placement of music, and they sell \nall over the globe. In fact, China is one of their best customers. I \nlove that there is a place in Yakima, WA, that is figuring out how to \nsell a U.S.-manufactured product in China and that they are continuing \nto compete with the Chinese every day and winning that battle.\n  I am so proud that company uses the Export-Import Bank to reduce \ntheir risk to those customers because those customers live in a place \nwhere the banking and security might not be there.\n  Why is this so important? Well, first of all, 95 percent of consumers \nin the world live outside of the United States of America. So unless we \njust want to sell to people in the United States of America, we better \nhave a pretty good strategy of how we are going to sell to people \noutside of the United States of America.\n  So with 95 percent of consumers outside of the United States of \nAmerica and a rising middle class around the globe--the middle class is \ngoing to double in the next 20 years. It is going to double. That means \nmore people with more disposable income to buy products and to use \nservices that are so critical.\n  Take aviation, for example. Because there is a rising middle class \naround the globe and a lot more people want to travel, that is 35,000 \nnew airplanes that are in demand. That is how many we are going to have \nto build over the next 20 years--35,000 new airplanes.\n\n[[Page S3964]]\n\n  Well, that could be really good news for the United States of America \nand U.S. manufacturing because those are great middle-class \nmanufacturing jobs. But guess what. Those jobs are not secure. The \nBrazilians want to build airplanes. The Europeans already build \nairplanes. The Chinese want to build airplanes. They are all competing \nfor that rising middle-class market that is demanding new airplanes. \nThey all want to get in the action of having manufacturing jobs in \ntheir states.\n  So we need to make sure we implement the Export-Import Bank, which is \nabout to expire on September 30 of this year. Without the Export-Import \nBank, we are going to be hobbling businesses across the United States \nof America and not giving them these tools.\n  The Export-Import Bank has created thousands of jobs in the United \nStates of America. It has increased exports by $37 billion and helped \nsmall businesses and created jobs. It also helps us pay down the \nFederal deficit. It has generated over $1.057 billion returned to the \nU.S. Treasury. So it has actually helped us pay down the Federal debt. \nSo my colleagues who are now all of a sudden either having amnesia on \nwhy they supported the Ex-Im Bank or not coming forward to support it \nnow need to remember what a vital tool this is to the U.S. economy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I ask unanimous consent for another 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I want to close by saying that other countries use \nthese same financial tools. So a lot of my colleagues can see that \nother countries, for the same reason, when the marketplace does not \nprovide a private sector financial tool to securitize these products--\nit is important that the United States stay competitive with everybody \nchasing global market opportunities.\n  Let's not hobble U.S. manufacturing. Let's get the Export-Import Bank \nout of committee and reauthorized.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/25/senate-section/article/S3964-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3964]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor and Pensions is discharged from further \nconsideration of H.R. 803 and the Senate will proceed to the measure, \nwhich the clerk will report by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 803) to reform and strengthen the workforce \n     investment system of the Nation to put Americans back to work \n     and make the United States more competitive in the 21st \n     century.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 2:30 \nshall be equally divided and controlled between the two leaders or \ntheir designees.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, for the next several hours we will be \nmoving to a bill that the Senator from Washington, Mrs. Murray, and the \nSenator from Georgia, Mr. Isakson, have had the principal role in \nfashioning. They will have a chance to talk about that. In just a few \nminutes the chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nCommittee, Senator Harkin, will proceed with the bill. But before that \nhappens, I wish to take 3 or 4 minutes to talk about the importance of \nwhat is happening here.\n  In 1998 Congress passed a sort of ``GI bill'' for workers. The idea \nwas to do what is at the top of every Governor's agenda in every State \nright now: How can we help more Americans get the job skills to fit the \njobs?\n  When I was home in Granger County last weekend, the concern of \nTennesseans was that it is too hard to find a job; it is too hard to \nkeep a house; what can I do to get a job?\n  This legislation we are dealing with today, for the first time since \n2003, reauthorizes $9.5 billion in funds that will be spent through \nlocal workforce boards, through community colleges, and through State \ngovernments to help individuals in North Dakota, in Washington, in \nTennessee, in Georgia get the job skills to find a job. This bill will \nmake it easier for them for them to achieve that goal. It has the great \nadvantage of not mandating how they do it from Washington but creating \nan environment where people can do this for themselves.\n  Our former Democratic Governor Phil Bredesen said to me that when he \nfirst became Governor and went to find out about the $145 million of \nfederal workforce development funding that comes to Tennessee, he just \nthrew up his hands. He said: It is too complicated. I cannot do \nanything with it.\n  So he told his cabinet members: Do the best you can.\n  Well, working together with the House of Representatives, Senator \nMurray and Senator Isakson and a group of us here have taken this law \nthat was passed 16 years ago and made some dramatic changes to it. They \nwill tell you more about that. They will be talking about how we have \ntaken many of the 47 work-training programs that exist in the Federal \nGovernment and simplified them, eliminating 15 programs that were \nineffective or duplicative, eliminating 21 Federal mandates, \nstreamlining multiple plans into a single State plan that reduces time \nspent on paperwork, streamlining reporting requirements, giving \nGovernors more flexibility, giving local workforce boards more \nflexibility, and most importantly, giving the individuals who need jobs \nmore opportunity to say: This is what I would like to do, and this is \nwhat I choose to do.\n  This has been no easy task. Senator Murray and Senator Isakson \ndeserve a lot of credit from all of us because many Congresses have \ntried to reauthorize this law before. I am going to come back after \nabout an hour and deliver a little more extensive discussion on this, \nbut the 108th Congress, the 109th Congress, and the 112th Congress--all \ntried to do this but could not get a consensus about how to move \nforward. Finally, Congresswoman Virginia Foxx produced the SKILLS Act \nin the House of Representatives. The House passed this bill in March of \n2013. It came over here to the Senate. The Senate HELP Committee passed \nits bill last July. Led by Senator Murray and Senator Isakson, the \nSenate began working with the House, came up with an agreement, and, \nworking with a number of Senators, we have reduced the number of \namendments that actually have to be voted on today to two. So we will \nhave two amendments to be voted on and then will vote on final passage. \nThen we will send the bill back to the House. Hopefully the President \nwill have a chance to sign it.\n  I would like to say that I hope that in the midst of what is too much \ndysfunction in the Senate, this will be an example of what can happen \nwhen we put our minds to it.\n  The members of the HELP Committee, on which I am the ranking \nRepublican, and Senator Harkin, the ranking Democrat--we have some \npretty big philosophical differences. Ideologically, we are not the \nsame. But we have passed 19 bills out of the HELP Committee. 13 have \nbecome law this year. That is a record of accomplishment we are proud \nof. It shows that Senators with different opinions can come to a \nconsensus and come to a resolve.\n  So let me step aside now and let those who have really done the most \nwork on the bill speak--the Senator from Washington and the Senator \nfrom Georgia. I will be back in about an hour, and then we will be \nvoting a little later this afternoon. This is good news for the workers \nof America, for the Governors who felt hamstrung by Washington, for the \nworkforce boards who have been limited in their ability to meet the \nneeds of local employers and workers, and for Senator Coburn, who has \nbeen a real leader in pointing out how many duplicative work programs \nwe have. We have gone a long way in the direction he wanted us to go. I \ncongratulate all of those Senators for the result.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3378\n\n                (Purpose: In the nature of a substitute)\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, as provided under the consent \nagreement, I now call up the substitute amendment No. 3378.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent that all after the first vote at \n2:30 p.m. be 10 minute votes and that upon disposition of H.R. 803, the \ntime until 4:30 p.m. be equally divided between the two leaders or \ntheir designees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, just last month I joined seven of my \ncolleagues, Republicans and Democrats from the House and the Senate, to \nintroduce a critical piece of legislation called the Workforce \nInnovation and Opportunity Act. It is a bill to reauthorize and \ndramatically improve the Workforce Investment Act, or WIA, which \nauthorizes a number of critical workforce development programs in all \n50 States.\n  This legislation is something I have been working on for several \nyears with a number of our colleagues. It is something that is long \noverdue--for more than a decade. Since we introduced a compromise deal \nlast month, we have been working feverishly with our colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle and both sides of the Capitol to iron out any issues \nthey might have and make a few small technical fixes. We have made sure \nthat every single Member of the Senate and their staffs have had the \ntime to look through this deal, ask questions, and propose amendments. \nNow, today, we are one final step away from sending this tremendous \nbipartisan deal to the House of Representatives and then hopefully to \nthe President's desk.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a list of over \n100 organizations supporting this bill, including business groups, \nlabor, educators, Governors, mayors, and countless others.\n  Improving our Federal workforce programs is, as I said, something I \nhave been working on for more than a decade. During that time, I have \nheard from so many workers and businesses in my home State of \nWashington and across the country who tell me how important effective \nworkforce programs are for themselves and their communities. Business \nowners, large and small, have told me that while existing programs \nhelp, it has become harder and harder to find workers with the skills \nthey need to fill new jobs in the 21st century. Workers who want to \nadvance their careers or get back on the job after being unemployed \nhave told me that it is more and more difficult to get the education \nand skills they need to compete for the new jobs.\n  I am thrilled that we have reached this important step in the \nprocess. The reason this agreement was even possible is the incredible \nbipartisan process we have had over the last 2 months to reach a \ncompromise on which we could all agree. So today I thank my coauthors \nof this bill in the Senate for all of their hard work through the \nprocess and their work to rally support for it today: Senator Tom \nHarkin, a Democrat from Iowa, the great chairman of the Senate HELP \nCommittee; Senator Lamar Alexander, from whom you heard, a Republican \nfrom Tennessee and the esteemed ranking member of the HELP Committee; \nand finally, my very close partner in this process, Senator Johnny \nIsakson from Georgia.\n  Senator Isakson and I are the coauthors of the Senate version of this \nbill to reauthorize WIA. Throughout this process it has been an \nabsolute pleasure to work across the aisle with him to get this done. \nHis integrity and his commitment have been key to making this a \nreality.\n  Senator Isakson's office is right next door to mine. Whether it was \non the phone or while the two of us were walking over here to the \nChamber to cast votes, we must have had hundreds of conversations on \nhow to reach this point. So it means a lot for me to be here with him \ntoday.\n  I also thank a few other Senators whose commitment to improving our \nworkforce systems has been remarkable.\n  First of all, I thank Senator Enzi, our colleague from Wyoming. \nSenator Enzi and I have been working for a very long time to \nreauthorize WIA. More than once, we would be at the White House for \nmeetings, and regardless of the topic, wherever we were, he would tell \nPresident Bush and now President Obama: This should be a bipartisan \neffort we can all agree on. I think today's actions are proof that he \nwas right all along.\n  Second, I wish to recognize and thank Senator Sherrod Brown from Ohio \nfor his years of leadership on these issues. Senator Brown's \nunderstanding of the changes in the American economy and our places of \nwork is unparalleled. The State of Ohio should be very proud to have \nhim represent them in the Senate.\n  In particular, Senator Brown's work on the issues of skills, \nmanufacturing, economic competitiveness, and education reform have been \ncritical. In crafting this deal, we were fortunate to be able to draw \non his SECTORS Act and weave the concepts of that throughout this bill. \nIn fact, it is because of Senator Brown's strong advocacy that we were \nsuccessful in requiring SECTOR initiatives at both the State and local \nlevels, as well as including them in plans and functions and reports. I \nknow that in my State of Washington, we use SECTOR strategies in \neverything from aerospace industries to maritime, health, construction, \ngaming, finance, renewable energy, and viniculture. They all work to \nimprove the efficiency and effectiveness of our workforce system. I am \nvery proud that we have included sections in this bill and have worked \nwith Senator Brown closely and have benefited from his knowledge and \nleadership.\n  I also thank Senator Kay Hagan from North Carolina for her work on \nthis legislation. Her America Works bill provided us with a great \nframework to think about skills and certification and credentials and \nthe need to be closely aligned with employers. Because of her \nleadership and her vision, this bill requires that training that leads \nto recognized postsecondary credentials receive a priority, meaning \nthat both workers and employers benefit from the training provided \nthrough this act.\n\n  We also require that all States and locals report on the number of \ncredentials offered, meaning that the entire workforce system will be \nmore closely aligned to the needs of employers and workers and will \nyield more direct value in and for the marketplace.\n  I also wish to mention that Senator Hagan worked hard to ensure that \nwe focused not just on initial credentials but credentials that are \nindustry-recognized and both portable and stackable.\n  Finally, I thank Senator Franken from Minnesota, who represents the \nsame State as the late Senator Paul Wellstone, who was my Democratic \npredecessor lead on this bill.\n  True to Senator Wellstone's legacy, Senator Franken has shown a deep \nunderstanding of the needs of job seekers, workers, and employers, as \nwell as a passion to help them all advance and succeed.\n  I was very pleased to work closely with him on this legislation and \nensure that a number of his priorities were included. Lead among his \npriorities was building closer ties with our community colleges, and we \nworked hard to make sure that happened.\n  I am also pleased that we benefited from a truly innovative program \nin Minnesota, Twin Cities RISE!, which has been a pioneer in pay-for-\nperformance models for many years and which helped to inform our \ninclusion of pay-for-performance provisions in this bill.\n  So it is clear this bill is the product of many authors. And while we \nknow that nobody gets everything they want, I think at the end of the \nday we can all proudly say this bill will help our workers, our \nbusinesses, and our economy for years to come, because Federal \nworkforce programs have proven time and again that the best investment \nwe can make as a country is an investment in our American workers.\n  I have seen firsthand in my home State of Washington workers who were\n\n[[Page S3966]]\n\nlaid off who were able to get new training, new skills, and new jobs. I \nhave seen so many Washington State businesses--from our aerospace \ncompanies to video game design firms--that were able to access workers \nwith the new skills they needed to grow and compete.\n  But with millions of new jobs that would require postsecondary \neducation and advanced skills in the coming years, we will fall behind \nif we do not modernize our workforce development systems and programs \nnow. We have to make sure that when high-tech jobs of the 21st century \nare created, Americans are ready to fill them, and that is exactly what \nwe have all done in this bill.\n  We have doubled down on the programs that work, we have improved the \nprograms that have become outdated, and we have created a workforce \nsystem that is more nimble, adaptable, better aligned with what our \nbusinesses need, and more accountable so that they can continue to make \nit better.\n  We started with a House proposal, a Senate proposal, and we all met \nin the middle. That is exactly what the American people sent us here to \ndo, to work together to help our workers and help our economy grow.\n  This is an all too rare opportunity for all of us to get behind a \nstrong, bipartisan, bicameral bill.\n  I urge all of our colleagues to support the Workforce Innovation and \nOpportunity Act and send it to the House for a vote.\n  I thank my great friend and partner, who has spent innumerable hours \ngetting us to this point. I thank him, his staff, and all of our staffs \nwho have worked hard to find a compromise and not to find a fight.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act--Investing in America's \n                            Competitiveness\n\n\n                  List of Key Supportive Organizations\n\n       1.

I yield for Senator Isakson, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I have to say first and foremost that it has been a real \nprivilege to work with Senator Murray from the State of Washington. We \nare across the hall from one another. We see each other coming and \ngoing and coming back to the floor and from the office.\n  We have worked hard, our staffs have worked hard, and finally today \nlightning has struck. We are about today--in the Congress of the United \nStates--to reauthorize the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act and \naddress one of the significant challenges that face America today.\n  As we sit in this Chamber and talk about this bill, there are 10.6 \nmillion Americans who are unemployed. There are also 4 million jobs \nwaiting to be filled by people who need specific skills. This bill \ndeals with the skills deficit in America, and it is going to match some \nof those unemployed with some of those jobs to lower our unemployment \nrate and raise the rate of prosperity in American families. This is an \nimportant bill.\n  A lot of people who have watched the Senate over the past few years \nmight have said: How in the world did you reach an agreement on \nanything? You always seem to be fighting, you always seem to be \narguing.\n  I want to tell a brief story. About 1 month ago Senator Murray and I \njoined a few other Members of the Senate--Senator Harkin, Senator \nAlexander, a couple of Members from the\n\n[[Page S3967]]\n\nHouse: Representative Foxx of North Carolina and Representative Kline, \nthe chairman of the Education & the Workforce Committee in the House.\n  We didn't sit around a table and say: What is it that divides us? We \nsaid: What is it that unites us?\n  What unites us is the fact that the American people are looking for \nleadership from us to deal with the unemployment issue and the training \nissue. We have been languishing to try to authorize this bill for 12 \nyears. So we sat down and identified what we agreed on. We identified \nwhat the problems were. We worked with the Members of the House who \nopened up and said: Well, we passed the SKILLS Act, but we will sit \ndown, listen to your side, and try to find common ground.\n  After a few days, really--not weeks--we found common ground on 80 \npercent of the issues that confront us in workforce and investment \nareas. There are a few places where we found disagreement, sure--and so \ndid those stop us? No, because the perfect should never be the enemy of \nthe good, and this bill is the good of the Senate in terms of dealing \nwith issues.\n  I want to brag about a few people in this body, if I can, besides \nSenator Murray. I want to talk about Scott Cheney for a second, her \nloyal assistant. He sat in my office with me--about a week and a half \nago--side-by-side, staff and Senator, working out some of the details \non this bill.\n  I thank Tommy Nguyen on my staff who has worked countless hours for \ncountless years to make this happen.\n  David Cleary, the aide to the committee, the aide to Senator \nAlexander, has done a yeoman's job. In fact, he did probably as much of \nthe hand-holding in the past couple of weeks over amendments as anybody \nI know.\n  I thank Senator Enzi from Wyoming, who is my mentor in the Senate. \nWhen I was first elected to Congress, I was appointed to a Web-based \neducation joint commission between the House and the Senate. Mike Enzi \nwas the Republican Senator who was appointed to that commission. I was \nthe Republican Congressman. I didn't know Mike Enzi, but I watched him \nwork. I watched him find solutions to problems. I watched his quiet, \npatient work to find a solution, and I said: That is the guy I want to \nbe like.\n  He is the guy who really got Mrs. Murray and myself to this point \ntoday, because he has forged ahead when nobody else would.\n  When Chairman Kennedy was chairman of the committee before his tragic \nloss, Mike continued to work with Senator Kennedy and said: Let's try \nto find a way to do workforce innovation and opportunity.\n  I am glad we are doing it today, and we are doing it in large measure \nbecause of Senator Enzi.\n  Senator Tim Scott, who did yeoman's work, introduced the SKILLS Act \nthat was passed in the House and Senate. He could have folded his arms \nand said: I am going to be recalcitrant, I am not going to cooperate. \nBut he said: What can I do to help? There are some things I want to \nmake sure we do, but one thing I want to make sure we don't do is not \naddress the problem of unemployment and training.\n  Rob Portman was of tremendous help to us too. We had so many Members \nwhose ideas have been incorporated in this bill to deal with the issue \nof skill and deal with the issue of unemployment. I am so appreciative \nof each and every one of them, and I think the American people will \nappreciate them too.\n  I want to highlight a couple of features in here that are most \nimportant. Unlike most of what government does, we have scaled down the \nsize of workforce investment boards in the States and in the local \ncommunities so they are working numbers, not numbers that are so big \nthey can't work.\n  We put more money into training and less into bureaucracy. We scaled \ndown a number of workforce programs and consolidated them to maximize \nthe Federal dollar to benefit the State level. We gave the State level \nthe local authority to determine the curriculum of what was best for \nWashington or best for Georgia.\n  Washington is not a one-size-fits-all town, and workforce development \nis not a one-size-fits-all issue. Through the labor departments of the \nvarious States, we now are going to empower them to train people for \nthe jobs they need in their State, not the jobs Washington might think \nthey might have needed in their State. That is a tremendous advance \nforward in this legislation and equally very important.\n  Some people will sit on the floor and say: Well, did we get all we \nwanted? No, we didn't. Nobody did.\n  Did you get enough?\n  We got plenty.\n  There are a lot of labor commissioners and Governors who are going to \nbe celebrating. In fact, I have had two calls this morning from \nGovernors' offices or from labor department offices saying: Thank you, \nyou are finally giving us the power to address what we need to do in \nour State to address unemployment and address job training.\n  It has been a privilege for me to work with Senator Harkin, Senator \nAlexander, and Senator Murray.\n\n  To close, before I turn the floor over to Senator Harkin--who I think \nwill be next on the floor--I commend Senator Harkin on his leadership \nas the chairman. He and Senator Alexander gave us the encouragement \nthat we could get a bill done. They didn't insist on something they \nwanted in the bill to be there exactly like they wanted it.\n  As we all know, Senator Harkin is a champion for those with \ndisabilities. The disability section in this bill is outstanding to \nprovide training, opportunity, and rehabilitation for those who operate \nwith developmental disabilities; and that is what we should be doing on \nthe workforce, because their contribution is as important as the \ncontribution of any other single American.\n  Today is a great day for the Senate. It is also a great day for the \nworkforce in America. It is a great day for training and for the \nskills.\n  We want to fill the 4 million jobs that are vacant in America with 4 \nmillion of those 10.6 million who are unemployed in America--to raise \nprosperity, raise opportunity, and raise hope in America.\n  With that said, I yield the floor for the distinguished Senator from \nIowa, Senator Harkin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am pleased to join with my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle and in both Chambers today in taking up the Workforce \nInnovation and Opportunity Act that is a reauthorization of what we \nalways called the WIA bill, the Workforce Investment Act of 1998.\n  As the chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nCommittee, I can say we have worked on this bill, the one that we have \nhere now, for 5 years. This is the first reauthorization since 2003 of \nthe Workforce Investment Act.\n  I especially express my appreciation to Senator Isakson, Senator \nMurray, and Senator Alexander for their great working relationship and \nsticking to it for all these years when we didn't know if we were ever \ngoing to make it.\n  I see that our former ranking member Senator Enzi is here, who \nstarted with it when he was ranking member. I thank him also for all of \nhis work to get to this point.\n  What is that old saying? Slow cooking beats fast food any day.\n  This is kind of slow cooking, home cooking. It took a while but some \nof these things do take time. They take time to work out and get ironed \nout. I understand that.\n  But, again, I can't express my appreciation enough to my colleagues: \nSenator Isakson, Senator Enzi, Senator Murray, and Senator Alexander, \nfor their stick-to-itiveness, never giving up, and making sure that we \ngot to this point.\n  I also thank my House colleagues who worked closely with us over the \nlast several months: Representatives Kline, Miller, Foxx, and Hinojosa. \nDuring those months of negotiations, we reached a compromise between \nthe reauthorization bill the House had passed last year and the bill we \npassed out of committee in July of last year.\n  Again, with the great work of Senator Murray and Senator Isakson, \nworking with our House colleagues, we have a very good bill. It has the \nbroad support--broadly--from employers, to mayors, to Governors, to \norganized labor. Everybody is now supporting this bill. I suppose, as \nwith any piece of legislation that comes through the Senate, each one \nof those entities probably didn't get everything they wanted, but that \nis the art of compromise\n\n[[Page S3968]]\n\nand the art of getting good legislation through.\n  It couldn't come at a better time and a more needed time for \nreauthorization. As our economy continues to recover from one of the \nworst economic recessions in our history, it is more critical than ever \nthat we stand with our Nation's workers, our businesses, our young \npeople, citizens with disabilities, and with a commitment to help them \nprosper in the new jobs of the future.\n  Our economy has undergone substantial changes since the first \nWorkforce Investment Act bill of 1998. In fact, over the past 40 years, \nAmerica's backbone--the middle class--has been finding it harder and \nharder to make ends meet as wages have stagnated and costs have risen.\n  Quite frankly, a lot of the jobs of the past are gone. A lot of those \njobs aren't coming back. We have a new economy that we are now \nentering, and so a lot of people need to be trained, a lot of people \nneed to be retrained, and skills upgraded for these new jobs of the \nfuture.\n  That is what this bill does. It is part of the solution to this \nchallenge facing our middle class in America. Access to education, \ntraining, and employment services is critical to helping our workers \nsecure good jobs, gain access to the middle class, and become \neconomically self-sufficient.\n  This new bill includes provisions that support our State workforce \ndevelopment systems in providing employment and training services for \nadults, dislocated workers, and youth through State grant programs and \nthe public employment service. It also supports disconnected youth \nthrough programs such as an updated youth program focused on out-of-\nschool youth who need a second chance, such as Job Corps and \nYouthBuild.\n  It provides for employment and training activities for Native \nAmericans, migrant, and seasonal farm workers. It supports adult \nlearners through adult education and literacy programs, including \nservices for English language learners.\n  This bill includes innovative approaches to providing workforce \ndevelopment activities, including industry and sector partnerships, on-\nthe-job and incumbent worker training; transitional job strategies for \nthose who have poor work histories, but who would like to have more \nsteady and upgraded jobs; and workplace learning advisers who can help \neducate colleagues about services available in the workforce system.\n  One of the most important parts to me of this bill is a much-needed \nupdate to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.\n  I am particularly pleased that the bill addresses the \ndisproportionate burden of unemployment and underemployment experienced \nby people with disabilities in our country. Despite the enormous \nprogress we have made in ensuring that disabled people have the same \nrights and opportunities as all Americans, the sad fact is that the \nunemployment rate among people with disabilities in America is twice as \nhigh as people without disabilities, and their workforce participation \nrate is less than half that of the general population.\n  We have, quite frankly, failed to ensure that people with \ndisabilities meaningfully participate in the workforce. This bill makes \nmajor steps to correct this injustice. It will help a new generation of \nyoung people with disabilities to prepare for, obtain, and succeed in \ncompetitive integrated employment, not substandard subminimum wage \ndead-end jobs but in jobs in which people with disabilities can learn \nand grow to their maximum potential. That is what this bill would do, \nensure that young people with disabilities, let's say, who are in high \nschool and they have an IEP, Individualized Education Program, and they \nget through high school, are prepared for transition into the \nworkplace.\n  This bill includes things which will give them those experiences, \nsuch as part-time work, summer jobs, internships, workplace skill \ndevelopment, and preparation for jobs that are in high demand. \nBasically, we are going to give persons with disabilities the same \nsupports and experiences everyone else expects and receives and which \nthey haven't had in the past.\n  Through school as part of the IDEA Program, they have their IEPs and \nas soon as they quit they are dropped. That is the end of it or maybe \nthey go into subminimum wage jobs, and that is where they stay and they \nnever get skills upgrading, but we know from experience that people \nwith disabilities, whether it is intellectual or physical or a \ncombination of both, can learn and train and their skills can be \nupgraded just like anybody else so they can perform at their maximum \npotential.\n  Again, this bill requires State vocational rehabilitation programs to \nwork hand in hand with secondary schools, ensures that employers will \nhave the information necessary to recruit, hire, and retain people with \ndisabilities, and the bill focuses the efforts of State vocational \nrehabilitation on youth, requiring that 15 percent of their funds be \ndedicated to transitioning young people into competitive, integrated \nemployment.\n  I hope these efforts will directly address the high unemployment rate \namong people with disabilities, smooth the transition of young people \nwith disabilities into the competitive integrated workplace, and help \nemployers to support their employees with disabilities.\n  I thank my colleagues for working to make this bill one that will \naddress the outrageous status quo facing people with disabilities with \nregard to employment. More and more employers are finding that with a \nsmall bit of support or maybe a modification of the workplace, people \nwith disabilities can do those jobs and sometimes do them better than \npeople without disabilities. More and more employers are finding that \nout. In our former Workforce Investment Act bills, we didn't get to \nfocus on it that much. This bill now puts a major focus on it, and that \nis why I am so proud of this bill and why I think this bill is such a \nmajor step forward in all its regards.\n  This bill represents the best of what Congress can accomplish when we \nwork together. We have worked diligently to find areas of agreement in \nour committee where we can advance legislation on a bipartisan basis.\n  I heard Senator Alexander earlier mention this, and it is true that \non our committee we probably have the widest divergence of \nphilosophical views than any committee in the Senate, but we work \ntogether, both on a Senate level and on a staff level.\n  When this bill passes the Senate, it will mark the 18th bipartisan \nHELP Committee bill to successfully move to the Senate and this \nCongress, and--assuming the President will sign it--it will be the 14th \nbill passed out of our committee this Congress to be signed into law by \nthe President.\n  The House leaders have indicated that if the Senate acts swiftly to \npass this bipartisan, bicameral bill without substantial changes, they \nwill do the same, and we will be able to advance this bill to the \nPresident's desk in very short order.\n  It is a major victory for our workers, our businesses, and our \neconomy. I urge all my colleagues to join us in supporting this bill \nand in voting yes on final passage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Wyoming for \nallowing me to jump in for about 5 minutes.\n  This became an issue as we faced the greatest recession we have ever \nhad and, at the same time, we had GAO looking at how we are spending \nour money.\n  For just a little history so everybody will know, when GAO did their \nfirst report we had 47 separate job training programs run by nine \ndifferent agencies, and that year they looked at we spent $18.5 \nbillion. What we found is only two had metrics on them, and we weren't \neven paying attention to the metrics to use them.\n  I applaud the work of the HELP Committee, Senator Enzi, Senator \nIsakson, Senator Alexander, Senator Murray, and Senator Harkin, for \nbringing the bill to the floor. It is an improvement over what we are \ndoing, but I wish to offer a couple of points I think the American \npeople ought to know. We are not going anywhere far enough, not \nanywhere close to where we need to go.\n  The SKILLS Act coming out of the House markedly changed job training \nin this country. Now, this is a big modification to the SKILLS Act, but\n\n[[Page S3969]]\n\nthe SKILLS Act actually paid attention to the Government Accountability \nOffice. What they did is consolidate a lot of programs and put real \nmetrics and real competition into job training.\n  There are two critical flaws in this bill that I think are a \nmistake--and I know this bill is going to pass, so it is moving the \nball down the road. No. 1, there is no metric in the job training \nprogram to say: Did somebody get a job in the area that they were \ntrained for?\n  So it doesn't matter how many people we train. If there is no job and \nthey got no job for what they trained, we have wasted the money. So \nthat is not anywhere in the bill.\n  The second thing is the vast majority of money in this country that \nis spent on job training is Job Corps. When we ask behind the scenes \nwhy we didn't have major reform to Job Corps, it is because of all of \nthe parochial people they employ. In Oklahoma, it is over 1,000. Most \nof the Job Corps programs in Oklahoma are highly inefficient and \nfailing to do what we want them to do, and they are not going to be \nheld accountable with this bill.\n  So these are two really disastrous things that, had they been added, \nwould have made a real difference. And let me say why I can speak to \nthat. When the GAO put out their report on all the job training \nprograms, I had every one of my staffers in Oklahoma go to every job \ntraining, State and Federal, in Oklahoma. Let me tell you what we \nfound.\n  What we found was the Federal programs were totally failing. We were \nvery good at employing people in job training programs with Federal \nmoney, but when we looked for the outcome of whether we gave somebody a \nskill that gave them an ability to have a life, we failed.\n  Contrast that to Oklahoma's Career Tech system and their own State-\nfunded training programs, where they were 90-percent effective in \ngiving somebody a life skill.\n  So I am disappointed that the SKILLS Act didn't come over here and \nget voted on because that was what was in the SKILLS Act and it is \nreally accomplishing the goal.\n  My colleagues have been great with me in working on this bill to try \nto attest to and to accommodate my desires to see some changes. But \nthere are these two critical flaws, and it speaks to the lack of \ncourage in our country today that because we have people employed in \nJob Corps programs, we are not going to really shake that system up and \nmake it do what it needs to do.\n  I will never forget. I had a town hall meeting in Guthrie, OK, the \nlargest Job Corps training in Oklahoma, and I wrote a report that was \nhighly critical of it. They all came here, and I faced them down and \nsaid: Do you really want Federal Government money spent on your salary \nthat doesn't accomplish the goal of giving somebody a life skill? They \ncouldn't answer yes. They had to answer, no, they really didn't want \nthat.\n  But that is what Job Corps still is in this bill, and that is by far \nthe biggest job training program we have.\n  So I applaud the changes that we have made, the movements that have \ngone forward. But when there is no metrics on whether the skill that \nwas trained for got a job, we don't have any idea what we are going to \nbe measuring after this bill goes through.\n  No. 2, if we have not fundamentally gutted the present Job Corps \nsystem and changed it to where it is responsible to actually accomplish \na goal and hold them accountable--like we need to be holding the VA \naccountable--if we don't do that, we haven't really fixed anything.\n  This bill has no CBO score on it. It is at least $58 billion over the \nnext 6 years--at least. And we are going to vote on a bill again that \ndoesn't have a score.\n  So the intentions of my colleagues are pure, but I think they are \nmissing two critical provisions if they really want to fix job \ntraining. I thank them for their work. I appreciate their \naccommodation. I know this bill will pass and it is an improvement, but \nit is not going to fix the fundamental problems.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. I ask unanimous consent that, following my speech, Senator \nBrown from Ohio be allowed to speak next.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I rise today to speak in favor of the \nreauthorization of Workforce Investment Act.\n  I first thank Senator Johnny Isakson of Georgia, Senator Patty Murray \nof Washington, Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, and Senator Tom \nHarkin of Iowa for their hard work on this bill. We can see from that \nlist of Senators alone that this has been a truly bipartisan effort to \nreauthorize this Workforce Investment Act.\n  Of course, we have heard through the course of this discussion how on \nthe House side Kline, Miller, Foxx, and Hinojosa worked on it, which is \nbipartisan on that side of the building. And the two have been working \ntogether, which is bicameral. That doesn't happen a lot around here, \nbut on bills that make it through to the President's signature it does \nhappen, and it has happened on this one.\n  I thank the many Senators who have had suggestions for this bill. A \nlot of those suggestions have wound up in here. Some of them had \namendments that we will have to continue to work on in the future, and \nthey were very gracious in revising some of those so that they would \nfit what we are doing and still get the bill done. I know Tim Scott \ncould have taken a lot more credit for what he did in the House and \nwhen it came over here, but he has been extremely cooperative in using \nhis knowledge of the bill to further the bill. Senator Portman is \nanother critical Senator in working on it, and as we can tell by the \npassionate speech by Senator Coburn, there are things that could be \ndone and will need to be done in the future to make it an even better \nbill. But it is something that all of government ought to be doing--not \njust the workforce.\n  This is a day of elation for me. We have been working to improve this \nprogram for over 11 years. For 11 years this could have made a big \ndifference in our country's jobs. The Workforce Investment Act has been \ndue for reauthorization for 11 years. Who says the Senate works fast? \nWho says the Senate works slow? Hopefully, the Senate works and gets it \nright.\n  I am hopeful that now is the time we are able to get this important \npiece of legislation renewed and provide some much-needed help to \nAmerican workers and businesses through the new profile it provides.\n  The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act will transform the \nsometimes bureaucratic Federal job training system into a streamlined \nprogram that can help many more people learn the skills they need to \nget meaningful jobs. The reauthorization will eliminate 15 programs \nidentified as ineffective or duplicative--we don't do that very often--\nand 21 Federal mandates on State and local workforce boards. That is \nwhat we need to be doing throughout government.\n  This bill would apply common performance measures for all programs \nwith the focus on employment outcomes and employer satisfaction with \nthe trained workers. This will provide stronger accountability for \ntaxpayer dollars. These are all changes that are long overdue.\n  This piece of legislation also gives authority back to the State \ngovernments and equips them with tools to help small businesses. This \nbill provides Governors and State workforce directors what they told us \nthey needed in hearing after hearing. They wanted flexibility to use \nthe money where it was most needed. There were stovepipes where we \nrequired them to do certain things with the money even if they didn't \nhave customers that needed that part of the stovepipe, which meant that \nsome of the money went begging. So by actually eliminating some of the \nstovepipes, making the money more effective in this program, it \nincreases the value of the money that is there.\n\n  With this reauthorization States will better be able to meet the \nregional economic demand and provide training for jobs in which quality \nworkers are in short supply. We can help people get back to work by \noffering training for the skills and services needed in their \ncommunity. State and local officials are in the best position to \ndetermine the labor and job training needs of communities across the \nNation. The workforce and opportunity act will help improve our current \nstagnated\n\n[[Page S3970]]\n\neconomy and foster economic development for private sector job \ncreation. If it works as it should, hundreds of thousands of people \nwill be able to move into available jobs that are vacant because folks \ndon't have the right skills.\n  I remember the New York Times sent reporters out to see if there were \nany jobs available in the New York area. They came back and reported \nthere were thousands of jobs, there just weren't people trained to be \nable to do those jobs. That is what this bill is designed to do. Local \nbusinesses will finally be able to find workers who live in their \ncommunities who have a particular skill set that they need for their \nbusiness. The job training program that is included in the Workforce \nInnovation and Opportunity Act is what would get our economy going \nagain.\n  Job training programs are especially important to small-population \nStates such as Wyoming where skilled workers are in high demand and the \nsupply is short. We recently broke ground on the Wind River Job Corps \nCenter in Riverton, WY. The seven-building center will house 300 \nstudents and be the first of its kind in Wyoming. When the center opens \nin the next year or so, my constituents will be able to get the job \ntraining they need to succeed in their careers. This project would not \nhave been possible without the determination of the people of Wyoming, \nthe cooperation of the communities around there to provide facilities, \nthe land that was necessary, and legislation like the Workforce \nInnovation and Opportunity Act.\n  I particularly want to thank Senator Harkin for his recognition as \npart of the Appropriations Committee that Wyoming and New Hampshire \nwere the two States that didn't have job corps centers and the help he \ngave us in being sure there was money set aside to be able to do that \njob corps center. I also appreciate the emphasis on the youth bill that \nis in there where young people can work during the summer to actually \nlearn a trade while they improve their community.\n  On a broader scale, America is facing an economic climate that \nthreatens our ability as a nation to compete in the global marketplace. \nThis bill sends a clear message that we are serious about helping our \nAmerican workers and employers remain competitive and that we are \nserious about closing the skills gap that is putting America's long-\nterm competitiveness in jeopardy.\n  I have been on the floor recently discussing articles that declared \nthat our current Congress could be the worst ever and that negotiating \npolitical agreements is a lost art. More often than not this year \nSenators have had no opportunity to weigh in and dissenting opinions \nare rarely considered. But the HELP Committee has broken through the \nlogjam and produced a bipartisan bill with a bicameral effort that is \ngoing to get through the Senate without cloture, without filling the \namendment tree, or any of the other procedural tricks. That is a \ntestament to the hard work of Senators Harkin, Alexander, Murray, \nIsakson, and their staffs and others who have worked on this bill. \nTheir efforts are an example all of us should keep in mind in thinking \nabout how we can and should operate. Almost half of today's sitting \nSenators have been here less than 6 years, so they haven't seen many \ntimes when the Senate has worked as it should, as it could, as it did. \nI urge them to keep this Workforce Investment Act bill in mind.\n  The HELP Committee had the first opportunity to shape the \nlegislation. Members were able to iron out unintended consequences and \ninput there. That is how committees work. Then Senators Harkin, \nAlexander, Murray, and Isakson gave all 100 Members of the Senate the \nopportunity to improve the legislation.\n  It is important to note this isn't the first time the HELP Committee \nhas followed this process. A few months ago we passed the community \ndevelopment block grant for child education after it went through \ncommittee and after amendments were offered. I am glad the full Senate \nis finally considering reauthorization of this important piece of \nlegislation.\n  I urge my fellow Senators to pass this bicameral, bipartisan \nagreement based on commonsense policies that will stimulate growth and \nthe economy. The education and job training programs provided by this \nWorkforce Innovation and Opportunity Act are too important to working \nfamilies, businesses, local communities, and our Nation's economy to \ndelay it.\n  I yield the floor for the Senator from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. Thank you, Madam President, and thanks to Senator Enzi who \nis one of the most cooperative Members of the Senate on so many levels. \nHe and I cochaired the Air Force caucus together and he has been good \nto work with. When I sat on the Health, Education, Labor and Pension \nCommittee, he was a member known then, as he still is, as one you can \nreach out to and who would get things done.\n  Special thanks to Senator Isakson who is on the floor and to Senators \nHarkin and Murray who did so much to work with our office on our \nSECTORS ACT and the whole litany of workforce investment issues. I am \nindebted to them.\n  Passing this legislation would reauthorize and improve the Workforce \nInvestment Act which first was established some 15-plus years ago. It \nincludes critical workforce development programs that have helped \nthousands of Americans get on their feet. It provides streamlined one-\nstop services that empower adults and students and gives them the \ntools, skills, and the resources they need to find a new career and \nimprove their current skills. All of this helps to meet the needs of \nemployers looking for trained, skilled workers.\n  The Cuyahoga Works Career Center in Cleveland is one of those \nprograms. It is run out of The Cuyahoga County Library, known as one of \nthe best library systems in the country. The center told me of a few \nsuccess stories I wish to share.\n  A teacher was laid off from Cleveland Public Schools 3 years ago, \nsubstitute teaching while she worked with a Cuyahoga Works career \ncounselor. The counselor showed her how to use social networking and \nLinkedIn more effectively. As a result she connected with an \nadministrator in a local school district that invited her to discuss \nher job search. During this meeting the teacher learned that although \nshe had a strong background, she could benefit from taking a couple \ncomputer classes. The Cuyahoga Works career counselor directed her to \nthe library's Google workshops along with a few other computer courses. \nShortly afterwards the teacher let her career counselor know she had \naccepted a long-term position in one of the local school districts.\n  Let me share another Cuyahoga Works success story. While visiting the \nnew Cleveland casino, a Cuyahoga Works career counselor was stopped by \nan employee who had worked with this counselor on her job application. \nThe customer was extremely grateful and went so far as to introduce the \ncounselor to her supervisor explaining, ``This person is the reason I \ngot this job.''\n  It is clear that legislation such as this works. We know that to \ncompete globally we need workers who can quickly adapt to new \ntechnologies in business processes. So our workforce training programs \nmust be able to keep up with the times. That is what the Workforce \nInnovation and Opportunity Act does. It builds on existing success and \nupdates it for the 21st century workforce. Part of this improvement \nmeans we take a sector-based approach.\n\n  Since 2007, I have held some 250 roundtables around my State. From \nthe beginning of the first one at the Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce \nthrough a whole host of these in agriculture, with farmers and veterans \nand small businesspeople, workers and others, what I hear over and over \nis despite high unemployment, too many employers are having a hard time \nfinding workers with the skills necessary. As a result, job openings in \nhigh-growth industries--health care, energy, bioscience, even \nmanufacturing--are going unfilled.\n  The skill gap exists, especially for careers in high-tech fields and \nfor jobs that require more than a high school degree. But often the \nskills gap exists with people with less than a college degree. This gap \ndenies workers new opportunities they deserve. It undermines our \nNation's economic competitiveness\n\n[[Page S3971]]\n\nand limits our ability to attract new jobs and businesses. To close the \ngap, we need to create industry or sector partnerships to ensure that \nworkers have the right skills to get hired in high-tech emerging \nindustries with good-paying jobs. It means local communities--local \ncommunity colleges, local workforce investment boards, local labor \nunions, local small businesses--decide what they need to put these \nworkforce training programs together regionally in community after \ncommunity, whether it is in North Dakota, the Presiding Officer's \nState, or whether it is in my State of Ohio, driven by what kinds of \njobs are available.\n  That is why I introduced the Strengthen Employment Clusters to \nOrganize Regional Success--or SECTORS Act--back in 2008. I reintroduced \nthis legislation with Republican Senator Collins from Maine this year. \nI am pleased that provisions in today's bill are based on our \nbipartisan SECTORS bill. This modernization bill requires sector-based \npartnerships to ensure workforce training programs are developed with \nindustry input, with labor input, with local community investment, \nworkforce investment boards, with local businesses, whether it is in \nChillicothe or Akron or Toledo or anywhere in my State.\n  Given the difficulty of negotiations, I am grateful for Chairman \nMurray's dedication to this bill, for her prioritization of these \npartnerships, because we know from experience how important they are. \nWith too many Americans still unable to find work, we should do all we \ncan to ensure our workers are fully qualified to fill available jobs. \nThat is what the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act does, and \nthat is why I encourage my colleagues to support it.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. HELLER. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I also thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in both \nChambers of Congress for their efforts on this important piece of \nlegislation that is before us. I especially thank Senators Isakson, \nMurray, Alexander, and Harkin for their leadership on this issue and \nfor working together with our colleagues in the House to craft this \ncompromise. I am pleased that Congress has come together in a \nbipartisan manner to address the most pressing issue we face in the \ncountry, which is the need to restore our country's economic health.\n  We have a responsibility here in Washington to ensure that the needs \nof American workers, businesses, and job seekers are all being met. I \nbelieve we need a two-pronged approach to this problem: first, a full-\nfledged effort to grow the economy and create new jobs; and second, a \ntemporary safety net that helps people unable to secure a job in this \ncurrent economic environment. The bill now in front of us is a much-\nneeded effort to reauthorize and streamline the Workforce Investment \nAct of 1998, which is the primary Federal law concerning job training \nand workforce development programs. The services offered through the \nWIA Program--job search assistance, career counseling, skills training, \nand on-the-job training--are a critical part of the effort to grow our \neconomy and to ensure that workers are prepared for the job market.\n  Importantly, these programs are coordinated at the State and local \nlevels to ensure that the unique needs of our communities are \nappropriately addressed.\n  The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act takes some long overdue \nsteps to modernize our workforce investment system. It eliminates 15 \nprograms that have been identified as duplicative or ineffective. It \nremoves 21 burdensome Federal mandates on States and local workforce \nboards. It promotes State and local control and improves flexibility so \nwe can better respond to changes in our workforce or the economy. It \nalso improves accountability and transparency measures to guarantee \nthat these programs are operating efficiently and effectively.\n  Given that this law has been due for reauthorization for more than 10 \nyears, providing States and local communities the flexibility they need \nis vital to ensuring economic stability. We clearly cannot depend on \nthe Federal Government to provide workers and businesses with timely \nsolutions to help our workforce, so I am pleased this legislation puts \nmuch of that control back where it belongs.\n  The need to reauthorize these important programs is perhaps no more \napparent than in my home State of Nevada. Our State is one of the \nStates hit hardest by the economic downturn, and although we are slowly \nrecovering, we still have a long way to go. Industries that thrived for \nmany years suddenly stalled, leaving thousands of workers out of jobs. \nNevada had a double-digit unemployment rate for 4\\1/2\\ years, \nunfortunately topping the charts at nearly 14 percent for several \nmonths.\n  Over the past few years, I have spoken with employers and job seekers \nin Nevada to look for ways to restore the health of our economy and get \nNevadans back to work. Surprisingly, I heard from many employers that \nthey have job opportunities available, they want to hire more employees \nand grow their businesses, but they are having difficulty finding \nworkers with the necessary skill sets.\n  The skills gap problem isn't unique to Nevada. In fact, there are \nmillions of unfilled jobs throughout the country. With nearly 10 \nmillion Americans still unemployed and looking for work, we must take \nsteps to connect job seekers with employment opportunities in in-demand \nsectors.\n  I was proud to join Senator Joe Donnelly from Indiana in introducing \nthe Skills Gap Strategy Act to develop a solution to this particular \nissue, and I am glad the manager's amendment before us today also \nreinforces some of these principles.\n  The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act is a bipartisan, \nbicameral piece of legislation that represents real efforts to get our \neconomy back on track. Although no bill is perfect and the nature of \ncompromise means not everyone gets everything they want, I am grateful \nfor the work my colleagues have done in writing this bill. Although I \nwould have preferred to include efforts to provide stability for \nuemployed job seekers by temporarily extending unemployment insurance \nbenefits, I also recognize that these job training and workforce \ninvestment programs are essential in getting Americans back to work.\n  I still firmly believe that our economic recovery needs a two-pronged \napproach that grows the economy and provides stability for job seekers, \nand this bill is an important part of that equation.\n  While the Senate is in session, I call constituents back in my State \nand ask them to join me for a telephone town hall meeting. During one \nof the calls just last night, I asked Nevadans if they felt as though \nthe economy was improving. Of those participating, 26 percent said yes, \nthey do think the economy is improving; 13 percent said they were \nunsure; and 60 percent said no, they do not think the economy is \ngetting any better. On a ratio of 2 to 1, Nevadans feel that the \neconomic growth is lagging.\n  We need to fix this and pass policies to help turn this economy \naround. In the meantime, we cannot forget about the most important \nsafety net available to Americans. Make no mistake. I have every \nintention of continuing to work with my colleague from Rhode Island to \ntemporarily extend unemployment benefits for those who are seeking to \nwork.\n  I was proud to once again team up with the Senator from Rhode Island \nyesterday to reintroduce a new unemployment extension bill that would \nprovide 5 months of benefits with retroactive eligibility.\n  We will continue to work with our colleagues here in the Senate, the \nHouse, and this administration to pass this legislation to ensure that \nwe continue to provide this temporary safety net while still looking \nfor work.\n  Again, I thank my friends in both the Senate and the House for their \nwork on this much-needed legislation. This compromise effort proves \nthat Congress is capable of working together on legislation to help our \neconomy. I am hopeful this experience will encourage all of us to \ncontinue to work together to pass more bills, grow our economy, and \ncreate new jobs for people in Nevada and for all of the United States.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I am proud to rise today in support of \nthe Workforce Investment and Opportunity Act. I want to thank Chairman\n\n[[Page S3972]]\n\nHarkin, Ranking Member Alexander, Senator Murray, and Senator Isakson \nfor putting together a strong reauthorization of the Workforce \nInvestment Act. I am happy that we were able to come together in a \nbipartisan, bicameral way to reauthorize this bill.\n  As our Nation continues to look at how to best create, sustain, and \nsupport high-paying jobs, we must look at how best to educate our \nworkforce and how best to provide needed resources to fill jobs in high \ndemand. WIA does just that. It helps people learn new skills and \nincreases their chances of succeeding. This bill before us today is a \nmajor step toward improving WIA and helping our Nation remain \ncompetitive globally.\n  This bill allows local workforce boards to tailor services based on \nregional employment and workforce needs. This means that workers will \nget access to education and training for the skills needed to fill \njobs, including professional development. It helps ensure that Federal \nworkforce and training programs are working together by bringing \ntogether multiple programs and providers into a unified State plan to \nbreak down barriers and improve efficiency and effectiveness. This bill \nalso ensures that all WIA programs are held to one set of common \nperformance measures. This will help integrate case management and \nreporting systems while strengthening evaluations. Finally, this bill \nensures that youth with disabilities will be provided the services and \nsupport they need to be successful in competitive, integrated \nemployment.\n  I am particularly proud that this bill takes an in-depth look at \nnontraditional occupations. These are jobs where a gender makes up less \nthan 25 percent of the workforce for that occupation. Women currently \nrepresent half of our Nation's workforce, but two-thirds of women are \nconcentrated in 21 of 500 occupational jobs. Except for nursing and \nteaching, most of these jobs are among the lowest paid, including work \nin retail, service, and clerical jobs. Less than 16 percent of women \nwho go through federally funded workforce programs receive any \ntraining. Most only get a ``needs'' assessment and receive help in \nfinding a job. The economic recovery is leaving women behind. Of the \n1.3 million jobs gained in the United States, nearly 90 percent went to \nmen. Men have since regained 19 percent of jobs lost while women have \nonly regained 6 percent. The incomes of women in the workforce are too \noften not adequate for a decent standard of living to support a family. \nThis bill would require one-stop career centers to provide info to \nindividuals, including women, on opportunities in fields that are \nnontraditional. It requires reporting related to job-placement services \nfor participants, including the number and percentage of participants \nwho enter a nontraditional occupation. It also requires all programs to \nmake an effort to develop programs that increase employment \nopportunities for those that are interested in nontraditional work.\n  The Workforce Investment and Opportunity Act supports our workforce \nin providing education and training for millions of America's workers. \nIt ensures that local workforce boards have the flexibility needed to \nmeet their regional needs. It encourages better coordination between \nFederal workforce and training programs and State and local efforts to \nattain economic development. It requires all programs to be \naccountable, and it provides more opportunities for youth with \ndisabilities. This bill is a downpayment on our middle class and our \nNation's future. It is my hope this bill be passed in a swift, \nexpeditious, and uncluttered way and continue to work with Members on \nboth sides of the aisle and across the dome to improve our workforce \nsystem.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to rescind \nthe quorum call.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, while the Senator from Iowa is still \non the floor, I wish to compliment him. The committee which he chairs--\nof which I am the ranking member--has produced 19 bills this year for \nthis Congress, 10 of which have become law. No other committee has \nproduced as much--this will add one to that--and that is not because we \nagree on everything.\n  The truth is we disagree on a lot of things, but we have found a \nway--when there is a chance to get a result--to come together.\n  Senator Harkin has helped to create an environment in which Senator \nIsakson and Senator Murray, and a group of other Senators, have finally \nbrought this Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act to a conclusion, \nand a lot of other Senators have tried, and it has taken a long time to \ndo it. Our focus today should be on the workers of America and people \nwho need jobs.\n  I think it is important to point out that when the Senate tries to do \nit this way and allow everybody to have a chance to have a say, we can \nget a pretty good result. This is $10 billion, and for our State--I say \nto the Senator from Iowa--it is $145 million for the single biggest \nissue in our State: How do I get a better job? It is not a matter of \nWashington telling you how to do that. This is a bill that empowers \nStates to enable people to get the skills they need so they can get a \nbetter job.\n  I thank the chairman for the way he has worked on this, and I wanted \nto say that while he was on the floor.\n  Madam President, I urge my colleagues to support this act today. It \nis a jobs bill. I was home in Grainger County in East Tennessee this \npast weekend working with the Clinch-Powell Cooperative. It is a great \norganization which helps people with home foreclosures and helps them \nto find a job.\n  The worry they have is that it is too hard to find a job. The worry \nof the National Federation of Independent Business Leaders--whom I \ntalked with in Knoxville--is that it is too hard to create a job. We \nall have our reasons for that. On our side of the aisle, we think there \nare too many taxes, rules, regulations, and mandates from Washington \nthat make it harder for a person who wants to create a job to do that.\n  I had one Tennessee small business man tell me he was looking at new \nemployees as a liability more than an asset. He said: I hate that. I \nwant to think of every one of my employees as an asset. When I hire \nthem, I have to think about this health care cost or this tax cost or \nthis regulatory cost, and all these extra costs, and they become, in my \neyes, a liability and that discourages me from hiring anyone. That is \none reason why so many Americans are having a hard time finding a job. \nAnother reason is--and the reason we are working together today on this \nbill--because the skills don't fit the job.\n  We have a very good Governor in Tennessee whose name is Bill Haslam. \nI think his priority is the same as every other Governor whom I know in \nthe country, which is he is trying to grow and attract jobs. What he \nhears from every employer is: We have the jobs, but the employees don't \nhave the skills.\n  Our Governor is working hard, for example, to create a program with \nBridgestone Corporation--the big tire maker headquartered in \nTennessee--at the community college and technical institute level, \nwhere the institute would train people with the exact skills that \nBridgestone needs. So many of the new jobs today require more skills \nthan they used to.\n  I was Governor when the Nissan plant came to Tennessee, and it was a \nsurprise to a lot of people. Automobile plants used to have 20,000 or \n30,000 people, but the Nissan plant only had 3,000 or 4,000 or 5,000 \npeople there. Now it has a few more, but it is the largest automobile \nplant in North America--and the most efficient. I imagine it is as \nprofitable as any automobile plant. But the jobs at the Nissan plant \nhave a lot higher standards and a lot higher skills for the employees.\n  It is the same today as it was 30 years ago--the biggest challenge \nthey have is finding Tennesseans, or other people, who have the right \nskills for the right jobs.\n  What can we in Washington do to help with that?\n  Well, we could sit here and in our wisdom write a lot of rules and \nprescriptions about just how to do that. In fact, that is what has been \nhappening with the Workforce Investment Act. It started out in 1998 as \nsort of a GI bill for workers. The idea was we would make it easier for \npeople to find jobs. We would create work councils in the States, give \nGovernors flexibility, allow them to make arrangements with community \ncolleges, such as the one I just described with Bridgestone. But then \nthe old Washington disease set in, and you know what it is: I have a \ngood idea, let's make everybody do it. Pretty soon we had 47 workforce \nprograms, and according to a Government Accountability Office report, \n45 of them were duplicative.\n  Well, the Senator from Oklahoma, who is retiring this year--which I \nregret very much--Senator Coburn, has led the charge. He asked for that \nreport, and he pointed out to us that we are wasting money and not \nhelping people when we spent $9.5 or $10 billion through the Workforce \nInvestment Act, which is just a few of those programs, in such a \ncomplicated way.\n  I mentioned on the floor of the Senate a while ago what our former \nDemocratic Governor Phil Bredesen said. Governor Bredesen was a very \ngood Governor and businessman. He likes to get results. He took a look \nat the Workforce Investment Act programs that were coming to Tennessee \nfrom the Federal Government through a dozen or more work councils, and \nhe just threw up his hands.\n  He said: I told the commissioner of employment security to just do \nwhat you can with it. There were too many well-intentioned rules and \nregulations\n\n[[Page S3974]]\n\nfrom Washington that caused these programs to be such a maze that \nGovernors and work councils could not deal with them. The work councils \nwere massive. There were 50 or 60 people who required someone up here \nsaying: This is who you have to have. There were duplicative proposals. \nInstead of allowing people who wanted a job to say, I would like to \nhave this kind of job with these kinds of skills, we were telling them \nwhat kind of skills they needed to have. This was not working.\n  The House of Representatives passed something called the SKILLS Act, \nwhich suited most of us on the Republican side of the Senate better \nbecause it eliminated more programs, eliminated more mandates, gave \nmore discretion to Governors, and decentralized the program.\n  The Senate passed a bill through our committee that we didn't like \nnearly as well because it still had too many Washington rules and \nmandates in it.\n  Senator Isakson, who is on the floor, and Senator Murray from \nWashington, led a group of Senators who worked with the House--led by \nCongressman Klein and Virginia Foxx and others--and we resolved our \ndifferences. Basically, what we have done is we moved a long way from \nwhere the House of Representatives bill was. I will be specific about \nwhat the bill does that I think makes a difference.\n  It eliminates 15 programs that were identified as ineffective or \nduplicative. It eliminates 21 Federal mandates on State and local \nworkforce board compensation. In other words, we are saying to \nTennessee, which I think has 13 workforce boards: OK, we don't think we \ngot a lot smarter flying to Washington this morning. You can decide \nmore about who is on your workforce board because we assume you know \nmore about what is going on.\n  It replaces multiple State plans for multiple Federal programs that \nhave to be submitted to Washington with a streamlined single-State plan \nthat will reduce time spent on paperwork.\n  We are going to spend $10 billion of the taxpayers' money--nearly \n10--so we ought to have some accountability, and we ought to know what \nis happening, but we don't need everybody spending more time filling \nout forms than they are helping people find jobs.\n  This bill also streamlines reporting requirements, and it focuses on \nreal outcomes, such as job placement, retention, earnings, credentials, \nand employer earning satisfaction.\n  The second broad thing the bill does is support local and State \ndecisionmaking and flexibility. In that sense it is like a block grant. \nIt reinstates the authority of Governors to reserve up to 15 percent of \nformula funds for innovative State and local programs. I like that.\n  I used to be a Governor. I used to think that the Governor of our \nState--and I still do--knows more about how to make job training work \nin Tennessee than anybody up here because he is there, not here, so let \nhim or her be in charge of a large part of that. It gives local \nworkforce boards the freedom to transfer up to 100 percent of funds \nbetween the two largest formula programs serving adults and dislocated \nworkers.\n  In other words, if the money we have allocated doesn't really fit \nHohenwald, TN, as well as it does New York City or Madison, WI, or \nAtlanta, GA, then the local workforce board can transfer money from \nthis program to that program. That just makes common sense. It gives \nStates the ability to incentivize and award performance.\n\n  It allows people who want a better job, people who want job training, \npeople who are out of a job to choose the career and training service \nthat best meets their needs, and it empowers Governors to recognize or \nconsolidate local areas that are low-performing in order to better meet \nregional needs.\n  Finally, it tackles the accountability issue which we all care about. \nIt authorizes consistent measures of quality, including a 5-percent \nreduction in funding for poor-performing programs. It requires the U.S. \nDepartment of Labor to conduct independent evaluations of programs at \nleast once every 4 years.\n  This is a good piece of work on the No. 1 subject in this country. \nWhether one is a Democrat or a Republican, jobs is the issue. It is too \nhard to find a job. It is too hard to create jobs. We have some \ndifferences of opinion about what to do about it, but I think we agree \nthat matching the job skills to the job is a solution for millions of \nAmericans.\n  I believe and I suspect most of us believe that in the Internet age \nspecially, what we should be doing rather than mandating so many \nanswers from here is empowering Governors and empowering local leaders \non workforce boards to enable people who want a better job or a job at \nall to choose what they want to do and to do it. So in Tennessee \nGovernor Haslam will now have much more freedom and $145 million a year \nto spend on helping Tennesseans get a better job at Bridgestone or at \nthe Nissan plant or start their own work because we are enabling, we \nare empowering. We are not mandating. We are doing less telling. And \nfrom the taxpayers' point of view, we are avoiding the waste of a lot \nof money by avoiding duplication.\n  I wish to thank Senators on both sides of the aisle for working \ntogether so well on this, particularly on our side of the aisle. I know \nSenator Harkin and Senator Murray worked well with the Democratic \nMembers. We appreciate their patience as we worked through this.\n  We had a number of Republican Senators whom Senator Isakson and I \nworked with, and I would like to acknowledge their role, starting with \nSenator Isakson. He was the majority leader of the Georgia--well, I \nguess he was the minority leader of the Georgia Senate. He was the \nRepublican leader. At that time, they didn't have a majority; they just \nhad a few Senators. But he learned the skills of negotiation and \ncompromise in order to get a result, while still sticking to his \nconservative principles, and I like to see that skill. So on our side \nof the aisle he gets most of the credit for the result we are getting.\n  Right up there with him is Senator Mike Enzi of Wyoming, who worked \non this, Senator Enzi says, for nearly 10 years. Now, that may seem \nhard to do, but this bill was supposed to be reauthorized after 2003, \nand this is 2014. So Senator Enzi brought it a long way, and we are \ngrateful to him.\n  In addition, Senator Collins and Senator Murkowski are cosponsors of \nthe bills.\n  Senator Scott from South Carolina played a great role by picking up \nthe SKILLS Act from the House and bringing it over to the Senate and \nreminding us that we needed to get rid of this maze of regulatory \nproblems and go as far in that direction as we could possibly go. So in \nhis first year in the Senate, Senator Scott has played a major role in \nthe passage of a very important piece of legislation.\n  I have mentioned Senator Coburn before. We all acknowledge there is \nno one on either side of the aisle who is more relentless in looking \nfor waste, fraud, and duplication than Senator Coburn. Through his work \nand his staff's work, he put the spotlight on the fact that 44 of our \n47 workforce programs were duplicative and wasteful. That is not him \nsaying that; that is the General Accountability Office saying that.\n  Senators Lee and Flake worked with us, and they will be offering \namendments today.\n  Senator Portman made significant contributions to the legislation, \nand we thank him for that.\n  Senator Hatch and Senator McConnell made important contributions, and \nSenator Toomey and Senator Coats did as well.\n  There are a number of other Senators who did something we would like \nto see more of around here; that is, they didn't insist on every right \nthey had. We are a body that operates by unanimous consent, so if we \nall insist on all the rights we have, we don't do anything, which is \nwhere we find ourselves sometimes. But there were a number of Senators \nwho had good ideas, who had proposals they would like to see adopted. \nMany of those we were able to incorporate in the manager's amendment, \nbut then some we just couldn't. So they stepped aside and they thought \nit was more important that we go ahead and come to a consensus and get \na result.\n  In conclusion, let me say this: The other night the Senator from \nGeorgia and I were at the home of the Australian Ambassador to the \nUnited States. He was talking about this body. The Australians love the \nUnited\n\n[[Page S3975]]\n\nStates--especially Kim Beazley, the Ambassador. He is a Labor Party \nmember. In our country, that would be called a Democrat. But he is a \nbig pro-American former Minister in Australia.\n  He said: You know, we envy the U.S. Senate. It is the greatest \ntribunal in the world. We all wish we had it.\n  It made us all stop and think. Are we really living up to the respect \nfor this body that people around the world have for the U.S. Senate \nwhen it is operating the way it should?\n  Well, today it is operating the way it should, but a lot of the time \nit does not.\n  How should it operate? The Senate is different because it is the \nsingle legislative body in the world that is designed for extended \ndiscussion of an important issue until it comes to a consensus, and \nthen we cut off debate and then we get a result, if it is possible. \nThat is how we get a civil rights bill. That is how we get Social \nSecurity. That is how we get a workforce investment act. We have \nextended discussion and debate and amendment and vote on an important \nissue until we come to a consensus.\n  Why is a consensus needed, which means 60 votes instead of 51 much of \nthe time? Because we govern a complex country by consensus. We don't do \nit by order or edict or any partisan way.\n  This is a very complicated bill. It brought here today by unanimous \nconsent, but that is only because we have debated it for an extended \nperiod of time here in the Senate and we have come to a consensus about \nit. We have given up on a lot of ideas we had. If we had our way, we \nwould pass the SKILLS Act in a minute--almost every single Republican \nwould--but that is not what the Democrats would do. So we have come to \nan agreement in the Senate, and we have come to an agreement with the \nHouse. That is the consensus. As a result of that, Governors, such as \nthe Bipartisan Policy Center's Governors' Council, have praised this \nresult. I believe our Governor in Tennessee, Governor Haslam, will \nbe delighted with it. I think our former Governor, Governor Bredesen, \nwho threw up his hands when he saw the maze he had to work with a \ncouple of years ago, will welcome what we have done.\n\n  I thank the Senators on both sides of the aisle who have done this. \nMy hope is that this is a disease that is infectious and that we see a \nlittle bit more of this kind of legislating in the Senate.\n  I would like to extend my deep thanks and sincere appreciation to the \ndedicated staff that worked on this bill to reauthorize the 16 year old \nWorkforce Investment Act for the past several years. Without their hard \nwork and tireless effort we wouldn't have been able to reach the \nsuccessful conclusion on the passage of this important bipartisan bill.\n  I would like to thank Scott Cheney on Senator Murray's staff, who has \nbeen working on this reauthorization effort for many years, as well as \nEvan Schatz.\n  Senator Isakson's staff worked hard with Senator Murray and our \nRepublican offices throughout the Committee process and in coming to \nthis final agreement, including Tommy Nguyen and Brett Layson.\n  I would also like to thank some former staff who put a lot of time \ninto this reauthorization effort in the 112th Congress, including Glee \nSmith who worked for Senator Isakson, as well as Beth Buehlmann and \nKelly Hastings who worked for Senator Enzi on the HELP Committee.\n  The Chairman of this committee has an outstanding staff that are very \ncapable and dedicated, particularly Crystal Bridgeman, Michael Gamel-\nMcCormick, Lee Perselay, Mildred Otero, and Derek Miller.\n  Our partners in the House of Representative deserve great thanks for \ntheir willingness to come to the table and negotiate a pre-conferenced \nagreement, including Rosemary Lahasky, Brad Thomas, James Bergeron, Amy \nJones, Leticia Mederos, Michele Varnhagen, and Jacque Chevalier on the \nmajority and minority staff of the House Committee on Education and the \nWorkforce.\n  Many of our Senate Republican offices deserve thanks for their work \nwith the HELP Committee on amendments and other technical fixes to the \nbill, including Denzel McGuire and Katelyn Conner on Senator \nMcConnell's staff, Christopher Toppings and Natasha Hickman on Senator \nBurr's staff, Leila Kimbrell and Kate Williams on Senator Murkowski's \nstaff, Laura Pence on Senator Coburn's staff, Kristin Chapman on \nSenator Enzi's staff, Nick Butterfield and Pam Thiessen on Senator \nPortman's staff, Christy Knese and Wendy Baig on Senator Lee's staff, \nChandler Morse on Senator Flake's staff, Diane Browning and Katie Neal \non Senator Hatch's staff, Dimple Gupta on Senator Toomey's staff, Casey \nMurphy on Senator Coats' staff, and Lizzy Simmons on Senator Scott's \nstaff.\n  We know these bills don't just suddenly appear. The Senate \nLegislative Counsel staff work long hours on the bill and then on the \namendments, so I would like to especially thank Liz King, Amy Gaynor, \nChelsea Koester, and Kristin Romero.\n  And we always rely on the experts at the Congressional Research \nService to give us good information in a timely manner, so I extend our \nthanks to David Bradley and Benjamin Collins.\n  Finally, I would like to thank my staff. They have put a lot of time \nand effort in to make this a process that the Senate and American \npeople can be proud of and I appreciate their efforts and late nights \non this bill. So, my thanks go out to Patrick Murray, Bill Knudsen, \nPeter Oppenheim, David Cleary, Diane Tran, Jim Jeffries, Margaret \nAtkinson, and Liz Wolgemuth.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. FLAKE. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3379 to Amendment No. 3378\n\n  Mr. FLAKE. Madam President, I call up my amendment No. 3379.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Flake] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3379 to amendment No. 3378.\n\n  Mr. FLAKE. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In section 116(g)(2), strike subparagraph (A), and insert \n     the following:\n       (A) In general.--If such failure occurs for a program year, \n     the Governor shall take corrective actions, which shall \n     include development of a reorganization plan through which--\n       (i) the Governor shall--\n\n       (I) prohibit the use of eligible providers and one-stop \n     partners identified as achieving a poor level of performance; \n     or\n       (II) take such other significant actions as the Governor \n     determines are appropriate; and\n\n       (ii) the Governor may require the appointment and \n     certification of a new local board, consistent with the \n     criteria established under section 107(b).\n\n  Mr. FLAKE. Madam President, I am pleased to have the opportunity to \noffer this amendment today, and I appreciate my colleague, the ranking \nmember of the HELP Committee, working with my office to make this \npossible.\n  The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act the Senate will vote on \ntoday establishes a performance accountability system for adults and \nyouth core programs provided for within it. This bill also establishes \nsanctions for both States and localities that fail to meet the \nestablished accountability measures.\n  My proposed amendment works to increase accountability in local \ntraining programs and one-stop providers.\n  As the bill currently stands, a Governor can only take corrective \naction if a local area fails to meet performance accountability \nmeasures for 3 years in a row. That is a long period of time. My \namendment moves the timeframe that a Governor can get involved in \nfailing programs lacking corrective actions from 3 years to 1 year. I \nthink that makes sense, certainly. Simply put, if training providers \nand one-stop partners are identified as ``poor performers'' after 1 \nyear, the Governor\n\n[[Page S3976]]\n\nshould be required to remove them from the list of eligible providers. \nThis amendment is simply common sense. Why should poorly performing \nprograms continue to miss performance accountability measures for 3 \nyears in a row before a Governor can get involved and take corrective \naction?\n  In addition, under this amendment a Governor could replace a local \nboard if necessary after just 1 year, but that wouldn't be required.\n  My hope is that if we are going to do these kinds of things--if we \nare going to provide these funds--States and localities should work \ntogether to make these programs as successful and beneficial as \npossible.\n  I believe this amendment will provide an additional level of \noversight of these programs, and I ask my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  Shifting now from this specific amendment, I now wish to talk a \nlittle bit about the amendment process in general and the position we \nfind ourselves in today in this body.\n  At their core, amendments offered on the floor serve as an \nopportunity to not only thoroughly debate an issue. We all know that \nlegislation is often brought to the floor having only had the benefit \nof input from just a few Members. What amendments do is provide \nindividual Senators the chance to change and often improve legislation. \nThey are a right in this body, not a privilege.\n  I believe in this fundamental process so strongly that I have \nsupported controversial cloture motions and other motions to proceed on \nunderlying bills even if I did not support that legislation, simply on \ngood-faith assurances that amendments would be offered and that \namendment debate would be allowed. Even though I did not support the \nbill as it stood, I would at least have the opportunity to make it \nbetter through an open legislative process. That is how I felt on a \nnumber of pieces of legislation that have moved through this body.\n  Unfortunately, many of these assurances were not met and my fear is \nthis body will continue to pass legislation with little to no amendment \nconsideration.\n  Since last July, Republicans have only had 11 rollcall votes on \namendments, including the 2 we will see today. By comparison, in the \nother body, House Democrats have had over 160 votes on amendments \nduring that same period--160 for the minority party in the House of \nRepresentatives. That is more than 14 times the votes Senate \nRepublicans have had.\n  As my good friend from Kentucky pointed out earlier, Representative \nSheila Jackson Lee has singlehandedly received more amendment votes \nthan all Senate Republicans, given that she has had 15 votes on her \namendments since last July in the House of Representatives.\n  Some who lionize this Chamber--and I am one of those--as the world's \nmost deliberative body often take a dim view to the practices of the \nHouse--I am not one of those; but this is supposed to be the more \ndeliberative body with open amendments and open debate--they will cite \nwith trepidation the restrictive and structured approach to debate in \nthe House and, with a shudder, the very fact that the House has the \ndread Rules Committee that picks and chooses which amendments will be \noffered. I can tell you from experience, when it comes to the ability \nto offer amendments, I now long for those days in the House.\n  During my service in the House, between the 107th and 112th \nCongresses, I personally offered--this is offered; not filed, but \noffered on the floor of the House of Representatives--239 amendments. \nIn fact, in the last four Congresses, I offered between 30 and 70 \namendments per Congress.\n  Outside of the sheer volume, one could reasonably chuckle at my \namendment batting average since very few of my amendments passed. But I \nactually had more amendments adopted in the past two Congresses each \nthan we have had rollcall votes on Republican amendments in the Senate \nsince July.\n  Under both Republican and Democratic leadership in the House, my \nright to offer amendments, particularly during the appropriations \nprocess, was respected. They were respected by both parties, even when \nI was offering dozens of earmark-limitation amendments that most of my \ncolleagues preferred not see the light of day.\n  Many of my colleagues here in the Senate served with me in the House. \nThey all remember those times. Nobody wanted to vote on Flake \namendments. These earmark-limitation amendments were not popular. They \noften did not get many votes. But, in fact, in all but one of the 140 \nearmark-limitation amendments I offered, they failed--all but 1. But I \nthink we can all agree that joining with a small handful of my \ncolleagues to spotlight precisely what was going on in these \nappropriations bills ultimately aided in the current earmark moratorium \nthat is in force by both Houses. That is a good thing.\n  While I prefer to have my amendments prevail, that certainly should \nnot be the test for whether I am afforded the ability to offer them.\n  Unfortunately, in my short time in the Senate, I have filed 85 \namendments to improve underlying legislation and to address issues \nfaced by my constituents. It is worth noting that this will be my first \namendment that will be voted on by my colleagues.\n  During last year's NDAA consideration, I filed an amendment that \nwould simply ask DOD to report on OCO spending. The amendment would \nhave required an accounting of OCO funds appropriated during fiscal \nyear 2013 and requested in fiscal year 2014 and would have withheld 10 \npercent of the budget for the Office of the Secretary of Defense until \nthe report was received. This amendment is not a fundamental policy \nchange; it is simply a reporting requirement that all of us would \nbenefit from.\n  Last week, I filed 30 amendments to the minibus appropriations bill, \nbut not one is likely to see the light of day. With no disrespect to my \ncolleagues, and having served on the Appropriations Committee in the \nHouse myself, I think we can all agree that spending bills benefit from \na good scrubbing by this entire body before they move through the \nlegislative process.\n  For example, one of those amendments would have reduced the USDA \nSingle Family Housing Direct Loan Program from $560 million to $360 \nmillion--the same amount as is in the President's budget. I think most \nof us would be surprised to learn that the Department of Agriculture \nhas a Single Family Housing Direct Loan Program and that we are funding \nit to the tune of $560 million. The President wants to move that down \nto $360 million. I agree with the President. We ought to. At least we \nought to be allowed to debate it and vote on it.\n  This is not an outlandish amendment. It would simply reduce funding \nlevels to the President's request and, more importantly, give this body \nthe opportunity to discuss the merits of the program.\n  I know some of my colleagues will disagree and will ultimately oppose \nmany of these amendments and others if they come to a vote, and that is \nfine. What is not fine is the fact that we in the U.S. Senate cannot \neven have that debate.\n  To be clear, this is not just a Republican concern. A recent article \nin the Hill mentioned how my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nare seemingly just as frustrated with the current amendment process. \nThe article included a quote from a Democratic Senator who said: ``I've \nnever been in a less productive time in my life than I am right now, in \nthe United States Senate.''\n  So apparently I should count myself lucky to get a rollcall today on \nthis amendment because there are many on the other side of the aisle \nwho have not been afforded the same luxury.\n  Both Democrats and Republicans are getting shut out of this process, \nand it is a very dangerous precedent. I urge my colleagues to encourage \nthoughtful, open debate from here on out. I also encourage support for \nmy commonsense reform to the accountability provisions of this \nlegislation we are debating today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Arizona for \nhis input, and I want to acknowledge his remarks with regard to the \namendment process.\n  One of the reasons we have a bill which is on the floor today--the \nWorkforce Investment and Opportunity Act\n\n[[Page S3977]]\n\nis here--is because it is one of the few bills where we have had a \nprocess in working toward a final passage where we have had a lot of \namendments.\n  This bill has a lot of input from a lot of people. We did that. The \nfact that he is having his first vote, after offering 85 amendments, is \na testimony to the reason we ought to have more voting on amendments, \nmore debate on the floor, and we will pass things and be more \nproductive in our process.\n  So I thank the Senator for his leadership. I thank him for helping us \nas we brought this legislation forward and encourage him to continue to \noffer amendments and work to perfect legislation coming before the \nSenate.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, could the Presiding Officer inform us \nas to the time remaining on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia controls 2 minutes \nand the Senator from Connecticut controls 45 minutes.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I wish to ask unanimous consent that \nthe majority side yield an additional 10 minutes of their time to the \nminority side in order for Senator Portman to make his speech.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I yield for Senator Portman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Georgia and \nappreciate his work on this legislation. I know that he and the Senator \nfrom Tennessee have been talking about the legislation earlier today. I \nunderstand that Senator Alexander talked about some of the work we have \ndone together to try to make sure this legislation does not just \nreauthorize an existing program but improves that program to give more \nfocus on how to take our Federal worker retraining program to make it \nwork for America's workers at a critical time.\n  We just learned that the economy, in the first quarter, grew even \nless than we had thought. I think it now has been readjusted to almost \nminus 3 percent--minus 2.9 percent growth. We have big problems in \nterms of our economy getting moving. One of the problems we have is we \ndo not have the trained workers for the 21st century jobs that are out \nthere.\n  I rise today as the Senate is on the verge of passing this first \ncomprehensive reform of our Nation's primary workforce development \nprograms in about 16 years, to say that I appreciate, again, the fact \nthat Members on both sides of the aisle have worked with me and others \nto put some reforms into this program to ensure it works better for our \nworkers and for our competitiveness and for our ability to actually get \nthis economy moving again.\n  We do have this weak economy. And sometimes we are sort of numb to \nit. We forget that this is not just a typical recovery; it is a very \nslow recovery. In fact, by measures of growth in economy or \nunemployment or other measures, it is the weakest economic recovery we \nhave had since the Great Depression. We have become numb to some of the \ndisappointing news.\n  Almost 20 million Americans are out of work, 317,000 of our friends \nand neighbors in Ohio are now unemployed, and millions more have given \nup looking for work. In fact, the number of people who have given up \nlooking for work is growing, so it is a high percentage. As to those \nwho have given up looking for work, you would have to go back 34 years \nago, to the 1970s, to find similar numbers of people as a percentage of \nthe workforce.\n  For men, they say it may go back to the 1940s when we started keeping \ntrack of this. So we have problems. We have problems that can be solved \nin part by closing what is called the skills gap. In other words, there \nare a whole bunch of jobs that are open, but they cannot be filled \nbecause people do not have the skills to take those jobs.\n  By the way, you do not have to take my word for it. Will.i.am of the \nBlack Eyed Peas is someone I do not often have an opportunity to quote \non the floor of the Senate, but he was at the White House recently. In \naddition to his work in the music industry, he is also known for his \nwork with kids back in his hometown of Boyle Heights, CA. A lot of that \nis focused on job training, skills training. During an event at the \nWhite House a couple of weeks ago, I saw that he said the following: \nThere are so many jobs in America we can't fill because people aren't \nbrought up to speed with the skill sets that are needed.\n  Will.i.am is right. The numbers back him up, by the way. Today, 4.5 \nmillion jobs remain open and unfilled in America. Yet we have these \nhigh levels of unemployment and all of these people who have left the \nworkforce altogether. What is going on? Part of it is that we do not \nhave the skills to be able to fill those jobs.\n  In Ohio today, if you go to the OhioMeansJobs Web site, you will see \n140,000 jobs advertised. Yet we have about 317,000 people out of work. \nIf you look at these jobs, a lot of them require advanced manufacturing \nskills, information technology skills, and medical and bioscience \nskills for health care workers. We have to do better in terms of \nfilling that gap so that American workers are able to meet the demands \nof the 21st century.\n  There is a skills gap report by the Manufacturing Institute that came \nout recently. Based on a poll they did, it said that 74 percent of \nmanufacturers are experiencing workforce shortages or skill \ndeficiencies that keep them from expanding their operations and \nimproving productivity. Seventy-four percent say they are looking for \nbetter skills to be able to fill those jobs.\n  We could be doing so much better than we are to close that skills \ngap. For too many Americans, the only jobs available are those that \nthey do not have the skills and qualifications to be able to fill.\n  The Federal Government spends a lot of money on this. This is not for \nlack of funds. The Federal Government spends between $15 and $18 \nbillion a year on these Federal worker retraining programs. As some of \nyou know, there are 47 different programs spread over 9 different \ndepartments and agencies. We need to do more to try to consolidate and \nimprove these programs, but in the meanwhile let's do what we can. That \nis what this legislation does.\n  The Government Accountability Office or GAO--which looks at all \nFederal agencies and decides how they are doing, spent a lot of time \nlooking at this. They have said that some of that money--the $18 \nbillion I talked about of our taxpayer money that does provide the \nfunding for these 47 different programs over 9 departments and \nagencies--they are not working very well. They say 45 of the 47 \nprograms overlapped with at least 1 other program. Only five have \nconducted an impact study of their efforts since 2004, meaning that the \nassessments of outcomes or performance you would expect are not being \ndone. Only five have conducted an impact study of their efforts since \n2004.\n  GAO concluded that ``little is known about the effectiveness of most \nof these programs.'' But actually we do know something about the \neffectiveness because these millions of unfilled jobs are an indictment \nof the program. In other words, we should be doing a better job of \ngetting the skills we need to fill these jobs if we are spending $15 to \n$18 billion of hard-earned taxpayer money on it.\n  I hear this story all across Ohio, and I know my colleagues hear it \nacross their States. I hear from workers, from businesses, from \neducators. People are frustrated, and there is good reason for it. I \nthink the way Washington has handled workforce development is simply \ninefficient. It is not working well. I think it is unfair to employers \nwho have open positions because they cannot find qualified candidates \nto fill them. It is certainly unfair to taxpayers who send their money \nto Washington believing that their government will be good stewards of \nthose funds and that we are going to use them effectively for worker \nretraining, getting the money into the hands of people to train them \nfor jobs that are actually out there. I think it is unfair to, of \ncourse, millions of Americans who would like to build a better life for\n\n[[Page S3978]]\n\ntheir families and find that the Federal resources allocated to them \nare not getting the job done.\n  Because we believe we can do better, this Congress is going to act \ntoday. The Senate and the House are working together on this issue, \nwhich is good. It is bicameral. It is bipartisan.\n  I have joined with Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado on what is \ncalled the CAREER Act. The CAREER Act is included, in most part, in \nthis legislation. The CAREER Act first calls for a reduction in the \nwasteful and inefficient overlap in the system.\n  I am pleased to see that the legislation before us today trims 15 \nprograms from our Nation's workforce development program. I think that \nis a good start. I also think we can do even more. Understanding that \nthere were a lot of constraints, different points of view, we need to \nconsolidate further, in my view.\n  Second, we called for an increased focus on helping unemployed \nworkers attain high-quality credentials that give them a leg up in the \nlocal job market. I am pleased this bill includes our provisions that \nrequire those local boards, the workforce investment boards, to give \npriority consideration to programs that lead to credentials that are in \ndemand in their local area.\n  We worked hard to include a provision requiring the State and local \nboards to provide specific strategies for helping folks attain high-\nquality credentials. These are industry-recognized credentials that are \nin demand, that are portable--they can move from State to State--and \nthat help them move up the career leader. That is important because we \nknow that these credentials, based on all the research, are critical to \ngetting people into these jobs.\n  Third, we call for a new and innovative accountability program in the \nsystem called Pay for Success. Currently, the workforce development \nprograms provide funding regardless of performance so long as certain \nrules are followed and input requirements are met--not output but \ninput. This has resulted in this unaccountability the GAO talked about \nand many complacent programs that have fallen short. Pay for Success \nturns this model on its head by linking payments to outcome, to actual \nperformance measures. Job-training service providers who do well will \nbe rewarded under this model. Those who fail to deliver results are \ngoing to be held accountable.\n  I am pleased that again this underlying legislation--the Workforce \nInnovation and Opportunity Act--before us today includes these Pay for \nSuccess provisions that allow local workforce boards to use their \nformula to engage in Pay for Success contracts. That is a step in the \nright direction. I would like to go even further, but I think it is \nhistoric and it is very important.\n  Finally, we call for access to better data to make it less difficult \nand expensive for State and local officials to assess the effectiveness \nof their training activities in real time. I am pleased this \nlegislation includes the provisions for a study on how to access better \ndata that can help the system deliver better results for taxpayers and \nthe unemployed. That is part of the CAREER Act.\n  These four reforms can help change lives and turn around our economy. \nThey are the kinds of reforms that can empower millions of Americans to \nget the kinds of jobs that do fund retirement, that do buy homes, that \ndo pay for college educations. These reforms are long overdue.\n  We live in a dynamic and ever-changing economy, no question about it. \nWe have to be sure our workforce is also dynamic and ever-changing to \nbe able to meet the demands. We should not be held back by a workforce \ndevelopment system that has not been reauthorized since 1998. For \nreference, that is the year Google was first incorporated as a company. \nSo I strongly support the underlying legislation.\n  Again, I commend my colleagues on both sides of the aisle--I see some \nof them here today on the floor--for their work. I thank them for \nworking with Senator Michael Bennet and me to incorporate some of the \nbipartisan CAREER Act provisions.\n  At a time when the two parties in Washington have been at odds on how \nto finally get our economy moving again, this is a jobs bill that is \nwin-win. It is a win for everyone, especially those Americans who are \nstill looking for jobs and those businesses that are desperate to fill \nthe skills gap they see.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I rise in strong support of the Workforce \nInnovation and Opportunity Act. This legislation represents a long-\noverdue upgrade to our workforce investment system. I wish to commend \nthe bipartisan work of Chairman Harkin, Senator Murray, Senator \nAlexander, and Senator Isakson in negotiating this compromise \nlegislation that will move our job training and adult education systems \nforward.\n  The need to improve our workforce investment system has crystallized \nduring this recovery from the great recession. My home State of Rhode \nIsland continues to struggle with high unemployment--the highest rate \nin the Nation. Many of our unemployed workers have been out of work for \nan extended period of time. Yet employers tell me they have open \npositions they cannot fill because they cannot find workers with the \nskills they need today. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act \ntakes important steps to help address the skills mismatch that keeps \njobs open and potential workers unemployed.\n  The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act streamlines the current \nworkforce development system by requiring a single comprehensive plan \nthat incorporates all of the core programs and is aligned with economic \ndevelopment plans for the States. It also establishes shared \nperformance metrics that apply to all of the programs in the system. In \nother words, it makes sure that employers, educators, and the workforce \nsystem are all on the same page.\n  The legislation before us today makes some tough choices, eliminating \n15 programs. However, it also maintains and strengthens vital national \nprograms such as Job Corps and Youth Build, which have made a \ndifference for so many young people in Rhode Island and across the \nNation.\n  I am particularly pleased that the Workforce Innovation and \nOpportunity Act strengthens the partnership between our workforce \ninvestment system and our public libraries. Libraries are where people \ngo when they need help or information. They are a critical part of the \ndelivery system for adult education and job training.\n  In fiscal year 2011, the Institute of Museum and Library Services \nreported that there were 1.52 billion visits to public libraries across \nthe Nation. Senator Cochran and I introduced the Workforce Investments \nthrough Local Libraries Act to harness the potential of public \nlibraries to expand the reach of the workforce investment system and \nensure that job seekers and adult leaders had the opportunity to \ndevelop the critical digital skills necessary for today's economy. The \nWorkforce Innovation and Opportunity Act includes many of the \nprovisions of this legislation. I was very pleased to work with Senator \nCochran and have great gratitude for Senators Alexander, Isakson, \nHarkin, and Murray for incorporating some of our ideas.\n  The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act also strengthens adult \neducation and includes many of the provisions of the Adult Education \nand Economic Growth Act that I introduced with Senator Brown.\n  For 2012, data from the Program for the International Assessment of \nAdult Competencies show that an estimated 52 percent of adults age 16 \nto 65 in the United States lack the literacy skills necessary to \nidentify, interpret, or evaluate one or more pieces of information. \nThese are critical skills for postsecondary education and the \nworkplace. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act will help \naddress this critical need for adult education and literacy by ensuring \nthat adult education programs are aligned with job training and \npostsecondary education, supporting the professional development of \nadult educators, offering technical assistance for adult education \nproviders, and strengthening the research and evaluation of best \npractices in adult education.\n  The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act is an example of what is \npossible when we work together to solve problems and strengthen the \ntools available to our communities to\n\n[[Page S3979]]\n\nimprove the quality of life. We have libraries. We have adult education \nprograms throughout this country. What I think the sponsors of this \nlegislation so creatively did is pull them together, so the sum of the \nparts is much greater and will have a much more effective impact on the \nemployment opportunities for Americans and our productivity as a \nnation.\n  In that regard, I would like to discuss for a moment a new bipartisan \nbill I have introduced with Senator Heller to restore emergency \nbenefits for jobseekers for 5 months. What we have done here is we have \naddressed the issue of training, but we still have an issue with people \nwho are desperately looking for work and need the assistance of the \nunemployment benefits to do that.\n  I think this legislation will help us make the case because one of \nthe legitimate reasons that were raised with respect to the extension \nof benefit was, well, we do not have a job training program, so we are \nnot preparing people for jobs. That is what we should be doing. Well, \nthis bill goes a long way to do that. I think it helps us in trying to \nmake the case.\n\n  As we know, in April we voted on a bipartisan basis to send the bill \nto the House. Unfortunately, it languished there, and then ultimately \nthe time expired. Our new plan would provide prospective emergency \nbenefits--just going forward--for those eligible job seekers who lost \ntheir benefits on December 28. They would essentially pick up where \nthey were on December 28.\n  This is something that, hand in hand with this new job training bill, \nwill give people both additional advantages of training and resources \nto make it through the training period, pay the rent, have a cell phone \nso they can call for a job, do those things that are necessary to get \nby. It is fiscally responsible. It is offset. We are waiting for an \nofficial score from CBO, but our intention is to make it a bill that is \nfiscally responsible. Madam President, 3.1 million Americans lost these \nbenefits--that number grows by approximately 72,000 a week. We can do \nbetter. We must do better.\n  We are doing a lot to try to get people back to work. I commend this \nlegislation. It is an important step forward.\n  It is an important step forward, because as so many of my colleagues \nhave noted, one of the things that is amazing in this recession--and I \nhave mentioned it previously--is to go into Rhode Island to companies \neven with the state unemployment rate of 8 percent--and have the owners \nsay they are desperately looking for four or five workers. They can't \nfind them.\n  Why is that? The skills that 20 years ago got someone a good job in \nRhode Island and for the past 20 years kept them working, after this \ndownturn slowed their company or pushed them out, those skills are out \nof date. Good workers, long work history, they need not only the help \nto retrain, but they also certainly need the help to get from day to \nday until they can get back in the workforce.\n  With that, let me again commend and thank the sponsors and authors of \nthis legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent that if the final vote on passage \nis successful, the statement of the managers for the Workforce \nInnovation and Opportunity Act be printed in the Record immediately \nfollowing the text of the Senate-passed bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. How much time remains on the Republican side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I ask unanimous consent that 5 additional minutes be \nextended from the Democratic side to the Republican side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 25 minutes remaining on the \nDemocratic side.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Sure, absolutely.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I yield the balance of our time to the Senator from \nUtah, Mr. Lee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3380 to Amendment No. 3378\n\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3380 to amendment No. \n3378.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Lee] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3380 to amendment No. 3378.\n\n  Mr. LEE. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To require that evaluation reports are due every fourth year, \nto establish a reservation of funds in a fiscal year in which a report \n   is due, and to establish a reduction in funds if a report is not \n                               submitted)\n\n       Beginning on page 395, strike line 20 and all that follows \n     through line 24, and insert the following:\n       (B) Periodic independent evaluation.--The evaluations \n     carried out under this paragraph shall include an independent \n     evaluation of the programs and activities carried out under \n     this title. A final report containing the results of the \n     evaluation shall be submitted under paragraph (5) not later \n     than June 30 of 2018 and every fourth year thereafter.\n       On page 399, between lines 6 and 7, insert the following:\n       (9) Reservation and reduction in funds for failure to \n     submit evaluation reports.--\n       (A) Reservation of funds.--At the beginning of a report \n     year or a succeeding year, the Secretary shall reserve 5 \n     percent of the funds appropriated and made available to the \n     Office of the Secretary.\n       (B) Return of funds.--If, by the end of the report year or \n     succeeding year, respectively, the committees described in \n     paragraph (6) do not receive the corresponding report, the \n     funds reserved in subparagraph (A) for the year involved \n     shall be returned to the Treasury of the United States.\n       (C) Definitions.--In this paragraph:\n       (i) Report year.--The term ``report year'' means a fiscal \n     year in which a report is due under paragraph (1)(B).\n       (ii) Succeeding year.--The term ``succeeding year'' means \n     each succeeding fiscal year, after a report year in which a \n     report is due and not received as described in subparagraph \n     (B), if the report remains unsubmitted on the first day of \n     that succeeding fiscal year.\n\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, Federal job training programs are seldom \nevaluated to determine whether they are meeting their intended \npurposes.\n  However, when the United States is $17.5 trillion in debt, we as \nrepresentatives of the American taxpayers should do a better job to \nensure that the programs we are funding are actually working and we are \nworking with them.\n  We should pay particularly close attention to programs that receive \nbillions of dollars every year from the Federal Government when their \nauthorization lapsed over one decade ago.\n  The Murray-Isakson-Harkin-Alexander substitute amendment takes \nimportant steps to ensure title I State and local programs are more \naccurately evaluated, meaning performance measures and held accountable \nfor unmet goals and resubmitted reports.\n  More specifically, the bill would sanction State and local programs \nshould they continually fail to meet their performance measures or fail \nto submit required reports. The substitute amendment does not hold the \nDepartment of Labor to similar standards.\n  The Department is required to conduct evaluations and to submit \nseparate reports to Congress. I was very pleased to work with Senators \nAlexander and Harkin to include in the managers' amendment a provision \nthat would require the final evaluation reports to be made public and \navailable\n\n[[Page S3980]]\n\nto the public. In my opinion, requiring the Department to post these \nreports to the Department's Web site is a commonsense step toward \nimproving transparency in the WIOA job training programs.\n  In addition, I worked closely with the HELP Committee chairman and \nranking member to further discuss a procurement provision within the \nJob Corps section of the bill. While I believe there are still some \noutstanding concerns that we should continue to discuss, I believe \neveryone's goal is to ensure that the best Job Corps operators are able \nto compete for these sites.\n  Today I would like to offer an additional good governance measure \nthat would subject the Department of Labor to similar sanctions as the \nStates. It would help tackle the problem of the Department of Labor \ndelaying congressionally mandated evaluations, which routinely has been \nabused by both Republican and Democratic administrations.\n  It is a shame that Congress passing a law requiring the completion of \nan evaluation by a certain date is not enough to get the job done. My \namendment would remedy this problem by reducing the budget of the \nDepartment of Labor's Office of the Secretary by 5 percent in the year \na report is due, should the agency fail to conduct and release the \nindependent evaluation as required by this bill. This reduction of \nfunds would continue each year until the report is finalized.\n  WIOA authorizes $9 billion each year for the next 5 years, and title \nI represents half of that funding. Therefore, ensuring an independent \nevaluation of title I programs is conducted and made publicly available \nfor review and scrutiny by Congress and the American public. It is \ncritically important for any future modification, renewal or \nelimination of programs.\n  I would appreciate the support of my colleagues for the passage of \nthis amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, we worked very hard on this bill to make \nsure we had good, strong, independent evaluations and reporting \nrequirements. Therefore, I am pleased to rise and speak in opposition \nto the amendment.\n  We included in the bill requirements for an independent evaluation to \nbe conducted every 4 years, which includes what we call the gold \nstandard impact evaluation, the first of which is due in 2019.\n  Our House colleagues on both sides of the aisle agreed with and \nsupported these provisions in a bipartisan, bicameral process. What the \nLee amendment would do would be to inappropriately penalize the \nSecretary of Labor if the Secretary does not submit a report by an \narbitrary date.\n  I understand the intent of the amendment. We all want to see reports \nfiled in a timely manner. However, the Lee amendment does not give any \nallowance for factors that might be outside of the Secretary's control \nand then would penalize the Secretary for the failure of others over \nwhom the Secretary has absolutely no control--and that is why I oppose \nthe amendment.\n  As the name suggests, independent evaluations are run by objective, \nindependent third parties. Sometimes the evaluations encounter delays \nthat are far beyond the control of the Department.\n  For example, data may not be available in a timely manner; \nalternatively, followup with States, local areas or programs \nparticipating in the evaluation may be necessary. On some occasions, \nlegal challenges may arise. Any of these factors could delay a \ncomprehensive report of this nature.\n  Then to say, however, we are going to penalize the Department for \nfailing to meet an arbitrary deadline I think is inappropriate and \ninequitable, because they may not have control over that. So the Lee \namendment would disregard any and all of these reasons a report might \nbe delayed even by 1 day.\n  I wish to make it clear that all of us who worked on this bill \nbelieve in the value of independent evaluations and the information \nthey can provide policymakers and consumers, but we also believe they \nshould be done right, without undue pressure of arbitrary deadlines and \nno room for corrections.\n  I would also note the underlying bill does strengthen evaluations and \nreporting in the right way. This is something we all worked on and we \nhave all worked on it in a bipartisan bicameral nature.\n  Again, the House has been very clear that we work this out. They \nwould not be accepting of this amendment, so I hope all Senators would \njoin with us who worked so hard on this bill in a bipartisan manner to \noppose the Lee amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. If I could respond very briefly, I think it is important to \npoint out that, yes, there may come a time when in any government \noffice--whether it is an elected government office or appointed \noffice--when someone who is new to the office might be affected by \nsomething that did or didn't happen during the predecessor's time in \noffice.\n  But even were that to occur in the case of the Secretary of Labor, \nthis is a position that could easily enable, could easily empower the \nnew Secretary to come in and within a matter of months make sure our \ncontractor gets a report done and make sure that report gets submitted.\n  It is also worth noting that when we entrust a Federal agency with \nthe power to spend $9 billion of the American people's hard-earned \ntaxpayer money, hard-earned resources, we should expect them to stand \naccountable, and they should certainly have the ability to have a study \nconducted and have that study released to the American people.\n  If we don't trust them to be able to issue that report and make it \npublic, then we should have some reason to be concerned about giving \nthem $9 billion.\n  But I think this is a reasonable requirement, and therefore I ask my \ncolleagues to support this measure.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in proud support of \nthe Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, and to urge my colleagues \nto support it.\n  This is an extremely important piece of legislation, and one I was \nhappy to work on in the HELP Committee. It is also long overdue. We \nhaven't reauthorized the Workforce Investment Act since 1998, and it is \nclear that the law isn't working for the 2014 economy. We know it isn't \nworking because we have a large and growing skills gap.\n  Now, what is the skills gap? Recent studies have shown that between \none-third and one-half of manufacturers in my State have at least one \njob they can't fill because they can't find a worker with the right \nskills. That is the skills gap in Minnesota. Of course, it isn't just \nMinnesota, it is a nationwide phenomenon, and any colleague I talk to \non the floor says that is the case in his or her State.\n  A 2011 survey by Deloitte found that there were 600,000 manufacturing \njobs nationwide that were unfilled because of a skills shortage. I just \nmet with Bob Kill, the president and CEO of Enterprise Minnesota, a \nterrific organization that studies manufacturers in my State of \nMinnesota, and as he likes to say, ``we've been admiring this problem \nfor a long time.''\n  And it is not just manufacturers. There is a skills gap in \ninformation technology, in health care, and in other sectors that have \njobs sitting there waiting for skilled workers to fill them. There are \nmore than 3 million jobs in this country that could be filled today if \nthere were workers who had the right skills. With too many Americans \nunemployed, we have to find a way to fill those jobs.\n  The thing is, we know how to solve this, and the Workforce Innovation \nand Opportunity Act will help us do that. I have been to the floor of \nthe Senate a number of times to talk about the strategy. I have talked \nabout it with the Presiding Officer. I am excited about this, as the \nPresiding Officer very well knows. These are partnerships between \nbusinesses and community and technical colleges that are training \nworkers and getting them into\n\n[[Page S3981]]\n\nhigh-skilled, high-demand jobs right away.\n  A number of these partnerships are up and running in Minnesota and \nhave employers fighting over graduates--and sometimes the fight starts \neven before the students have graduated. That is good for the student. \nBob Kill told me about the top student in one of these programs at \nAlexandria Technical and Community College--by the way, a community \ncollege which has been doing this for a while and doing a great job. \nThis student had 14 job offers before he graduated. All 14 employers \nsaid they would pay him to get his engineering degree. I bet if we \nasked most recent graduates from 4-year or even graduate degree \nprograms, they would be jealous of that kind of eagerness from \nemployers.\n  So that is a program that is working, and with good reason; employers \nwere involved in the program from day one, so they helped to shape the \ncurriculum to their needs. This is obviously more effective than a \ntraining program with no connection to the needs of employers or, as \nLabor Secretary Tom Perez calls it, ``train and pray.'' Our education \nsystem needs more of this focus on skills for jobs that exist.\n  Careers are different than they were a generation ago. Very few \npeople stay working in one job for one company for their entire life \nanymore. As technology progresses faster and faster, workers are going \nto need to constantly update their skills. We need a workforce \ndevelopment system that is agile enough to keep up with these changing \ndemands. That is essential not just so workers will be able to get the \ndifferent skills they will need over the course of their working lives, \nit is also going to be one of the keys to the United States remaining \nglobally competitive. If our workers can't adapt to the new industries \nthat are constantly forming, we will lose those jobs to our global \ncompetitors. We are seeing manufacturing coming back to our country for \nall sorts of reasons, and we need to have the skilled workers to take \nadvantage of that and be globally competitive. There is no better way \nto anticipate and react to these changes than to connect businesses \ndirectly with our schools to get workers exactly the skills they need.\n  This is also about local competitiveness, it is about jobs, it is \nalso about college affordability. I already talked about the student \nwith 14 job offers, all of which included a free engineering degree. We \ncan't get more affordable than free. Many have heard me talk about this \nissue before, a manufacturer from Minnesota named Erick Ajax.\n  When Erick hires employees from these business-technical college \npartnerships, the way he looks at it is they are on a career ladder \nthat would otherwise not be available to them. He told me about one \nsuch hire. He hired him right after a credentialing program, like a \nshort CNC credentialed program. The guy did a great job, and so he \nsaid: Well, I am going to send you back to community college to get \nyour associate's degree while you are working, and I will pay for it.\n  So the guy got his associate's degree, came back, and he was \nmagnificent. So then he said: You know what. I am going to send you to \nthe University of Minnesota to get your bachelor's degree, while you \nare working. I believe he is about to get his bachelor's degree, but he \nis now the head of quality control for this advanced manufacturing \ncompany--and he will have a couple of degrees, with zero debt. I think \nabout that story a lot when I think about college affordability.\n  I could talk about these partnerships for hours, as the Presiding \nOfficer knows--he has heard me--because they work. I have been \nenthusiastic about this. That is why I worked with Patty Murray, the \ngreat Senator from Washington; Johnny Isakson, the great Senator from \nGeorgia; Tom Harkin, the great Senator from Iowa; and Lamar Alexander, \nthe great Senator from Tennessee, to make sure this bill would \nencourage the formation of these partnerships. I thank each and every \none of them for their leadership on this bill. They worked together on \na bipartisan basis and led a cooperative process in the HELP Committee. \nI think the result is a bill of which everyone can be proud.\n  I will keep working to pass my Community College to Career Fund Act, \nbecause I think these partnerships deserve even more focus as well as a \ndedicated funding source. But I am proud that I fought to make sure the \nWorkforce Innovation and Opportunity Act contains provisions similar to \nmy bill, and it does a lot to encourage the formation of more of these \npartnerships--and bigger partnerships--create more jobs, more workers \nwith jobs, and degrees on a path in the right direction. I think this \nis a huge step in the right direction, and I thank my colleagues. We \nare creating a smarter, nimbler workforce that will be able to respond \nto the unique needs of each local area, coordinating all the programs \nso they will all be working together toward the same goals and the same \noutcome metrics. This will reduce administrative costs and make the \nsystem focus on what counts--getting people good jobs.\n  Once again, I thank Senators Murray, Harkin, Isakson, and Alexander \nfor their hard work on this bill. I encourage my colleagues to support \nit so we can get our workforce system working for today's economy and \nthe economy of tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, as we end this debate, I thank my \ncoauthors and managers of this bill, Senator Isakson, Senator Harkin, \nand Senator Alexander. And I also again thank Senator Enzi who was for \nyears my partner on this bill.\n  For over a decade now some combination of us, along with others, has \nbeen working to reauthorize the Workforce Investment Act, and I am so \nexcited that we are finally on the verge of passing this long overdue \nlegislation through the Senate.\n  Let me remind everyone that the workforce development system serves \nover 20 million people every year. That is one of every eight working-\nage adults in this country--people who are looking for work, people who \nwant to change their jobs, people who want to upgrade their skills. And \nthe system serves thousands of employers every year--manufacturers, \nconstruction firms, health care providers, financial institutions. The \nlist goes on.\n  Let's also remember that our workforce development system is a vital \npartner of economic developers all around the country, making sure that \ncompanies being recruited or expanded have access to training and \nskilled workers necessary to compete and grow.\n  With millions of new jobs that will require postsecondary education \nand advanced skills in the coming years, we will fall behind if we do \nnot modernize our workforce development system and programs now. We \nhave to make sure when high-tech jobs of the next century are created, \nAmericans are ready to fill them. That is what we have done with this \nbill. We have doubled down on the programs that work, we have \neliminated programs that have become outdated, and created a workforce \nsystem that is more nimble, adaptable, better aligned, and more \naccountable.\n  I am very proud to be at this point. I again especially thank my \npartner who has been with me so many critical times, Senator Isakson \nfrom Georgia, who has been incredibly hardworking and diligent in \ngetting this done.\n  I look forward to the votes. We have two amendments--I will be \njoining all of our cosponsors in voting against those amendments--and \nthen final passage. I again thank everyone who has worked so hard on \nthis legislation for so many years.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, as we close the debate, I \nenthusiastically support and endorse the Workforce Investment and \nOpportunity Act. This is a statement the Senate can send to the United \nStates of America and all people who are on unemployment, looking for \nbetter opportunities. We are now going to offer training to see to it \nthose 10,600,000 Americans out of work can find jobs, and hopefully it \nwill be the 4 million jobs available today in America where skilled \nworkers are not trained.\n  I thank Senator Murray for her kind comments and reiterate my \nappreciation for her, her staff, Scott Cheney, my staff, Tommy Nguyen.\n  Chairman Harkin has been a fearless leader on our committee and \nallowed us the chance to get to where we are today.\n\n[[Page S3982]]\n\n  Senator Alexander's velvet glove on an iron hand helped us get \nthrough an amendment process that was difficult at times but got us to \nthe point we are today.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for the bill and against the two \namendments.\n  I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Explanation of the Bill and Managers' Views\n       V. Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n\n               I. Purpose and Summary of the Legislation\n\n       The purpose of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act \n     is to amend and reauthorize the Workforce Investment Act of \n     1998, which supports the nation's primary programs and \n     investments in employment services, workforce development, \n     adult education, and vocational rehabilitation activities and \n     has been due for reauthorization since 2003. The bill also \n     reauthorizes and enhances the Adult Education and Family \n     Literacy Act, amends the Wagner-Peyser Act of 1933, and \n     amends and reauthorizes certain provisions in the \n     Rehabilitation Act of 1973.\n       The legislation is the product of an extensive bipartisan, \n     bicameral effort in negotiations between the Senate Health, \n     Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee and House \n     Committee on Education and the Workforce regarding their \n     respective reauthorization bills and input from the major \n     stakeholders in workforce development, adult education, \n     employment services, and vocational rehabilitation and other \n     disability programs. In addition, two hearings were held in \n     the 113th Congress regarding the reauthorization of the \n     Workforce Investment Act of 1998--one in the Senate and one \n     in the House of Representatives.\n       This legislation amends the Workforce Investment Act of \n     1998 by making the changes identified below.\n\n[[Page S3983]]\n\n       This legislation repeals the Workforce Investment Act of \n     1998 and replaces it with new authorization language for \n     workforce systems in the States and local areas, Job Corps. \n     national programs, adult education and literacy, and general \n     provisions. In addition, the legislation includes amendments \n     to the Wagner-Peyser Act of 1933 and the Rehabilitation Act \n     of 1973, which are important programs connected to the \n     broader workforce development system.\n       First, the bill makes a number of specific changes to \n     workforce investment activities under title I. The number of \n     required members on State and local workforce boards is \n     reduced. States are required to submit one plan to address \n     all of the core programs--title I-B, title II, employment \n     services under the Wagner-Peyser Act in title and State \n     vocational rehabilitation under title IV--and develop a \n     comprehensive State strategy to align workforce activities \n     with labor market demands and economic development goals. The \n     bill also includes a process describing the partner \n     contributions for infrastructure funding. There is an \n     increased emphasis on ensuring physical and programmatic \n     accessibility of one-stop centers and training providers. \n     Flexibility of funds for use at the local level between adult \n     and dislocated worker funding is enhanced. A set of common \n     performance indicators is required for all core programs \n     under the bill. Importance is placed on providing career \n     pathways and the use of sector strategies for delivering \n     services. Streamlining reporting requirements and \n     administrative burdens are applied. Youth who face severe \n     barriers to employment and education, including out-of- \n     school youth, are targeted for assistance.\n       Second, the bill makes a number of changes to the Adult \n     Education and Family Literacy Act to support successful \n     transitions to postsecondary education or training, or \n     employment. The bill requires specific activities at the \n     local, State, and national level, including integrating basic \n     adult education and occupational skills training and the use \n     of career pathways. The bill also requires the Secretary of \n     Education to conduct evaluations and research regarding adult \n     education activities provided under the title.\n       Third, the amendments to the Wagner-Peyser Act of 1933 \n     include changes to the Workforce Information Council, which \n     supports the development of a State-Federal system for \n     identifying labor market information. The amendments also \n     include provisions to support professional development for \n     employment services staff.\n       Fourth, the bill prioritizes competitive integrated \n     employment for individuals with disabilities, particularly \n     young people with disabilities who are transitioning from \n     education to employment, by ensuring that these individuals \n     have the skills and training necessary to maximize their \n     potential. The amendments also include better alignment of \n     disability programs in order to ensure that individuals \n     receive the services, technology, and support they need in \n     order to live inclusive, successful lives.\n       Fifth, the bill repeals the Workforce Investment Act of \n     1998 and eliminates the following 15 programs:\n       Youth Opportunity Grants\n       21st Century Workforce Commission\n       National Institute for Literacy under Adult Education\n       Health Care Gap Coverage for Trade Adjustment Assistance \n     participants\n       WIA Incentive Grants\n       WIA Pilots and Demonstration Projects\n       Community-based Job Training Grants\n       Green Jobs Act\n       Projects with Industry under the Rehabilitation Act \n     amendments\n       Recreation Programs under the Rehabilitation Act amendments\n       In-service Training under the Rehabilitation Act amendments\n       Migrant and Seasonal Farmworker Program under the \n     Rehabilitation Act amendments\n       WIA Veterans Workforce Investment Program\n       WIA Workforce Innovation Fund\n       Grants to States for Workplace and Community Transition \n     Training for Incarcerated Individuals under the 1998 \n     Amendments to the Higher Education Act.\n\n\n                II. Background and Need for Legislation\n\n       When Congress passed the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, \n     it was seen as a major step forward in streamlining existing \n     Federal workforce programs and supporting Federal investment \n     in workforce development activities. Since the authorization \n     for the statute expired in 2003, there have been numerous \n     attempts to reauthorize the legislation in both the House and \n     the Senate.\n\n\n             III. Legislative History and Committee Action\n\n       In the 113th Congress, the Senate took the following action \n     on reauthorization of the Workforce Investment Act. On June \n     20, 2013, the Senate HELP Committee conducted a hearing on \n     reauthorization of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998. On \n     July 24, 2013, Senator Murray, Senator Isakson, Senator \n     Harkin, and Senator Alexander introduced S. 1356, the \n     Workforce Investment Act of 2013. On July 31, 2013, the \n     Senate HELP Committee considered S. 1356 in executive session \n     and reported it favorably, as amended, to the Senate by a \n     vote of 18 to 3. The committee considered and adopted two \n     amendments to the underlying bill. The first amendment was in \n     the nature of a substitute and included changes recommended \n     by the bill managers--Senate HELP Chairman Tom Harkin (D-IA), \n     HELP Committee Ranking Member Lamar Alexander (R-TN), Senator \n     Patty Murray (D-WA), and Senator Johnny Isakson (R-GA)--and \n     was adopted by unanimous consent. The second amendment, \n     offered by Senator Casey (D-PA), Senator Hatch (R-UT), and \n     Senator Whitehouse (D-RI) included additional reporting \n     requirements for the Job Corps program. The amendment was \n     accepted by voice vote.\n       In the 113th Congress, the House took the following action \n     on reauthorization of the Workforce Investment Act. On \n     February 26, 2013, the House Education and the Workforce \n     Committee, in the Subcommittee on Higher Education and \n     Workforce Training, conducted a hearing on the \n     reauthorization of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998. On \n     February 25, 2013, Higher Education and Workforce Training \n     Subcommittee Chairwoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) introduced H.R. \n     803, the Supporting Knowledge and Investing in Lifelong \n     Skills Act. On March 6, 2013, the Committee on Education and \n     the Workforce considered H.R. 803 in legislative session and \n     reported it favorably, as amended, to the House of \n     Representatives.\n       The committee considered and adopted the following \n     amendments to H.R. 803. The first amendment was in the nature \n     of a substitute and included changes recommended by the bill \n     manager, Representative Foxx, and was adopted by voice vote. \n     The second amendment, offered by Representative Tim Walberg \n     (R-MI), streamlined the unified State plan process at the \n     Federal level. The third amendment, offered by Representative \n     Martha Roby (R-AL), prohibited the use of funds for lobbying \n     and political activities. The fourth amendment, offered by \n     Representative Susan Brooks (R-IN), allowed State and local \n     workforce boards to implement pay-for-performance strategies. \n     The second, third, and fourth amendments were considered en \n     bloc and adopted by voice vote.\n       On March 15, 2013, the House of Representatives adopted \n     H.R. 803 by a vote of 215-202. During debate the House \n     considered the following amendments. The first amendment, \n     offered by Representative Foxx provided a local application \n     process when designating local workforce investment areas and \n     made technical and clarifying changes to the underlying bill, \n     and passed by voice vote. The second amendment, offered by \n     Representative Pete Gallego (D-TX), required State and local \n     plans include advanced manufacturing workforce development \n     strategies, and passed by voice vote. The third amendment, \n     offered by Representative Don Young (R-AK), required the \n     Secretary of Labor to set aside one percent of the funds for \n     Native American workforce development programs, and passed by \n     voice vote. The fourth amendment, offered by Representative \n     Diane Black (R-TN), expressed a sense of Congress that any \n     administrative costs be off-set by funds currently being used \n     for marketing and outreach by the Department of Agriculture, \n     and was withdrawn by unanimous consent. The fifth amendment, \n     offered by Representative Scott Garrett (R-NJ), required a \n     reduction in funds to the Department of Labor if long overdue \n     evaluations were not completed within a specified amount of \n     time, and passed by voice vote. Another amendment was offered \n     by Representative John Tierney (D-MA) and was in the nature \n     of a substitute, and did not pass by a recorded vote of 192-\n     227.\n\n\n            IV. Explanation of the Bill and Managers' Views\n\n       Sections 1, 2, and 3. Sections 1, 2, and 3 describe the \n     short title for the bill, the Workforce Innovation and \n     Opportunity Act; include the purposes of the Act; and state \n     the definitions for the Act, which are intended to have the \n     same meaning under each program authorized under the Act \n     unless otherwise stated. The definitions identify the ``core \n     programs'' under the Act, which consist of title I State \n     grant programs; title II adult education programs; the \n     employment service under title III amendments to the Wagner-\n     Peyser Act; and State vocational rehabilitation programs \n     under title IV.\n\n\n   Title I--Workforce Development Activities; Providers; Job Corps; \n                 National Programs; and Administration\n\n       Title I of the underlying bill includes the primary \n     components of State and local area workforce development \n     systems as well as several national programs for youth and \n     special populations. In order to strengthen and streamline \n     the workforce system, the title focuses on changes to \n     governance, including reducing the number of required board \n     members at the State and local level; requiring one, unified \n     State plan; and promoting local workforce areas more closely \n     aligned to labor markets and economic development regions \n     while preserving a locally driven workforce system. The bill \n     also promotes the themes of providing employment services and \n     workforce development along a career pathway for \n     participants, and education training in line with in-demand \n     industry sectors and occupations for a region.\n     Workforce Boards\n       In order for boards to be more strategic, the bill reduces \n     the number of required board members at both the State and \n     local level. The boards remain a business majority with a \n     business chairperson, while the representation for the \n     workforce is increased. At the local level, with the \n     exception of the core programs under the Act, the one-stop \n     partners are no longer required members.\n     Workforce Plans\n       To support a strategic, comprehensive, and streamlined \n     system, the bill requires one,\n\n[[Page S3984]]\n\n     unified State plan, covering four years, to meet the \n     requirements for each of the core programs. The plan also \n     requires a description of the State's overall strategy for \n     workforce development and how the strategy will help meet \n     identified skill needs for workers, job seekers and employers \n     in the State. This unified plan will improve service delivery \n     to individuals as well as reduce administrative costs and \n     reporting requirements at the State level. In order to \n     promote a one-stop system that accommodates the needs of \n     individuals with disabilities, the State and local plans must \n     include a description of how the one-stop system in the State \n     will comply with the applicable requirements of section 188 \n     and the Americans with Disabilities Act regarding the \n     accessibility of programs and facilities for people with \n     disabilities.\n     Workforce Development Areas\n       In order to maintain the balance between governors and \n     local elected officials, the bill requires States to consult \n     with local boards and chief elected officials in order to \n     identify local areas and planning regions that are in \n     alignment with labor markets and regional economic \n     development areas. The bill allows for initial and subsequent \n     designations based on performance, fiscal integrity, and \n     participation in regional coordination activities, including \n     regional planning, information sharing, pooling of \n     administrative costs, and coordination of service delivery.\n     Performance Accountability\n       In order to promote increased transparency about the \n     outcomes of Federal workforce programs, the bill includes six \n     primary indicators of performance for adults served under \n     programs authorized under the Act, and six primary indicators \n     for youth served under the Act. Commonality among the \n     indicators will allow policymakers, program users, and \n     consumers to better understand the value and effectiveness of \n     the services. The managers recognize that for those \n     participants who have low levels of literacy skills, or who \n     are English language learners, the acquisition of basic \n     English literacy and numeracy skills are critical steps to \n     obtaining employment and success in postsecondary education \n     and training. Therefore, the term ``measureable skill gains'' \n     referred to under indicator V in this section for adult and \n     youth, is intended to encourage eligible providers under \n     title 11 to serve all undereducated, low-level, and under \n     prepared adults. The managers agree that reporting and \n     evaluation requirements are important tools in measuring \n     effectiveness, especially for the core programs. Therefore, \n     the legislation includes performance reports to be provided \n     at the State, local and eligible training provider levels, as \n     well as evaluations of the core programs by States.\n     One-Stop Infrastructure\n       To improve the quality of the one-stop delivery system, the \n     bill requires the State board, in consultation with chief \n     local elected officials and local boards, to establish \n     criteria for use by the local board in assessing the \n     effectiveness, physical and programmatic accessibility, and \n     continuous improvement of one-stop centers and delivery \n     systems at least every three years. Regarding infrastructure \n     funding for one-stop centers, the bill maintains requirements \n     for the mandatory one-stop partners in a local area to reach \n     a voluntary agreement, in the form of a memorandum of \n     understanding, to fund the costs of infrastructure, other \n     shared costs, and how the partners will deliver services \n     under the system. If local areas fail to come to an agreement \n     regarding sufficient funding of one-stop infrastructure \n     costs, a State one-stop infrastructure funding mechanism can \n     be imposed for those local areas. Mandatory partner program \n     contributions, pursuant to the State one-stop infrastructure \n     funding mechanism, are based on the proportionate use of the \n     one-stop centers and subject to specified caps.\n     Employment and Training Activities\n       For youth, the bill utilizes the existing formula to allot \n     funds to States for youth services. It improves upon existing \n     youth services by placing a priority on out-of-school youth \n     (75 percent of funding at the State and local level), and \n     focusing on career pathways for youth, drop-out recovery \n     efforts, and education and training that lead to the \n     attainment of a high school diploma and a recognized \n     postsecondary credential. A priority is also included for \n     work-based learning activities.\n       For adults and dislocated workers, the bill utilizes the \n     existing formulas with the inclusion of a minimum and maximum \n     allotment percentage for the dislocated worker formula \n     beginning in fiscal year 2016. The managers believe the \n     addition of the minimum and maximum percentages will help \n     bring stability to the only formula that currently does not \n     include such mechanisms, and will reduce funding volatility \n     for States year to year. The bill preserves the governor's 15 \n     percent set aside for statewide activities.\n       To eliminate the perceived ``sequence of services'' under \n     current law, requiring an individual to proceed through core \n     and intensive services before training eligibility can be \n     determined, the bill consolidates core and intensive services \n     into a new ``career services'' category. While the services \n     remain similar to those under current law, the structure is \n     intended to provide more flexibility to one-stop staff in \n     determining a participant's need for training. Local boards \n     are required to convene, use, or implement industry or sector \n     partnerships. The bill also improves upon the mechanisms for \n     local boards to provide education and training to eligible \n     participants by adding the following optional methods, under \n     certain guidelines, for training--contracting for classes of \n     training for multiple participants or on a pay-for \n     performance basis; incumbent worker training; and \n     transitional jobs strategies. Finally, the title includes \n     authorization levels for appropriations for the State grant \n     programs.\n     Job Corps\n       The bill improves upon the current Job Corps program by \n     strengthening the contracting requirements for centers, \n     requiring the program use the performance accountability \n     indicators for youth described in section 116 and \n     strengthening reporting requirements, and allowing the \n     Department of Labor to provide technical assistance to \n     centers. The bill includes requirements for a financial \n     report and a third party review of the program every five \n     years. The bill also includes a provision allowing operators \n     of a high-performing center, defined by performance criteria, \n     to be eligible to compete in any procurement process for that \n     center. Where there is not sufficient performance information \n     for the time period required under section 147(b)(2)(B) or \n     Section 147(h)(3) due to the effects of a natural disaster or \n     the participation of the center in a performance pilot \n     program, it is the intent of the managers the Secretary apply \n     the provisions of that section to any performance information \n     that is available to the Secretary from the relevant period \n     preceding the time the determination under that provision is \n     made. This would allow entities operating the center to have \n     an opportunity to meet performance requirements allowing them \n     to compete where the absence of complete information is not \n     the fault of the operating entity.\n     National Programs\n       The bill reauthorizes the Native American program; the \n     Migrant and Seasonal Farmworker program; and YouthBuild. It \n     also includes provisions for National Dislocated Worker \n     Grants; technical assistance under title I; and evaluations, \n     research, studies and multistate projects conducted by the \n     Secretary of Labor. The bill requires the Secretary of Labor \n     to conduct a multistate study on strategies for placing \n     individuals in jobs and education and training programs that \n     lead to equivalent pay for men and women, including the \n     participation of women in high-wage, high-demand occupations \n     in which women are underrepresented. We believe this is \n     important because a key element of raising women's wages is \n     to provide access to occupations that are predominantly held \n     by men, pay well, and are in demand in the economy. Many \n     occupations today are still dominated by one gender, with \n     more than 75 percent of the jobs in that occupation held by \n     men or by women. Jobs that are predominantly held by men--in \n     industries like transportation, manufacturing, or \n     construction trades--often pay considerably more than jobs \n     traditionally held by women, such as child care workers, \n     health care workers, clerical workers, or workers in retail \n     or other service sectors industries. The managers expect the \n     Secretary to review existing programs and research, State \n     laws and initiatives, and any other relevant project, to \n     determine successful strategies for placement and retention \n     of women in relevant training or jobs and to provide States \n     and localities with the information, tools, and assistance \n     they need to develop programs and activities that will \n     replicate such strategies. We request completion of this \n     project within eighteen months of enactment.\n       The bill requires an independent evaluation of the \n     activities under title I at least once every four years for \n     the purpose of improving the management and effectiveness of \n     programs and activities. In recognition of the changing \n     demands of the economy, the bill allows the YouthBuild \n     program to expand into additional in-demand industry sectors \n     or occupations in the region.\n       The bill includes authorization of appropriations for the \n     programs under subtitle D.\n     Administration\n       The bill adds restrictions against lobbying activities with \n     funds under this title. The managers do not intend for these \n     provisions to restrict awareness or outreach activities \n     regarding services and activities under title I.\n\n\n         Title II--The Adult Education and Family Literacy Act\n\n       In reauthorizing title II, the Adult Education and Family \n     Literacy Act, the bill places an emphasis on ensuring States \n     and local providers offer basic skills, adult education, \n     literacy activities, and English language acquisition \n     concurrently or integrated with occupational skills training \n     to accelerate attainment of secondary school diplomas and \n     postsecondary credentials. Making sure these skills are \n     solidly in place for all students is a priority. The bill \n     also emphasizes utilization of a career pathway approach for \n     adult learners to support transitions to postsecondary \n     education or training and employment opportunities.\n       The bill requires all adult basic education and literacy \n     programs to use the same set of primary indicators of \n     performance accountability outlined for all employment and \n     training activities authorized under this Act. Individuals \n     receiving these services should be able to use these skills \n     in obtaining a regular secondary school diploma or its \n     recognized equivalent, obtaining full time employment, \n     increasing their median earnings, and enrolling in \n     postsecondary education or training, or earning a recognized \n     postsecondary credential.\n\n[[Page S3985]]\n\n       It is essential for adult educators to work closely with \n     workforce development stakeholders in the State, including \n     State and local workforce boards. To help in achieving a \n     seamless statewide workforce development system, the bill \n     requires title II programs to submit a unified State plan \n     with the other core programs within this Act. The bill also \n     provides funds for States to use in offering eligible \n     providers of adult education technical assistance, providing \n     professional development training to improve the instruction \n     and outcomes for adult learners, and conducting evaluations. \n     It encourages State and local leaders to provide activities \n     contextually and concurrently with workforce preparation and \n     training activities for a specific occupation or occupational \n     cluster for the purpose of educational and career \n     advancement.\n       The bill authorizes national activities to assist States \n     and local providers in developing valid, measurable, and \n     reliable performance data, and in using such performance \n     information for the improvement of adult education and family \n     literacy education programs. The bill also includes \n     provisions to support research and evaluation of adult \n     education activities at the national level. Finally, the bill \n     places an emphasis on integrating English literacy with \n     civics education, as well as adult education and occupational \n     training activities.\n\n\n             Title III--Amendments to the Wagner-Peyser Act\n\n       Title III of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act \n     makes amendments to the Wagner-Peyser Act of 1933, which \n     authorizes the public employment services and the employment \n     statistics system. Amendments to the Wagner-Peyser Act \n     generally maintain current law but also reflect the need to \n     align the statute with the other changes in the bill such as \n     including the State employment services in the unified State \n     plan; aligning performance accountability indicators with \n     those indicators used for core programs--as described in \n     section 116 of title I; renaming ``employment statistics'' to \n     the ``workforce and labor market information system'' and \n     updating the Workforce Information Council; and providing for \n     staff professional development in order to strengthen the \n     quality of services. Authorization of appropriations for the \n     workforce and labor market information system and the \n     workforce information council is provided for each of the \n     fiscal years of 2015 through 2020.\n\n\n         Title IV--Amendments to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973\n\n       Title IV of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act \n     amends and reauthorizes the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The \n     Rehabilitation Act was last reauthorized in 1998.\n       The Rehabilitation Act is an important law for individuals \n     with disabilities, particularly those with significant \n     disabilities. It authorizes programs that affect the daily \n     lives of many individuals with disabilities, including the \n     vocational rehabilitation program (training, services, and \n     supports for employment); the independent living program; and \n     research and information on new technology to assist \n     individuals with disabilities.\n       There remains a critical need for employment and training \n     services for individuals with disabilities. Almost 25 years \n     after the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act, it \n     is still difficult for many individuals with significant \n     disabilities to find full time employment that is \n     commensurate with their skills, interests, and goals. Yet \n     State vocational rehabilitation programs can play a \n     significant role in meeting this need by providing training, \n     services and supports for individuals with disabilities.\n       It is especially important to provide young people with \n     disabilities more opportunities to practice and improve their \n     workplace skills, to consider their career interests, and to \n     get real world work experience. Those activities are \n     prioritized in the amendments to the Act. For example, the \n     bill requires State vocational rehabilitation agencies to \n     make ``pre-employment transition services'' available to all \n     students with disabilities, and to coordinate those services \n     with transition services provided under the Individuals with \n     Disabilities Education Act. State vocational rehabilitation \n     programs will set aside at least 15 percent of their Federal \n     program funds to help young people with disabilities \n     transition from secondary school to postsecondary education \n     programs and employment.\n       In addition, these amendments establish a framework to \n     ensure every young person with a disability, regardless of \n     their level of disability, has the opportunity to experience \n     competitive, integrated employment. These requirements will \n     provide young people with disabilities with the opportunity \n     to develop their skills and to use supports, available \n     through State vocational rehabilitation programs, to \n     experience competitive, integrated employment as they leave \n     school and enter the workforce.\n       In order to better align the Independent Living program \n     that serves individuals with significant disabilities living \n     in the community with other similar efforts, the amendments \n     transition the administration of the Independent Living \n     program from the Department of Education to the Department of \n     Health and Human Services, Administration for Community \n     Living. The transition moves the program to an agency with a \n     lifespan and community focus and will better allow the \n     program to fulfill its goal to support ``independent living . \n     . . and the integration and full inclusion of individuals \n     with disabilities into the mainstream of American society.''\n       The amendments also incorporate ``independent living'' into \n     the name and mission of the National Institute on Disability \n     and Rehabilitation Research and similarly move that program's \n     administration from the Department of Education to the \n     Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for \n     Community Living in order to better align the program \n     priorities with agency goals and priorities.\n\n\n                      Title V--General Provisions\n\n       The bill repeals the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 in \n     its entirety, replacing it with reforms to better serve \n     unemployed and underemployed workers as well as employers. In \n     doing so, authority is provided to the Secretaries of Labor, \n     Education, and Health and Human Services to establish a \n     smooth and orderly transition period to implement this Act.\n\n\n                     V.

Combined State Plan\n       Establishes a process for the State to allow additional \n     workforce development-related programs to participate in and \n     submit federally required plans through the State planning \n     process.\n     Chapter 2--Local Provisions\n\n     Section 106. Workforce Development Areas\n       Describes how States, in consultation with local boards and \n     chief elected officials, will identify local areas and \n     planning regions in a State based on criteria for alignment \n     with labor markets, regional economic development, and \n     availability of resources. Describes process for initial and \n     subsequent designation based on performance, fiscal \n     integrity, and participation in regional coordination \n     activities, including regional planning, information sharing, \n     and coordination of service delivery for local workforce \n     areas. Requires States to provide funding and technical \n     assistance to local areas in a regional planning process that \n     choose to become a single local workforce area. Provides for \n     an appeal process and the continuation of single State \n     designations.\n     Section 107. Local Workforce Development Boards\n       Establishes local boards. Membership includes a majority of \n     representatives of businesses in the local area and a \n     business chairperson; requires 20 percent of the board be \n     representatives of the workforce, including labor \n     organizations; other representatives include education and \n     training providers in the local area (such as community \n     colleges), the core programs in the local area, and economic \n     and community development. With the exception of core \n     programs, required one-stop programs are not required to be \n     represented on the board. Describes permissible standing \n     committees; the appointment, certification, and \n     decertification requirements for local boards; and continues \n     to allow the State board of a single State to function as the \n     local board for the State. Identifies the functions of the \n     local board, permits the local board to hire staff, and \n     directs the local board to establish and apply objective \n     qualifications for the director's position. Provides certain \n     limitations for the local board concerning the delivery of \n     career and training services.\n     Section 108. Local Plan\n       Requires each local board to develop and submit a local \n     plan to the governor, including a description of how services \n     offered through the core programs at the local level will be \n     coordinated and aligned to regional needs. Requires the \n     strategy described in the local plan to align with the State \n     strategy\n\n[[Page S3986]]\n\n     for workforce development. Local boards participating in a \n     regional planning process are required to contribute to and \n     submit a regional plan. Describes the process for plan \n     submission, approval, and modifications.\n     Chapter 3--Board Provisions\n\n     Section 111. Funding of State and Local Boards\n       Clarifies that funding to support State and local boards \n     must be provided by title I administrative funds, which may \n     be supplemented by non-Federal funds.\n     Chapter 4--Performance Accountability\n\n     Section 116. Performance Accountability System\n       Establishes performance accountability indicators at the \n     State level that are common to each of the core programs for \n     adults and performance accountability indicators applicable \n     to all youth programs within the Act. Requires States to \n     negotiate with the Secretaries of Labor and Education a level \n     of expected performance for each of the indicators. Describes \n     factors for consideration in setting and assessing levels of \n     performance. Establishes performance accountability \n     indicators for local programs and a performance negotiation \n     process similar to that required of the State. Requires \n     performance reports to be prepared and submitted by States, \n     local areas, and eligible training providers. Requires States \n     to conduct an evaluation of the core programs, use the \n     results to continuously improve programs, and make results \n     available to the public.

Mr. President, I thank all of the Senators for their \nstrong affirmative vote for the reauthorization of the Workforce \nInvestment Act, now called the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity \nAct. It is a great bill. A 95-to-3 vote I think indicates that people \nworked hard, put together a great bill that meets the needs of our \ncountry in training our new workforce for the future.\n  Again, I thank Senator Alexander, our ranking member, for a very \nclose working relationship on our committee. I would note for the \nrecord that the passage of this bill marks the 14th bill reported out \nof our committee during this session of Congress, during this Congress, \nthat will go to the President for his signature. Our committee met a \nlittle bit ago. We are now reporting another bill, the Autism Cures \nbill we hope to have again before the Senate very shortly also for \npassage. Our committee has worked very hard across party lines to reach \nthese agreements.\n  Again, I thank Senator Alexander.\n  On this bill, especially, I thank Senator Isakson and Senator Murray \nfor sticking with it. This bill took 5 years and a lot of ups and \ndowns, a lot of knots to untangle. But they did it. They worked hard at \nit.\n  I think there is a lesson here for all of us, that if you stick to it \nand you focus on the areas in which you have agreement, not those where \nyou do not have agreement, but you focus on the areas you have \nagreement and build from there, you can get good things done. So this \nis a good bill. I want to thank all of the Senators and their staffs.\n  I again thank my ranking member on the Senate Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions, HELP, Committee, Senator Alexander, and his staff. \nI appreciate their assistance in getting this bill through the floor, \nand I especially appreciate their partnership in the updates we made to \nthe Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which is title IV of the WIOA. My \nthanks to David Cleary, William Knudsen, Peter Oppenheim, and Patrick \nMurray on Senator Alexander's team.\n  I again thank the Democratic champion of reauthorizing the Workforce \nInvestment Act, WIA, Senator Murray. She and her staff have dedicated \ncountless hours to advancing this bill. In particular, my thanks to \nMike Spahn, Stacy Rich, Evan Schatz, and Scott Cheney.\n  My thanks as well to Senator Isakson and his team, who have been \ngreat partners in this bipartisan effort. I would especially like to \nthank Tommy Nguyen, Brett Layson, and Michael Black.\n  We absolutely could not have made it to the finish line in the Senate \nwithout the dedication and work of my House colleagues, Representatives \nKline, Miller, Foxx, and Hinojosa. Working with them and their staff \nhas been a pleasure, and I would like to take a moment to thank some of \nthe key staff in their offices specifically.\n  For Representatives Kline and Foxx, my thanks to Amy Jones, Rosemary \nLahasky, Brad Thomas, and James Bergeron who has since moved on to \nother professional endeavors.\n  For Representatives Miller and Hinojosa, my thanks to Megan O'Reilly, \nLeticia Mederos, Jamie Fasteau, Jacqueline Chevalier, Brian Kennedy, \nand Rosa Garcia. I also thank Michele Varnhagan and Jody Calemine, who \nhave since moved on to other professional endeavors. I would also like \nto thank Kevin McDermott in Representative McDermott's office.\n  I also offer my appreciation to my own team for their work in \nadvancing this bill. Specifically, I thank Brian Ahlberg, Derek Miller, \nCrystal Bridgeman, Michael Gamel-McCormick, Mildred Otero, Lauren \nMcFerran, Lee Perselay, Liz Weiss, Michael Kreps, and Robin Juliano. I \nwould also like to thank Andy Imparato, Pam Smith, David Johns and \nThomas Showalter, former members of my staff who have since moved on to \nother professional endeavors.\n  Let me also express my appreciation to Senator Enzi and his former \nHELP Committee staff who dedicated many years to reauthorizing WIA. \nSpecifically, I would like to express my appreciation to Beth Buehlmann \nand Kelly Hastings.\n  I also greatly appreciate the technical assistance we received from \nthe Federal agencies and the Congressional Research Service.\n  Specifically, I thank the Department of Labor and the Department of \nEducation for their technical assistance. Portia Wu, Gerri Fiala, Mark \nMorin, Sean Cartwright, Michelle Rose, Adri Jayaratne, Julia McKinney, \nand so many others at the Department played key roles in moving this \nlegislation forward.\n  At the Department of Education, I extend my thanks to Gabriella \nGomez, Lloyd Horwich, Brenda Dann-Messier, Jodie Fingland, and Johan \nUvin.\n  I also thank the following staff at the Congressional Research \nService for the expert assistance they provided during this process--\nDavid Bradley, Benjamin Collins, Adrienne Fernandes-Alcantara, and Kate \nManuel.\n  Finally, we could not do this work without the help of the Senate \nLegislative Counsel. Liz King, Kristin Romero, Amy Gaynor, and others \non their team were instrumental in drafting this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I want to thank our chairman and ranking member, Senator \nHarkin and Senator Alexander, for their tremendous work and backing us \nas we worked through this process. I again thank my partner, Senator \nIsakson, who was so diligent and true to his word and worked through \nevery issue with us. I want to thank him for that.\n  I also will take a minute this afternoon to extend a sincere thank \nyou to all of the staff who worked so hard to help put this bill \ntogether, worked through its challenges, and got us to this point today \nwhere we have passed it in the Senate. If the Senate will bear with me, \nwe have a lot of names, but I think that tells you how many people \nworked so hard on this. From my office: senior advisor Scott Cheney; my \nchief of staff Mike Spahn; my Budget Committee staff director Evan \nSchatz; Stacy Rich and Emma Fulkerson from my floor and leadership \nstaff; my entire communications team, especially Eli Zupnick and Sean \nCoit; and everyone else from my team who has worked so very hard to \nmove this bill forward.\n  I thank the wonderful staff from Senator Isakson's office: Tommy \nNguyen, staff director of the HELP Subcommittee on Employment and \nWorkplace Safety, as well as Brett Layson and Michael Black who have \nbeen incredible to work with.\n  I thank Chairman Harkin's Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nCommittee team: senior education policy adviser Crystal Bridgeman; \nchief education counsel Mildred Otero; disability policy director \nMichael Gamel-McCormick; disability counsel Lee Perselay; Derek Miller, \nstaff director of the HELP Committee; deputy staff director and labor \npolicy director of the HELP Committee Lauren McFerren; and labor policy \nadviser Liz Weiss; and many more on his staff who have helped.\n  I also thank the staff of Senator Alexander: education policy adviser \nPatrick Murray; education policy director and counsel Peter Oppenheim; \nBill Knudsen, education policy advisor; and HELP Committee staff \ndirector and chief of staff David Cleary.\n  We also benefited from the expertise of the Congressional Research \nService. I thank David Bradley, Benjamin Collins, and Adrienne \nFernandes-Alcantara.\n  I would be remiss if I did not thank the professionals in the Senate \nLegislative Counsel's office, especially Liz King, Amy Gaynor, Kristin \nRomero, and Katie Grendon.\n  As you can see, a lot of people worked a very long time to get us \nwhere we are. This has been an 11-year process, so there have been a \nlot of staff who worked on various versions of this reauthorization \nover the years. I cannot name them all, but there are some who deserve \nrecognition as well: Gerri Fiala, Bill Kamela, Beth Buehlmann, Kelly \nHastings, Pam Smith, David Johns, and Glee Smith.\n  Of course, my thanks to the staff in the House and the \nadministration, of whom there are far too many to mention here.\n  I think that tells all of us that this is a bill that was worked on \ndiligently by\n\n[[Page S3991]]\n\nmany over the years. Who will benefit at the end of the day are our \nworkforce and our employers and our country.\n  I thank again my counterpart Senator Isakson for working with me to \nget this done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I want to associate myself with the remarks of Senator \nHarkin and Senator Patty Murray from Washington. I reiterate what I \nsaid in my opening statement about how much regard and respect I have \nfor Senator Murray, for the job she has done. We would not be here \ntoday if it were not for Patty Murray. I am grateful for her support \nand her kind words.\n  I want to reiterate all of the names she said, all the thanks that we \nhave. But I want to particularly thank my staff who have made me once \nagain look good. That is a difficult job to do sometimes. I thank Tommy \nNguyen, Amanda Maddox, Michael Black, Brett Layson. I appreciate all \nthey have done; Joan Kirchner, my chief of staff, who came to our aid \nlast week and pulled a rabbit out of the hat in the Republican \nconference that allowed us to be here.\n  We all get a lot of credit as Members of the Senate. But it is our \nstaff who make or break what we do. We are very grateful to our staff \nor the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act would not become law, \nwould not get to the President's desk.\n  So to Patty Murray, to Senator Harkin, to Senator Alexander, thank \nyou. And to all of our staff, thank you for day in and day out doing \nthe real work of the Senate and for the people of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have come here every week now for 72 \nconsecutive weeks that the Senate has been in session to urge \ncolleagues to wake up to the growing threat of climate change. Today I \nhave the pleasure and honor of being joined by my friend and colleague \nSenator Joe Manchin of West Virginia.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from West Virginia and I be \nallowed to engage in a colloquy for the time we have been allotted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Senator Manchin and I come from very different parts \nof the country. We are the Ocean State, he is the Mountain State. We \nboth came here today to say that climate change is real, that human \nactivities, including the burning of fossil fuels, are causing dramatic \nchanges to the Earth's atmosphere and oceans, and to seek responsible \nsolutions that will ensure reliable, sustainable energy for the United \nStates and protect our local communities and economies from the worst \neffects of a changing climate, recognizing, as we must, that fossil \nfuels will be part of America's fuel mix for decades.\n  The recent National Climate Assessment showed many effects of climate \nchange are already being seen across the United States. In my home \nState of Rhode Island, we have Narragansett Bay, more than 3 degrees \nwarmer in the winter than it was 50 years ago. Measurements at the \nNewport tide gauge show that as the seawater warms and expands, the sea \nlevel is up almost 10 inches against our shores since the 1930s.\n  Extreme weather depends a lot on natural variability, but climate \nchange increases the odds that heat waves and heavy rain bursts will \noccur. As the climate has warmed, some types of extreme weather have \nbecome more frequent and severe. Here on this chart we see that in the \nnortheast, up here, the area which includes both Rhode Island and West \nVirginia, between 1958 and 2010, the amount of rain coming in those big \ndownpours has gone up by 70 percent.\n  Let's remember how climate change affects the economy and jobs. For \nexample, fishermen in Rhode Island have seen their winter flounder \ncatch from Narragansett Bay nearly disappear in the recent decades as \nthe bay has warmed. These are not distant climate model projections, \nthis is now. This is happening to Rhode Island.\n  The people of West Virginia have Senator Manchin fighting for them \nevery day in Washington. I know he believes that we need to find \neconomically responsible answers to environmental problems. I am proud \nto stand with him today as his friend and colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n[[Page S3992]]\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I thank the Chair.\n  I am pleased to join my friend Senator Whitehouse from the great \nState of Rhode Island to talk about this important subject. In the \npast, we may not always have agreed on how to approach this problem, \nbut at least we have come together to work on a solution together. That \nis very important. That is a rare thing in Washington, as the Presiding \nOfficer knows. We are determined to see if we can find common ground to \nmove forward.\n  As the Senator suggested, the way we produce and consume energy in \nour States is quite different. I am the Mountain State, he is the Ocean \nState. Nonetheless, we both agree we need to strike a balance between \nthe economy and the environment. One cannot go it alone. It takes a \nbalance, if you will, in about anything we do in life, one that \nacknowledges the reality of the climate change, while also \nunderstanding that fossil fuels, more specifically coal that we produce \nso much of in our State, is such a part of our economy, is a vital part \nof our energy mix for decades to come. That is by the Department of \nEnergy, the EAI's own claim.\n  There is no doubt that 7 billion people have impacted our world's \nclimate. Those who deny that I believe are wrong. A lot of them are my \nfriends. I believe we have had an impact and we have a responsibility. \nBut we need to know what is going on and the facts we are dealing with \nin the world today.\n  There are more than 8 billion tons of coal consumed around the world \neach year. This gives an outline of where most of that coal is \nconsumed. Currently China burns more than 4 billion tons per year. They \nare not stopping or letting up. If anything, they are increasing their \nconsumption and building more coal-fired plants as we speak, while the \nUnited States and Europe each burn less than 1 billion tons. So the \nUnited States of America, you could say, uses less than one-eighth of \nthe coal consumed annually in the world. If we stopped burning every \nkind of coal, would that really clean up the climate? But if we find \nways to do it better, can we help the rest of the world clean up the \nclimate? That is what we are here to talk about.\n  There is a broad agreement in the scientific community that carbon \nemissions and other human contributions are causing substantial changes \nto the Earth's climate. According to the West Virginia State \nClimatologist's Office, five of the six wettest years have occurred \nsince 1989; four have occurred since 1990.\n  Just as I do not deny the existence of climate change, my friend \nSenator Whitehouse does not deny that eliminating coal from the energy \nmix would hurt the reliability of our grid. He knows that you cannot do \nit. We have got to work together to keep the reliability in the system, \nwhich is so vital to people all over this country.\n  Without coal, the northeast United States would have suffered severe \nand enduring power outages during last winter's polar vortex. If our \nreliability had failed during the polar vortex we came through this \npast year, there is no question people would have died--no question at \nall.\n  Importantly, during that period of time, coal provided 92 percent of \nthe increase in energy needed to survive that disaster.\n  Coal was able to go online to back up the grid. Ninety-two percent of \nit was driven by coal because it is dependable, reliable, and \naffordable.\n  This chart shows basically the portion of increase in U.S. \nelectricity generation by fuel, January-February 2014, the times we \nneeded it most to keep the grid systems up and running. You can see \ncoal--92 percent--and natural gas fell because of distribution problems \nwe had. It will increase, it will get better as distribution and \ninfrastructure is built.\n  Oil, nuclear, hydro, renewable--you can see they weren't able to pick \nup the demand that was needed or the load that was needed to keep the \nsystem moving.\n  Nick Akins is the CEO of American Electric Power. He said this about \nthe polar vortex: ``This country did not just dodge a bullet--it dodged \na cannon ball''\n  We need to address climate change, but we need to do it while \nmaintaining the reliability of our electricity system. Senator \nWhitehouse and I both realize that coal will remain a vital part of our \nNation's general portfolio for the foreseeable future.\n  According to the President's own Energy Information Administration--\nthe EIA--coal generated about 40 percent of all U.S. electricity in \n2011. In 2040 coal will still generate more than 30 percent of the \ndomestic electricity that is needed.\n  This chart basically shows where we are going in the foreseeable \nfuture. This is 2040. By 2040 natural gas will be at 35 percent, and \ncoal will still be at 32 percent--both, it can be said, out of fossil, \nso you have 67 percent. Renewals increase to 16 percent. Nuclear is \ngoing down to 16 percent, and I believe we have to reengage our efforts \nthere. I really do. So coal will assume the dominant world markets for \nthe foreseeable future.\n  According to EIA, coal provided 69 percent of China's energy \nconsumption in 2011. This chart gives a little bit of an idea of where \nwe are. China used four times the amount of coal used in the United \nStates that year. Coal supplied 41 percent of India's total energy \nconsumption. During that period of time, India used roughly the same \namount of coal as we did in the United States. By 2040 China will \nproduce 62 percent of its electricity from coal, while India will \nproduce 56 percent. During the next few years, some 1,200 new coal \nplants are going to be built across 59 countries; 363 are going to be \nbuilt in China and 455 in India alone.\n  It is unbelievable when you look at more than 8 billion tons of coal \nthat are consumed around the world each year. China currently burns \nmore than 4 billion tons per year, while the United States and Europe \nburn less than 1 billion tons. Use in these countries and in other \nparts of the world is projected to grow dramatically for decades to \ncome.\n  The United States has already been a leader in proving to the world \nthat we can produce coal cleaner today. Traditional pollutants--sulfur, \nmercury, nitrogen, and particulates--have been cut 80 percent in the \nlast several years. What is less known is that technologies are being \ndeveloped--and some already exist--that dramatically lower coal plant \ncarbon emissions.\n  With smarter investments from the public and private sectors, we will \nnot only finish the first generation of carbon capture, storage, and \nutilization plants but also develop the second generation of these \ntechnologies. When that happens in the not so distant future, we will \nlead the world toward utilization of fossil fuels in a way that \nproduces negligible or zero harmful emissions.\n  With the right policies and the right coordination between the public \nand private sectors, we can lead by example and show the world that we \ncan burn fossil fuels cleaner than ever. Most importantly, we can do \nall of this while protecting consumers, creating jobs, and growing our \neconomy.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I agree with my friend from West Virginia that we \nmust address climate change in a way that protects jobs in all sectors \nand ensures grid stability.\n  Fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas are indeed going to be an \nimportant part of America's energy mix for decades. So we need to \ninvest, as Senator Manchin has suggested, in reducing the carbon \npollution we generate from these sources.\n  We also need to adapt our power infrastructure to withstand the \neffects of climate change. Extreme weather has become the main cause of \nblackouts in the United States.\n  The President's Council of Economic Advisers and the Department of \nEnergy counted 679 widespread outages between 2003 and 2012 due to \nsevere weather. Fifty-eight percent of power outages since 2002 and 87 \npercent of outages affecting 50,000 or more customers were caused by \nsevere weather such as thunderstorms, hurricanes, and blizzards. The \naverage annual cost of power outages caused by severe weather is \nbetween $18 billion and $33 billion per year. The U.S. Energy \nInformation Administration compiled data that is plotted on this chart \nshowing that weather-related power outages are already on the rise \nsince just the early nineties.\n  Addressing climate change is also important to grid stability.\n  We also should expand and modernize our electric grid. A smarter grid \nwill make it easier to respond to and recover from extreme weather \nevents,\n\n[[Page S3993]]\n\nwill boost efficiency within the system, will help lower utility bills, \nand will bring more renewable energy online.\n  In both our States, Senator Manchin and I realize it is in America's \ninterest to be leaders in the research, development, and deployment of \nenergy efficiency tools; in cleaner fossil fuel research; and in \nrenewable energy technologies--particularly ones we can export. I know \nSenator Manchin has some of these technologies being rolled out in his \nState.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. When I was Governor of West Virginia, we set and have \nnow achieved an alternative where we are going to reduce our carbon \nfootprint by 25 percent by using coal in a cleaner fashion and also \nsome of the other things we do, which I will explain. Not only did we \ndo it, we did it 10 years earlier than we had targeted. In 2013, 4.1 \npercent of West Virginia's energy already came from hydroelectric and \nwind energy. Mount Storm Wind Farm--so many people don't know what we \nhave done in our little State because we are all in; we want to do it \nall, and we are trying everything we have--is the second largest wind \nfarm east of the Mississippi, 17 miles across the beautiful landscape.\n  I also agree with Senator Whitehouse on the importance of energy \nefficiency. With our friend Senator Hoeven of North Dakota, I have \nintroduced the All-Of-The-Above Federal Building Energy Conservation \nAct, legislation that would improve the energy efficiency of all \nFederal buildings and set an example for the private sector.\n  This legislation takes a commonsense, all-of-the-above approach to \nthe issue of Federal energy efficiency. I believe that by encouraging \nthe use of innovative technologies and practices, instituting \nreasonable goals, and allowing building managers flexibility, we can \nachieve better environmental stewardship in a cost-effective manner.\n  As Governors, Senator Hoeven--a Republican from North Dakota--and I \nrelied on common sense to guide our State policies, and this bill \napplies that much needed common sense to Federal policies. We should be \nusing all of our abundant resources, including coal, to power our \nNation in the most efficient way possible. Our bill accomplishes this \ngoal and proves the Federal Government can lead the way in using fossil \nfuels to achieve greater energy efficiency in a much cleaner fashion.\n  While efficiency and renewables are important, let me say again that \nit is most important to reduce emissions from coal plants while keeping \nthem running well into the future. Advances in coal-use technologies \nwill continue to develop with help from the public sector.\n  Enhanced oil recovery is already developing into a valuable tool for \naugmenting domestic oil production. We need Federal investments for \ntechnology such as EOR.\n  Research is ongoing for the use of coal and CO2 for a \nmultitude of new energy and consumer products, including fertilizers, \nliquid fuels, and plastic materials.\n  I just had a gentleman come to my office who basically makes carbon \nout of coal which cleanses the water we drink.\n  So there are so many things. Senator Whitehouse is right. There are \nso many things that we are using, and we can do a lot more.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Efficiency is something we take seriously in Rhode \nIsland as well.\n  In 2013 the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy ranked \nRhode Island as the sixth most energy efficient State in the country. \nThe Energy Information Administration in 2011 ranked Rhode Island the \nlowest in energy consumption--which, as the Presiding Officer from the \nsmall State of Delaware can understand, we have a bit of an unfair \nadvantage--but we were also the sixth lowest in total energy costs per \ncapita. We do our part to save energy, avoid emissions, lower costs, \nand reduce the demand and stress on the electric grid.\n  Rhode Island and eight other States participate in the Regional \nGreenhouse Gas Initiative--we call it ``Reggi''--which caps carbon \nemissions and sells permits to emit greenhouse gases to powerplants. \nOne of the ways Rhode Island has been able to drive down our energy \nconsumption and our utility bills is by investing the money generated \nthrough RGGI into energy efficiency. Rhode Island invests over 91 \npercent of its RGGI proceeds in energy efficiency projects and \nimprovements, helping residents save money on their utility bills and \nmaking small businesses more competitive.\n  Rhode Island is also poised to gain scores of jobs from the \ndevelopment of offshore wind. I think we have the advantage on West \nVirginia in offshore wind. Our private developer of offshore wind, \nDeepwater Wind, has received its first major environmental permit to \nbegin deployment in the Block Island wind farm area.\n  The price of wind energy has decreased over 90 percent since the \nearly 1980s and is now competitive in the energy markets. I am working \nto make wind energy more a part of our energy portfolio.\n  At the Federal level, our energy policy must use the best science \navailable to improve the way we use fossil fuels, and our Tax Code \nshould help address climate change while leveling the playing field for \nvarious energy sources.\n  I believe carbon-driven climate change hurts our economy, damages our \ninfrastructure, and harms public health. Yet those costs are not \nfactored into the cost of fossil fuels. That means the cost of the \npollution has been borne by the public. I believe we should adopt a \ncarbon fee to correct this market failure and return all its revenue to \nthe American people--what Republican supporters of a carbon fee call \nrevenue neutral.\n  On a smaller scale, Congress can also extend the renewable energy tax \ncredits and other measures that are supported by Members on both sides \nof the aisle, helping renewable energy in West Virginia and a \nbipartisan array of States.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. The Senator and I disagree on a few things, but I \nadamantly disagree with my dear friend Senator Whitehouse regarding the \nwisdom of a carbon fee or so-called carbon tax. But I do agree that we \ncan use the Tax Code and other Federal tax incentives to help clean up \nfossil fuels. That is why we are here together to find a pathway.\n  First, the DOE must approve $8 billion in loan guarantees for \nadvanced fossil fuel projects that they have had available since 2005. \nNone of it has been invested to try to help use the fuel that we depend \non--coal--in a much better, cleaner fashion. Also, I found out that we \nalso have $3.2 billion from the stimulus money to be used for shovel-\nready coal projects that is still sitting and hasn't been invested. So \nthere is a lot we can do without appropriating any new money, just \nusing the money that is there for the purpose it was intended.\n  New tax incentives could be employed to incentivize providers to \nupdate sub-critical plants to the super- and ultra-super-critical \nconfigurations that pave the way for CCS.\n  Finally, we need to incentivize the second generation of CCS \ntechnology, the one that holds the future for promise of coal use with \nnegligible emissions.\n  What are we talking about? Carbon capture sequestration, just being \nused for that purpose, if you don't have a secondary source to where \nyou can put it and sell it for enhanced oil recovery, as we call it--\nthe technology that we could use in the shale that maybe can enhance \nthe gas from the shale, the Utica and Marcellus that we have in West \nVirginia--so much could have been done that we haven't done. Maybe we \ncould solidify the carbon and use it as a spent fuel. These are things \nwe need to get to, and this money lying right now in the Department of \nEnergy for almost 10 years needs to be invested.\n  With the help of Senator Whitehouse, I can only think that we can \nmove forward and find a solution.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I agree with the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia that the Department of Energy's advanced fossil projects loan \nguarantee program has not yet lived up to, at this time, its potential.\n  I will work with him to push the administration to accelerate its \nuse.\n  I wish to close my share of this colloquy by noting something very \nbasic; that is, that America has long stood before the world as an \nexceptional country and deservedly so. America proved the case for \npopular sovereignty\n\n[[Page S3994]]\n\nwith no need of kings or crowns. America took our balanced market \ncapitalism and rose to international economic dominance. America has \nlong been the vanguard of civil and human rights for our people and \naround the globe. When American military power must be used, we don't \nconquer and rule. We come home. This exceptional nature confers upon us \na responsibility to lead, to be an example, to be, as President Reagan \nsaid, ``a shining city on a hill.''\n  Our generation will be judged by whether we were responsible about \nclimate change, whether we listened, and whether we led.\n  Senator Manchin and I are both committed to the idea that American \ninnovation can create the clean energy technologies of the future, so \nthat when it comes to addressing the biggest problems facing our world, \nthe United States should be out front, and we are committed to working \ntogether to find responsible solutions to the climate crisis.\n  We also realize we have different perspectives on what those \nsolutions should look like. I live in a State that is harmed by carbon \npollution, and Senator Manchin is from a State that sees economic \nbenefit from coal. We believe we could both learn more about those \ndifferent perspectives. So I am committing to travel with Senator \nManchin to West Virginia to see the coal plants that power many parts \nof our country and meet the people there working to curb pollution and \nimprove efficiency, and I invite Senator Manchin to Rhode Island to see \nhow climate change is taking its toll on our shorelines and marine \nindustries.\n  America is still a beacon to the world because ultimately we have the \nability to work through disagreements to common ground on a shared \nplatform of fact. With the commitment of serious leaders such as \nSenator Manchin, I am confident we can move forward to an energy future \nthat preserves the economy and quality of life in West Virginia, in \nRhode Island, and for all Americans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nManchin have such time as he needs to conclude his colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. Again, I say to my \ngood friend Senator Whitehouse from Rhode Island, I look forward to \ncoming to his beautiful State of Rhode Island and seeing all of what \nthey are doing and the efficiencies they have and technology they are \nincorporating. I also look forward to showing him my State, the \nbeautiful State of West Virginia, and its great people.\n  We have both visited each other's States before, so we know how good \nour States are. It is going to be great to revisit.\n  I thank the Senator also for joining me on the floor as we continue \nto have this extremely important dialogue. If Senator Whitehouse and I \ncan start looking for a pathway, I am sure friends from both sides of \nthe aisle can join us. That is what we are trying to have happen.\n  I agree with Senator Whitehouse, the United States of America has \nlong stood before the world as an exceptional country that people look \nup to. We have reigned as the dominant world power and have played the \nrole of the world's leader for more than 200 years.\n  Coal use is expanding across the globe, and we need to face that \nreality--and we must take our position as the world leader and broker \nsolutions, knowing the rest of the world is going to use this product \nmore than ever before. So finding a balance of the environment between \nour concerns and our economic prosperity is going to happen. We should \nbe that leader also.\n  The solution for the United States is to develop a technology that \nwill allow us to use the fuels we need cleanly and to export that \ntechnology to the world.\n  Yes, West Virginia and Rhode Island are indeed different in many \nways, but most importantly the Senator and I both know they are both \npart of this great country, and that is what makes America great. We \ncan deliberate and challenge each other's positions on any one issue--\nand we sure have had our share of dogged debates on the issues of \nclimate change and energy issues--but when it comes to deciding what is \nbest for our future generations and our beautiful Earth, there is \nalways room for reasonable compromise and a way forward.\n  So as we continue to work diligently in the Senate, I also look \nforward to visiting again with him, and we will make that happen sooner \nthan later.\n  Once again, I thank Senator Whitehouse for coming to the table to \nestablish a truly commonsense, all-of-the-above energy policy that \nacknowledges the vital role coal must play moving forward.\n  This energy strategy will also help protect good-paying jobs, boost \nour economy nationwide and around the world, and improve the quality of \nlife of all living things.\n  We are going to fix this together, not as Democrats or Republicans \nbut as Americans, as the world leaders we always have been. We have \nbeen looking to find the balance, and we will find the balance and show \nnot only America but the world that we can look past our differences to \nbetter this world. I look forward so much to that. We both have looked \nat it from this standpoint: We both agree we need to work together and \nbasically agree we have a responsibility in this world and this country \nto be a leader again in finding a pathway to using the energy the good \nLord gave us and find the best balance we can with the economy and \nenvironment, cleaning up the environment for which we are responsible.\n  I thank my good friend, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The senior Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/25/senate-section/article/S3994-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3994-S3997]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE AMENDMENT PROCESS\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, before I came to the Senate, I read in the \nhistory and civics books that the Senate was called the world's \ngreatest deliberative body, where anybody with a good idea or even a \nbad idea at least had an opportunity to talk about it, offer an \namendment or legislation, and get a vote. That is what was meant by \n``the world's greatest deliberative body.''\n  Unfortunately, the Senate has become virtually unrecognizable to \nthose of us who began our tenure under the previous leadership of the \nSenate.\n  Simply put, we have gone from an institution that legislates, that \ndebates the great ideas to solve the problems and challenges of this \ngreat democracy to one that has become a killing floor for good ideas.\n  We have had at least three bipartisan bills in the last few weeks the \nmajority leader has stopped because he has refused the opportunity for \nRepublicans in the minority and the Democrats in the majority to offer \nany amendments and to get votes.\n  I think about the Shaheen-Portman bill, the energy conservation bill, \nthe tax extenders bill for the expiring 50 or so tax provisions, and \nthe appropriations bill that recently was on the Senate floor. All of \nthese pieces of legislation enjoy bipartisan support. So one would \nthink, in a dysfunctional Senate, at least those kinds of bills would \nhave the opportunity to get debate, amendment, and passage.\n  That is not the case because the majority leader insists on a ``my \nway or the highway'' mentality. In essence, he wants to be the traffic \ncop who decides whose ideas get to be debated, what amendments get to \nbe offered, and what votes get to occur.\n  As one Senator from a State that represents 26 million constituents, \nI refuse to participate in a process where the majority leader from \nNevada gets to tell my constituents what kind of amendments I get to \noffer on their behalf. It is unacceptable. This is not the Senate I \njoined when I got here nor a Senate any of us should be proud of.\n  Shortly after I got to the Senate, Republicans became the majority \nparty. I always tell my friends and constituents back home, being in \nthe majority is a lot more fun than being in the minority. But back \nthen it was understood by both parties that the price of being in the \nmajority, and recognizing and respecting the minority did have rights, \nis that you had to take some tough votes on amendments, but after all \nthat is why we are here. That is part of the price we pay for serving \nin the Senate--to vote sometimes on things we would prefer not to vote \non\n\n[[Page S3995]]\n\nand sometimes we have to take tough votes.\n  Like it or not, that is how the Senate used to operate. Both \nRepublicans and Democrats alike recognized that allowing an open \namendment process was about guaranteeing that all Americans--all \nAmericans--those represented by Senators in the majority and those \nrepresented by Senators in the minority--that all Americans acting \nthrough their elected representatives had a voice and a vote on the \nSenate floor.\n  Sadly, under the current majority leader, the amendment process has \nbecome a distant memory. Again, this is not just about a Senator's \nprerogative. This isn't about just the process or procedure. This is \nabout our constitutional form of governance, where every State has two \nSenators and every Senator has the prerogative to represent their \nconstituents to the best of their ability.\n  Here is a sad statistic: Since last July, nearly 1 year ago, we have \nhad rollcall votes on a mere nine minority amendments; that is, among \nthe 45 of us who sit on this side of the Chamber, we have only had a \nchance for nine rollcall votes on amendments.\n  Meanwhile, in the House of Representatives, our friends in the House \nheld rollcall votes on more than 160 minority amendments.\n  In other words, Republicans control the House; Democrats control the \nSenate. But in the Democratic-controlled Senate, the minority had nine \nvotes on amendments. In the Republican-controlled House, the minority \ngot 160 votes on amendments.\n  So this isn't just about our being denied amendments. The fact is and \nwhat I can't understand is why majority party Democrats are willing to \nstand by and allow the majority leader to deny their rights and to deny \ntheir constituents a voice and a vote on the important work done in the \nSenate.\n  Since July, we have actually had fewer rollcall votes on Democratic \namendments than on Republican amendments. Imagine. I understand being \nin the minority--and being in the minority means not often getting your \nway, but if I was in the majority and the majority leader was shutting \nme out and my constituents out and denying us a chance to have votes on \namendments--and I am a Member of the majority party--I think I would \nhave some tough explanations to give to my constituents about why I was \nnot allowed to be effective as their representative in the Senate.\n  But here is an even more shocking scenario. For freshman Democrats--\npeople newly elected to the Senate--this is what Politico said \nyesterday:\n\n       Since joining the Senate in January 2013, the 12 freshmen \n     Democrats have not had a single vote on the floor on any \n     amendment bearing any of their names as the lead sponsor.\n\n  That is shocking to me. So none of the 12 freshman Democrats--Members \nof the majority party--have had a single vote on any of their \namendments that bear their name as the lead sponsor since 2013--not a \nsingle vote.\n  Their constituents, the majority party, completely shut out of the \nprocess because of the dictatorship on the floor of the Senate of the \nmajority leader.\n  Over that same period, during the 113th Congress, for example, the \njunior the Senator from Alaska, the senior Senator from Arkansas, the \nsenior Senator from Colorado, the senior Senator from New Mexico, and \nthe junior Senator from Montana have not had a single rollcall vote on \nan amendment that bears their name as the lead sponsor.\n  For that matter, according to The Hill, the junior Senator from \nAlaska ``has never received a roll-call vote on an amendment he's \noffered on the Senate floor ever.'' Shocking. So not one time in his \nSenate career has the junior Senator from Alaska received a rollcall \nvote on the Senate floor because of the way the majority leader has run \nthe Senate. He has been denied the opportunity to be effective on \nbehalf of the people he represents in the Senate--and he is a Member of \nthe majority party.\n  It has gotten so bad, according to the same Politico article I cited \na moment ago, that the junior Senator from New Jersey recently asked \none of his Democratic colleagues whether voting on Presidential \nnominees was all the Senate did. He could be forgiven for thinking that \nbecause that seems like all we do these days. In addition, the junior \nSenator from Connecticut said: ``I got more substance on the floor of \nthe House in the minority than I've gotten as a member of the Senate \nmajority.''\n\n  Again--I repeat myself--these are Democrats, Members of the majority \nparty who have been shut out of the process. Their party controls the \nChamber, yet this debate is obviously not about party control or \nindividual Members, but it is about making sure that millions upon \nmillions of Americans should have their voices heard in the Senate. It \nis about giving us a chance on their behalf to represent them in this \nbody.\n  I am encouraged to read that some of my colleagues across the aisle \nare starting to push back against the majority leader's tyranny. I \nwould urge them to continue pushing back and to continue to remind the \nmajority leader that putting up a legislative blockade is not only bad \nfor the minority party and the Republicans, it is bad for the majority \nparty and the people they represent, too.\n  In conclusion, I would say that in addition to the amendment issue I \nhave spoken about for the last 10 minutes or so, there are no fewer \nthan 284--284--House-passed bills that are awaiting consideration here \nin the Senate--284. Do you not think that among those 284 bills there \nis just one or two or three decent ideas that might be debated, perhaps \nimproved upon, by an open amendment process in the Senate that we \nshould take up and consider?\n  Many of these are jobs bills, the type of legislation that would help \npromote economic growth and, boy, we sure could use some economic \ngrowth because the economy is contracting, not growing, which means \nthat jobs are scarce and people are hurting. There are bills that would \nexpand opportunity and increase family income. At a time of mass \nunemployment and stagnant wages, where the median household income has \ngone down by nearly $2,300 since June of 2009, it is simply outrageous \nthat the majority leader has refused to take up any one of those 284 \nbills that have passed the House, most of which had bipartisan support. \nIt is outrageous he has refused to let us take up those bills, many of \nwhich would help the millions of Americans who are currently looking \nfor a job who cannot find a job. The American people, after all, are \nthe reason why we are here, and they are the ones who are suffering the \nmost from the majority leader's autocratic rule. They deserve better, \nand it is time all of us, Republicans and Democrats alike, demanded \nthat.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I concur with the distinguished Senator from Texas and the concerns \nthat we have and we share about the lives of people all across the \ncountry and their ability to earn a living.\n  Tomorrow President Obama is planning to travel to Minnesota. So as I \ncome to the floor the President is making the preparations because the \nPresident said he will spend the day in the shoes of a woman who had \nwritten a letter about the economic challenges she faces. I hope the \nPresident takes the time to actually talk to other people as well and \nspend a day in their shoes as well, because I think there are a lot of \npeople in Minnesota--a lot of people in Minnesota--who would like to \nask the President about his health care law and about some of the \ndamaging side effects of the law.\n  The Mankato Times had a story from Minnesota schools to lose more \nthan $200 million because of ObamaCare. A State representative is \nquoted as saying that wasteful spending on the health care law has left \nmany taxpayers outraged because they will soon be making a significant \nimpact on Minnesota schools, on the students in the State of Minnesota. \nWill the President address that?\n  According to documents released by Minnesota's Management and Budget \nOffice, over the next 3 years, the total unfunded costs associated with \nthe health care law compliance will cost school districts statewide at \nleast $207 million. As the State representative said:\n\n       This is troubling news for our schools. This is $200 \n     million that school districts won't be\n\n[[Page S3996]]\n\n     able to use to hire more teachers to improve their \n     educational programs. This is an unneeded expense that does \n     absolutely nothing for our students.\n\n  As the Minnesota State representative says: ``It is pretty sad when \nschools are forced to prioritize ObamaCare compliance over the \neducation of our children.''\n  The President says the health care law should be forcefully defended \nand be proud of. Is that something the President is going to forcefully \ndefend and be proud of? You take a look at the side effects of the \nhealth care law, so many side effects of the health care law.\n  One of the side effects is the medical device tax that Democrats \nincluded in the law. It is a destructive tax and is hitting the people \non the ground in Minnesota where the President is going to be tomorrow. \nThis destructive tax impacts the livelihood of individuals. These are \nthe folks who work to make things such as pacemakers, artificial \njoints, ultrasound equipment. It is a tax the President asked for, the \nPresident demanded and wanted as part of the health care law, and that \nevery Democratic Senator in this Chamber voted for, including the two \nDemocratic Senators from Minnesota where the President will be \ntomorrow. It adds up to $3 billion a year. Companies will have to make \nup for that lost revenue. They are going to do it through higher prices \non other individuals and moving some of their construction and their \ndistribution overseas. Is that what the President wanted in this health \ncare law? Will he forcefully defend and be proud of that?\n  According to a survey by an industry trade group about this--the \nfolks who actually make these medical devices--that is exactly what is \nhappening. Device manufacturers have had to cut 14,000 jobs because of \nthe tax last year. They say they didn't hire another 19,000 they \nplanned to hire. That is a total of 33,000 American jobs lost because \nof the taxes in the President's health care law. Now there are more \nthan 350 medical device firms in Minnesota, companies in Minnesota that \nemploy people on the ground in Minnesota, citizens who want to be hard-\nworking individuals, supporting more than 30,000 jobs in Minnesota. \nSince the health care law passed, the medical device industry has lost \nmore than 1,000 of those jobs in Minnesota where the President will be \ntomorrow. Is the President ready to stand with those individuals about \nthe devastating side effects of his health care law?\n  One of the biggest device makers in the state is called Medtronix. \nThey announced they are moving their headquarters to Ireland. That is \nnot only because of the President's health care law and not every job \nlost in the industry is due solely to this one tax, but the Obama \nadministration's burdensome tax policies and this terrible health care \nlaw side effects are impacting people all around the country and \nspecifically in this area in Minnesota.\n  One of the side effects is fewer jobs for American families. The \nPresident has said that Democrats who voted for the law should \nforcefully defend and be proud of it. I hope someone in Minnesota will \nget the chance to ask the President tomorrow if he is proud of the \nthousands of jobs his health care law is costing the hard-working men \nand women who make these medical devices in this State of Minnesota. I \nhope the President will spend a day in the shoes of someone who lost \ntheir job as a medical device maker.\n\n  A lot of people in Minnesota and around the country are also worried \nabout another devastating side effect of the health care law, and that \nis the impact on their paychecks--smaller paychecks that a lot of \nfamilies are getting specifically because of the health care law. \nYesterday there was an article in the Washington Post, page 2, Tuesday, \nJune 24th: ``Businesses gear up for employer mandate.'' Subheadline: \n``Some cut workers' hours; others struggle with costs, logistics.''\n  Well, what happens if you cut hours? What happens if you are \nstruggling with costs? Who is impacted by that? Obviously, the families \nof the individuals who are working in those businesses. The article \nsays employers around the country have been cutting their workers' \nhours back to part-time status. Part time in the health care law is \ndefined as 30 hours a week. Most people think of a 40-hour workweek. \nNot President Obama. He has a different view of what a full-time job \nis. They had to cut back to part-time status in order to avoid paying \nfor the expensive health care mandates required by the law.\n  The article in the Washington Post yesterday adds that ``seasonal \nemployees and low wage workers such as adjunct professors, cafeteria \nstaffers'' have been especially hard hit.\n  It is happening in Minnesota. The President is going to be there \ntomorrow, and he is going to say, ``I want to walk a day with this \nwoman and see what her life is like.'' He can hand-select somebody who \nmakes it look as though his policies might be working, but there are \npeople in Minnesota who are being harmed by the President's policy.\n  In Faribault, MN, the city is to cut hours of workers because it \ncannot afford to pay for their insurance. The city of Mankato, MN, had \nto do the same, cutting most of their workers to 29 hours a week to \nkeep under the limits set by the health care law. In Hastings, MN, the \nschools have to limit how much their classroom aides, food service, and \ntransportation employees can work. The same thing is happening in towns \nand counties and businesses all over the State of Minnesota where the \nPresident will be tomorrow. They are cutting back hours, reducing the \nsize of their paychecks, and why? Because of the health care law. Is \nthe President going to spend a day in the shoes of someone who has had \ntheir hours cut back because of the health care law? Is he going to \nforcefully defend his law to those people when he is in Minnesota \ntomorrow?\n  Are the two Senators from Minnesota who voted for the health care law \nready to forcefully defend the smaller paychecks these people are \ngetting? This isn't just happening in Minnesota, it is happening all \naround the country. You know, it is not bad enough that these people \nare getting hit a second time by another very expensive side effect of \nthe health care law--smaller paychecks. Now what they are seeing is \nhigher premiums they have to pay. According to a new study, people in \nMinnesota are paying a lot more for health insurance. Why? Because of \nthe health care law. For an average 64-year-old woman in Minnesota, \npremiums would have been $273 a month in 2013 before the mandates in \nthe Obama health care law kicked in. But in 2014, buying insurance \nthrough an ObamaCare exchange, her premiums jumped to over $400 a \nmonth. She is paying $1,500 more this year than she did last year \nbecause of the President's health care law.\n  Who is going to forcefully defend that? Who is going to come and be \nproud on the floor of the Senate and speak with great pride about what \nthey have done to this woman and the effect of this health care law in \nher life?\n  For a 27-year-old man, he would have paid an average of $95 a month \nin 2013. Under the ObamaCare law, he is paying $140 a month--an extra \n$540 this year compared to last year.\n  Can the Senators who voted for this law be proud of these kinds of \npremium increases? The American people wanted reform that gave them \naccess to quality affordable care--access, quality, affordable. What \nthey are getting is higher premiums, higher copays, higher deductibles.\n  Republicans have offered solutions for patient-centered health care, \nmeasures such as increasing the ability of small businesses to get \ntogether and negotiate better rates, expanding health savings accounts, \nallowing people to buy health insurance that works for them and their \nfamilies because they know what is best for them and they don't need \nthe government and President Obama to tell them that he knows better \nwhat they need in their lives than they know what they need in their \nlives. Republicans have offered ideas that would give people the care \nthey need from a doctor they choose at a lower cost.\n  The President may not want to talk about any of these tomorrow in \nMinnesota, all the ways his health care law is hurting people in \nMinnesota and around the country, hurting education, hurting jobs, \nhurting the economy and hurting the pocketbooks of men and women around \nthe country. But Republicans are going to keep coming to the floor, \nkeep talking about the burdensome side effects, the expensive side \neffects, and sometimes the irreversible and sometimes fatal side \neffects as a\n\n[[Page S3997]]\n\nresult of this health care law. And we will continue to offer real \nsolutions for better health care without the terrible side effects that \nthe American public continues to face as a result of the President's \nhealth care law.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my \npersonal friend, Mr. Jim Host. Jim is a native of Ashland, KY, and has \nspent his life dedicated to business and public service within our home \nState. The National Football Foundation and College Hall of Fame \nrecently announced that he will receive their award for Outstanding \nContributor to Amateur Football--an honor that he is unquestionably \ndeserving of and will add to his already extensive list of awards and \naccolades.\n  A standout high school baseball player, Mr. Host passed on a $25,000 \noffer to play professionally and instead accepted a scholarship to play \nat the University of Kentucky. Host would eventually play professional \nbaseball, though only after he received his degree. As his career \nprogressed, his time as a student athlete would never be too far from \nhis thoughts.\n  In 1969, Host entered the world of politics, becoming the youngest \nmember of Governor Louie B. Nunn's cabinet at the age of 29. Two years \nlater, he was the Republican nominee for Lieutenant Governor, though he \nlost in the general election. Never one to be deterred by defeat, he \nfocused his attention squarely on a new venture--starting his own \nbusiness.\n  Mr. Host had only $107 to his name when, in 1972, he started Jim Host \nand Associates in a small office above a barber shop in downtown \nLexington. What he lacked in monetary assets, however, he made up for \nwith an impressive arsenal of smarts and determination. With these \ntools he built Host Communications, and forever altered the landscape \nof college athletics.\n  The foundation of Host Communications was the right to broadcast \nKentucky basketball games over the radio. In its early years, Jim \nHost's company was one of several entities that had this right. \nHowever, Host soon obtained the exclusive rights and expanded his \nbroadcast to 117 radio stations in the State. In addition to his radio \nbroadcast, Host bought a publishing company and printed programs for \nKentucky basketball and football games.\n  He continued to grow his business around Kentucky athletics, and over \ntime he created the first model of the consolidated multimedia rights \ncompanies we see today. By the time he sold Host Communications to IMG \nin 2007, Host provided the University of Kentucky, and over 20 other \ncollege athletic programs, with what he called the ``full-meal-deal''--\nthat is to say that TV deals, radio broadcasts, coaches' shows and \ntheir endorsements, publishing, signage, and sponsorship were all \ncontrolled by Host, and enabled the university to generate more revenue \nthan was ever thought to be possible. Today, nearly every university \nwith an athletics program follows this blueprint prepared by Jim Host.\n  Host also developed a close partnership with the NCAA and is credited \nwith creating the organization's first corporate sponsorship program.\n  Now, at age 76, Jim hasn't slowed down at all. He still gets up at 4 \na.m. every morning and is always quick to state that he ``can't sleep \nfast enough.''\n  As chairman of the Louisville Arena Authority, he was instrumental in \nthe construction of the KFC Yum! Center as well as the subsequent surge \nof new business activity in the downtown area. Additionally, he \ncurrently serves as chairman of Volar Video.\n  By way of his grit, determination, and sheer smarts, Jim Host has \nseen immense success in his business and has effected an immeasurable \nimpact on the Commonwealth of Kentucky and college athletics. I ask \nthat my U.S. Senate colleagues join me in recognizing Jim Host and \ncongratulating him for his latest award from the National Football \nFoundation.\n  The Lexington Herald-Leader recently published an article detailing \nJim Host's latest award. I ask unanimous consent that the full article \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the Lexington Herald-Leader, June 12, 2014]\n\n Lexington Businessman Jim Host Honored by National Football Foundation\n\n       The National Football Foundation and College Hall of Fame \n     has announced that sports marketing pioneer Jim Host of \n     Lexington has been named the recipient of its award for \n     Outstanding Contribution to Amateur Football.\n       ``Jim Host created a lasting legacy as a sports marketing \n     innovator, and his creative genius will continue for many \n     years as the bedrock of multimedia rights in college \n     athletics,'' the group's president and CEO, Steve Hatchell, \n     said in a news release. ``From humble beginnings, Jim built \n     Host Communications, essentially launching the practice of \n     marketing in college athletics. His efforts have resulted in \n     millions of dollars for colleges and universities nationwide, \n     and those numbers only continue to grow.''\n       First presented in 1974, the Outstanding Contribution to \n     Amateur Football Award provides national recognition to those \n     whose efforts to support the National Football Foundation \n     have been local in nature.\n       Host becomes the 38th recipient of the award.\n       Born in Ashland, Host received a baseball scholarship to \n     the University of Kentucky. After running for lieutenant \n     governor in 1971, he opened Jim Host and Associates, a one-\n     man operation above a barbershop in Lexington.\n       Host is chairman of Volar Video, which delivers customized \n     video across television, computer and mobile platforms. Volar \n     produced the live webcasts of both the National Football \n     Foundation's 56th annual awards dinner and the group's \n     announcement of the 2014 College Football Hall of Fame class.\n       Host will be honored at a dinner on Dec. 9 in New York.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/25/senate-section/article/S3997-3", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3997-S3999]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                  Second Lieutenant Joe L. Cunningham\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to a true American \nhero, Army 2LT Joe Cunningham of Kingston, OK who died on August 13, \n2011 serving our Nation in Laghman Province, Afghanistan. Lieutenant \nCunningham was assigned to Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 1st \nBattalion, 179th Infantry Regiment, 45th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, \nArmy National Guard, Stillwater, OK.\n  Joe enlisted in the U.S. Army in 2001 and joined the Army Reserves as \na military policeman. He volunteered to\n\n[[Page S3998]]\n\ndeploy to Iraq in 2005 where he served as a team leader. After \nreturning from Iraq, he served as a weapons instructor for deploying \nsoldiers. In 2008, Joe switched to the Oklahoma National Guard, serving \n18 months in the Air Guard before moving on to the Army Guard, where he \nwas accepted to Officer Candidate School. In August 2010, Joe was \ncommissioned as a second lieutenant and deployed in June 2011 to \nAfghanistan as the executive officer of B Co 1/179 Infantry.\n  Joe leaves behind his father Kirk Tucker, from Kingston, and siblings \nTracy, Terri, Bethany, Ashton, Ricky and Taylor. He was preceded in \ndeath by his mother Dorothy Cunningham. He touched the lives of many as \nevidenced by comments written on his online guest book.\n\n       ``I knew Joe he was an inspiration to the soldiers of Bco. \n     1/179 he always put soldiers first he is what a soldier \n     wanted to be professional thru and thru in the short time I \n     had to work with him he truly opened my eyes and changed my \n     views on things he was and always will be a great friend and \n     a soldier that will be greatly missed. God Bless Joe \n     Cunningham may god watch and protect you thru ``through'' the \n     gates of heaven you shall be missed. ''\n       You will be missed by all. It was pleasure and an honor to \n     have you as troop under my supervision while assigned to the \n     138th Security Forces Squadron. RIP friend and brother.''\n\n  Joe lived a life of love for his family, friends, and country. He \nenjoyed hunting, fishing and sports. Joe was a big Oklahoma Sooners fan \nand held season tickets for the Oklahoma City Thunder. He loved kids, \nand one of his greatest joys was spending time with Korlee Cunningham.\n  Joe will be remembered for his commitment to and belief in the \ngreatness of our Nation. I am honored to pay tribute to this true \nAmerican hero who volunteered to go into the fight and made the \nultimate sacrifice of his life for our freedom.\n\n\n                       Sergeant Bret D. Isenhower\n\n  Mr. President, I now wish to pay tribute to a true American hero, \nArmy SGT Bret D. Isenhower of Lamar, OK, who died on September 9, 2011, \nserving our nation in Paktya Province, Afghanistan. Sergeant Isenhower \nwas assigned to 1st Battalion, 179th Infantry Battalion, 45th Infantry \nBrigade Combat Team, Oklahoma Army National Guard.\n  Sergeant Isenhower was killed by enemy small arms fire when his team \nwas attacked while conducting combat operations in Zurmat District. He \nwas 26 years old.\n  Our prayers go out to those in his family he left behind: father \nKevin Isenhower; mother Janet Dawsey; sisters Bridgette Hall and \nKrysten Isenhower; and nephew Jackson Hall.\n  Bret graduated from Seminole High School in 2003 and then attended \nEast Central University and was a member of the Pi Kappa Alpha chapter. \nDetermined to be a soldier, he joined the Oklahoma National Guard in \n2006 as an infantryman. He deployed in support of Operation Iraqi \nFreedom for a yearlong deployment in 2007-08. He rose to the rank of \nsergeant and team leader.\n  Bret actively looked for ways to serve his community and his fellow \ncitizens. On one occasion, he and a friend were enroute to school to \ntake a final and noticed a woman pulled over on the side of the road \nwith a flat tire. Bret pulled the car over and helped change the tire \nwithout regard to the time that it took. Needless to say, he missed his \nfinal exam, but didn't care because it was the ``right thing to do.'' \nBret also served as a volunteer firefighter at the Seminole Fire \nDepartment and the Seminole County 911 dispatcher.\n  Bret cared deeply for his family and would often let his 3-year-old \nnephew Jackson use him as a human jungle gym. He was full of kindness \nand yet very brave under fire.\n  It is clearly evident how much this young man impacted his family, \ncommunity and fellow citizens and soldiers by reading through some of \nthe following quotes.\n  Laura Rose, a former teacher at Seminole High said, ``Not only did he \ngive the ultimate sacrifice for his country, but he was a good person \ntoo. Some students go on their way and you never see them again, but \nBret would come and visit and let me know how he was doing.''\n  Specialist Randen Allison credits Bret with saving his life in \nAfghanistan by reacting quickly and placing a tourniquet on his arm. \nWhen Specialist Allison thanked Bret for helping, Bret responded by \nsaying, ``Don't worry about it. I'm just doing my job.''\n  A warrior indeed, Bret died in the heat of a firefight. These tough \nfights took the life of Bret from us prematurely, but make no mistake; \nit is a fight we will win. We must continue our unwavering support for \nthe men and women protecting our Nation and allies.\n  I extend our deepest gratitude and condolences to Bret's family. He \nlived a life of love for his family, friends, and our country. He will \nbe remembered for his commitment to and belief in the greatness of our \nNation. I am honored to pay tribute to this true American hero who \nvolunteered to go into the fight and made the ultimate sacrifice of his \nlife for our freedom.\n\n\n                    First Lieutenant Damon T. Leehan\n\n  Mr. President, I also pay tribute to a true American hero, Army 1LT \nDamon T. Leehan of Moore, OK, who died on August 14, 2011 serving our \nNation in Laghman Province, Afghanistan. Lieutenant Leehan was assigned \nto A Company, 1st Battalion, 179th Infantry Regiment, 45th Infantry \nBrigade Combat Team, Oklahoma Army National Guard.\n  Lieutenant Leehan died of injuries sustained when the vehicle in \nwhich he was riding was attacked with an improvised explosive device in \nthe Alingar District while conducting combat operations. He was 30 \nyears old.\n  Damon graduated from Edmond High School and enlisted in the Oklahoma \nNational Guard in 1998 at the age of 17. He had previously deployed to \nAfghanistan in 2003 as a combat medic. In 2008, he successfully \ncompleted Officer Candidate School and was commissioned as a second \nlieutenant.\n  In his civilian role, Damon served his community as an Xray \ntechnician since 2001 at the Integris Southwest Medical Center in \nOklahoma City.\n  Damon consistently impressed and touched the lives of those around \nhim. This is evident by reading through some quotes.\n  Ashely Hale, his supervisor at the hospital said, ``He was a hard-\nworking, outgoing, well-known, well-liked co-worker . . . he had many \nfriends here.''\n  Major General Myles Deering, the Adjutant General of Oklahoma said, \n``LT Leehan served his nation and our state with great honor and \ndistinction for more than a decade. His sacrifice will never be \nforgotten.''\n  Wendy Deatsch, of Edmond said, ``I was one of his high school \nteachers. He was one of my very favorite students. He always had a \nsmile on his face and had a saying that always put one on mine. He \nwould say, `Miss Wilks, turn that frown upside down!' It always \nworked!''\n  Curtis Meloy, of Cushing said, ``Damon was a great soldier, and a \nbetter man. I am truly better for having known him.''\n  Members of Damon's platoon posted, ``LT, we miss you and you were a \ntrue friend and leader. Our platoon will never be the same without you! \nYour leadership will be missed.''\n  I extend our deepest gratitude and condolences to Damon's family and \nfriends. Our thoughts and prayers go out to those in his family he left \nbehind: his wife Audrey, children, Emma and Ethan, father Dennis, and \nmother Marina Blevins.\n  Damon lived a life of love for his wife and two children, family, \nfriends, and country.

I am honored to pay tribute to \nthis true American hero who volunteered to go into the fight and made \nthe ultimate sacrifice for our protection and freedom.\n\n\n                 Private First Class Tony J. Potter Jr.\n\n  Mr. President, I pay tribute to a true American hero, Army PFC Tony \nJ. ``TJ'' Potter Jr. of Okmulgee, OK, who died on September 9, 2011, \nserving our Nation in Paktya Province, Afghanistan. Private First Class \nPotter was assigned to 1st Battalion, 279th Infantry Battalion, 45th \nInfantry Brigade Combat Team, Oklahoma Army National Guard.\n  TJ was killed by enemy small arms fire when his team was attacked \nwhile conducting combat operations in Zurmat District. He was 20 years \nold.\n  Born 3 months early, TJ wasn't the biggest kid growing up, but he \nmore than compensated for it in drive and enthusiasm. TJ graduated from\n\n[[Page S3999]]\n\nOkmulgee High School in 2010 after leading his football team to a state \nchampionship. Determined to be a soldier and join the Oklahoma National \nGuard, even over his parents' reservations, TJ enlisted as an \ninfantryman prior to graduation in April 2010.\n  In such a short time on this earth, TJ had an incredible impact on \nhis family, his community and his brothers in arms.\n  TJ's friend Samuel Trout said, ``Everybody knew him, everybody got \nalong with him, you could talk to him.''\n  Fellow co-worker Jon Skinner said, ``He was always a great guy, he \nwas always a hard worker, down to earth, great guy to kick it with.''\n  Fellow high school student Earnest Woodruff said, ``He tried to help \neverybody at practice. He always wanted us to run harder so we would do \nbetter when we went out to the games. He was always going 100 percent. \nI just know that he's going to be in a better place.''\n  Football coach Shane Page said TJ could do anything that he put his \nmind to and ``Just every day we have to be thankful for the fact that \nwe do have the soldiers out there fighting to protect us and \neverything. I mean it's an honor to know that he was a part of that but \nit's a very, very sad day.''\n  His mother, Yvonne said, ``He was the rock of our family. He held \neverything together.'' His father, Tony Sr. added, ``If he felt we were \ndrifting apart, he would bring us back together. He was our glue. You \ncould always count on him for everything.''\n  TJ lived a life of love for his family, friends, and our country. I \nextend our deepest gratitude and condolences to TJ's family, his wife \nand high school sweetheart Emily, his son Tony James `TJ' Potter who \nwas born after his death, and parents Tony and Yvonne Potter. He will \nbe remembered for his commitment to and belief in the greatness of our \nNation. I am honored to pay tribute to this true American hero who \nvolunteered to go into the fight and made the ultimate sacrifice of his \nlife for our freedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/25/senate-section/article/S3999-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3999-S4000]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           HENRY COUNTY, IOWA\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the strength of my State of Iowa \nlies in its vibrant local communities, where citizens come together to \nfoster economic development, make smart investments to expand \nopportunity, and take the initiative to improve the health and well-\nbeing of residents. Over the decades, I have witnessed the growth and \nrevitalization of so many communities across my State. And it has been \ndeeply gratifying to see how my work in Congress has supported these \nlocal efforts.\n  I have always believed in accountability for public officials, and \nthis, my final year in the Senate, is an appropriate time to give an \naccounting of my work across four decades representing Iowa in \nCongress. I take pride in accomplishments that have been national in \nscope--for instance, passing the Americans with Disabilities Act and \nspearheading successful farm bills. But I take a very special pride in \nprojects that have made a big difference in local communities across my \nState.\n  Today, I would like to give an accounting of my work with leaders and \nresidents of Henry County to build a legacy of a stronger local \neconomy, better schools and educational opportunities, and a healthier, \nsafer community.\n  Between 2001 and 2013, the creative leadership in your community has \nworked with me to secure funding in Henry County worth over $2 million \nand successfully acquired financial assistance from programs I have \nfought hard to support, which have provided more than $8 million to the \nlocal economy.\n  Of course, one of my favorite memories of working together is our \nshared commitment to community wellness and their work to obtain \nwellness grants to promote physical exercise, nutrition, and healthy \nlifestyles. I am also pleased with the community's success in obtaining \nfunds through Main Street Iowa for the redevelopment of the historic \nUnion Block building and other major renovations in downtown Mt. \nPleasant.\n  Among the highlights:\n  Investing in Iowa's economic development through targeted community \nprojects: In Southeast Iowa, we have worked together to grow the \neconomy by making targeted investments in important economic \ndevelopment projects including improved roads and bridges, modernized \nsewer and water systems, and better housing options for residents of \nHenry County. In many cases, I have secured Federal funding that has \nleveraged local investments and served as a catalyst for a whole ripple \neffect of positive, creative changes. For example, working with mayors, \ncity council members, and local economic development officials in Henry \nCounty, I have fought for more than $3 million for National Guard \nfacilities, helping to create jobs and expand economic opportunities.\n  Main Street Iowa: One of the greatest challenges we face--in Iowa and \nall across America--is preserving the character and vitality of our \nsmall towns and rural communities. This isn't just about economics; it \nis also about maintaining our identity as Iowans. Main Street Iowa \nhelps preserve Iowa's heart and soul by providing funds to revitalize \ndowntown business districts. This program has allowed towns like Mount \nPleasant to use that money to leverage other investments to jump-start \nchange and renewal. I am so pleased that Henry County has earned \n$110,000 through this program. These grants build much more than \nbuildings. They build up the spirit and morale of people in our small \ntowns and local communities.\n  School grants: Every child in Iowa deserves to be educated in a \nclassroom that is safe, accessible, and modern. That is why, for the \npast decade and a half, I have secured funding for the innovative Iowa \nDemonstration Construction Grant Program--better known among educators \nin Iowa as Harkin grants for public schools construction and \nrenovation. Across 15 years, Harkin grants worth more than $132 million \nhave helped school districts to fund a range of renovation and repair \nefforts--everything from updating fire safety systems to building new \nschools. In many cases, these Federal dollars have served as the needed \nincentive to leverage local public and private dollars, so it often has \na tremendous multiplier effect within a school district. Over the \nyears, Henry County has received $756,173 in Harkin grants. Similarly, \nschools in Henry County have received funds that I designated for Iowa \nStar Schools for technology totaling $74,980.\n  Agricultural and rural development: Because I grew up in a small town \nin rural Iowa, I have always been a loyal friend and fierce advocate \nfor family farmers and rural communities. I have been a member of the \nHouse or Senate Agriculture Committee for 40 years--including more than \n10 years as chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. Across the \ndecades, I have championed farm policies for Iowans that include \neffective farm income protection and commodity programs; strong, \nprogressive conservation assistance for agricultural producers; \nrenewable energy opportunities; and robust economic development in our \nrural communities. Since 1991, through various programs authorized \nthrough the farm bill, Henry County has received more than $3.7 million \nfrom a variety of farm bill programs.\n  Keeping Iowa communities safe: I also firmly believe that our first \nresponders need to be appropriately trained and equipped, able to \nrespond to both local emergencies and to statewide challenges such as, \nfor instance, the methamphetamine epidemic. Since 2001, Henry County's \nfire departments have received over $1.2 million for firefighter safety \nand operations equipment.\n  Wellness and health care: Improving the health and wellness of all \nAmericans has been something I have been passionate about for decades. \nThat is why I fought to dramatically increase funding for disease \nprevention, innovative medical research, and a whole range of \ninitiatives to improve the health of individuals and families not only \nat the doctor's office but also in our communities, schools, and \nworkplaces. I am so proud that Americans have better access to clinical \npreventive services, nutritious food, smoke-free environments, safe \nplaces to engage in physical activity, and information to make healthy \ndecisions for\n\n[[Page S4000]]\n\nthemselves and their families. These efforts not only save lives, they \nwill also save money for generations to come thanks to the prevention \nof costly chronic diseases, which account for a whopping 75 percent of \nannual health care costs. I am pleased that Henry County has recognized \nthis important issue by securing more than $423,000 for community \nwellness activities.\n  Disability rights: Growing up, I loved and admired my brother Frank, \nwho was deaf. But I was deeply disturbed by the discrimination and \nobstacles he faced every day. That is why I have always been a \npassionate advocate for full equality for people with disabilities. As \nthe primary author of the Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA, and the \nADA Amendments Act, I have had four guiding goals for our fellow \ncitizens with disabilities: equal opportunity, full participation, \nindependent living, and economic self-sufficiency. Nearly a quarter \ncentury since passage of the ADA, I see remarkable changes in \ncommunities everywhere I go in Iowa--not just in curb cuts or closed \ncaptioned television, but in the full participation of people with \ndisabilities in our society and economy, folks who at long last have \nthe opportunity to contribute their talents and to be fully included. \nThese changes have increased economic opportunities for all citizens of \nHenry County, both those with and without disabilities. And they make \nus proud to be a part of a community and country that respects the \nworth and civil rights of all of our citizens.\n  This is at least a partial accounting of my work on behalf of Iowa, \nand specifically Henry County, during my time in Congress. In every \ncase, this work has been about partnerships, cooperation, and \nempowering folks at the State and local level, including in Henry \nCounty, to fulfill their own dreams and initiatives. And, of course, \nthis work is never complete. Even after I retire from the Senate, I \nhave no intention of retiring from the fight for a better, fairer, \nricher Iowa. I will always be profoundly grateful for the opportunity \nto serve the people of Iowa as their Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/25/senate-section/article/S4000-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4000-S4001]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           IOWA COUNTY, IOWA\n\n Mr. HARKIN.

Over the \nyears, Iowa County has received $122,934 in Harkin grants.\n  Disaster mitigation and prevention: In 1993, when historic floods \nripped through Iowa, it became clear to me that the national emergency-\nresponse infrastructure was woefully inadequate to meet the needs of \nIowans in flood-ravaged communities. I went to work dramatically \nexpanding the Federal Emergency Management Agency's hazard mitigation \nprogram, which helps communities reduce the loss of life and property \ndue to natural disasters and enables mitigation measures to be \nimplemented during the immediate recovery period. Disaster relief means \nmore than helping people and businesses get back on their feet after a \ndisaster, it means doing our best to prevent the same predictable flood \nor other catastrophe from recurring in the future. The hazard \nmitigation program that I helped create in 1993 has provided critical \nsupport to Iowa communities impacted by the devastating floods of 2008. \nIowa County has received over $1.6 million to remediate and prevent \nwidespread destruction from natural disasters.\n  Agricultural and rural development: Because I grew up in a small town \nin rural Iowa, I have always been a loyal friend and fierce advocate \nfor family farmers and rural communities.

During the mid-to-late \n1990s, cities in Iowa County received $199,635 in Community Oriented \nPolicing Services grants. Also, since 2001, Iowa County's fire \ndepartments have received over $708,000 for firefighter safety and \noperations equipment.\n  Disability rights: Growing up, I loved and admired my brother Frank, \nwho was deaf.

Mr. President, I wish to \nrecognize the successful efforts made over the past 25 years to improve \nthe health of children across the globe. Through a strong, bipartisan \ncommitment to foreign assistance, the United States, in partnership \nwith other world leaders, multinational organizations, and local \nstakeholders, has played a critical role in reducing the number of \nchild deaths before the age of 5.\n  Compared to 25 years ago, 6 million fewer children will die this year \nbefore their fifth birthday. This achievement could not have been \npossible without the dedication to service and drive to help others \nthat is characteristic of the American spirit. As a member of the \nSenate Appropriations Committee, I have long supported programs such as \nPEPFAR, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, and other efforts to address \nchild and maternal health. Over the years, I have worked with \nRepublican and Democratic administrations on these initiatives and am \nproud of the bipartisan support they have received.\n  Today, thanks to significant investments made by the United States \nalong with faith-based, philanthropic, nongovernmental organizations, \nand support from other countries, fewer children are dying from \npreventable diseases and conditions such as pneumonia, diarrhea, \nmeasles, malaria, and AIDS. We have succeeded in cutting in half the \nnumber of deaths among children under 5 and reduced the incidence of \npreventable illness.\n  As we celebrate the progress that has been made, we also look ahead \nto the work that remains. Millions of children still live with the \nreality that they may not reach their fifth birthday. As we continue to \nface tight fiscal environments, we must be careful not to try to \nbalance the budget on the back of the world's poor and hungry. After \nall, total U.S. foreign aid to all countries constitutes only 1% of the \nU.S. Federal budget. As a leader in our global community, we must find \nways to maintain our commitment to global health programs and continue \nefforts to improve child mortality rates.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/25/senate-section/article/S4001-2", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4001]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NATIONAL ROOFING WEEK\n\n Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the National \nRoofing Contractors Association, NRCA, headquartered in Rosemont, IL, \nand its efforts to designate the week of July 6-12, 2014 as National \nRoofing Week.\n  The roof is one of the most important components of any home or \nbusiness. It is the first line of defense against natural elements, \nsuch as rain, snow or wind, and yet it is often taken for granted until \nit falls into disrepair. National Roofing Week recognizes the thousands \nof roofing contractors and roofing-related businesses across the \ncountry, the industry's commitment to public service and is a valuable \nreminder of the significance quality roofing has on every home and \nbusiness in the United States.\n  Established in 1886, NRCA is one of the Nation's oldest trade \nassociations and the voice of professional roofing contractors \nworldwide. Today, the NRCA has more than 3,800 members located across \nall 50 States and represents a variety of industry stakeholders, \nincluding roofing, roof deck, and water proofing contractors. Utilizing \nits vast network of roofing contractors and industry-related members, \nNRCA is responsible for the installation of the majority of new \nconstruction and replacement roof systems on commercial and residential \nstructures in America. With most of its members employed by small, \nprivately held businesses, the NRCA represents thousands of hard-\nworking families and individuals that are the backbone of our economy.\n  Professional roofing contractors provide vital services to their \ncommunities, both on and off the clock. This year NRCA members will \ngather in Chicago, IL throughout the week of July 6-12 and donate their \ntime and materials to charitable community service roofing projects \nthroughout the Chicago area.

HEYMAN\n\n Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I wish to offer my congratulations \nand thanks to David F. Heyman as he steps down as the Department of \nHomeland Security's, DHS Assistant Secretary for Policy. Mr. Heyman is \nnot only a capable and strong leader but a key partner who has worked \nwith Congress as we aim to tackle some of our Nation's most complex \nhomeland security challenges, such as global supply chain security, \nadvance screening to protect our citizens from threats abroad, and \ninstituting systems that help us better identify who enters and leaves \nthe United States.\n  Mr. Heyman was confirmed by the Senate in June 2009 as the second \nAssistant Secretary for Policy in the history of the Department. As \nhead of the Office of Policy, he was charged with leading a team of \nexperts to provide thought leadership, policy development, and decision \nanalysis for the Department's senior leadership.\n  Mr. Heyman has worked tirelessly over the past 5 years for the \nDepartment and the U.S. government. He led a capable and diverse team \nthat handled a variety of important and challenging issues. Through his \nwork across the Department, within the agency, and with many of our \npartners around the globe, Mr. Heyman brought a cross-cutting view of \nDHS to the Office of Policy. He has worked steadfastly with Congress \nand other stakeholders to ensure those outside the Department have a \ngreater appreciation for the breadth and depth of homeland security, \nencouraging us all to understand the responsibilities we share to \nprotect our nation.\n  During his tenure, the first and second Quadrennial Homeland Security \nReviews were created, both of which outline the Department's mission \nand roles as well as establish DHS's direction for the next 4 years. \nMr. Heyman played key roles in a variety of efforts including: raising \nglobal standards for aviation and cargo security, contributing to \nstrategies on countering violent extremism, and strengthening global \nsupply chain security. He has shepherded efforts to transform and build \nupon our international partnerships with Canada, Mexico, India, China, \nGermany, and the United Kingdom as well as with many global \norganizations such as the World Customs Organization, the International \nCivil Aviation Organization, the International Maritime Organization, \nand others. Under Mr. Heyman's charge, the Office of Policy has also \nhelped to foster a culture of leadership and innovation through the \ncreation of the Rick Rescorla National Award for Resilience and by \ninitiating efforts to encourage stronger home building standards to \nsafeguard lives and communities.\n  During the time of his appointment Mr. Heyman's two sons were born. \nWe not only owe Mr. Heyman our deepest gratitude but also a special \nthanks to his wife and children for their sacrifice of their precious \nfamily time--all for the betterment and protection of our Nation.\n  Mr. David Heyman has served this Nation well, and I urge my \ncolleagues to recognize his great contributions to the security, \nsafety, and resilience of this country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/25/senate-section/article/S4001-4", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4001-S4002]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                EIGHTH STREET MISSIONARY BAPTIST CHURCH\n\n Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I \nhonor the Eighth Street Missionary Baptist Church in North Little Rock, \nAR. In December of 2014, Eighth Street Missionary Baptist Church will \ncelebrate the 100th anniversary of its founding.\n  In 1914, several members and deacons from an existing congregation \nset forward to plant a new church in North Little Rock. The new \ncongregation secured a building and immediately the doors of the Eighth \nStreet Missionary Baptist Church were open and they began to receive \nmembers.\n  In 1954, under the leadership of Rev. S.J. Moss, Eighth Street \nMissionary Baptist Church began construction on\n\n[[Page S4002]]\n\na new building at 800 Hazel Street in North Little Rock, only to lose \nthis structure to a devastating fire in 1958. The church met at a local \nschool until their church could be rebuilt.\n  In 1969, the church was forced to make a difficult decision about \ntheir facility--make extensive repairs or change locations due to \nrequirements of a community development project. Church leadership \ndecided to sell the property and Rev. R.T. Sawyer authorized the \npurchase of a new lot on 9th and Hickory Streets. Less than a year \nlater, the church held their groundbreaking ceremony for yet another \nbuilding where they worshipped until 2014.\n  It brings me great pleasure to announce that just recently, the \nchurch held the dedication ceremony for their newly constructed worship \ncenter. The Eighth Street Missionary Baptist Church has a rich history \nof land ownership, leadership, and overcoming tremendous obstacles. \nStanding as a fixture in the North Little Rock community, the \ncongregation of Eighth Street Missionary Baptist Church will continue \nto demonstrate both their strong faith and devotion to their \nparishioners and the community.\n  I have great pride in the Eighth Street Missionary Baptist Church's \ncontinued growth and the vibrancy of their congregation. I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in congratulating the Eighth Street Missionary \nBaptist Church on its centennial anniversary, with many successful \nyears to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/25/senate-section/article/S4002-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4002]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO STEVEN SAVAGE\n\n Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I wish to recognize Plaistow \nChief of Police Steven Savage for his extraordinary leadership and \nservice to New Hampshire and to our Nation. The Plaistow Police \nDepartment will soon dedicate the town's tactical training center in \nhis honor.\n  As a young man, Chief Savage enlisted in the U.S. Air Force and \nanswered the call to service during the Vietnam war. He was honored \nwith numerous service ribbons including the Air Force Presidential Unit \nCitation, the Air Force Good Conduct Medal, the National Defense \nService Medal, the Vietnam Service Medal, and the Republic of Vietnam \nGallantry Cross Unit Citation.\n  After an honorable discharge from the Air Force, Chief Savage went on \nto earn a B.S. with honors in criminal justice from Northeastern \nUniversity. He first worked as a police officer in Baltimore, MD, where \nhe earned a Bronze Star and four Ribbons of Commendation from the \ncity's Meritorious Conduct Board.\n  He returned to his native New Hampshire in 1977, when he was selected \nas police chief of Haverhill.

These combined 38 years \nhave distinguished Chief Savage as the second longest serving police \nchief in the state of New Hampshire.\n  Chief Savage has held leadership positions in local, regional and \nnational law enforcement organizations, from chairman of Plaistow's \nHighway Safety Committee to president of the New Hampshire Chiefs of \nPolice Association. He has been active in his community as well, \nvolunteering on social service boards, committees, and supporting local \nyouth sports.\n  For more than 25 years, Plaistow's police department has been working \nto upgrade its firing range and tactical training facilities, which are \nused by police from Danville, Hampstead and Haverhill for their annual \nre-qualification as well as by U.S. postal inspectors from across New \nEngland and upstate New York. Finally, under Steven's leadership, a \nsite plan was approved for the project earlier this year. Previously \nmaintained unofficially by its many stakeholders, it will now be more \npermanently improved and supported.\n  Chief Savage has worked tirelessly his entire career to keep others \nsafe, and the tactical training center, to be dedicated on June 26th, \nwill stand as a lasting symbol of his commitment. I ask my colleagues \nand all Americans to join me in congratulating Chief Savage on his \ndistinguished career in service to New Hampshire and to our \ncountry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/25/senate-section/article/S4002-2", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4002]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:32 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 4631.

Res. 484\n\n       Whereas Yosemite National Park is internationally renowned \n     as one of the most extraordinary examples of natural beauty, \n     splendor, and majesty, and is a showcase of spectacular \n     waterfalls, fantastic geologic history, and abundant wildlife \n     that has provided sanctuary, comfort, and inspiration to \n     humans for thousands of years;\n       Whereas, on June 30, 1864, President Abraham Lincoln signed \n     the Act entitled ``An Act authorizing a Grant to the State of \n     California of the `Yo-Semite Valley' and of the Land \n     embracing the `Mariposa Big Tree Grove' '', approved June 30, \n     1864 (commonly known as the Yosemite Grant) which--\n       (1) for one of the first times in United States history set \n     aside land for enjoyment and protection for future \n     generations; and\n       (2) demonstrated--during some of the bloodiest days of the \n     Civil War--the unique vision of the United States to protect \n     what would become one of the most cherished and iconic \n     national parks;\n       Whereas with President Lincoln's action, this vision was \n     codified and marked Yosemite Valley and Mariposa Grove as the \n     seed of the conservation movement in what is now known as \n     ``America's Best Idea'';\n       Whereas June 30, 1864, marks the birth of the national park \n     idea, the concept that has inspired over 400 National Park \n     units in the United States and hundreds of national parks \n     worldwide;\n       Whereas the land surrounding Yosemite Valley and Mariposa \n     Grove was designated the 3rd national park on October 1, \n     1890, and Yosemite Valley and Mariposa Grove were added to \n     Yosemite National Park in 1906;\n       Whereas the land preserved within Yosemite National Park is \n     part of the ancestral homeland of several American Indian \n     tribes and groups;\n       Whereas Yosemite National Park was dedicated a World \n     Heritage Site in 1984 and has fostered sister park \n     relationships with national parks in foreign countries \n     including--\n       (1) Huangshan National Park and Jiuzhaigou National Park in \n     China; and\n       (2) Torres del Paine National Park in Chile;\n       Whereas Yosemite National Park, a leader within the \n     National Park Service, is--\n       (1) the first national park to open a museum;\n       (2) the first national park to hire a female law \n     enforcement ranger;\n       (3) the birthplace of rustic style architecture and of big \n     wall rock climbing;\n       (4) the first national park to formally implement park \n     education and interpretation programs; and\n       (5) the first national park to partner with a nonprofit \n     stewardship organization;\n       Whereas Yosemite National Park receives over 4,000,000 \n     visitors each year from around the world;\n       Whereas Yosemite National Park is home to a variety of \n     natural resource features, containing--\n       (1) wilderness areas encompassing 94 percent of the park's \n     acreage;\n       (2) more than 800 miles of trails including the renowned \n     Pacific Crest Trail and John Muir Trail;\n       (3) 2 federally designated wild and scenic rivers, the \n     Tuolumne River and the Merced River;\n       (4) the largest intact subalpine meadow complex in the \n     Sierra Nevada; and\n       (5) 30 properties and districts listed on the National \n     Register of Historic Places and 5 National Historic \n     Landmarks;\n       Whereas Yosemite National Park continues to embody amazing \n     opportunities for recreation and public enjoyment in one of \n     the most amazing natural physical landscapes in the world; \n     and\n       Whereas the preservation of Yosemite National Park is a \n     testament to the commitment and determination of many \n     dedicated people and institutions over the past 150 years: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n\n[[Page S4005]]\n\n       (1) recognizes and honors the 150th anniversary of the \n     establishment of the Act entitled ``An Act authorizing a \n     Grant to the State of California of the `Yo-Semite Valley' \n     and of the Land embracing the `Mariposa Big Tree Grove' '', \n     approved June 30, 1864 (commonly known as the Yosemite Grant) \n     (referred to in this resolving clause as the ``Yosemite Grant \n     Act'') on June 30, 2014;
