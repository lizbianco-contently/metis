Mr. President, last night the Senate took the first steps \nin supporting the people of Ukraine, sending a clear message to Russia. \nI am pleased the Senate voted overwhelmingly in a bipartisan fashion to \nconsider this bipartisan bill that was reported to the Senate floor. \nThe measure includes a number of provisions: a loan guarantee, \nsanctions, and security assistance. This certainly is a step in the \nright direction. It is not everything, but I certainly applaud the \nefforts of the Members from both sides of the aisle who have labored \ndiligently to get us this far.\n  I hope the bipartisan support will continue so we can finish the bill \nthis week and provide the people of Ukraine with the critical support \nthey need while imposing strong sanctions against those in Russia and \nUkraine who created this crisis. There is no reason why we can't pass \nthe bill today.\n  According to all reports, the situation regarding Ukraine is getting \nworse, not better. Russian troops are seizing facilities in the Crimea. \nAll they have to do is make a phone call. They didn't need to have all \nthe brute force, knocking down doors and injuring people in the \nprocess. They have\n\n[[Page S1698]]\n\ndone this throughout Crimea. The Government of Russia looks foolish. \nThe world community understands that. They are levying foolish \nretaliatory sanctions, mocking the efforts of the international \ncommunity to bring about a peaceful and fair resolution to the illegal \ninvasion and the annexation of Crimea.\n  Yesterday President Obama and other European leaders meeting in The \nHague formed a strong, united front in denouncing Russia's unlawful \nactions against the people of Ukraine. Under President Obama's \nleadership, the United States, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, Germany, \nand the United Kingdom took further action by suspending Russia from \nthe G8--as of today it is the G7--and canceling the planned summit in \nSochi this summer.\n  I mentioned those seven countries, but over in Europe yesterday, the \nPresident was there with some 42 other nations, all of them looking \nwith an eye toward what Russia had done that was totally contrary to \ninternational law. By excluding Russia from the G8, President Obama and \nour allies have sent the message loudly and clearly that bullying \nbehavior and rhetoric will not go unchallenged. I applaud the efforts \nof our allies to take a stand against Russia's aggression and welcome \ntheir further commitment to hold accountable President Putin and his \ncronies--and they really are his cronies. If there were ever a \nthugocracy, this is it. This is a government that is corrupt, and they \nneed to be held accountable for violating international law. This \ncannot go unnoticed and unretaliated against.\n  As for action here in the Senate, I look forward to stabilizing \nUkraine and imposing new sanctions against Russia by passing the bill \nthat is before us. We should do that today. One way or the other, we \nneed to get it done as quickly as possible.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I wish to start with a few words about \nthe legislation the Senate is considering this week on Ukraine. It \ntouches on the jurisdiction of many committees and is of high interest \nto Senators on both sides of the aisle. How the United States meets the \nRussian invasion of Crimea matters. It is related to the future \nvitality of NATO, the negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program, \nand our own energy policy regarding the export of natural gas.\n  We have Members on both sides of the aisle working closely, and there \nis a decent amount of common ground here, which is good. Nearly \neveryone agrees the Ukrainian people deserve our support. Most of us \nalso agree we should back up that support with meaningful legislation, \nnot just to show our support for an independent, democratic, and free \nUkraine but also to show President Putin there will be costs for his \nactions.\n  So one would think it wouldn't be that difficult to get a solution \nhere, but roadblocks keep popping up. First, there was a House-passed \nbill prior to the recess that would have provided loan guarantees to \nUkraine. It was blocked by the majority leader. We should have passed \nthat and sent it to the President. Now the majority leader seems \ndetermined to blow up the process too. Yesterday he actually came to \nthe floor to effectively blame the Republicans--believe it or not--for \nthe invasion of Crimea. I mean, who writes this stuff? It is not just \ncompletely unhelpful, it also injects hyperpartisanship into the \nprocess at a time when we should all actually be working together. At \nthis point it is not at all certain the majority leader might not even \nmake things worse by shutting down the amendment process. I hope that \nis not where we end up. This issue is way too important for that.\n  Look, this bill in the Senate cannot pass the House or become law in \nits current form. It has to be amended. Not only have many Members not \nyet had a chance to offer amendments in committee, but so many \ndevelopments have unfolded in this crisis in the weeks since the bill \nwas drafted, the legislation has to be at the least modified to take \nthose realities into account. In order for this bill to become law, the \ncontroversial IMF provision must be removed.\n  This simply cannot be a ``take it or leave it'' situation. That is \njust nonsensical. The people who sent us here to represent them deserve \nbetter. We should give them that. That means allowing a sensible \namendment process, and it means dropping the kinds of wild partisan \naccusations we have seen--attacks that will only make it that much \nharder to get an effective bipartisan solution.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/25/senate-section/article/S1698-3", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I listened carefully to the comments of \nthe minority leader, Senator McConnell, and he is asking for \nbipartisanship and quick action on the Ukrainian matter before the \nSenate today. I agree with him completely.\n  In fact, it was about 10 days ago when Senator John McCain, on the \nother side of the aisle, joined with me and six of our colleagues, and \nwe took a late-night flight on a Thursday evening, flew all night long \nto go to Kiev, Ukraine. We spent the whole day on Friday meeting with \ngovernment leaders. We had one night in a hotel room and then the next \nday, Saturday, a whole day of meeting with their leaders as well. Late \nthat night we caught a plane back to Washington, arriving at 5 in the \nmorning.\n  It was a whirlwind trip but an important one because it came just \nhours before the Russians staged this phony referendum in Crimea--a \nreferendum that had been condemned by the United Nations Security \nCouncil, with the exception of Russia's vote. They voted against the \ncondemnation, which was to be expected. China abstained.\n  So the question before us is, What can and should the Senate do, and \nwhen should it do it? Well, we have a measure before us that passed out \nof the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. I believe the vote was 14 to \n3. I may be mistaken by a vote or two there, but it was a strong \nbipartisan majority. Senator Menendez then brought it to the floor.\n  When it came to the floor before our trip to Ukraine, Senator Reid \noffered to bring it to the floor and pass it and do this on a \nbipartisan basis quickly--just what the Senate minority leader is now \nasking for--but there was an objection. The objection came from the \nSenate minority leader's side of the aisle. A Republican Senator \nobjected to moving this bipartisan measure forward quickly. So Senator \nReid set up the vote that happened yesterday when 78 Members voted in \nthe affirmative to move to this measure. That is a good thing. I hope \nwe can bring it up this week, and if the other side or any Senator has \na proposal for an amendment, I hope they won't keep it to themselves \nand conceal it but bring it forward. Let's talk about it and see if we \ncan amend this measure, change this measure in a constructive fashion, \nwithout introducing a lot of amendments which might bog us down in \nlong-term debate.\n  The Ukrainians are waiting to hear from the United States. What they\n\n[[Page S1699]]\n\nwant to hear from us is very simple. Are we on their side? Will we \nstand with them as they resist Russian aggression and the possibility \nof Russia moving from Crimea into Ukraine proper. This is a legitimate \nconcern in Ukraine.\n  We met with the governor of Donetsk in the eastern reaches of \nUkraine, where there are more Russian-speaking people and perhaps more \nRussian loyalty than perhaps in other parts of the country, and he is \nconcerned about provocateurs coming in from Russia stirring up the \nlocal people in demonstrations. Several people have been killed in the \nprocess. They want to see things stabilized and quieted. In order to do \nthat, I think the United States and freedom-loving nations around the \nworld need to stand with Ukraine. This is the purpose of our \nresolution: to sanction Russia for its aggression in Crimea, to warn \nthem off from any further aggression into Eastern and Southern Ukraine, \nto provide some basic assistance to Ukraine, and to set up a process \nwhere this new government in Ukraine can borrow--underline ``borrow''--\nmoney under conditions from the International Monetary Fund to rebuild \ntheir economy. It is an economy on the ropes.\n  The previous leader Yanukovych was loyal to Moscow. People came to \nthe streets and said they felt the government was insensitive to their \nown feeling that there also should be an attachment to the West and \nthat Ukraine could in fact at least look to the West in terms of its \neconomic future. Yanukovych resisted--demonstrations on the street, \nhundreds of thousands of people in the Maidan and Kiev, Ukraine, and \n103 of those demonstrators gunned down, shot and killed in the streets, \nby snipers firing from government buildings.\n  There is a high state of emotion in the Ukraine today, as Yanukovych \nfled the country and the parliament took control. The new prime \nminister is a man who, at the age of 39, has an awesome responsibility. \nHe carries the burden of his nation on his shoulders. He came to the \nUnited States asking for our help. President Obama met with him. He met \nwith Members of the Senate, and I thought that conversation was \npositive--moving us forward. Now it is up to the Senate this week to \nmove on this measure. Let's not bog down in partisan debates. Let's not \nget off on tangents.\n  One of the issues I think will be brought up in the course of this \nweek is the question of energy, and it is an important question because \nPutin has to be viewed for what he is today. He is the leader of \nRussia, and he is trying to save and sustain a failing Soviet \nfranchise. He said: The most disappointing event of the 20th century \nwas the elimination of the Soviet Union. Those were Putin's words. He \nhas this dream of restoring an empire, reaching out to countries which \nused to be republics of the Soviet Union and members of the Warsaw Pact \nnations, and trying to bring them back into the Russian fold. We saw it \n8 years ago when he invaded Georgia and took territory there.\n  I have been there. I have seen it. Behind the barbed wire in South \nOssetia we see the Russian troops. They are garrisoned trying to \nprotect that region of Georgia which they seized 8 years ago. The same \nthing is true now in Crimea. This is Putin's idea. If he can't win the \nhearts and minds of neighboring nations, he will take them over with \nmasked gunmen, Russian soldiers, and energy extortion.\n  There was a debate in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee about \nwhether or not we can come to the assistance of those surrounding \nnations being preyed upon by the Russians and Putin--and to do it with \nassistance through energy. In the last several years we have found an \nabundance of natural gas in the United States. Somewhat surprisingly, \nour country, 5 years ago dependent on foreign energy sources, now has a \nsurplus of natural gas.\n  So the question was raised: Can we transport this gas to these \ncountries, liberating them from dependence on Russia for energy \nsources? It is a very important question. It is a timely question. But \nit is one we should view in the context of where we are today.\n  The good news is companies are moving back to the United States to \nreestablish manufacturing in our country--good-paying jobs. Why? We \nhave skilled workers, some of the most productive in the world. \nSecondly, we now have this surplus of natural gas--an important \nfeedstock for manufacturing jobs. With those two elements and \ntransportation costs, we find more companies coming back to the United \nStates, and we need them--in Illinois, in New Jersey, and desperately \naround the United States.\n  So the question then is raised--an important question: Would we \njeopardize our economic growth, our creation of manufacturing jobs, if \nwe started exporting the natural gas which we have discovered? It is a \nworthy debate, an important debate. It is one that is really important \nwhen we consider the future of building manufacturing jobs in America.\n  Secondly, we take a look at this natural gas debate, and we have to \nput it in historic context. Those who say to export, just to sell it, \nand that it is another commodity, need to put this in historical \ncontext. If 5 years ago the United States had gone through a famine, \nwould we be exporting agricultural goods today without concern? I don't \nthink so. We would think twice about it because we can remember that \nnot that long ago we were vulnerable. Thank goodness we weren't and \nhaven't been. But think about the energy famine we suffered some 5 \nyears ago. We were dependent on OPEC. We were dependent on foreign \nsuppliers. We were worried about where our Nation was going from an \nenergy perspective.\n  The discovery of new sources of natural gas, new methods of \nextraction and new sources of oil, for example, have given us hope that \nwe are going to be an energy surplus Nation. But it is a newfound \ntreasure, and it is one about which we ought to be careful and measure \ncarefully.\n  Some say we have plenty, more than we can use, and it should be an \ninternational commodity. Others say take care and make certain we make \nthe decisions best for America, number one.\n  Should we debate that and decide that in a matter of minutes or hours \non the floor of the Senate this week or take the time to look at it \ncarefully? I think the latter.\n  When I went and spoke with the new Prime Minister of Ukraine, \nYatsenyuk, I mentioned this possibility: What if we exported liquefied \nnatural gas to Ukraine? He said: We don't have a place to receive it \ntoday. It is a pretty substantial investment of infrastructure to \nreceive LNG into our country and to use it effectively. We are not in \nthe position with our economy to make that investment today. We are \ngoing to look to other energy sources in the near term.\n  So the notion that natural gas exports will have benefit for Ukraine \nor any nation in the near term may be wishful thinking. Shouldn't we \nlook at that part of the equation honestly about what they can absorb, \nwhen they can absorb it, and whether they want it? I think these are \nall legitimate and critically important energy policy debates in which \nwe should engage.\n  But let's not make any mistake about it. We need to pass a resolution \ncondemning what Russia has done in Crimea and threatens to do in \nUkraine. They have gathered at the borders of Belarus and in Russia, on \nthe eastern reaches of Ukraine--military forces far beyond what was \nnecessary to guarantee an orderly referendum in Crimea a little over 9 \ndays ago. They are poised to move forward. I pray that they won't.\n\n  We have to make it clear in the West--whether it is President Obama's \nvisit with the G-7 nations, whether it is the European Union in \nresolution or even our Senate and House--that we stand with Ukraine. We \nwant to stand by their sovereign and territorial integrity.\n  Many people didn't notice--they should have--but in 1994, Ukraine was \nthe third strongest nuclear power in the world. After the breakup of \nthe Soviet Union, Ukraine had more nuclear weapons than any country on \nearth, save the United States and Russia.\n  In 1994, they came forward and said: We are prepared to eliminate and \ndestroy our nuclear arsenal if we have the assurance of major nations \nthis won't jeopardize our future and it won't jeopardize our \nterritorial integrity. They produced what was known as the Budapest \nMemorandum. The Budapest Memorandum was signed by the United States, \nthe United Kingdom,\n\n[[Page S1700]]\n\nUkraine, and Russia, guaranteeing that at least in principle all those \nnations would respect the territorial integrity of Ukraine. Within the \nlast 2 weeks, Russia has not only reneged on that promise--it has in \nfact invaded Ukraine and taken over territory there.\n  It is important for us, when it comes to Ukraine, to not only stand \nby the Ukrainian people as they move toward a more democratic form of \ngovernment, but it is important for us to reinforce the premise that if \na country will give up its nuclear weapons, will not pursue the \ndevelopment of nuclear weapons, and become part of the nuclear club, we \nwill basically say: That will not create a dangerous situation for your \nfuture. This is what the Budapest agreement was about, recently \nviolated by Russia, one of the signatories.\n  If we want to make the argument in Iran, North Korea, and other \ncountries, that they should foreswear their nuclear weapons, shouldn't \nwe also be standing by the premise that if they do, at least civilized \nnations will stand behind them if they and their sovereignty are \nthreatened? This is what is happening today in Ukraine and Crimea.\n  It is not just a question of the survival of the Ukrainian Government \nbut also a question as to whether civilized countries around the world \ntrying to lessen the threat of nuclear weapons will stand with one \nvoice and condemn the Russians for what they have done.\n  It is very clear Putin has ambitions far beyond the Republic of \nGeorgia and far beyond Ukraine. He engaged in this charm offensive at \nthe Sochi Olympics and talked about the modern Russia and what it meant \nin the 21st century. The very same troops who were protecting the \nathletes from terrorism in Sochi, as soon as the final ceremony ended, \nwere shifted and transferred into Crimea to invade that nation. The \ncharm offensive was clearly over. NBC may have covered the Sochi \nOlympics, but it didn't cover the invasion of Crimea in real-time. But \nit happened, and we know it happened.\n  Having been to Ukraine with Senator McCain and six other colleagues, \nour bipartisan delegation found a deep attachment in Ukraine to the \nUnited States. It is an attachment sometimes linked to specific \nfamilies. I happen to represent the City of Chicago, where there is a \nprominent section known as Ukrainian Village. When I returned from \nUkraine and went back to this section of Chicago, near the church where \nthe Ukrainians worship on Sunday, we had over 500 people who gathered \nto hear what I had seen and heard and to talk about where we should go \nwhen it came to the future of Ukraine.\n  But it is worthy to note that there weren't just Ukrainian Americans \nin that room in Chicago when I returned a week ago. In the front row \nwere Polish people--and we have more Poles in Chicago than almost any \nother city outside of the nation of Poland--Lithuanians, Latvians, \nGeorgians, and even Venezuelans. They had all come there to listen \ncarefully, many of them with memories that not that long ago they were \nunder Soviet domination and lived in fear of what would come from \nMoscow. These same people were standing together. They were standing in \nleague with their Ukrainian-American neighbors, with the understanding \nthat throughout its modern history Russia and the Soviet Union have \ntaken over countries nearby when they could, and many times we didn't \nspeak out.\n  I have heard the argument made that perhaps, if the United States \nshowed more military force in other places in the world, we might have \ndiscouraged Vladimir Putin. That argument doesn't make sense. Look at \nhistory. We were in the midst of the Vietnam war and we had committed \nhalf a million troops. The greatest military in the world was engaged \nin Southeast Asia when Brezhnev, the head of the Soviet Union, invaded \nCzechoslovakia. We were engaged in two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, \nactively showing the power of our military in those countries, under \nPresident George W. Bush, when Vladimir Putin invaded the Republic of \nGeorgia.\n  So I think it is an empty argument to say if we just show our muscles \nand start a war someplace, the rest of the world will be fearful. I \ndon't think it is a recipe for the future. What the President is trying \nto do is to establish political and economic sanctions on Russia which \nwill cost their economy and put pressure on them to stop this \naggressive conduct. That, to me, is sensible.\n  Let's take up this measure. If Members have amendments, bring them to \nthe floor. Let's pass it today, not later this week. Let's show that we \nstand with the Ukrainians and oppose Russian aggression, support \nsanctions when needed, and prepare to loan to the Ukrainians the money \nthey need to sustain their economy and to build it in the future.\n  Ukraine is the second largest country in Europe. It is moving toward \nthe West. Let us welcome them. As long as they are going to make \ncertain their future is consistent with our democratic values, I think \nit is important we not only continue this dialogue but show we can \ntruly be their allies and friends.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I come to the floor to discuss the fourth \nanniversary of ObamaCare. Four years ago this past Sunday the President \nsigned his health care legislation into law. The measure was jammed \nthrough Congress on a party-line vote against the strong objections of \nRepublicans and the American people. Democrats and the President \nassured everyone this opposition was temporary. When people find out \nwhat is in the law, they will like it, Democrats and the President \npromised.\n  Four years later, however, that isn't the case. The majority of the \nAmerican people still disapprove of the law. Why do they still \ndisapprove? Because the President's health care law has failed in every \npossible way. We have canceled health care plans. We have seen people \nwho have lost their doctors and lost their hospitals. We have seen \nsoaring premiums, higher out-of-pocket costs, lower pay, disastrous Web \nsites that have left thousands in limbo, confusion in the health \ninsurance market, and widespread damage to the economy.\n  The President's law has failed so badly that some of the President's \nstrongest supporters are rejecting it. Young people whose support of \nthe President was so successful in his election and reelection are \nturning their backs on the President's law. Unions which pushed for the \nlaw's passage and the President's reelection are now protesting that \nthe law will destroy their health care plans and damage workers' \nlivelihoods. Democrats running for reelection are running from the \nhealth care law as fast as they can for fear that association with \nObamaCare will doom their chances of reelection. People are finding out \nwhat the law truly means for them and they don't like it.\n  When the President was trying to pass his health care law, he made a \nfew promises. I think a lot of people remember when the President said: \nIf you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan. \nHe said: If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. The reality \nof the law has proven to be quite different.\n  Six million Americans so far have lost their health care plans as a \ndirect result of ObamaCare, and far too many of them found their only \nalternative was a plan that offered less coverage for more money. \nMillions of other Americans have lost their doctors and hospitals. \nObamaCare placed a number of new taxes and regulations on insurance \ncompanies that left them facing huge cost increases. In an effort to \nmanage their costs without raising health care premiums even further, \nmany companies have narrowed their network of doctors and hospitals, \nespecially in exchange plans. As a result, many Americans have lost \ndoctors they have been seeing literally for years. Cancer patients in \nthe middle of treatment have found their doctors are not covered by the \nnew health care plans. Patients are also discovering their hospital \noptions are now far more limited, as many plans exclude top hospitals.\n\n[[Page S1701]]\n\n  A recent article in the Associated Press reported:\n\n       Some of America's best cancer hospitals are off-limits to \n     many of the people now signing up for coverage under the \n     Nation's new health care program.\n\n  Practically speaking, the AP reports:\n\n       Those patients may not be able to get the most advanced \n     treatment including clinical trials of new medications.\n\n  In a particularly cruel twist, many of the patients who lost access \nto doctors and hospitals didn't know they would lose access when they \nsigned up for their plans as provider information on the health care \nexchange Web sites is often, to quote a Business Week article, \n``missing, wrong, or difficult to navigate.''\n  In addition to promising that patients would be able to keep their \nhealth care plans and their doctors, the President promised his health \ncare law would reduce health care costs, but in fact health care costs \nhave only risen since the Affordable Care Act passed. Families and \nindividuals who were effectively dumped into the exchanges have \nfrequently found that their only health care options cost far more than \ntheir previous health care plans and offer far less.\n  Family shopping for so-called silver plans now can face deductibles \nup to $12,700, a staggering amount of money that very few families are \nable to afford. For many families that number represents a full quarter \nof their income before taxes.\n\n  Last week news emerged that already-high premiums on the exchanges \nare set to increase substantially next year. This was the headline in \nThe Hill newspaper: O-Care premiums about to skyrocket. The Fiscal \nTimes reported that Americans should ``expect premium prices to soar.'' \nIn fact, The Hill reported that ``health industry officials say that \nObamaCare-related premiums will double in some parts of the country.'' \nThe Wall Street Journal reports that ``one recent analysis finds that \n80% of firms offering employee coverage have raised deductibles or \nother cost-sharing provisions, or are considering doing so . . . to \navoid a new tax that's set to hit more lavish plans in 2018 and to \ncounter health-cost increases. Thus, employee out-of-pocket costs could \nrise.'' Perhaps a more accurate name for the law would have been the \n``Unaffordable Care Act.''\n  The havoc ObamaCare has wreaked on our health care system would be \nample reason to dislike the law. ObamaCare's damage isn't limited to \nour health care system; it is also damaging our economy.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reports that ObamaCare \nwill result in 2\\1/2\\ million fewer full-time workers over the next 10 \nyears and reduce wages by more than $1 trillion. Those are real-world \neconomic impacts.\n  Household income has already dropped by almost $3,700 over the course \nof the Obama Presidency, and American families are already struggling. \nUnemployment is high and economic growth is sluggish. The last thing we \nneed is fewer workers and lower wages.\n  On top of that, ObamaCare is discouraging employers from hiring and \nreducing employees' hours, thanks to the slew of new taxes, mandates, \nand regulations ObamaCare levies on businesses large and small. Chief \namong these, of course, is the requirement that businesses with 50 or \nmore employees provide health insurance to all of their full-time \nemployees, which the law defines as those working 30 hours or more. If \nthey don't do that, they pay fines. Faced with this mandate, State and \nlocal governments, nonprofits, and businesses with small profit margins \nhave been forced to cut employees' hours to avoid health care bills or \nfines they can't afford to pay. Other businesses have been forced to \nkeep their businesses under 50 workers instead of creating new jobs and \nhiring new people.\n  Larger businesses are also deciding not to hire or even letting \nworkers go as a result of the costly taxes and regulations the health \ncare law imposes. According to a recent study, ObamaCare's tax on \nlifesaving medical devices, such as pacemakers and insulin pumps, has \nalready affected more than 30,000 jobs in the medical device industry.\n  I don't care what party you are from, you cannot think this law is \nworking. Our health care system may have needed reform, but this was \nnot the way to do it. Instead of improving our health care system, \nObamaCare is making it far worse. It is time to repeal this law and \npursue real solutions to our health care challenges.\n  Instead of the failing government health care exchanges, we could \ncreate affordable health care plans by allowing the purchase of \ninsurance across State lines. This would allow for interstate \ncompetition when it comes to the purchase and sale of insurance. That \nwould increase competition among health plans, which in turn would \ndrive prices down, not up, as is happening now.\n  We could allow businesses to pool together to negotiate lower rates \nwith health insurance companies.\n  We could improve high-risk pools to help people with preexisting \nconditions and expand health savings accounts to allow families to put \naway money tax free to pay for future health care-related expenses.\n  We could end the rampant lawsuit abuse that is driving up the cost of \ncare for all Americans.\n  We do need real reform of our health care system--the kind of reform \nthat will actually drive down costs and expand access to care while \nallowing Americans, not the government, to make decisions about the \nhealth care plans they choose and the doctors they visit. ObamaCare is \ndoing the opposite.\n  ObamaCare isn't working. We need to repeal it now and replace it with \nreal health care reforms so that Americans don't have to endure another \n4 years like the last 4.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, sometimes it takes a sudden, flagrant \nbreach of international order to dispel a President's naivete about an \nadversary. The 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan had that effect on \nPresident Carter, and one can only hope that Russia's annexation of \nCrimea will have a similar impact on President Obama.\n  Only recently the President was describing his Russian reset--those \nwere his words--as a success. In other words, he was still calling the \nreset a success after Moscow had done the following things--and I think \nit is worth recalling the litany of things Vladimir Putin and Russia \nhave done notwithstanding President Obama's hopeful intention to reset \nthat relationship. Here is what Moscow has done:\n  They brutalized domestic human rights activists.\n  They tortured and murdered anticorruption whistleblower Sergei \nMagnitsky.\n  They unleashed a barrage of anti-American propaganda.\n  They threatened to target U.S. missile defense sites with offensive \nweapons.\n  They vetoed numerous United Nations resolutions regarding Syria, \nwhere Bashar al-Assad has now killed roughly 150,000 civilians. They \nvetoed those resolutions. They also ignored U.S. demands to stop aiding \nBashar al-Assad, period. It is well known and documented that Russia \nregularly sends weapons to Assad to use on his own people.\n  Russia has denounced U.S. sanctions against Iran as undisguised \nblackmail. This is a country seeking a nuclear weapon that would \ndestabilize the entire region--and perhaps worse--in the Middle East.\n  Russia has expelled USAID from their country and pulled out of the \nNunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program designed to reduce the \nthreat of nuclear weapons.\n  Russia has also banned American citizens from adopting Russian \nchildren and offered asylum to NSA leaker Edward Snowden.\n  That is quite a list. As you can see, while President Obama said he \nwants to reset that relationship with Russia, Vladimir Putin has \nbasically thumbed\n\n[[Page S1702]]\n\nhis nose at the United States and the international order. Yet none of \nthat has kept President Obama from calling this relationship with Putin \nand Russia a success.\n  If we consider the three biggest U.S. diplomatic victories often \nattributed to this reset the President likes to talk about--greater \nRussian cooperation in Afghanistan, the New START arms control treaty, \nand the Russian support for U.S. sanctions in Iran--only the first one \nlooks like a genuine, durable achievement from the vantage point of \nMarch 2014.\n  The New START treaty was a dangerous giveaway. In addition to \njeopardizing U.S. missile defense plans, it reduced the number of \nAmerican nuclear launchers and warheads while allowing Russia to \nincrease the size of its own arsenal.\n  As for the Iran sanctions endorsed by the U.N. Security Council \nmembers in June of 2010, these were less significant than the \nunilateral U.S. sanctions that Congress forced upon President Obama \ndespite his objections in December 2011. For that matter, the \nadministration has now unilaterally decided to loosen U.S. sanctions--\nand thereby relinquish some of the best leverage we have on Tehran--to \nkeep them from crossing that red line and acquiring a nuclear weapon. \nWhat did we get for that? We got minor concessions and more hollow \npromises.\n  As with other U.S. adversaries, the Iranians are watching Ukraine to \nsee how President Obama responds. In the modern era, cross-border \nmilitary invasions of sovereign States have been a blessedly rare \noccurrence. Yet Vladimir Putin has now launched two of them in less \nthan 6 years. The Secretary General of NATO has called Russia's armed \nseizure of Crimea ``the gravest threat to European security and \nstability since the end of the Cold War.'' Europe remembers the primary \nlocation for two world wars during the last century. They remember, and \nthey remember what happened in 1938 which, unfortunately, bears an \neerie resemblance to some of the initial steps being taken by Vladimir \nPutin and Russia today, and they remember what happened after that, \ncasting the world into a terrible war in which millions of people lost \ntheir lives in World War II.\n  President Obama's initial response was to sanction 11 Russians and \nUkrainians, leaving Putin's inner circle and his favorite oligarchs \nuntouched, and they drew mocking rebukes from the Kremlin. Last \nThursday, the President decided to ramp up the sanctions by issuing new \nsanctions that did go a little further, targeting four oligarchs and 16 \ngovernment officials, including Putin's Chief of Staff, along with a \nprominent Putin-linked financial institution.\n  In addition, President Obama declared he had now signed a new \nExecutive order. Remember, the President said he has a phone and a pen. \nWell, he has been using them--not necessarily working with Congress but \nhe has been using them. He has issued a new Executive order that gives \nus the authority to impose sanctions not just on individuals but on key \nsectors of the Russian economy. The problem with that is that sanctions \nimposed on Russia's economy are going to hurt Europe and invariably end \nup inflicting damage even on the U.S. economy. But I hope the President \nuses this authority to send Putin a message and finds a way to thread \nthe needle to exact the costs he said he would exact on Putin for this \nlawless act.\n  In my view, the sanctions should also target Rosoboronexport. This is \na State-owned Russian arms dealer that has been supplying the Assad \nregime and Syria with weapons, and it has become the Grand Central \nStation of corruption. The U.S. Pentagon has inexplicably been buying \nMi-17 helicopters from Rosoboronexport to supply the Afghan military, \ndespite numerous alternatives. I am happy to report the senior Senator \nfrom Indiana Mr. Coats has introduced an amendment that would terminate \nthese contracts and prohibit all business dealings with companies that \ncooperate with Rosoboronexport, and I am a proud cosponsor of that \namendment. I hope the majority leader, as Senator McConnell, the \nRepublican leader, implored this morning, will allow an open amendment \nprocess so reasonable amendments designed to improve this bill will be \nallowed to be voted on.\n  As America responds to Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine, \nsanctions will remain a critically important tool, but sanctions alone \nare not enough. They should be accompanied by at least three other U.S. \npolicy moves.\n  First, the United States needs to assess the military needs of \nUkraine and other Eastern European countries and then swiftly \ndispatch--or facilitate the purchase of--whatever resources may be \nrequired. Offering military ration kits rather than serious military \nassistance is a joke. It is a bad joke, and it is an insult to our \nfriends in Kiev and freedom-loving people within the orbit of Russia.\n  Second, we should enhance and expand our European missile defense \nsystem with upgrades such as a new X-Band radar and more capable \ninterceptors. We should also increase our overall missile defense \nbudget. This is something Putin hates but which is a legitimate \nexpenditure of self-defense monies to help keep the world safer, \nparticularly from the threat of an Iranian missile.\n  Third, we should dramatically accelerate the approval process for \nU.S. companies seeking to export liquefied natural gas. Congress can \ntake the lead here by amending the 1938 Natural Gas Act, an antiquated, \nDepression-era law that has become an obstacle to economic growth and \nU.S. foreign policy interests. Even in the short term, most of our LNG \nexports would go to Asia, it is true, rather than Europe, but it would \nincrease overall the supply, and expediting and expanding those exports \nwould increase that global supply, help push down prices, and signal to \nVladimir Putin that Washington is determined to squeeze his gas \nrevenues and break his energy stranglehold on Eastern Europe. That is \nwhy members of both political parties have called for boosting and \naccelerating LNG exports as quickly as possible. Those can begin to \nflow from the United States as early as 2015, thus increasing supply, \nalleviating dependency on other sources, and send a very important \nmessage to Mr. Putin.\n  All of the actions I have described would send a powerful message to \nMoscow and help maximize our diplomatic leverage in the current crisis. \nThe March 20 sanctions were a good start. The legislation that is \ncrafted by my friend from Tennessee, the ranking Republican on the \nForeign Relations Committee, along with Senator Menendez, the chairman, \nare a good start, but there is more that can be done and should be \ndone. I hope the majority leader will allow a reasonable and rational \nprocess to allow other Members in the body to participate by adding \ntheir constructive ideas to this legislation, which will pass by the \nend of the week, but I think there are a multitude of good ideas that \ncould be added to it to make it even stronger and send an even more \neffective message to Vladimir Putin and, hopefully, discourage him from \nacting further in his naked aggression in Ukraine.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schatz). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I wish to ask about my time, but before \nthe Senator from Texas leaves, I wish to thank him for his comments and \nhis involvement in this issue. I appreciate his coming to the floor. I \nthink this is an important issue for us to be debating and I firmly \nsupport the open amendment process that has been alluded to.\n  If I could, I wish to inquire as to how much time is remaining at \nthis point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 4 minutes remaining on the Republican \nside.\n  Mr. CORKER. I was afraid that might be the case. I wonder if I could \nask unanimous consent to speak for 8 minutes or so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the \npending business before the Senate, which is the aid package and \nsanctions package and the IMF package relative to Ukraine. I wish to \nthank Senator Menendez for the way he conducted our hearings and markup \nrelative to this bill.\n  I think most people in this body understand this is a bill that came \nout of\n\n[[Page S1703]]\n\nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee on a 14-3 vote. We had one \nMember who was absent, dealing with some business in Florida. It is my \nunderstanding had that Member been there, this actually would have come \nout of committee on a 15-3 vote. So I emphasize, first of all, this \nbill has been through the committee process. On the other hand, events \non the ground have changed since the bill came out of committee. Things \nhave evolved since it came out of committee. I hope there is an open \namendment process to make adjustments to the bill to take into account \nsome of the things that have occurred on the ground since that time.\n  Look, I know all of us want to strongly support Ukraine. I know all \nof us strongly condemn what Russia and Putin have done recently in \nCrimea, and I think all of us understand that what we want to do is to \nstop that aggression from moving on into the southern and eastern \nportions of Ukraine. So we are trying to respond in a way that sends a \nsignal to Russia, sends a signal to those who have been involved in \nthese illicit activities, that they should at least stop on the Crimean \nborder and, hopefully, over time they will recede from Crimea. What we \nare trying to do is prevent further aggression in this area.\n  I think everyone understands it has been our policy for 70 years as \nthe United States to promote a democratic whole and free Europe. So \nwhat is happening with Russia and Crimea--and hopefully not in Ukraine, \nalthough there is no doubt they have fomented many of the problems that \nhave occurred there--what we are attempting to do is to ensure that \nEurope remains free, democratic, and whole.\n  I know everybody here remembers the fact that Ukraine was a place of \nnumbers of nuclear weapons from Russia. When the Soviet Union broke \napart in 1991, there was a huge arsenal of nuclear weapons and warheads \nin Ukraine. We signed an agreement called the Budapest Memorandum with \nthe United Kingdom, Russia, and Ukraine relative to Ukraine's \nsovereignty if they were willing to give up these nuclear weapons. So \nit is very much in our national interests that we prevent Russia from \nbreaking up and dealing nefariously with the sovereignty of Ukraine.\n  We have crafted a bill which does three things. No. 1, it provides \neconomic aid. I think everyone in this body understands the tremendous \neconomic problems Ukraine is experiencing. I think we all understand \nthe first thing that has to happen in Ukraine is it has to be \nstabilized economically. Therefore, the administration has pledged $1 \nbillion in aid. This bill backs that up in a way that allows that to \noccur. Obviously, Congress has to approve spending, which is associated \nwith loan guarantees. These loan guarantees, by the way, would not take \neffect until after Ukraine has signed an IMF agreement that makes sure \nthey are going to go through the structural processes necessary to make \nsure they do what actually causes them to be a more successful country.\n  The bill also deals with sanctions. I think everyone knows there have \nbeen numbers of people who have been involved nefariously in dealing \ninternally in Ukraine with their sovereignty issues, but there also \nhave been numbers of corrupt officials in Russia who have affected what \nis happening in Ukraine, and this bill sanctions both. We are sending a \nvery strong message. Economic aid is important, but I also think \nsanctioning the bad behavior and Russia understanding there are going \nto be additional sanctions put in place is important.\n  I wish to thank the administration for the sanctions that have been \nput in place. I thought it was a big step to put in place sectoral \nsanctions, or when they said they had the ability through Executive \norder to do that. What I hope will happen, and what we have pressed for \nout of our office, is they will implement some of those sectoral \nsanctions to send a shock wave through the Russian economy that in the \nevent they do anything to come into Ukraine while they are amassing \ntroops on the border--if they do anything in that regard--this is just \nthe beginning.\n  I think all of us understand Russia is in a place where their economy \nis weak and we know the ruble has depreciated greatly in value. We \nunderstand our best asset against them right now is sanctions that \nwould hurt them economically and certainly affect those people who sit \naround Putin and affect him in big ways.\n  The third piece of this bill is IMF reform. I join a number of people \nwho believe the IMF reforms that have been laid out are important. They \nare important to the world. I talk to my friends on this side of the \naisle who I think may have more of an isolationist bent, and I say that \none of the things that is most important for us as a nation is to have \nan entity such as the IMF--it is not perfect, it makes mistakes, but it \nis the entity that everything in the world is looking to right now to \nhelp usher Ukraine from where they are to a place that is prosperous \nand has the ability to improve the standard of living of Ukrainians, \nwhich is very important from the standpoint of their stability.\n  So we are all focused on the IMF. We have people on my side of the \naisle who again have become more isolationist, less adventurous, if you \nwould, relative to--which is where the country is, I understand. But \nwhat the IMF does is allow us to share the risk of stabilizing \ncountries such as Ukraine with other countries around the world. I \nthink all of us understand the threats to global stability are greater \ntoday than they have been in the past. So there was an agreed-to set of \nreforms that took place back in 2010. I strongly support--I strongly \nsupport--those reforms and, as a matter of fact, would say Ukraine is \nthe poster child for why we need to have an IMF that is functioning at \na much higher level.\n  We account for a transfer from something called the NAB, if you \nwill--it is a line of credit that we have; it is out there; it is a \nliability our Nation has--and we transfer $63 billion of that $100 \nbillion over to something that is in a basket of currency. So we are \nnot taking on any additional liabilities. Yet there is a pay-for aspect \nof this through the budgeting process that is fully accounted for in \nthis bill.\n  Again, I join Dr. Henry Kissinger, Dr. Condoleezza Rice, former \nSecretary Jim Baker in saying and knowing we should adopt these IMF \nreforms.\n  These are the three big elements of this bill. We have some democracy \nassistance. We have some authorized sums to help us build stronger \nrelationships with our allies. But I strongly support this piece of \nlegislation. I think this piece of legislation is a full package. It is \na package that deals with the three aspects that need to be dealt with \nat this time.\n  Ukraine is, again, the poster child of why we want to have a fully \nfunctioning IMF. Look. I know there are going to be amendments offered. \nThere actually have been some already. I hope we will have a full and \nopen process, with amendments that are relevant to what we are dealing \nwith on the floor. I think the bill can be improved.\n  It is my hope, as we move through this week, that we will have the \nopportunity for those amendments to be heard and voted on but, at the \nsame time, by the time the week ends and we head back to our respective \nStates we will have, in a unified way, sent a message to Russia, sent a \nmessage to the people of Ukraine as to where this body stands relative \nto their support economically, relative to sanctions that we believe \nstrongly should be put in place against Russia, and how we believe the \nIMF should be functioning as a stabilizing force in the world.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/25/senate-section/article/S1703-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1703]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, my understanding is we are on the motion to \nproceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are.\n  Mr. RUBIO. I wanted to speak about the issue of Ukraine. I get a lot \nof questions, phone calls, emails about it. It has certainly been on \nthe minds of a lot of people across the country. The most common \nquestion that I get is: What do we do about it? What can we do? Related \nto that is the question of: Why does this even matter?\n  I am going to get to that in my conclusion. But on this motion that \nis now before the Senate, where we are being asked to vote on a package \nof sanctions and also assistance to Ukraine, I wanted to first outline \nwhat it is we can do moving forward in addition to this bill that is \nbefore us, but also why this bill that is before us is so important.\n  I think there are a couple of things that we really need to focus on \nin terms of our reaction to what has happened with regards to Crimea \nand with Ukraine, in particular, because of the Russian actions that \nhave been taken.\n  First and most important we need to help the Ukrainian people and the \ninterim government in Ukraine to protect its nation's sovereignty but \nalso to protect its transition to democracy--to full democracy.\n  They have elections scheduled in May of this year. For these \nelections it is going to be critical that they go off smoothly, that \nthey are free and they are fair because that is an important step in \ntheir transition to democracy.\n  But we should anticipate that Russia, through Putin, is going to do \neverything it can to disrupt these elections, to delegitimize these \nelections. We already see evidence in open source reporting in the \nmedia that, in fact, there are highly trained agitators sponsored by \nthe Kremlin that have found their way into Ukraine and could \npotentially participate in ways to try to disrupt these elections.\n  So I think one of the first things we can do, working with our allies \nin Europe, is to help them with the logistical support they need to \ncarry out in May elections that are free and are fair and to help them \nwith the biggest step they are going to take so far towards a \ntransition to democracy in Ukraine.\n  The second action we need to take to help Ukraine to protect its \nsovereignty and to make its transition to democracy is to help them \nstabilize their economy. You can imagine that this disruptive change in \ngovernment, combined with an invasion of its territories, has been \nhighly disruptive to their economy, which was already feeling some real \nconstraints. That is why the bill before us is so critical. In addition \nto some of the direct assistance, it will help them access loans that \nwill allow them to stabilize their economic situation.\n  What we can anticipate is that Russia is going to do everything it \ncan to disrupt their economy. Again, the Russian argument here is--it \nis a ridiculous argument. But the argument they are making to the world \nis: Ukraine is a failed state. The Russian-speaking population is being \nthreatened. So we have to get involved. We must intervene to try to \nstabilize that situation.\n  That is the argument they have made in Crimea. Increasingly, that is \nthe argument they seem to be making with regard to Eastern Ukraine. So \nthe bill before us is critical because it will be a major step on the \npart of this government to do its part, in conjunction with our allies \nin Europe, to help Ukrainians stabilize their economy.\n  As I have shared before, I have some real concerns about some of the \nlanguage that is in this bill. It has to do with these changes to the \nIMF that I do not think belong in this legislation. I do not think they \nbelong in this legislation for two reasons. One, I do not think that we \nshould be taking up an issue of that importance in this manner. We \nshould have a full debate. That should be dealt with separately. But I \nalso think it was a mistake by this administration to include the IMF \nlanguage in this bill because what we need as much as anything else is \nnot just to pass this bill out of the Senate but to pass it with the \nmost amount of support possible.\n  I want to see it be 100 to 0 or 95 to 5 so we can send a very strong \nmessage to Russia and the world that the United States of America and \nher people are firmly on the side of Ukraine's sovereignty and \nUkraine's desire for independence from Russia and its ability to \nstabilize itself in moving forward. That, quite frankly, is endangered \nas a result of the administration's decision to push this divisive \nlanguage into this bill. There was no reason for them to do that.\n  In fact, that sentiment is not a Republican sentiment. It is being \nechoed in the House, where a number of Democrats today are quoted in \nnewspaper articles as saying that this is a mistake, that they should \nnever have done this. If they were to take this language out, you would \npass a bill in the House and Senate this week. We could have passed one \nbefore we left 2 weeks ago. Instead, it continues to have to go through \na prolonged debate and divisiveness.\n  There are people who have had to vote against it here on the floor \nbecause they feel so strongly about the IMF language. We could have had \ntheir support. We could have sent a stronger message than the one that \nis being sent now.\n  I have those concerns. By the way, there was a statement made on the \nfloor yesterday that I think deserves to be addressed. The majority \nleader stood here and said that, basically, the reason that--\nRepublicans are responsible for the loss of Crimea in an effort to help \na family that is engaged in American politics. I think that statement \nis absurd and ridiculous. I think it is the kind of hyperbole that in \nissues such as this has no place.\n  At some point there have to be issues so big and so important to the \nnational security of this country that they are above politics and \nabove that sort of statement. That being said, while I share the same \nconcerns that many of my colleagues do about the IMF language, and \ninitially expressed my position that I was not willing to vote for this \nbill with it, after much thought and consideration over the last couple \nof weeks, researching the issues, I made the conclusion that in the \ncost-benefit analysis, helping Ukraine stabilize itself, helping \nUkraine stabilize its economy, given the importance of this issue, it \nis so important that I am prepared to vote for this despite the fact \nthat it has something in it that I do not like. That is how important I \nthink this issue truly is.\n\n  Oftentimes in foreign policy that is what we are called to do. We are \ncalled to make pragmatic decisions that are in the best interests of \nAmerica and our allies around the world, even if it is less than ideal \nor perhaps not the complete solution that we want. That is why I voted \nto proceed with the debate on this bill yesterday. That is why I am \nprepared to support it despite the inclusion of IMF language that I am \nstrongly against--because I think this issue is that important.\n  The third thing we can do to help Ukraine protect its sovereignty and \nmake its full transition to democracy is to help them with their \ndefense capability. Now, understand that when the Soviet Union fell in \nthe early 1990s, Ukraine was left with the world's third largest \nstockpile of tactical nuclear weapons and strategic nuclear weapons on \nthe planet.\n  But they signed this agreement with the United States, the United \nKingdom, and Russia that basically said: If you give up your nuclear \nweapons, we, these three countries that signed this, will provide for \nyour defense and assure you of your defense. So Ukraine did that. They \ngave up these weapons. This was signed in 1994, and 20 years later, one \nof the three countries that signed that agreement has not just not \nprovided for their defense, they actually invaded them.\n  I want to make a point on this for a second. Think about if you were \none of these other countries around the world right now that feels \nthreatened by your neighbors, and the United States and the rest of the \nworld are going to you and saying: Listen, do not develop nuclear \nweapons. Do not develop nuclear weapons, South Korea. Do not develop \nnuclear weapons, Japan. Do not develop nuclear weapons, Saudi Arabia.\n\n[[Page S1705]]\n\nWe will protect you. We will watch out for you.\n  What kind of lesson do you think this instance sends to them? I think \nthe message this is sending to many nations around the world is: \nPerhaps we can no longer count on the security promises made by the \nfree world. Perhaps we need to start looking out for ourselves. That is \nwhy the Ukrainian situation is so more important than simply what is \nhappening in Europe. This has implications around the world.\n  There are a number of countries around the world now that are \nconsidering increasing their defense capabilities, including a nuclear \ncapacity, because they feel threatened by neighbors that have a nuclear \ncapacity themselves. So far they have held back because they have \nrelied on the United States and our partners to assure them that they \ndo not need these weapons, that we have their back. But now when \nsomething like this happens, these countries see it as further evidence \nthat potentially those sorts of assurances are no longer enough in the \n21st century.\n  That raises the real risk that over the next 2 decades, you could see \nan explosion in the number of countries around the world that possess a \nnuclear weapons capability because they now feel that they must protect \nthemselves and can no longer rely on other countries to do it for them.\n  So how can we help Ukraine with its military and defense \ncapabilities? By providing them assistance. By the way, the Ukraine \nmilitary capability degraded not just because of their overconfidence \nin these assurances that were made to them, but there was also \ncorruption in that government. In fact, the previous president who was \nousted by a popular revolt, that president actually undermined the \ndefense capabilities of that country and took a lot of that money and \nused it for internal control, to be able to control his own population \ninstead of being able to protect his country.\n  So what can we do to help? The first thing that I have called for us \nto do is to provide Ukraine with more military equipment and more \ntraining. We should work with our NATO allies and the European Union to \nhelp equip and train the Ukrainian military forces so that they can \nprotect the country now and moving forward. We can also share \nintelligence information with them to help them better position their \nassets and understand and have a better awareness of what is going on \naround them.\n  We can also help them with logistical support. These are the sorts of \nthings that I hope this administration will take steps toward in the \nnext couple of days. So that is the first thing we can do. We can help \nUkraine protect its sovereignty and make its full transition to \ndemocracy.\n  The second thing we need to do is we need to continue to raise the \nprice on Putin for the invasion of Crimea. We need to change the \ncalculation, the cost-benefit calculation that he is going to go \nthrough as he decides whether to move into Eastern Ukraine now and \npotentially even parts of Moldova.\n  So already some steps have been taken in that regard. I applaud the \nadministration for having additional sanctions announced last week. I \nthink we are going to have to continue to do more in conjunction with \nour allies. I think we need to add more names of individuals, of \nfinancial institutions, and of businesses, primarily those who have \nlinks to this invasion, but also Russia's involvement in supporting the \nSyrian regime as it carries out the mass slaughter of its own people.\n  I think we need to suspend our civil and nuclear cooperation \nagreement that was entered into as part of the 123 agreement 4 years \nago as a strong message to them. I think we need to reassess the role \nthat NATO plays in Europe. NATO was largely built around the Soviet \nrisks in Western Europe.\n  Then, after the fall of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, \nNATO kind of lost its way a little bit in terms of its role in Europe \nbecause there was no threat. In fact, you saw some of these countries \nsaying, you know, it is likely that NATO's role now will be about \noperations in the Middle East or in Africa and being involved in \nthreats there as opposed to actually having to defend our own \nterritory.\n  The facts on the ground in Europe have changed dramatically in the \nlast 2 months. You now, in fact, do have a powerful military force in \nthe region that has shown a willingness to invade a neighbor. They did \nthis in 2008 in Georgia. They are doing it again now in a way that is \neven more egregious and outrageous. I think it is time for NATO to \nreevaluate its capabilities, given this new threat that is here to \nstay.\n  Also, the time has come for NATO to reposition its assets to face \nthis threat and this risk. I think and I hope that those conversations \nare happening now. I think for NATO, in many respects, it is time to \nreinvigorate this alliance. It has a clear and present danger in Europe \nin the form of the government of Vladimir Putin, who threatens his \nneighbors and the stability of Europe. So now I think NATO has found a \nreason to reinvigorate itself.\n\n  The last point I would make, in terms of changing the calculus, is \nthe real stranglehold Russia has on Europe. It is not simply its \nmilitary capabilities, it is its natural resources. Much of Europe \ndepends on Russia for its oil and natural gas. This creates a \ntremendous amount of leverage on their neighbors. One of the reasons we \nhave seen some countries in Europe reluctant to move forward on even \nhigher sanctions is because they are afraid of losing access to the \nnatural gas and oil from Russia that their economy depends on.\n  We need to change that. That can't happen overnight, but we need to \nbegin to change that; first, by increasing our exports to those \ncountries and particularly Ukraine. I know Senator Barrasso will have \nan amendment as part of this debate that I hope will be considered that \nwill allow us to export more natural gas to Ukraine. But what also \nneeds to happen is other countries in Europe need to develop their own \ndomestic capabilities in natural gas so they can become less reliant on \nRussia for these resources and become more reliant on themselves and \nfree countries in the region to be able to do that. That is a critical \ncomponent of a long-term strategy in all of this.\n  Let me close by answering the question I began with. Why does this \nmatter? I think this matters for a lot of different reasons. I have \nhighlighted one, in terms of decisions being made around the world and \ngovernments deciding whether they are going to pursue their own \ndomestic nuclear weapons capability, but there is another that perhaps \nwe need to think about.\n  After World War II--in fact, after the last century when the world \nwent through two devastating World Wars--there was a commitment made \nthat no longer would nations be allowed to aggressively invade other \ncountries and take over territory and exercise illegitimate claims. In \nfact, international norms were established at the end of World War II. \nThere were some conflicts during the Cold War with Russia, with the \nSoviet Union, and with the spread of communism, but by and large, \nespecially since the end of the Cold War, that has been the established \nnorm.\n  It is not acceptable in the late 20th century and in the early 21st \ncentury for a country to simply make up an excuse and invade a neighbor \nand take their lands and territory. That was perhaps the way of the \nworld 300 years ago, 200 years ago, and 100 years ago, and there were \nmassive wars and loss of life as a result of countries doing that, but \nthe world grew tired of these conflicts and decided we will no longer \ntolerate or accept these sorts of things. If you recall, in the early \n1990s, Saddam Hussein did that. He invaded Kuwait. The entire world \ncommunity rallied around the United States of America to expel him as a \nresult of that illegitimate action.\n  In the 21st century, we have the most egregious violation of that \nnorm. We basically have Russia deciding they don't like the way things \nare going in Ukraine so they decide to invade. They decided to take \nover a territory. Think about how they did it. They denied ever doing \nit. They sent Russian troops into Crimea, but they had them wear \nuniforms that had no markings on them. In fact, the press would ask \nthese soldiers: Where are you from, and they wouldn't answer. They \ninvaded a country but lied about their invasion. They claimed these \nwere local defense forces that had rallied around the Russian flag. \nThey made up this excuse\n\n[[Page S1706]]\n\nthat somehow the Russian-speaking population in the region was being \noppressed and attacked and was in danger and so they needed to \nintervene.\n  To this day, Russia still will not admit the military role they are \nplaying on the ground in Crimea. So in addition to violating this \ninternational norm, which is an outrageous behavior, they have lied \nabout it and think they can get away with it. The point I am making is, \nif in the 21st century a country is allowed to invade a neighbor, lie \nabout it and lie about the reasons for it and they can get away with it \nwithout significant costs, we have created a dangerous precedent with \nwhich we are going to have to live. All over the world there are \npowerful nations that can now claim land they do not control belongs to \nthem.\n  I took a trip in February to Asia. I visited Japan and the \nPhilippines and South Korea. You know what the No. 1 fear in that \nregion is. That China has similar claims to Russia. They claim all \nsorts of pieces of territory and of oceans that belong to them. They \nclaim it belonged to them 1,000 years ago and should belong to them \nnow. They have taken a different tack, but the point is, if we now live \nin a world where a country can make territorial claims and then simply \nact on them without any repercussions from the international community, \nthen I think the 21st century is starting to look more and more like \nthe early 20th century, a time that subjected the world to two \ndevastating World Wars.\n  We cannot allow this to go unpunished. The only way this can be \npunished is if the free countries of the world rally together and \nimpose sanctions and costs on Vladimir Putin and his cronies for having \ntaken this action. That will never happen--the free world will never be \nable to rally to impose those costs--unless the United States leads \nthat effort. We can't do it alone, but it cannot be done without us.\n  That is why it is so important that measures such as the one the \nSenate now is considering happen with the highest amount of bipartisan \nsupport we can muster. We may not agree with every aspect of it--I \ncertainly do not--but we must weigh the equities. If we were to put \nthis on a scale, the need to do something about Ukraine so far \noutweighs the things about the legislation before us that we don't like \nbecause of the implications it has not just on our Nation but on the \nworld and the role we must play. If some other country around the world \nfails to pass sanctions, fails to take steps or does so in a way that \nis divided, it might have some impact, but when the United States fails \nto act in a decisive way, it has a dramatic impact.\n  One of the arguments our adversaries around the world use is asking \nour allies: Why are you still in the camp of the United States? They \nask: Why are you still allying yourself with the United States? They \nare unreliable. Their government is always bickering and deeply \ndivided. They can't come together in Washington to do anything. Do you \nthink, if you are ever invaded or ever get into trouble, the United \nStates could possibly muster the domestic political support necessary \nfor them to come to your assistance? Don't count on America. Count on \nus or count on yourself.\n  I have already explained why there is danger in that, but that is the \nargument these countries use against us. What I fear is that if we fail \nto take decisive and unified action in this body, in the Senate, to \nsend a strong message--and while we may not agree on every component of \nthis, and I have already said I believe it was a mistake for the \nadministration to push for that IMF reform language--if we do not send \na strong and decisive message, then I think this will be spun against \nus. I think this will be used as evidence to our allies and other \ncountries around the world why America is no longer reliable, either \neconomically or militarily.\n  The consequences of that could extend far beyond Europe into other \nregions of the world, such as Asia. This is not a game. This is not \nsome domestic political dispute. This issue has ramifications that will \ndirectly impact the kind of world our children will inherit. In fact, \nit will dramatically impact the kind of world we will have to live in \nover the next 20, 30, and 40 years. We cannot afford to make a mistake. \nWe cannot afford to be wrong.\n  I hope I can convince as many of my colleagues as possible to support \nthis legislation, with all of its flaws, so we can send a clear message \nthat on these issues we are united as a people and as a nation and that \nwe remain committed to U.S. global leadership.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I enjoyed very much the remarks of the \nSenator from Florida. He is very much concerned about this, very much \nplugged into the situation of what is happening in Ukraine, but I would \nlike to make a couple of comments about that from a slightly different \nperspective, one that is from my current position as the ranking member \non the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n  I would like to look at just one part of this proposal; that is, the \nmoney that would be coming out of the military to take care of a \nproblem the military should not have to take care of at a time when \nthings are very serious. The IMF has all the authority it needs to meet \nall of Ukraine's borrowing needs--that is the $35 billion--with its \nexisting commitments from the global community. The IMF does not need \nadditional U.S. funds to help Ukraine. It does not make sense to double \nthe size of the IMF by ratifying a 2010 agreement, paying for it with \nmoney that could be used by DOD to address the shortfalls which I am \ngoing to talk about.\n  By the way, there is another option out there because the House has a \nbill. Chairman Royce of the House Foreign Affairs Committee is marking \nup a bill today as we are speaking that I believe addresses our \nresponse to Ukraine in a more responsible way. The House bill is likely \nto provide $68 billion in Ukraine aid that does not expand the IMF and \nremoves it from the bans on LNG. This does not contain IMF reform. It \ndoes not take money from the DOD. I think that is good.\n  The Senator from Florida commented that we wouldn't be in the \nposition we are in right now with the Europeans afraid to come to the \naid of Ukraine if it weren't for the fact they are reliant upon Russia \nfor their ability to produce LNG. We in this country have had a real \nboom in getting in the tight formations of the LNG. Right now we need \nto be exporting more of it to get the price up so it can be produced \nfor ourselves in this country. No better way than to start exporting \nthis to countries such as Ukraine. If we are doing this, the Western \nEuropean countries would not be reliant upon Russia for that ability.\n  I think we have an opportunity there to do something with this bill, \nand hopefully we will be able to satisfy the needs of Ukraine and at \nthe same time not provide further damage to our military.\n  I recognize that out of the $315 million pricetag in total aid for \nthe package, it rightly cuts $150 million from the State Department. \nThat is true. That is where it should come from. But it also then takes \nan equal amount--\n\n[[Page S1707]]\n\n$150 million--away from the Department of Defense to double the size of \nIMF in order to give authority that isn't actually required for the IMF \nto adequately loan to Ukraine, and should not be included as part of \nthis bill.\n  The unnecessary proposed $157 million of defense rescission to pay \nfor this aid has already been used by OMB, the Office of Management and \nBudget, and by the DOD, Department of Defense, to build the current \ndefense budget. These funds have already been spent and we cannot get \nany more out of the military right now. If Defense is forced to pay for \nthis aid, then the services will likely have to reduce their readiness \naccounts.\n  Readiness accounts mean lives because we talk about risk. If we are \nnot ready, to the degree we are not ready, we incur more risk, and risk \nis translated into lives. Our national security funding can't be \ntreated like an ATM. Mr. President, $157 million can be used to support \ncritical defense readiness needs, such as an Army brigade combat team \nfor 6 months, 1,000 Marine embassy security personnel for 1\\1/2\\ years, \nabout 2 months of the O for a second carrier air wing or almost two \nF-16 squadrons for 1 year.\n  What has happened to the military, if only people out there would \nunderstand, and they do not--there are a lot of Republicans and \nDemocrats both out there not talking about this, the most serious \nproblem we are facing in this country--is what the Obama administration \nhas done to our military.\n  I remember so well 5 years ago going to Afghanistan so I could \nrespond to the President's budget, which was at that time talking about \nwhat he was going to be doing to the military. I knew he would begin 5 \nyears ago to start disarming America, and what did he do. He did away \nwith our only fifth-generation fighter, the F-22; he did away with our \ncarrier capability, the C-17; did away with our future combat system; \nand he did away with our ground-based interceptor in Poland. Of course, \nwe are desperately looking for something to protect the Eastern part of \nthe United States as a result of that. That was all in the first year, \nthe first step in disarming America.\n  Since that time, the President in his budget has taken out of the \nmilitary some $487 billion. If he goes through with his sequestration, \nit will be another one-half billion dollars.\n  People don't realize where this all started. They will say: Wait a \nminute. It is just entitlements. Entitlements are a problem, because 60 \npercent of the total budget goes to entitlements. But keep in mind, \nthere is also discretionary spending which is nondefense discretionary \nspending. When this President took office, the first thing done was to \ntake $800 billion for a stimulus, none of which was used for the \nmilitary. That obligated us on nondefense discretionary spending for \nthe rest of the time at the expense of defense. So now we are in a \nsituation which is so serious in this country that even our military \nleaders have come out and made statements. People have to understand \nhow critical this situation is and how we have disarmed this country.\n  Secretary Hagel 2 weeks ago said:\n\n       American dominance on the seas, in the skies, and in space \n     can no longer be taken for granted.\n\n  Is this America? We have taken this for granted since World War II, \nand all of a sudden--because of what has happened through this \nadministration to the military in the last 5 years--we can no longer do \nthis.\n  General Amos, head of the Marines, agrees with me on increased risk:\n\n       We will have fewer forces arriving less-trained, arriving \n     later to the fight. . . . This is a formula for more American \n     casualties.\n\n  We just said when the risk increases, then our very brave troops die.\n  Under Secretary Frank Kendall of this administration, on January 3, \nsaid:\n\n       We're cutting our budget substantially while some of the \n     people we worry about are going in the opposite direction. \n     We've had 20 years since the end of the cold war [and sort] \n     of a presumption in the United States that we are \n     technologically superior militarily.\n\n  That is not the case now.\n  The top military person, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nGeneral Dempsey, was appointed to the position by President Obama. He \nsaid to our committee, the Armed Services Committee, that we are \nputting our military on a path where the ``force is so degraded and so \nunready'' that it would be ``immoral to use the force.''\n  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff: Immoral to use the force. \nThis is supposed to be America. We are supposed to be a superior \ncountry. What has happened to us?\n  Admiral Winnefeld, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the second \nhighest position, stated:\n\n       [t]here could be for the first time in my career instances \n     where we may be asked to respond to a crisis and we will have \n     to say that we cannot.\n\n  Unfortunately, this is something which not many people are aware of \nin terms of what we are doing.\n  Yes, we want to do what we can for Ukraine, and we believe the State \nDepartment certainly has an obligation. But the other half of the \namount, the $157 million, cannot come from the military because we are \nso unready today.\n  When we are considering this, we have to consider we have a real \nserious problem with our military. Unfortunately, people are not aware \nof this, and a lot of politicians don't talk about it because they are \nuncomfortable talking about it.\n\n\n                        Sebelius v. Hobby Lobby\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today in the Supreme Court something very \nsignificant is happening.\n  I am from Oklahoma. David Green and his wife, of Oklahoma City, \nstarted a business called Hobby Lobby by making picture frames in their \ngarage. It wasn't that long ago. I can remember them doing that. They \nwere able to open their first store which was about 300 square feet.\n  With the profits they made in their little garage operation, David \nGreen's faith, practice, and his day-to-day business decisions led him \nand his family to build a successful nationwide company. Over the \nyears, their business has grown to 602 stores. With plans to expand, \nHobby Lobby has an annual revenue upward of $2.5 billion, and David has \nhad success despite running his business in a very countercultural way.\n  For instance, all of the retail stores close at 8 p.m. each night and \nall day on Sunday so employees can spend time with their families. This \nis appreciated by the company's some 16,000 employees who are paid \nabove the minimum wage. Hobby Lobby's generous employee benefit plan \nincludes an onsite clinic with no copay at Hobby Lobby headquarters and \neligibility to enroll in medical, dental, and prescription drug plans, \nalong with long-term disability, life insurance, and a 401(k) plan with \na generous company match. This is something they have done since long \nbefore ObamaCare came along.\n  At one point Hobby Lobby was challenged by a competitor who said they \nwould bury the company with their money; so the firm opened their doors \non Sunday, ultimately earning the company some $150 million in revenue \neach week over and above what the competitor previously had been able \nto raise. Eventually David Green said he was challenged by God to trust \nin Him with his business to go back to his policy of closing on \nSundays. He did, and his business has prospered. David's Christian \nfaith runs deeper than his desire to have a profitable, successful \ncompany. But he is getting both. When he was faced with the decision to \nmake money or obey God, he chose to obey God, whatever the \nconsequences.\n  More recently he was faced with a new test. It didn't come from a \ncompetitor. It came from the U.S. Government.\n  Part of ObamaCare requires employers not only to provide health \ninsurance to their employees but also to provide free access to the \npills which terminate pregnancies. David, as I and many others, \nbelieves that life begins at conception. I believe that; David believes \nthat. We are free to believe that. Offering an option to end that life \nwould be a violation of our moral compass as defined by his faith and \nour faith.\n  Here is a guy who feels so strongly in his belief, and as his actions \nhave shown, he would rather pay the $1.3 million a day in fines from \nthe Obama administration than comply with the law--in other words, \nkilling an unborn child.\n  Today the Obama administration is claiming this privately-owned \nbusiness is waging a war on women for not\n\n[[Page S1708]]\n\nagreeing to provide these treatments for its employees free of charge--\nnever mind that he has been offering his employees health insurance \nsince long before the government mandated it.\n  So we have the faith of an individual and what he is willing to do \nfor his faith: He is willing to stand up to this abusive government. If \nwe restrict those of faith from applying their conscience to the world \naround, then we quench the progress of freedom.\n  The Obama administration is attempting to write a new moral code if \nit is going to tell people like David Green he no longer has the \nfreedom to apply his faith and convictions to how he operates his \nprivate business.\n  The case before the Supreme Court today is about maintaining freedom, \nwhich starts by preserving the fundamental freedom of religion under \nthe First Amendment--whether it is practiced in a temple or a public \nsquare. Hobby Lobby is not alone, but it is a leader in this battle. \nMore than 100 institutions have filed similar claims. Four universities \nin my State of Oklahoma have also filed a lawsuit along the same lines.\n  So here we have a situation--and it is hard to believe this can \nhappen in America--where there is a man who has built up and is \nactively employing 16,000 people who otherwise might not be employed. \nHe is providing income, selling products. He is a self-made man who \nstarted out in his garage. He has built up a giant operation all \nthroughout America and has made a great contribution. Along comes the \nObama administration and ObamaCare which says: We are going to fine you \n$1.3 million a day if you don't offer these abortions.\n  This is actually being considered right now in the U.S. Supreme \nCourt. I think God is on our side and I think we are going to have a \ngood outcome. But imagine, one man taking the risk of $1.3 million a \nday in fines just to stand behind his faith and behind the 16,000 \npeople who work for him to make sure that good happens.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I wish to speak about the same topic as \nmy good friend from Oklahoma.\n  I was at the Supreme Court listening to the arguments on this case, \nSebelius v. Hobby Lobby, and another case involving a Pennsylvania \ncompany which I wish to speak about as well.\n  Of course, this case, as the Senator from Oklahoma has pointed out, \nstarts with the Affordable Care Act and what many people and I believe \nthe Supreme Court will decide is a blatant violation in religious \nfreedom in the way that act would be applied.\n  There is nothing in the act that deals with the rule which sets those \nbig fines up or establishes how those fines would be collected--or, in \nfact, nothing in the act which specifies specific things that have to \nbe in the so-called model plan. That all is up to the administration, \nall up to the Department of HHS--unless the Court or the Congress does \nwhat needs to be done here, which is to say there are certain \nboundaries you can't cross.\n  The so-called Affordable Health Care Act--which seems to be providing \nneither better health care nor better affordability--was signed into \nlaw 4 years ago this week. In that 4 years we have seen disastrous \neffects of the health care act. One of those is the workplace effect \nwhere more and more people work less and less.\n  Why do they work less and less? Because for the first time ever the \ngovernment has said businesses and people had an obligation to provide \ninsurance for somebody who worked more than 30 hours. Prior to that \nlaw, many people with insurance worked less than 30 hours. It may not \nhave been insurance which the President of the United States would have \nspecified they had, but it was insurance which appeared to be working \nfor them. But once the government says: Here is what you have to do, \nthe government ironically also appears to be saying: Here is what you \ndon't have to do.\n  So we know the workplace effects are bad. We know this is one of the \nprincipal reasons given for people working part time without benefits \ninstead of working either full time or part time with benefits. We see \nthe cut in Medicare and the impact it has on seniors. We see the \nincreasing amount of money you have to spend before your insurance \nkicks in for so many people. We know this law is not working for \nAmerican families or American individuals. Now we see a case where the \nlaw doesn't work for the Constitution.\n  Specifically, the law forces businesses such as Hobby Lobby--\nmentioned by the Senator from Oklahoma, Senator Inhofe--to offer health \ninsurance for employees which covers services that violate their \nreligious belief. This is a company which has always prided itself in \nits ability to offer health care coverage better than its employees \nmight be able to get other places. This is a company which starts its \nnonseasonal employees at a rate about twice minimum wage, its lowest \npaid employee. This is not a company which is in any way trying to take \nadvantage of its employees. This is a company which in every indication \nthrough the existence of the company is they want to act in a certain \nway which is comfortable with its faith.\n  The penalties? If you don't do what the government says, the \npenalties are $36,500 per employee per year. In the case of this \ncompany, which has locations all over the country and a significant \nnumber of employees, that is more than $450 million a year. If you \ndon't provide insurance at all, one of the points made by the \ngovernment lawyers today, your option would be you would only pay a \n$2,000 penalty. So $2,000 a year if you don't offer insurance at all; \n$36,500 a year per employee if you don't offer exactly the insurance \nthe all-knowing government has decided you need to have.\n  What a foolish position for the Federal Government to be in: Your \npenalty, if you are this big company but privately held, closely held \nby a family--this happens to be a big and successful company but not a \npublicly-traded company. It happens to be a company that chose to \nincorporate but incorporated within the ability of the family to do so \nin a closely-held way. If you don't pay--if you don't do what the \ngovernment says, your penalty would be less than the insurance you are \nproviding by quite a bit--if you don't provide insurance at all. If you \ndon't do exactly what the government says, it is probably the amount of \nmoney that puts your company out of business.\n\n  Hobby Lobby, with more than 500 arts and crafts stores around the \ncountry, is being joined in the case today. The cases were joined \ntogether by Conestoga Wood Specialties, a company that manufactures \nkitchen cabinets. Their case was presented at the same time. This \ncompany was founded by the Hahns family, a Mennonite family from \nPennsylvania. It is a smaller company than Hobby Lobby, but a company \nthat still upholds their own religious beliefs and has a tradition of \nupholding those religious beliefs in everything they do. These two \ncompanies of very different size do not object to all of the things in \nthe list of things the government says you have to offer. In fact, in \nthe area of contraception, they object to only 4 of the things that \nhappen after conception, the things that would create an abortion in \ntheir view after conception. They both traditionally offered other \nkinds of contraception, but this crosses their religious boundary. So \nfor these 4 things only the government would say you have to pay \n$36,500 per employee per year.\n  There are at least 46 cases filed concerning for-profit companies \nthat have the same kinds of religious objections. More than 10 of those \nlawsuits are in my State of Missouri. It is not just about one set of \nreligious beliefs, but it is about protecting all Americans' First \nAmendment rights to pursue their faith-based principles and what they \nbelieve. These happen to be a Mennonite family and an evangelical \nChristian family. The largest Christian group in America, the Catholic \nChurch, has a broader sense of what they think would violate their \nreligious beliefs. But the point here is not what the government is \nspecifically trying to force you to do; it is that the government under \nthe laws that we have passed should not be able to force you to do \nthings that violate your faith principles.\n  There are many faith-based groups that have different views of how \nyou deliver health services. I met with many of those groups over the \ncourse of the last 2 years since this rule came out. There are 84 \ndifferent briefs that have been filed with the Court on behalf of these \ntwo cases, suggesting as\n\n[[Page S1709]]\n\nfriends of the Court that here is something you should think about and \nlook at. On those 84 amicus briefs they are at least 3 to 1 in favor of \nthe families that own these companies that want to be able to run their \ncompanies based on their faith-based principles.\n  The numbers of people that are concerned about this are large, and \nthey include a very diverse set of coalitions of people who care. One \nbrief from a bipartisan group of 107 Members of Congress said you \nshould uphold the law that Congress passed that protects people's \nfreedom of religion--not to mention the Constitution itself--where \nfreedom of religion is the first freedom mentioned and the first \nsentence in the First Amendment to the Constitution. It is important in \nour history of who we are. Twenty-one states have joined this case on \nbehalf of these companies. Doctors' and women's organizations have \nfiled briefs advocating that the Court respect the religious rights of \ncompanies. Protestant and Catholic theologians have filed briefs, as \nhave the Rabbinical Council of America, the U.S. Conference of Catholic \nBishops, the International Society of Krishna Consciousness, Crescent \nFoods, a halal food company, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day \nSaints, and the Coalition of Christian Colleges and Universities. All \nhave a broad diversity of religious views, but they agree on one thing: \nThis is a principal tenet of who we are.\n  President Jefferson said in a letter he wrote to the New London \nMethodists in 1809 that of all the rights we hold, we should hold the \nright of conscience most dear. Once the government can start telling \nyou what to believe and how you apply what you believe, we have given \nup the most fundamental of all freedoms.\n  Congress has a long tradition of protecting religious liberty. The \nCongress enacted the Religious Freedom Restoration Act to ensure broad \nprotection of religious liberty. The HHS regulations do not satisfy the \nhigh bar set by that act. That is a position that I hope the Court \nupholds. The mandate is an enormous government overreach, and it \nviolates Americans' constitutional rights.\n  While this mandate severely fines religious individuals, it exempts \nplenty of other nonreligious institutions. The administration has \nalready exempted 100 million employees from the mandate for commercial \nor political reasons. People should also not be forced to give up their \nbusiness to hold on to their faith or to give up their faith to hold on \nto their business. These family businesses are not publicly traded \ncorporations.\n  I am not a lawyer, but I am told on the best authority there is not \none court case that diminishes the rights of these kinds of \ncorporations. In fact, numerous Federal courts have upheld the ability \nof for-profit corporations to bring racial discrimination cases. So you \ncould have a racial profile as a corporation, but you couldn't have a \nreligious profile as a corporation. This is an untenable position for \nthe government to take.\n  The Supreme Court has heard this case today. I join my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle and in both Chambers to urge the Court to \npreserve the fundamental religious freedoms that Americans have \nenjoyed, the Constitution demands, that laws passed overwhelmingly by \nthe Congress and signed by the President in 1993 continue to be the \nstandard that is applied to our right of conscience, our right of \nbelief, of what we want to believe, must believe, and do believe.\n  I am pleased to be joined by my colleagues to talk about this very \nsame topic.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank Senator Blunt. I did not get to hear all of \nSenator Inhofe's comments, but as an Oklahoman I think we couldn't have \na finer company or a finer corporate citizen than the Green family, in \nterms of their chains of stores around the country and what they have \ndone. The reason they are successful is because they actually care, \nnurture, and support every one of their employees.\n  They work on principles that they truly believe in, and it has really \nbeen the key to their success. They are never open on the sabbath. They \nbelieve in paying somebody a livable wage. They are big in the \ncommunity. As a matter of fact, they are one of the largest \ncontributors to organizations that are funded in the charitable realm. \nThey go down deep to actually help people. They come with pure motives.\n  The Senator from Missouri mentioned what Thomas Jefferson said in \n1809:\n\n       No provision in our Constitution ought to be dearer to man \n     than that which protects the rights of conscience against the \n     enterprises of civil authority.\n\n  I want you to listen to that for a minute. Jefferson, one of the \nauthors of the rules of the Senate, one of the key Framers of the very \nConstitution that we live under, recognized that it is most important \nto protect this conscience of the Green family to do what they think, \naccording to their faith, is the right thing to do.\n  My colleague referenced the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Why \nwas that necessary? Because we saw civil government starting to impede \ninto an arena that Thomas Jefferson warned about. That is why it was \npassed, that is why it was signed, and that is why it is the law of the \nland. This is going to be a seminal case, and it has nothing to do with \nbirth control. Hobby Lobby pays for birth control. It always has and \nalways will. It has to do with can we allow the civil government to \nimpede to such a level, as my colleague from Missouri said, that the \ngovernment can now tell you what your values are, what you have to \nthink, and how you have to act, on the basis of what the government \nsays your values are.\n  As an obstetrician who has delivered more than 4,000 children, as \nsomebody who has cared for every complication of pregnancy, as somebody \nwho believes in the value of newly created human life, all the Greens \nare saying is: We really shouldn't have to pay our money to abort a \nbaby when we find it unconscionable to take innocent human life. It \ndoesn't mean that people that work for them cannot get an abortion. It \njust says they don't want to violate their own conscience by supplying \nit.\n  The other issue that ought to be evident to everybody is that plan B \nis over the counter. It is not even part of your health care. You can \ngo buy it. As a matter of fact, there is not even an age limit on it \nnow. A 12-year-old can go buy it over the counter. So it is not about \nlimiting abortion; it is about the conscience of a very successful \ncompany. The reason they are successful is they follow the teachings of \ntheir faith. Now we have government in a position where they are going \nto tell them what their faith is.\n  Let me reiterate what Jefferson said:\n\n       No provision in our Constitution ought to be dearer to man \n     than that which protects the rights of conscience against the \n     enterprises of civil authority.\n\n  These are deeply felt and held beliefs based on their faith.\n  The other side of this is we see their deeply held beliefs and how \nthey have rescued universities, how they have come to the aid of food \npantries, how they have actually been active in the community. \nEverywhere they are involved they are out following the same deeply \nheld beliefs of helping the poor and indigent, giving people an \nopportunity through a college education that they never would have had, \ngiving people a day of rest.\n  Their stores are not open late. Their employees get to go home. They \ncould sell more products if they were open later. They could sell more \nproduct if they were open on Sunday. They choose not to because they \nthink the principles under which they operate their business based on \ntheir faith have created an environment which allows everybody who \nworks for them to succeed. If you go through their businesses, if you \ngo through their warehouses, and if you go to their stores, what you \nsee is a smile on almost everybody's face. Why? Because people enjoy \nworking there, because they are treated as human beings. They are \nlifted up. They are given opportunity. They are given the very things \nthat we all want for our neighbors and for ourselves.\n  My hope is that the Constitution will be looked at as the Supreme \nCourt considers this case and that the Religious Freedom Restoration \nAct will be looked at as the Supreme Court considers this case.\n\n[[Page S1710]]\n\n  The Affordable Care Act is not affordable; it is unaffordable. For \nAmericans it has a $2 trillion cost over the next 10 years. It is a \ndisaster in terms of how it has been implemented. It is going to be a \ndisaster in terms of quality care and delayed care because of the \nincreased deductibles that almost everybody is facing. We shouldn't let \nit be a disaster in terms of destroying businesses.\n  We ought to embrace this family and their business for what they have \ndone. They have taken advantage of the American enterprise system in a \nway that has built tremendous success, that has benefited not just the \nGreen family but hundreds of thousands of people through their \ngenerosity, and their capability to empower people to get ahead.\n  I am glad to see my colleague, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I would ask for an additional 5 minutes \nfor the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I come to the floor today to talk about a very important case that \nthe U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments on this morning that goes to the \nvery core of our Nation's foundation--the future of religious freedom \nin the United States.\n  As Americans we cherish our religious liberty. It lies at the heart \nof who we are as a people, and we know we must always guard against \nthreats to our religious freedom enshrined in the First Amendment of \nthe Constitution. That is why I am joining my colleagues Senator Blunt \nand Senator Coburn on the floor today and speaking in support of the \nconstitutional rights that all Americans have under the First \nAmendment, which guarantees the right of freedom of conscience and \nreligious liberty.\n\n  Here is what is at stake. Americans should not be forced to give up \ntheir religious freedom or their rights of conscience simply because \nthey want to open a family business. American families should not be \nforced into choosing between their family business and complying with \nunlawful government mandates that infringe on the First Amendment to \nthe Constitution, and that is why this case, which is being heard today \nby our Supreme Court, is so important to the American people.\n  A provision of President Obama's health care law includes a mandate \nthat threatens penalties on private organizations unless they \ninvoluntary agree to violate their deeply held religious beliefs. This \nis anathema to the First Amendment to our Constitution. If religious \ninstitutions and faith-based organizations are forced to comply with \ngovernment mandates that violate the core principles of their faith, \nthat is a violation of the First Amendment to the Constitution, and it \nis contrary to what we stand for as Americans.\n  I have heard from people in my State who are deeply concerned about \nthis mandate and the issue that is being considered by the Supreme \nCourt today. They are simply asking to have the same conscience rights \nthey had before the President's health care law was passed--the same \nconscience rights that are enshrined in our Constitution that protect \nall Americans regardless of what our faith is and regardless of our \nbackground.\n  This is a fundamental matter of religious freedom and the proper role \nof our government. It is about who we are as Americans. If the \ngovernment, through mandates, can take away our conscience rights, what \ndoes that say about other rights we have under our Constitution?\n  This debate comes down to the legacy left behind by our Founding \nFathers and over 200 years of American history. We have a choice \nbetween being responsible stewards of this legacy or allowing the \nFederal Government to interfere with religious life in an unprecedented \nway.\n  Protecting religious freedom and conscience rights in the past has \nbeen a bipartisan issue. Congress has a long history of protecting \nreligious liberty. I heard my colleague talk about the Religious \nFreedom Restoration Act that was signed into law by President Clinton \nto ensure that the government should be held to a very high level of \nproof before it interferes with someone's free exercise of religion. \nThat is what is at stake in the Supreme Court decision and the mandates \nthat are being rendered by the health care law against private \ncompanies such as Hobby Lobby and others.\n  This is what is at stake: Under the President's health care law, \ncompanies such as Hobby Lobby and Conestoga--and we are proud to have a \nHobby Lobby in the State of New Hampshire--that want to help and \nprovide health care coverage for their employees could be forced to pay \nover $36,000 per employee unless they provide drugs and devices that \nviolate their religious beliefs and conscience rights. Why should they \nbe forced into this position? If the Federal Government is able to \nviolate the First Amendment in this way, what is to stop other \nfundamental rights from being violated?\n  Protecting religious freedom was once an issue that bound Americans \ntogether. I believe this effort, which is so fundamental to our \nnational character, must bring us together once more.\n  I look forward to seeing the Supreme Court's decision on this issue, \nbut this is a case that never should have been filed. The Affordable \nCare Act, or ObamaCare, should have never violated the rights of \nconscience of these companies or of religious organizations, and it is \ntime to turn this around. I look forward to the Supreme Court \nvindicating their rights under the First Amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution, which should have been respected by this administration, \nbut that is why we have a Supreme Court. I look forward to the Supreme \nCourt decision, which I hope will uphold the First Amendment rights of \nthe parties to this litigation and to all Americans.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/25/senate-section/article/S1710-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Washington Landslide\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I wish to take a moment to address an \nissue that has really been on the hearts and minds of those back home \nin my home State of Washington.\n  On Saturday, as I am sure many of my colleagues heard, the town of \nOso, WA--a small, tightly knit town alongside the Stillaguamish River--\nwas directly hit by a massive landslide. That landslide cut off the \ntown of Darrington, which is just a few miles down State Road 530. \nHouses over a square mile were simply swept away. We already know we \nhave lost several people, and yesterday we learned there could be well \nmore than 100 who are still missing. So right now in Washington State \nthere are dozens of families who simply don't know if their loved ones \nare even still alive.\n  Even though Oso and Darrington are 2,300 miles away from the Nation's \nCapital, our hearts and prayers are with them and their families. I \nwant them to know that in the coming days and weeks and months--and \neven years, if that is what it takes--all of us will stand with the \npeople of Oso and\n\n[[Page S1711]]\n\nDarrington and provide any resources they need to recover and rebuild \nand that they have the thoughts and prayers of everyone in this \ncountry, from their Washington to this one.\n\n\n                          Affordable Care Act\n\n  Let me change gears a bit and address one of the most significant \npieces of legislation for women in my lifetime--the Affordable Care \nAct.\n  On Sunday this law celebrated its fourth anniversary, serving as a \nvery stark reminder of where our Nation's health care system was just 4 \nyears ago. Four years ago our health insurance companies could deny \nwomen care due to so-called preexisting conditions such as pregnancy or \nbeing a victim of domestic violence. Four years ago women were \npermitted to be legally discriminated against when it came to insurance \npremiums and often were paying more for coverage than men. Four years \nago women did not have access to the full range of recommended \npreventive care, such as mammograms or prenatal screenings and much \nmore. Four years ago insurance companies had all the leverage and all \nthe power, and too often it was women who paid the price.\n  Now, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, for the first time women--not \ntheir insurance companies or their employers--are fully in charge of \ntheir own health care. In fact, women make up over half of the 5 \nmillion people who have already signed up for coverage in the new \nmarketplace, and over 47 million women have already gained guaranteed \naccess to preventive health services thanks to the Affordable Care Act.\n  That is why I feel so strongly that we cannot go back to the way \nthings were. While we can never stop working to make improvements, we \nowe it to the women of America to make progress and to move forward and \nnot allow the clock to be rolled back on their health care needs.\n  Unfortunately, there are efforts underway all across the country--\nincluding here today in our Nation's Capital--to severely undermine a \nwoman's access to some of those most critical and lifesaving services \nthat are provided under the Affordable Care Act. No provision of this \nlaw has faced quite as many attacks as the idea of providing \naffordable, quality reproductive health services to the women of \nAmerica.\n  For this reason I was very proud to lead Members of my caucus in \nfiling an amicus brief with the Supreme Court in the two cases being \nconsidered there today. Those cases were brought by CEOs who want to \ntake away their employees' right to insurance coverage for birth \ncontrol, which is guaranteed under the Affordable Care Act.\n  As was the case in the many attempts before this case, there are \nthose out there who would like the American public to believe this \nconversation is anything but an attack on women's health care. To them, \nit is a debate about freedom--except, of course, freedom for women's \naccess to care. It is no different than when we are told that attacks \non abortion rights somehow are not an infringement on a woman's right \nto choose but it is somehow about religion or States rights; or when we \nare told that restricting emergency contraception isn't about limiting \nwomen's ability to make their own family planning decisions, it is \nsomehow about protecting pharmacists; or just like last week when an \nAlaska State senator proposed placing State-funded pregnancy tests in \nbars but ruled out providing contraception because ``birth control is \nfor people who don't necessarily want to act responsibly.''\n  The truth is that this is about contraception. This is an attempt to \nlimit a woman's ability to access care. This is about women. Allowing a \nwoman's boss to call the shots about her access to birth control should \nbe inconceivable to all Americans in this day and age. It takes us back \nto a place in history when women had no voice and no choice.\n  In fact, contraception was included as a required preventive service \nin the Affordable Care Act on the recommendation of the independent, \nnonprofit Institute of Medicine and other medical experts because it is \nessential to the health of women and families. After many years of \nresearch, we know that ensuring access to effective birth control has a \ndirect impact on improving the lives of women and families in America. \nWe have been able to directly link it to declines in maternal and \ninfant mortality, reduced risk of ovarian cancer, better overall health \ncare outcomes for women, and far fewer unintended pregnancies and \nabortions, which is a goal we all share.\n  What is at stake in this case before the Supreme Court is whether a \nCEO's personal beliefs can trump a woman's right to access free or low-\ncost contraception under the Affordable Care Act.\n  I strongly believe every American deserves to have access to high-\nquality health care coverage regardless of where they work or where \nthey live, and each of us should have the right to make our own medical \nand religious decisions without being dictated to or limited by our \nemployers. Contraceptive coverage is supported by the vast majority of \nAmericans, who understand how important it is for women and families.\n  In weighing this case, my hope is the Court realizes that women \nworking for private companies should be afforded the same access to \nmedical care regardless of who signs their paycheck. We can't allow \nfor-profit, secular corporations or their shareholders to deny female \nemployees access to comprehensive women's health care under the guise \nof a religious exemption. It is as if we are saying that because \nsomeone is a CEO or a shareholder in a corporation, their rights are \nmore important than the employees who happen to be women.\n  As I sat inside that Supreme Court chamber this morning listening to \nthe arguments being made on both sides, I couldn't help but think: If \nthese CEOs are allowed to evade this law, what would happen to the \nother legal protections for employees? Could a boss decide not to cover \nHIV treatment? Could an employer opt out of having to comply with \nantidiscrimination laws? Corporations should not be able to use \nreligion as a license to discriminate.\n  I am proud to be joined in filing the brief by 18 other Senators who \nwere in office when Congress enacted the religious protections through \nthe Religious Freedom Restoration Act in 1993 and again when we made \naccess to women's health care available through the Affordable Care Act \nin 2010. We are Senators who know that Congress did not intend for a \ncorporation or its shareholders to restrict a woman's access to \npreventive health care. We all know that improving access to birth \ncontrol is good health policy and good economic policy. We know it will \nmean healthier women, healthier children, healthier families, and a \nhealthier America. And we all know it will save money for businesses \nand consumers.\n  I know many of our colleagues believe that repealing the Affordable \nCare Act and access to reproductive health services is somehow a \npolitical winner for them. But the truth is that this law and these \nprovisions are winners for women, for men, for children, and for our \nhealth care system overall. So I am very proud to stand with my \ncolleagues who are committed to making sure the benefits of this law do \nnot get taken away from the women of America, because politicians and \nideology should not matter when it comes to making sure women get the \ncare they need at a cost they can afford.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. I wish to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Harpool Nomination\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Madam President, I rise to urge my colleagues to vote \nthis afternoon--hopefully this afternoon or, if not this afternoon, \ntomorrow--for a terrific man to be a judge in the Western District of \nthe Federal District Court in Missouri.\n  As an old lawyer--too old--I find myself amazed that I have the \nopportunity to speak to the Senate about someone I have known a long \ntime, about a lawyer I know very well. This is a man whose name is Doug \nHarpool. He is from Springfield, MO.\n\n[[Page S1712]]\n\n  Back in the early 1980s he and I arrived as very young lawyers in the \nMissouri House of Representatives. I had the opportunity to get to know \nhim well--his character, his integrity, his work ethic. I watched him, \nagainst tremendous odds and, frankly, some inappropriate pressure, \nfight for a first major attempt at ethics reform in the Missouri \nLegislature. His journey was sometimes a very lonely journey, but he \nhad a pit bull kind of mentality about going after this important \ntopic, believing that if a person is in public service, a person's \nstandards must be high; believing that if one chooses--many times at \nless compensation--a path in the public arena, one has a certain duty \nto conduct oneself with integrity and the kind of character that could \nmake others proud of their representation.\n  After his time in the Missouri Legislature, he went on to be a \nlawyer's lawyer. I don't mean the kind who says ``I am a litigator'' \nand never goes near a courtroom, and I don't mean the kind who says ``I \nhandle serious cases'' and does nothing but shuffle paper, but, rather, \na real litigant--somebody who is in the courtroom, by the way, on both \nsides of the table. This is somebody who helped clients who were suing \npeople and helped people who were being sued.\n  He has worked with great regard as a practicing attorney now for many \nyears. There is nothing better than being respected by one's peers, \nespecially those whom one has battled because when we battle with \nsomeone, we see it all. We see what kind of a person we are up against \nand what tactics the other person is willing to use. We see a person's \nraw intellect and their ability to think on their feet. So when I \nstarted hearing from so many lawyers who were Doug Harpool's colleagues \nwhat a terrific choice he would be, I knew that what I believed about \nhim was shared by so many others.\n  He will never be a judge who gets ``robitis.'' That is a serious \ndisease which sometimes strikes Federal judges more often than other \nkinds because they are appointed for life. Practicing lawyers talk \nabout judges who have robitis, which is a malaise that comes upon a \njudge who all of a sudden removes himself from the common people and \nthat somehow makes him or her above the struggles lawyers are having, \nmakes them above the problems clients are presenting in their \ncourtroom. This is a grounded man. This is a man who will understand \nwhat it is like to litigate a case, why his judgments must be fair and \nalso speedy, why he owes it to the litigants to actually read their \nbriefs--not assign it to someone else, to thumb through and then make a \ndecision based on a predetermined notion he might have.\n\n  This is someone who will take this work with the degree of \nseriousness it deserves and with the amount of compassion we all should \ndemand.\n  I am so proud to be here urging his confirmation. I am confident he \nwill be confirmed by a wide margin. But I am even more confident he \nwill be the kind of Federal judge who will make me proud and all of \nMissouri proud for as long as he chooses to sit on the bench.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I rise today to speak to the \nimportance of passing the pending legislation to support the people of \nUkraine in maintaining their independence at this very challenging \ntime.\n  Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea marks the first time one \nEuropean nation has seized territory from another since the end of \nWorld War II. Now President Putin is continuing his military buildup \nalong Ukraine's eastern border, and Russia's actions in the Crimea fly \nin the face of the basic principles of sovereignty that have \nunderpinned security in Europe and around the world for decades. The \nUnited States and the international community must stand with Ukraine \nand reaffirm our commitment to Ukraine's independence and territorial \nintegrity.\n  This moment is a real test for the international community. It tests \nwhether the nations of the world can respond in a unified way to \nsupport Ukraine and to check Russia. It will also test whether we in \nCongress can overcome political differences and leave partisanship at \nthe water's edge.\n  I believe we can and that we will rise to the occasion. We had a very \ngood vote last night and hopefully that will continue as we take up the \npending legislation.\n  First, we should provide Ukraine with much needed economic \nassistance. That is why I strongly support the legislation that is \ncurrently before us. It authorizes the administration to extend $1 \nbillion in loan guarantees to Ukraine.\n  Second, Congress needs to continue to push the administration to \nimpose costs on Russia for its illegal and escalating actions.\n  I applaud yesterday's decision by the G7 nations to cancel their \nparticipation in the upcoming Sochi summit, to suspend Russia's \nparticipation, and to convene energy ministers for talks to strengthen \nour collective energy security.\n  The latest round of U.S. and EU sanctions are another very important \nstep. However, Congress must continue to explore options for additional \nbipartisan sanctions legislation. In addition, the administration \nshould be aggressive in responding to Russian provocations using the \nauthorities we give them.\n  Third, we need to demonstrate support for our other allies and \npartners in the region who are threatened by Russia's expansionist \nagenda.\n  NATO has already taken some commendable actions in the past week. \nThey have deployed additional aircraft and early warning systems, and \nwe are reinforcing our commitment to Poland and our Baltic partners.\n  This is a significant moment for Ukraine, for Europe, and for the \nUnited States. It is imperative that we do our part to help the people \nof Ukraine secure the bright independent future they deserve. The \npeople of Ukraine and of Ukrainian descent--whether they be in Kiev or \nin Manchester, NH--are watching and counting on our support.\n  Our European allies are watching and are counting on our continued \nleadership. And maybe most important, Vladimir Putin is watching and \ncounting on our acquiescence.\n  So let us be committed and resolute. Let us stand together in support \nof the people of Ukraine. And let us start by passing this important \nlegislation.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Unemployment Insurance\n\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, the Senate needs to do everything it can \nto help create jobs, improve our economy, and address the basic needs \nof the average American. Unfortunately, many efforts to make meaningful \nprogress on these issues have been thwarted in the last 2 months. \nSpecifically, for the last 87 days, emergency assistance for job \nseekers has been blocked by gridlock.\n  Despite the best efforts of several of my colleagues, including my \ncolleague and friend Senator Dean Heller of Nevada, today over 2.2 \nmillion Americans are being denied vital assistance in what remains a \nvery difficult economy, but I am pleased to say that a group of five \nRepublicans and five Democrats have reached a principled compromise to \nend this impasse and help get people back on their feet.\n  Indeed, I along with Senators Heller, Merkley, Collins, Booker, \nPortman, Brown, Murkowski, Durbin, and Kirk have introduced a bill to \ncontinue emergency unemployment insurance for 5 months retroactive from \nDecember 28.\n  As I have advocated, this bill contains no cuts to the weeks of \nbenefits available or the structure of the tiers of benefits, nor does \nit include other problematic policy changes. It is, however, fully paid \nfor and includes some positive reforms that better align the \nunemployment insurance and workforce systems to help get people back to \nwork sooner.\n\n[[Page S1713]]\n\n  It also includes language my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle sought--and that was previously passed in the Senate 100 to 0--\nwhich would prohibit millionaires from receiving Federal emergency \nbenefits.\n  I wish to thank Senator Heller for his commitment to this issue, for \nhis steadfastness, and for his recognizing that this should not be a \npartisan issue. He has been an extremely thoughtful, collaborative, and \nconstructive colleague in trying to bring this issue to the floor.\n  I also wish to particularly thank Senators Collins, Murkowski, \nPortman, and Kirk because they also have been extremely thoughtful, \ntireless, and resolute in their efforts to find a pathway forward. They \nhave all brought constructive ideas to the table. We have been able to \ncraft a principled compromise that will provide aid to an estimated 2.7 \nmillion Americans, including 12,000 Rhode Islanders.\n  This is a vital lifeline that can mean the difference between making \na rent payment, putting enough food on the table, and keeping the heat \non as our constituents search for work in an economy where there are \nstill more than two job seekers for every opening and in fact in some \nplaces three job seekers for every opening.\n  I have been working since last year to extend these benefits. Every \nday that passes is another day that hard-working Americans do not have \nthe same type of aid as those who were unemployed and looking for work \nlast year had. I am glad we have reached a principled bipartisan \ncompromise. It deserves to move forward quickly so we can provide much \nneeded relief to our constituents and can strengthen our economy.\n  I understand there have been administrative concerns raised about \nthis bill by the National Association of State Workforce Agencies, \nwhich Speaker Boehner appears to be using as a reason to not take up \nthis bipartisan compromise. Frankly, administrative challenges should \nnot be a reason to deny aid to working Americans who have lost their \njobs through no fault of their own and are out there hitting the \npavement searching for work in a challenging economy.\n  The Secretary of Labor has sent Congress a letter addressing all of \nthe concerns raised by the national group. This letter notes the \nSecretary of Labor is ``confident that there are workable solutions for \nall the concerns raised by NASWA. From the Great Recession to the \npresent, the Congress has worked in a bipartisan fashion to enact \ntwelve different expansions or extensions to the EUC program. A number \nof extensions included changes to the program that were as or more \ncomplex than those included in the current bill. The Department of \nLabor has consistently worked with states to implement these extensions \nin an effective, collaborative and prompt fashion, and will do so \nagain.''\n  Indeed, the States have implemented benefits retroactively several \nweeks after the program has expired previously. I would like to add \nthat my colleagues who have joined as cosponsors of this bill, out of \nan abundance of caution and a desire to allay these administrative \nconcerns, have included clarifying language to ensure that \nadministrative funding constraints related to the prohibition on \nmillionaires receiving emergency unemployment insurance could not be \nread in an overly broad fashion, so that it will make this bill \nadministratively easier to implement.\n  I look forward to debating this bill later this week. I am hopeful \nthat with this strong bipartisan showing, we can convince our \ncolleagues on the other side of the Capitol that this is the right \nthing to do for the economy and for working Americans who lost their \njob through no fault of their own and who are searching for work.\n  Again, I am delighted to join Senator Heller in this effort and our \nother Republican cosponsors. They have been extraordinarily thoughtful, \nconstructive, and collaborative. They have served not only their \nconstituents but this Senate and this country with great and deeply \nappreciated effort.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. HELLER. Madam President, I would like to begin by thanking my \nfriend from Rhode Island for his continued work to help the American \npeople by temporarily extending unemployment insurance benefits. This \nis something he and I have been working on together since this past \nDecember. I am pleased to have finally reached a bipartisan agreement \nthat can pass this Chamber.\n  I admire my colleague's dedication and am greatly pleased that we are \nhere this week to support our efforts to help keep American families on \ntheir feet during this tough economy. I also wish to thank Senators \nCollins, Portman, Murkowski, and Kirk for their continued willingness \nto come to the table to craft a bill that can garner enough support to \npass in this Chamber.\n  I would also like to recognize some of my other colleagues: Senator \nCoats, Senator Ayotte, who though not cosponsors on this bill today \nwere instrumental in these negotiations from the beginning. I \nunderstand their concerns and I also share their desire to see \nadditional reforms to these programs.\n  Regardless, I am grateful for their contribution over the past few \nmonths. I would also like to thank Senator Isakson and Senator Hoeven \nfor their input and am appreciative of their efforts throughout the \nprocess. Though it has not always been easy, this process has truly \nbeen a collaborative effort at every level.\n  Fortunately, I believe we have reached a compromise that will garner \nenough support in the Senate to help 1.3 million unemployed Americans \nget back on their feet as they look for work in the toughest job market \nin decades.\n  This bill is a responsible, fully paid for, temporary extension of \nunemployment insurance benefits that expired in December. It addresses \nconcerns that any further extension ought to be paid for. As our \neconomy recovers and people find new jobs, the demand for social safety \nnet programs should naturally diminish, but States such as Nevada, \nRhode Island, and many others still have long economic recoveries ahead \nof them.\n  I know some may feel there is little reason to extend these benefits, \nespecially since they were allowed to expire at the end of last \nDecember, but the fact remains that too many Americans are out of work \nbut want to return to the workforce. I have heard from many Nevada job \nseekers who in addition to trying to find a job are also struggling to \nput food on the table for their families, pay their rent or mortgage, \nand are running out of ways to make ends meet. Extending these benefits \nwill help these families before their situation goes from bad to worse.\n  My colleagues and I have worked together to come to a reasonable \nbipartisan agreement on both policy and pay-fors. I think we would all \nagree there are certain provisions that I think each side would prefer \nto see included in this bill, such as additional reforms, but this is \nthe nature of compromise.\n  We also recognize the challenge of dealing with a patchwork of State \nUI systems of varying capabilities, but I believe we are all open to \nfinding ways to ensure that this extension is implemented as \nefficiently as possible. This task may not be easy, but I firmly \nbelieve it is worth doing.\n  Again, thanks to all of my colleagues, especially my colleague from \nRhode Island who has been involved in this process. I look forward to \nmoving to this bill very soon and am hopeful Congress can finally \nresolve this matter as soon as possible to help restore some stability \nfor the millions of unemployed Americans looking to get back to work.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise to express my robust concern \nabout Russia's actions and the continuing escalation of tensions in \nCentral and Eastern Europe. Even with Ukrainian troops leaving Crimea, \nRussia continues to extort Ukraine, disavowing an agreement on gas \nprices that was part of a bilateral agreement\n\n[[Page S1714]]\n\nallowing Russia to lease the Black Sea port in Crimea for its fleet. \nRussia is now arguing it no longer has to provide the discounted gas--\nbecause it illegally seized the port--but that it also must be paid \nback $11 billion for prior discounts.\n  At the same time Russia has amassed more than 100,000 troops at \nUkraine's border, in addition to 23,000 troops that are in Crimea, \nmaking clear the threat of an outright invasion of Ukraine and possibly \na portion of Moldova. Putin is watching to see what we will do, to see \nif we have the resolve to act or if he, in essence, gets the green \nlight to take the next step.\n  I believe we need to act now. Although I also believe our response to \nRussia's annexation of Crimea should include the International Monetary \nFund reforms that passed in a bipartisan way out of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee and that obviously received a rather strong \nprocedural vote yesterday in the Senate--and these are critical to \nstrengthening the assistance package for Ukraine and to strengthen U.S. \nglobal leadership--I recognize our ability to move this package with \nthose reforms in it at this point is unlikely.\n  The House Republican leadership has proven itself intransigent on IMF \nreform, and we all know why. Trying to link support for IMF reforms to \nC-4 political committees that may have violated campaign finance laws \nand may involve individuals who illegally used them to influence \nFederal elections is pretty outrageous. I cannot believe the House \nleadership will not put national security interests above their \npartisan political interest but, obviously, politics clearly don't stop \nat the water's edge on this issue.\n  So while I am not happy about it, I believe we need to move forward \non a bill today that sends the necessary message of support to Ukraine \nand resolve to Russia. But as we take that step, let us realize it is \nthe IMF that is leading the effort to stabilize Ukraine's fragile \neconomy. Congressional ratification of the 2010 IMF reforms would \nincrease IMF emergency funding to Ukraine by up to 60 percent and \nprovide an additional $6 billion for longer term support, setting an \nimportant marker for other donors, such as the EU and the World Bank.\n  Let us be clear about what keeping the IMF provisions would have \ndone. The IMF is strengthened at no cost to U.S. finances or influence. \nThe United States retains its executive board seat and the sole veto \npower at no net cost because the $63 billion increase in the U.S. quota \nis totally offset by an equivalent decrease to a separate emergency \nfacility. However, other countries would put in new money, increasing \nthe IMF's lending power.\n  The fact is this would be a pure win for the United States. We would \nfully have paid for the $315 million budget impact of the bill with \nreal cuts and from funds that were underperforming or no longer needed. \nGiven that the IMF helps to stabilize countries, often an ingredient \nprecluding future need for military action, the minor cost would have \nbeen paid back many times over. And we will have another crisis in the \nfuture, in which the IMF will be critical to whether that crisis can be \ndiffused and solved.\n  I repeat what I have said before. This should not be a partisan \nissue. Presidents Reagan, Clinton, and both Presidents Bush backed \nlegislation to increase IMF resources. Ronald Reagan called the \nInternational Monetary Fund ``the linchpin of the international \nfinancial system.''\n  In a letter to the House and Senate leadership last week, members of \nthe Bretton Woods Committee, the original entity that created some of \nthe international organizations that have created global stability, \nsuch as the IMF, wrote that ``Implementing the IMF quota reforms . . . \nbolsters our leadership in the fund'' . . . and provides the United \nStates with ``leverage to continue to preserve our national security \nand economic interests abroad.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe letter I am referring to.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                  The Bretton Woods Committee,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. John Boehner,\n     Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid, Speaker Boehner, Minority Leader \n     McConnell and Minority Leader Pelosi: We write to urge \n     Congress to maintain strong U.S. leadership in the \n     International Monetary Fund (IMF) by enacting IMF quota \n     reform legislation. For over 60 years, the IMF has been a \n     principal tool for advancing U.S. national security and \n     economic interests globally.\n       The immediate importance of a strong IMF role for countries \n     in crisis is apparent now in Ukraine, which seeks help from \n     the U.S. and IMF to maintain its independence and economic \n     health, and to reduce its energy dependence on Russia. \n     Implementation of IMF quota reform would mean Ukraine would \n     be able to borrow 60% more in rapid IMF financing (from $1B \n     to $1.6B) than is possible today. Coupled with the U.S. $1 \n     billion in new loan guarantees for Ukraine currently being \n     considered by the Congress, Ukraine would have a total of \n     $2.6 billion in emergency resources to draw upon to stabilize \n     its economy. This enhances the geopolitical position of \n     Ukraine's government in the current crisis with Russia.\n       The IMF doesn't always get it right but it has been doing \n     important work in countries for decades to stabilize their \n     financial situation and put them on a path toward economic \n     growth for decades. This clearly serves our interests.\n\n\n                 Advancing National Security Interests\n\n       The IMF is often the first responder of choice for the \n     United States and our allies, to help countries prevent or \n     manage financial crises before they destabilize an economy \n     and give rise to conditions of economic stagnation, poverty, \n     and political instability, which can embolden terrorism. When \n     Russia went to war with Georgia in 2008, the U.S.-backed IMF \n     $750 million emergency loan to Georgia countered the early \n     financial fallout and kept our friend on a path of market-\n     friendly economic policies. It was the IMF that stepped in to \n     provide financial assistance to the former Eastern European \n     countries after the fall of the Berlin Wall. U.S.-supported \n     IMF loans helped stabilize Pakistan after 9/11, and have \n     reinforced fragile economies such as Jordan, Tunisia and \n     Morocco to help ensure our partners can focus on counter-\n     terrorism cooperation and combating radical extremism.\n\n\n                   Promoting U.S. Economic Interests\n\n       In its role to promote the stability of the international \n     monetary and financial system, the IMF consistently promotes \n     a growth-oriented agenda based on open markets and strong \n     macroeconomic and structural policies. IMF support to the \n     Euro Area during the recent financial crisis lessened the \n     global fallout and financial instability of highly \n     interconnected economies, and forced long-needed structural \n     reforms to begin to take place. The IMF was first responder \n     to the Asian crisis in the late 1990s, and helped restore \n     growth to Asian economies and create robust export markets \n     for U.S. businesses, which supports American jobs.\n       Implementing the IMF quota reforms negotiated by the United \n     States in 2010 bolsters our leadership in the Fund without \n     increasing the overall U.S. financial commitment. It requires \n     other countries to make additional financial commitments, \n     effectively providing a larger and more stable source of \n     financing that the U.S.--as the largest shareholder and only \n     country with veto power over major IMF decisions--can \n     leverage to continue to preserve our national security and \n     economic interests abroad. A stronger IMF keeps emerging \n     economies secured in the system we designed without \n     sacrificing any of our influence.\n       We would therefore urge the Congress to continue its \n     longstanding, bipartisan support of the International \n     Monetary Fund for our national self-interest and for the good \n     of the global system.\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Let me cite the names of some of the folks who signed \nthat letter: Madeleine Albright, former Secretary James Baker, Zbigniew \nBrzezinski, William Cohen, Stephen Hadley, Henry Kissinger, Tom Ridge, \nCondoleezza Rice, Clayton Yeutter, Robert Zoellick, Lee Hamilton, Brent \nScowcroft, Frank Carlucci, Robert Rubin, Larry Summers, John Snow, and \nHenry Paulson. This is a bipartisan list of ``Who's Who'' in foreign \npolicy, all saying this is critical to do.\n  Let me be very clear. Opponents have argued that IMF reforms provide \nno added relief to Ukraine, so it is superfluous to this bill. That \nargument is patently false. The 2010 IMF reforms strengthen the IMF. \nThat is why they were done. And as it relates to Ukraine, by increasing \nUkraine's quota, the reforms increase available short-term lending from \n$1 billion to $1.6 billion, and longer term resources the IMF can \nleverage for Ukraine by up to $6 billion. It also strengthens our \nability to shape an IMF support package for Ukraine.\n  Critics say IMF reforms undermine U.S. influence and increase \nRussia's influence in the IMF. They are dead\n\n[[Page S1715]]\n\nwrong again. We remain the largest IMF shareholder even after reform, \nwe are guaranteed our executive board seat, and we will continue as the \nonly country--the only country--with veto power over major IMF \ndecisions.\n  Meanwhile, the reforms rationalize the voting structure of the IMF to \nincrease buy-in of dynamic emerging economies in a way that ensures \ncontinued U.S. leadership in a more relevant international institution. \nOn the other side, the reforms matter little to Russia, which already \nhas a board seat.\n  Opponents say IMF reforms cost American taxpayers billions and put \ntaxpayer money at risk. Again, wrong. There is no cost to American \ntaxpayers. The reforms included in the Senate Ukraine bill preserve \nU.S. leadership, the veto position in the IMF, without increasing--\nwithout increasing--our financial commitment to the IMF. The IMF is the \nmost solvent financial institution in the world, and the risk of IMF \ndefault is de minimis.\n  We would have paid for all of this budget impact through real cuts, \nas my colleague and ranking member on the committee Bob Corker asked. \nWe came together and we figured it out. The appropriators helped us \ndetermine underperforming funds, programs from which we could take \nthese funds, and we ultimately came to a very successful conclusion.\n  I regret the failure to strengthen the IMF to support Ukraine and \nother unforeseen crises around the world will endanger the system we \nhave so painstakingly built. And it shouldn't need arguing that \nfragmentation of global economic governance is not in our national \ninterest. The fact is IMF reform, combined with the aid package for \nUkraine, would send a clear and unambiguous message to the world that \nthe annexation of Crimea will not stand.\n  But I understand this institution and our political realities, so I \nhave come to the floor to ask that we come together to at least send \nour message of support to Ukraine and another message to Putin. We \nshould act today. We cannot and should not stand for the violations of \ninternational norms perpetrated on Crimea by Russia. The world is \nwatching, and the world's superpower cannot be seen as incapable of \nrising to Russia's challenge. That is the responsibility before the \nSenate today.\n  So for those who have criticized the IMF reforms--and because the \nHouse leadership doesn't want to pursue it because of extraneous \nmatters having to deal with politics and not policy, willing to risk \nnational security issues--they are going to get their way today. I \nwould hope, therefore, the rest of this package, which provides a loan \nguarantee to Ukraine of $1 billion, that provides sanctions against the \nRussian regime and others who corrupted Ukraine, the previous Ukrainian \nGovernment, and who have violated its territorial integrity, that \nprovides assistance to ensure democratic elections can be held this May \nin Ukraine, that provides for greater defense cooperation with Ukraine, \nall other elements of this legislation, should have universal \nsupport. We should do it today in order to ensure that we send a clear, \nunambiguous message, as 100,000 Russian troops are on the eastern front \nof the Ukraine. I believe this is a critical moment for us to answer \naffirmatively.\n\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about \nan issue that has been in the news quite a bit, and quite a bit on the \nminds of people, I think, all around the Capitol, which is what is \nhappening with, specifically, Vladimir Putin and Russia and the \ninvasion and takeover of Crimea and the activities in Ukraine.\n  On March 15 Russian forces seized a natural gas distribution station \nin a Ukrainian village. I think this is key because this was right at \nthe time they were getting ready to have a vote on Crimea leaving \nUkraine, joining Russia, and I was in Ukraine at the time. I was there \nwith a bipartisan group. We had eight Senators--Republicans and \nDemocrats from across the aisle and across the broad spectrum of \npolitics in America. What we saw at the time, right before the vote, \nwas the helicopters heading in to take over the gas plant. To me that \nshowed how Vladimir Putin thinks of energy, thinks of politics, and \nthinks of power.\n  In the Washington Post that Sunday morning, the day of the vote in \nCrimea: ``Ukraine decries Russian Invasion, Natural Gas Facility \nSeized.'' Their first action before the vote even occurred, the \nRussians came in and seized a natural gas facility. It showed his \nwillingness, his desire, to use energy as a weapon. It is also a \nreminder that energy for us can be a powerful weapon to counter Russian \naggression.\n  President Putin has repeatedly made it clear that he does not care \nabout democracy, about freedom or about the Ukrainian people. What he \ndoes care about is money and power. As the United States considers how \nto help the Ukrainian people, as we are doing right now on the floor of \nthe Senate with sanctions and aid, I think we need to make sure we take \nsteps to hit Putin exactly where it hurts, which is in his wallet, in \nhis power. Right now some may say: How does this matter? How important \nis this? Right now about half of Russia's revenue comes from oil and \nnatural gas.\n  We heard it today in the energy committee. The chairman of the \ncommittee stated that in her remarks before hearing testimony. Fifty-\ntwo percent, she said, of Russia's revenue comes from oil and natural \ngas. I think Senator John McCain was exactly right when he said this \npast Sunday on CNN that ``Russia is a gas station masquerading as a \ncountry.'' He was part of that group of eight Senators who went to \nUkraine, went to Kiev, went and saw where the massacres occurred and \nvisited with the new Prime Minister and the new President.\n  That is why I believe my amendment to this sanctions bill, this aid \nbill on the floor of the Senate, is so very important not just to us as \na Nation but to the people of Ukraine, the people of Europe, those who \nare trying to regain some freedom from the yoke and the tyranny of what \nRussia is doing by charging outrageous energy prices to people across \nEurope and across the Ukraine. We have an opportunity right now to make \nit easier for the United States to export our own gas to NATO countries \nand Ukraine. That is what my amendment will do. It is simple. It is two \npages. By expediting the approval of facilities to export liquefied \nnatural gas, we can send a very powerful signal to European markets \nthat alternative supplies will be available soon. We can undermine \nRussia's leverage with its European customers today and undercut \nRussia's ability to make so much money off gas exports in the future.\n  Some Washington Democrats continue to act as though the conflict in \nUkraine has nothing to do with energy. Other Democrats see it \ndifferently. The Obama administration claims that speeding up LNG \nexports to Europe would not have an immediate effect. That is not what \nwe heard today in the energy committee. That is not what a bipartisan \ngroup of Senators has heard and believes.\n  We cannot ignore Russia's economic dependence on energy and the \nreality about how energy markets work. Remember, half of Russia's \nrevenue comes from oil and natural gas. That is why the United States \nshale gas revolution is already undermining Russia's negotiating \nposition with its European neighbors.\n  This all has come about in the last decade--new techniques of \nhorizontal drilling, directional drilling, all of which makes energy in \nthe United States easier, cheaper to get, and then more available so it \ncan then be more easily exported. By reducing U.S. demand, that frees \nup supply that can be bought on European markets. Because there is more \nsupply, that forces Russia's state-owned gas companies to adjust their \nprices. Every molecule of American gas that can get anywhere else in \nthe world is going to be a molecule that those in Europe and those in \nUkraine cannot be held hostage to buy from Russia.\n  That is what The Economist said earlier this year. The more supply \nthere is, then Russia's state-owned gas company will have to adjust its \nprices. It\n\n[[Page S1716]]\n\nran an article on European efforts to reduce the control Russia has had \nover gas prices. We can immediately apply more pressure to the region's \ngas prices and further erode Russia's revenues by approving additional \nliquefied natural gas export capacity.\n  I think about that hearing earlier today in the energy Committee, \nwhen every witness endorsed LNG exports to undercut Russia. So what is \nstopping us? Some Washington Democrats have denied any need to act more \nquickly. The administration has approved just seven applications for \nLNG export facilities over many years. It spent an average of 697 days \nprocessing each of them. The Energy Department has still not processed \nanother 24 applications that are waiting and waiting and waiting.\n  My amendment would speed up that process, force the administration to \nact on applications to be able to allow energy to be sent to our NATO \nallies and to the Ukraine. We don't need more hearings to tell us what \nwe already know. Natural gas and the pricing continues to be a boot on \nthe neck of the Ukrainian people and in Europe.\n  Majority Leader Reid needs to allow a vote on my amendment. To me, it \nstrengthens the Ukrainian relief package. It strengthens the economics \nin terms of money going from the United States. It strengthens aid, and \nit strengthens sanctions because it actually works to specifically \nundercut, undermine Russia's ability to hold others hostage. Plus, it \nhas bipartisan support. There are a number of Democrats who would vote \nto support it. I think it is time to send a signal to Russia that we \nare finally ready to use energy to help stop their aggression.\n  I will point out that I am not alone in this, and there is \nsignificant across-the-board support. It is interesting, the number of \nheadlines in the past week or so from papers with various different \napproaches, including the New York Times: ``U.S. Hopes Boom In Natural \nGas Can Curb Putin,'' directly tying natural gas to the Russian \nPresident. That is the New York Times.\n  The Wall Street Journal: ``West Tries To Loosen Russia's Gas Grip.''\n  Investor's Business Daily: ``Bold Energy Policy Best Response To \nRussia In Ukraine.''\n  The Wall Street Journal: ``Energy Exports as Foreign-Policy Tool'' \nand ``Moscow Tightens Squeeze on Ukraine Over Energy.''\n  It is evident the export of liquefied natural gas from the United \nStates will help us as a Nation. It will help us in terms of our \nforeign policy, and it can be used and should be used and must be used \nto undermine the Russian economy at a time when they are--with Putin on \nthe move, Putin on a daily basis evaluating the consequences of his \nactions to decide what he is going to do, planning to do, with the \npossibility of additional incursions into Ukraine. He continues with \ntroops along the border between Russia and the Ukraine ready to act, \nready to go in, ready to cross the border. All he understands is \nstrength and power, and the way to undercut that is by undercutting his \neconomic strength and power, by exporting liquefied natural gas.\n  So I come to the floor asking that Senator Reid allow an amendment \nthat would strengthen the bill we are discussing right now and making \nit better for the people in Ukraine, better for the people here at \nhome, and actually doing something significant about the problem we see \nexisting with the additional use of power by Vladimir Putin.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I come to the Senate floor today to \naddress the legislation that we are considering, legislation that will \nprovide economic and diplomatic sanctions to deter Russian aggression \nand also provide financial assistance in the form of a loan guarantee \nto the Ukraine to provide financial assistance that will be combined \nwith $15 billion in loan guarantees from the European Union as well as \nassistance from the International Monetary Fund that can truly make a \ndifference for Ukraine in helping them to stand up to this Russian \naggression, while at the same time undertaking sanctions that I believe \ncan be effective in deterring the incursions Russia is making into \nUkraine.\n  A very important part of what we do is to be united with the European \nUnion in this effort. For the sanctions to work, for the economic \nassistance to Ukraine to work, we have to have a united front. We have \nto work with our allies throughout Europe. But the European Union's \nability and willingness to stand with us is greatly impacted by their \nenergy situation. So how do we help? How do we help them address a very \ndifficult situation in energy so that they will stand with us in \nputting forth the kinds of sanctions that can truly make a difference \nnow? And the time to take action is now. The time to stand up to \nRussia's action of invading another country unlawfully, taking part of \nthat country, holding an election that is not bona fide, and amassing \ntroops on the border of a country and threatening to make additional \nincursions into a country--the time to stand up and put sanctions in \nplace that will deter that behavior is now.\n  But the European Union finds itself in a situation where fully one-\nthird if not more of its energy comes from Russia. Half of that is \npiped through the Ukraine and 50 percent or more of Ukraine's energy \ncomes from Russia as well--specifically, natural gas. So the EU finds \nitself in a very difficult position when it comes to energy, and \nobviously that is a very important factor as they deliberate their \nsteps in terms of both sanctions against President Putin and Russia and \nthe activities he has undertaken and may undertake in the future and \nalso in terms of their willingness to stand up and to halt those \nactions and to assist Ukraine.\n  So as part of this legislation we are considering, we have offered to \nhelp provide energy to Europe. The good Senator from Wyoming, Mr. \nBarrasso, was on this floor. He is the prime sponsor of legislation \nthat would help move natural gas in the form of LNG--liquefied natural \ngas--from this country to Europe. I am a cosponsor of that legislation. \nWe filed that legislation as an amendment to the bill we are \nconsidering, and we are asking for a vote on that legislation. I think \nthere would be very strong bipartisan support in this Chamber, and I \nhave no doubt whatsoever that the legislation will pass the House as \nwell. Representative Gardner has introduced the same or very similar \nlegislation on the House side, and there is no question that the \nsupport is there to pass the legislation.\n  So as we look this week--and I think we will pass a bill this week--\nto both put sanctions on Russia in place and to assist Ukraine, we can \nadd this energy legislation which is an integral piece in helping the \nEU stand with us in standing up against Russian aggression--very \nsimple, straightforward legislation.\n  What the legislation provides is that for companies in the United \nStates that are willing to build LNG facilities and export liquefied \nnatural gas, which they are prepared to do--and we will expand the \ncountries to which they can export. Right now we have a limitation in \nterms of the exports. They can go to countries with which we have free-\ntrade agreements, but there are many other countries that we have \nstrategic security interests in that make a huge difference in terms of \nour security and security in the world, NATO countries, the EU, \nUkraine.\n  I understand it would take time to build the facilities and move that \nproduct, but there is no question in the near term that if we pass this \nkind of legislation, we will be sending a very strong signal to world \nmarkets and, even more importantly, a very strong signal to President \nPutin that we are serious about working with the EU to provide energy \nso that they have sources other than Russia. That strengthens the EU, \nand it also weakens Russia because Russia is entirely dependent for \nrevenue on their sales of energy. So as we take this step, we not only \nstrengthen our allies, we weaken Russia's ability to make the kinds of \nincursions they have made into the Ukraine.\n  This is a very straightforward amendment. It has bipartisan support.\n\n[[Page S1717]]\n\nWe are offering it as part of this bill. As we work through the \namendment process and we determine the form this bill is going to \ntake--and again, I think there is strong bipartisan support to move \nthis legislation. I believe we can move it this week. I believe we can \nget agreement to have the votes and to move it this week. But I call on \nour leadership, I call on the leadership of the majority party in a \nbipartisan way to come together and give us the opportunity to vote on \nthis amendment. It is part of a commonsense, comprehensive approach to \ntruly deal with the situation in Eastern Europe.\n  In addition, I would like to take a moment to call on the President \nof the United States to take concrete steps that could make a big \ndifference in the energy equation. The President is negotiating with \nour NATO allies right now, with the EU, which is now the G7--formerly \nthe G8 but the G7 without Russia--talking about what steps can and \nshould be undertaken to address what Russia has done and may do in the \nfuture.\n  On a bipartisan basis, I joined with Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, \nand on May 21 we wrote a letter to the President calling on him to \nundertake an energy plan. I would like to take a minute to read that \nletter on the Senate floor because I think it is a straightforward, \ncommonsense energy plan that the President could undertake right now \nand show the world and show specifically President Putin that he is \nserious, that we are serious about working with the EU starting \nimmediately. So it addresses taking short-term steps but undertaking a \nlong-term plan that will ensure that the EU, working with the United \nStates and others--countries such as Norway, which is producing \nincredible amounts of natural gas in the North Sea--working with \ncountries that can supply natural gas to the EU, that we will end their \ndependence on Russia. And if Russia continues the kinds of activities \nit is undertaking, they will find themselves isolated.\n\n       Dear President Obama. We write to you today because we are \n     deeply concerned with the events unfolding in Ukraine and \n     Crimea that have been instigated and supported by Russia. \n     President Vladimir Putin's aggressive actions and \n     intransigence, and his continued dismissal of U.S. and \n     European Union warnings, is of particular concern. We share \n     your view that tough sanctions from both sides of the \n     Atlantic will be required to provide the necessary motivation \n     to change Putin's behavior, and to enable a diplomatic \n     resolution of this crisis.\n       The sanctions that have been implemented so far are good \n     and appropriate; however, we believe that energy security is \n     a critical component to achieving a successful outcome in the \n     region. Russia provides one-third of Europe's natural gas \n     needs. With Russia in a position to slow or stop gas flowing \n     into much of Europe, Putin retains leverage to continue to \n     dominate European energy markets. Though Russia has publicly \n     committed to maintaining a full supply of gas to Ukraine and \n     Europe, their recent history contradicts those proclamations. \n     In January 2009, Moscow cut its supply of gas flowing through \n     Ukraine, and at least 18 European countries saw their \n     supplies completely or partially reduced. Some governments \n     declared states of emergency and ordered factories and \n     schools to close, while millions of people struggled to cope \n     in freezing temperatures.\n       As long as Vladimir Putin continues to use energy as a \n     weapon, we must take this threat seriously and take this \n     Russian threat off the table. For the first time in a \ngeneration, America is in a position to export energy, and acting \nstrategically to increase our natural gas exports accompanied by a more \ncomprehensive U.S.-EU energy security dialogue will weaken Putin's grip \non European energy markets.\n\n  We produce 30 trillion cubic feet of gas a year in the United States. \nStates such as mine are producing incredible amounts. We are flaring \noff gas we would like to get to markets. This is a winning proposition \nto the United States. If we provide gas to the EU, that generates \neconomic activity and jobs here and helps strengthen the EU and reduces \nour dependence on natural gas from Russia.\n\n       We urge you to take five specific actions that will have \n     near and long term positive impacts on the energy security of \n     Ukraine and the EU.\n       First, direct the Department of Energy to accelerate the \n     natural gas export permit process by approving the pending \n     permits within 60 days, or providing specific reasons why it \n     cannot approve individual permit applications. Though exports \n     would not start immediately, and though the price points in \n     Asian markets are currently more attractive to natural gas \n     exporters, calling for expedited approval of Liquefied \n     Natural Gas exports will increase liquidity on the global \n     markets and will improve the European energy security.\n       Second, conduct a strategic review of U.S. energy policies, \n     and expand the group of nations that currently qualify for \n     U.S. energy exports beyond those with free trade agreements \n     to include our NATO allies, the EU, Ukraine, and any others \n     that are in the national security interest of the United \n     States.\n\n  It just makes sense.\n\n       The review could include examining the potential of \n     additional investments of facilities capable of liquefying \n     natural gas.\n       Third, launch a joint U.S.-EU initiative on energy security \n     at next week's--\n\n  Meaning this week--\n\n       U.S.-EU summit in Brussels, with specific near-term and \n     future deliverables. One area of critical importance to \n     ensure greater energy security in Europe is the natural gas \n     infrastructure. While some European countries such as \n     Lithuania and Austria receive 100 percent of their gas from \n     Russia, others receive far less, and by improving the \n     interconnections, these countries could far more easily \n     direct supplies to one another in case of an outage. One \n     specific fix would be to reverse the flow of gas from \n     Slovakia to Ukraine, a proposal that is under consideration \n     by the European Commission. Additionally, we should assist \n     Ukraine to establish and maintain a high level of security \n     around its strategically significant gas storage facilities \n     in Southern Ukraine.\n\n  Countries such as Norway--Statoil--can supply more gas. Working \ncooperatively, we could have an impact right now as well as put a long-\nterm plan in place that sends a very clear message to President Putin \nthat we are going to change the energy equation.\n\n       Fourth, help Ukraine implement a significant energy \n     productivity initiative. U.S. businesses have developed many \n     off-the-shelf technologies that can greatly reduce energy \n     waste and promote greater efficiency, which will reduce \n     Ukraine's energy needs. This has the potential to greatly \n     reduce the amount of energy required by Ukraine and lessen \n     their dependence on Russia.\n\n  I was recently in Ukraine. We have many U.S. companies doing business \nover there. Many of the companies were from my State. I met with 10 \nCEOs from different companies in Kiev that are doing business \nthroughout Ukraine. There is no question that by working with our \ncompanies they can have a major impact on what happens in Ukraine both \nin terms of conserving energy but also producing more energy, and that \ngoes to the final point.\n\n       Finally, help Ukraine implement energy development \n     technology to enhance domestic production and promote energy \n     security. We have been contacted by several U.S. companies \n     that are ready to make strategic investments to help Ukraine \n     increase production of their own energy resources to reduce \n     reliance on Russian energy supplies.\n       We urge you to support and encourage the U.S. State \n     Department's Unconventional Gas Technical Engagement program \n     that allows U.S. local and state-level officials to share \n     best practices with European government officials. Already, \n     U.S. oil and gas companies are leading EU countries in shale \n     gas exploration and off-shore exploration in Eastern Europe \n     to help these countries diversify their energy sources.\n       We urge you to use the meetings to encourage more European \n     cooperation to solve their own energy dependency problem. A \n     recent proposal from the United Kingdom provides a series of \n     recommended reforms to the European energy infrastructure. We \n     believe our proposal aligns with the British recommendations \n     will provide a helpful starting point for the discussions \n     next week. The U.S. has a long history of supporting the \n     transatlantic relationship on areas of security and defense, \n     and energy security should be part of that dialogue.\n\n  We then close the letter saying:\n\n       We look forward to working with you to implement this plan.\n\n  Think about it. These are steps the administration can and should \ntake now. There is bipartisan support for energy legislation in this \nbody to back it up and make it happen.\n  I call on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to come together \nas part of an effort to deter Russian aggression, help Ukraine. To help \nthe EU stand strong and united with us, we need to address the energy \nissue. We can and we should.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I appreciate Senator Hoeven's work on \nthe Ukraine issue. I know he went there recently, and I have also \nvisited the great energy resources in his State as his guest and know \nthey have a broad range of energy sources, as does Minnesota.\n\n[[Page S1718]]\n\n  I rise to talk about the importance of the Support for the \nSovereignty, Integrity, Democracy, and Economic Stability of the \nUkraine Act, and I urge the Senate to act as quickly as possible to get \nit done.\n  As the past week has made clear, the crisis in Ukraine is not waiting \nfor us. We witnessed Russia's blatantly illegal annexation of Crimea \nand its continued efforts to bully, intimidate, and weaken the new \nUkrainian Government.\n  It is critical we immediately demonstrate to the world, one, our \nsupport for Ukraine as it charts a new democratic future for itself; \ntwo, our abhorrence of the Russian Government's actions that violate \nUkraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity; and three, our \ncommitment to continue leading the world through a tough and determined \nresponse to the crisis.\n  This legislation, which was backed by our colleagues on the Foreign \nRelations Committee on a strong bipartisan vote, accomplishes these \nimportant goals. It provides badly needed assistance to Ukraine to help \nits new government stand on its own two feet.\n  It also punishes those who contributed to the crisis by authorizing \nsanctions targeting Russia's officials, Crimea's self-appointed \nleaders, and the former leaders of Ukraine who lined their own pockets \nat their country's expense.\n  It is unfortunate we have not passed this bill already, given that \nthe vast majority of our colleagues agree on the basic framework of how \nwe should respond to events in Ukraine. I understand some of our \ncolleagues may want to add something else to this bill, but almost \neveryone agrees we should provide assistance, including loan guarantees \nto the new Ukrainian Government and impose sanctions on Russian leaders \nand key institutions.\n  Now is the time for us to move forward. Together, the United States \nand our allies have taken important steps, such as barring Russia from \nthe Group of Eight and imposing sanctions on key Russian officials. \nPresident Obama is in Europe this week working to convince our allies \nto take even stronger measures to help Ukraine and hold Russia \naccountable. We in the Senate must also act.\n  I think it is important to step back to reflect on how we arrived at \nthis point. This is not a crisis the United States sought. The \nsituation in Ukraine became a crisis because the former President of \nUkraine and Russian leaders sought to keep the Ukrainian people from \npursuing their right to determine their own future.\n  The Ukrainian people rose last November after their then-President \nturned his back on an association agreement with the European Union. \nThis agreement would have helped bring Ukraine into the prosperous \ncommunity of European nations while also compelling it to reduce \ncorruption and enhance the rule of law. In short, it was a treaty that \nwould have helped lift Ukraine to a better future with greater \nopportunity for its people.\n  When the former President abandoned that treaty, the people of \nUkraine did not go quietly. They demonstrated courageously for months \nin the face of severe repression by the regime, including snipers \nshooting at civilians in the streets of Kiev. In the face of all odds, \nthey succeeded in forcing the regime to the negotiating table.\n  The President fled the country, taking with him his ill-gotten \nwealth. It seemed the Ukrainian people would at least have the freedom \nthey had worked so hard to achieve. The new government even signed--at \nlong last--the association agreement with the European Union that the \nold regime had rejected.\n  Unfortunately, President Putin has long sought to keep Ukraine from \ncharting its own course, first through economic manipulation and now \nthrough brutal force. When it became clear that the people of Ukraine \nwould not be denied, President Putin carried out a military \nintervention to cut off Crimea and stage a sham referendum before \nillegally annexing the territory in a flagrant breach of international \nlaw and Russia's own past commitments to Ukraine's sovereignty.\n  Even though he claims Russia will seek no more territory from \nUkraine, he continues to harass and undermine the new government by \nreneging on previous agreements to provide subsidies for gas and \nslowing deliveries, something my colleague from North Dakota has \nfocused on. Russia's military continues to mass on Ukraine's borders.\n  I find it interesting that just a few months ago President Putin \nwrote a New York Times op-ed on the subject of international law and \nthe use of force. He declared:\n\n       Under current international law, force is permitted only in \n     self-defense or by the decision of the Security Council. \n     Anything else is unacceptable under the United Nations \n     charter and would constitute an act of aggression.\n\n  In President Putin's view, force must be approved by the U.N. \nSecurity Council or it is an act of aggression, except when it comes to \nUkraine.\n  It should be clear by now that President Putin will use any means to \nadvance his ends. He employs the language of ethnic nationalism while \nhe tries to take apart Ukraine. His dissenters are sent to prison on \ntrumped-up charges, children languish in state institutions as a result \nof the adoption ban, which is something we care so much about in \nMinnesota as one of the top States for adopting kids from Russia and \nacross the world, and the Russian LGBT community lives under the \nconstant threat of oppression.\n  All the people of Ukraine want is a simple freedom to seek a brighter \nfuture for their country, to not be a pawn to President Putin's efforts \nto resurrect the Soviet Union. The whole world sees that.\n  On March 15, 13 members of the U.N. Security Council voted for a \nresolution to condemn Russia for the very use of force that President \nPutin criticized last year. Only one country voted against it and that \ncountry was Russia.\n  Now the world is watching us. They are watching to see whether the \nCongress of the United States will act. We have talked a lot about \nUkraine over the past several weeks. I was proud to cosponsor a \nbipartisan resolution, led by Senators Durbin and Coats, that expressed \nsupport for Ukraine and criticized Russia's actions. That resolution \npassed unanimously 2 weeks ago. Now is the time to show we are actually \ndoing something.\n  Ukrainians need to know that the United States stands with them, not \njust in the very important speeches on the Senate floor but also with \nreal assistance and real action. President Putin needs to know we will \nnot meekly return to business as usual and allow him to bully Ukraine \nwith impunity.\n  Our allies and adversaries around the world need to know we will \nstand together to protect our vision of a world governed by democracy \nand law, where nations do not live under the threat of force by their \nneighbors.\n  This is one of those times where the impact of our votes will be felt \nfar beyond the walls of this Chamber. In Ukraine they are going to be \nwatching this vote. In Russia they are going to be watching this vote. \nAll over Europe they are going to be watching this vote and in those \ncountries from the former Soviet Union. The world is watching. So other \npeople, other countries that may choose to engage in this illegal \nbreach of international law, that may choose to tread on this illegal \nground will be watching, and that is why this vote is so important.\n  I urge my colleagues, in the support of the people of Ukraine, to \nsupport this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I wish to take a moment to commend the \nSenator from Minnesota on her remarks. She expressed what we feel very \nstrongly in this body. I wish to express both my agreement with her \ncomments as well as the importance of moving this legislation. I \nbelieve there is very strong bipartisan support to move this \nlegislation. I think we can get it done this week.\n  Again, I express my appreciation for her words here today and I \nbelieve that is exactly the kind of cooperative spirit we need on the \npart of all 100 Senators to get this done. Now is the time for action. \nI join with the good Senator from Minnesota in calling for that action.\n  With that, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S1719]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Unanimous Consent Agreement--H.R. 4152\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nnotwithstanding cloture having been invoked, the motion to proceed to \nS. 2124 be withdrawn; that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of Calendar No. 328, H.R. 4152; that following the \nreporting of the bill, a Menendez-Corker substitute amendment, the text \nof which is at the desk, be made pending; that no other amendments be \nin order; that no points of order or motions be in order other than \nbudget points of order and the applicable motions to waive; that on \nThursday, March 27, following morning business, there be 2 hours of \ndebate equally divided between the two leaders or their designees prior \nto a vote in relation to the Menendez-Corker amendment; that upon \ndisposition of the amendment, the bill be read a third time and the \nSenate proceed to vote on passage of the bill, as amended, if amended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I note in \nthe majority leader's requested consent order he stipulates that no \nother amendments be in order, which I think is deeply regrettable, \ngiven the fact that this matter has been considered in the Foreign \nRelations Committee and then came to the floor without any opportunity \nfor the rest of the Senate to participate, either in the deliberative \nprocess or to debate important improvements to the legislation. I would \nnote two for the majority leader's consideration.\n  Two amendments which seem to enjoy a tremendous amount of bipartisan \nsupport are in recognition of the stranglehold Vladimir Putin and \nRussia have on Ukraine's energy supply as well as the energy supply to \nthe rest of Europe. There is a Barrasso amendment many of us support \nthat calls for the expedited consideration and permitting of exporting \nliquefied natural gas.\n  There is another amendment I have offered that would provide military \nassistance to Ukraine. Right now, the underlying bill provides $100 \nmillion. It doesn't specify the precise nature of the assistance, but \nit appears to be in the nature of rations, uniforms, and medical \nsupplies. I would think at a minimum we would want to make sure the \nUkrainians who are defending their country are supplied additional U.S. \nmilitary assistance in order to defend themselves against this Russian \naggression.\n  So I ask the majority leader to modify his unanimous consent request \nwith the following: that the first amendment in order be a Barrasso \namendment related to the exportation of liquefied natural gas; and that \nfollowing the disposition of the Barrasso amendment, the majority \nleader and the Republican leader or their designees be recognized to \noffer relevant amendments in an alternating fashion, including the \nCornyn amendment on military assistance to Ukraine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the majority leader so modify his \nrequest?\n  Mr. REID. I reserve the right, and will just make a brief comment. \nThe committee action on this bill was really historic. The issue my \nfriend just suggested be part of an amendment process was discussed at \nsome length in the committee.\n  As I discussed this morning, the situation in Ukraine is critical. \nThe Senate must act as quickly as we can on the Senate Committee on \nForeign Relations bill.\n  The bill before us gives additional aid to the fragile Ukrainian \neconomy. As Secretary Kerry said yesterday, he wants this aid that is \nin our bill now, but he also wanted what was in our bill--IMF funding. \nBut he said: If I cannot get both, the most important thing we do now \nis the funding that is in our bill, and he is probably right.\n  We already know there have been many signals--not any hidden \nsignals--from the House that they would not accept the IMF. The \nRepublican leader said he was concerned about the IMF.\n  So I am very pleased the sanctions inside this legislation that I \nhope will pass on Thursday is something that is going to help Ukraine. \nI am confident it will. It sanctions those inside Ukraine and Russia \nwho have undetermined Ukraine's sovereignty and stability.\n  I think, as far as I am concerned, we will have more legislation on \nthis in the not distant future. As far as I am concerned, I think there \nshould be more sanctions that we look at. I think they need more aid. \nOn Sunday shows, I heard Republican Senator Ayotte, Democratic Senator \nDurbin both talking about the need for sleeping bags, small arms fire, \nand things such as that that the Ukrainians simply do not have.\n  That is why I am pleased we have been able to come to a tentative \nagreement to vote on this measure Thursday. I would have preferred to \ninclude, as I have already indicated, the International Monetary Fund \nprovisions in this bill. It is something that is needed. These \nprovisions would have provided additional funds to stabilize this \nfragile Ukrainian economy, but my Republican colleagues, for reasons \nunrelated to Ukraine, were ready to kill the bill over the IMF issue.\n  Today we are ready to move forward on the bipartisan Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee bill without the IMF language. Let me just take a \nminute--a brief minute--to extend my appreciation--and I think I speak \nfor the entire Senate--for the hard work that has allowed us to get \nwhere we are.\n  Chairman Menendez, Ranking Member Corker--they have worked very well \ntogether on legislation generally but on this specifically. Senator \nMcCain, who is a long-time leader on national security issues, has been \nvery articulate and forceful in his view as to what should be done. By \nthe way, both Senators Corker and McCain suggested we should have the \nIMF money in this, but I called Senator McCain this morning and told \nhim reasons why I thought we could not go forward with it, and I think \nhe agrees with that.\n  I hope my colleagues will join us in voting to pass this important \nbill on Thursday. The people of the Ukraine are watching. The Russians \nare watching. It is time for the Senate to act. It is time for Ukraine \nto get the support it needs, it is time for this body to sanction the \nRussians, and it is time to send a clear message to Putin that the \nUnited States condemns the Russian annexation of Ukraine. I say once \nagain, if he so likes these votes he created in Crimea, why doesn't he \nhave one in Chechnya? Why doesn't he have a vote there? Because I think \nthat would turn out much differently than what he would want.\n  I understand Senator Barrasso is talking about this issue that my \nfriend from Texas suggested, and it and other issues are something we \nneed to bring up when we talk about further work on Ukraine.\n  So I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I will be brief, but further reserving \nthe right to object to the majority leader's request, I just want to \nmake sure the majority leader understands no one is talking about \nslowing down this bill. It is anticipated, I think even under the \nmajority leader's consent request, that we will be finished with this \nbill no later than Thursday. It is one of those circumstances where, \ngiven the context of what is in the legislation, there is actually \nbipartisan support because of the importance of sending a unified \nmessage to the Russian leader about this aggression.\n  But I wish to be clear that my position is that sanctions are not \nenough. We need to go further and to provide a means for the Ukrainian \npeople to defend themselves against this sort of aggression, which they \ndo not presently possess. We need to find a way to relieve the \nstranglehold Putin has on Ukraine and much of the rest of Europe that \nhe is going to keep using as long as he feels we have not acted to \nundermine or jeopardize that stranglehold.\n  That is the purpose of these amendments, and I regret the majority \nleader has seen fit to object to my request--reasonable request--for \ngermane amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, my friend from Texas is absolutely right.\n\n[[Page S1720]]\n\nWe need to do more on Ukraine--there is no question about that--and I \nlook forward to working with him and all Senators to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The motion to proceed is withdrawn.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/25/senate-section/article/S1720-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1720]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         PROVIDING FOR THE COSTS OF LOAN GUARANTEES FOR UKRAINE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I am now here for the 62nd weekly \neffort to have my colleagues wake up to the threats of climate change. \nCongress continues to remain sound asleep, I suspect anesthetized by \nthe narcotic drip of polluter money into our veins. But the signs of \nchange around us continue.\n  These are the Mau Loa monthly carbon dioxide concentrations. We have \njust passed, again, 400 parts per million of carbon dioxide in the \natmosphere. This is the second year in a row this has happened. This \nyear it happened 2 months earlier than last year. So why does it matter \nthat we are at 400 parts per million? What does that mean to anybody?\n  We have actually gone back and measured where the carbon \nconcentration in the atmosphere has been going way back. We can measure \nback in ancient ice so we know that for at least 800,000 years, our \ncarbon concentration is between 170 and 300 parts per million. That is \na long run for a species that has only been homo sapien for about \n250,000 years. That has been a long and hospitable window, during which \nour species has developed from very primitive hunter-gatherers into the \ncomplex people that we are now.\n  So when you take something like that, the carbon concentration, and \nyou bust out of a range that has sheltered us for 800,000 years, that \nis not nothing. It is particularly not nothing when you know that \ncarbon dioxide in the atmosphere raises the temperature of the Earth. \nWe have known that since Abraham Lincoln was President. This is not \nsomething that is debatable. This is not new news. This is established \nscience for 150-plus years.\n  We also know--because you can replicate it in the laboratory--that \nwhen you put higher concentrations of carbon in the air over seawater, \nit acidifies the seawater. If you doubt any of that, you can go out and \nmeasure that it is actually happening--the known provable theories, the \nknown principles, I should say. In fact, laws of science are actually \nmanifest in sea level rise from the warming oceans, in warming ocean \ntemperatures, in increased acidification. These are measurements.\n  As this continues, we continue to do nothing about it, but we let the \nbig polluters continue to spew carbon pollution into our atmosphere. \nSome of us in Congress are tired of waiting for folks to wake up. This \nmonth 31 Senators from every part of the country held the Senate floor \nthrough the night to sharpen this Chamber's focus on the threats of \nclimate change. I thank Senator Schatz of Hawaii for leading us through \nthis wake-up call, and to Senator Boxer for her leadership of the \nSenate Climate Action Task Force, and to the Presiding Officer, the \nsenior Senator from Massachusetts, for her enthusiastic participation \nand support in that effort.\n  The American people tuned in, tweeting over 54,000 times at the \nhashtag up4climate in the 24-hour period of this effort. Also, \nAmericans added more than 200,000 signatures to online petitions urging \nCongress to get with it and do something about this climate problem. \nThe public knows it is a problem and has been pushing us to act now for \nyears.\n  I have heard it from Rhode Island fishermen who now have to chase \ntheir catch further offshore into cooler waters because our coastal \nwaters have warmed. The Presiding Officer has heard it from her \nMassachusetts fishermen as well. I have heard it from homeowners in \nSouth Kingston, RI, whose houses are falling into the ocean as the sea \nlevel rises and they encroach further inland into what had for \ngenerations been family homes.\n  Rhode Island does its part to try to address climate change. We are \nparticipating in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, and we are \neverywhere readying our coastlines for worse storms and higher seas. \nBut the Ocean State cannot do this alone. The health, the safety, the \nprosperity of the people I represent in Rhode Island's communities \ndepend on national action. We need a national groundswell of citizens \nand elected officials from every State.\n  So last week I went to Iowa to share with that State Rhode Island's \nclimate change stories and to listen to Iowans tell me their climate \nchange stories and how it is affecting their communities. I was invited \nto Iowa by Senator Rob Hogg, who is a passionate defender of the Iowan \nenvironment and way of life and a very knowledgeable expert on climate \nchange.\n  I want to thank him and I also want to thank the Iowa legislature, \nparticularly house minority leader Mark Smith and senate majority \nleader Michael Gronstal for their warm welcome. I also want to thank my \ncolleague Senator Harkin and his staff for\n\n[[Page S1721]]\n\ntheir assistance in planning and coordinating my visit.\n  Farming is not a big deal in Rhode Island. We are not known as an \nagricultural State. We have farms and we love them. But it is not quite \nthe same as Iowa. Farming is the cornerstone of Iowa's economy. \nDisruption of agricultural productivity is one of the great climate \nrisks in Iowa. The recent National Climate Assessment draft finds this:\n\n       In the long term, combined stresses associated with climate \n     change are expected to decrease agricultural productivity, \n     especially without significant advances in genetic and \n     agronomic technology.\n\n  But we do not have to wait for the long term. Iowans are already \nbeing hit by extreme weather. In 2013, just last year, 155 science \nfaculty and research staff from 36 Iowa colleges and universities--home \nState Iowa teachers from their colleges and universities, 155 of them--\nsigned the Iowa Climate Statement, concerning the losses that farmers \nacross the State are already experiencing due to climate change.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Iowa Climate Statement be printed in \nthe Record following my statement.\n  Iowa has had 20 Presidential Disaster Declarations since 1990 due to \nflooding. Damage has been more than $20 billion. Although no one \nparticular flood can be directly connected to climate change, we know \nthat carbon pollution loads the dice for the extreme downpours that \nprovoke these floods in Iowa and in the Midwest.\n  I call it the Barry Bonds rule. You do not know which home run was \ncaused by the steroids, but you know for sure he was hitting extra home \nruns because of the steroids and you can measure that. In 1993 in Iowa, \na flood exceeding once-in-500-year flood levels hit Des Moines. Ted \nCorrigan of Des Moines Water Works told me during my visit that the \ncity's infrastructure was overwhelmed, leaving Des Moines without clean \nwater for more than 2 weeks.\n  The Des Moines Register reports that Iowa has endured at least 10 so-\ncalled 500-year floods since 1993--10 500-year floods since 1993. That \nincludes the big 2008 flood that cost $10 billion statewide in Iowa.\n  Doug Newman, the executive vice president at the Cedar Rapids \nEconomic Alliance, told me what it was like to live through that \nunprecedented flood. Doug explained that in Cedar Rapids, flood levels \nhad never, for as long as they have measured it, exceeded 21 feet. This \nflood maxed out at 31 feet, 10 feet above the all time previous ever \nrecorded record.\n  A thousand businesses were flooded. One-fifth of them were lost. More \nthan 1,000 people lost their jobs. So it was tough. But what I saw was \nIowans taking action--from college students to business leaders, from \nactivists of the Iowa Citizens Climate Lobby to the conservationists to \nthe Izaak Walton League. Iowans are preparing for the effects of \nclimate change, and they want to see Federal action.\n  Like Rhode Islanders, they are tired of trying to carry this \nthemselves. Des Moines Mayor Frank Cownie is one of over 1,000 mayors \nrepresented on this map all across the country who have signed the U.S. \nConference of Mayors Climate Protection Agreement, pledging to meet or \nbeat the Kyoto Protocol targets in their own cities and to press their \nState governments and the Federal Government--us--to enact meaningful \ngreenhouse gas reductions.\n  I visited with TPI Composites. TPI Composites has a development and \nmanufacturing facility in my home State, in Warren, RI. They are part \nof our composites cluster in Rhode Island. But they are also a leading \nIowa manufacturer of wind turbine blades. In 10 years, TPI has \nmanufactured more than 10,000 wind turbine blades. So when the Maytag \nheadquarters closed, leaving as many as 4,000 workers jobless in \nNewton, IA, this helped the town get back on its feet.\n  If we allow the production tax credit or the PTC to lapse, loss of \nthat tax incentive for wind energy producers will jeopardize the \nbusiness that TPI has built. So the Iowa State Senate unanimously \npassed a resolution in January supporting the extension of the \nproduction tax credit--unanimously, bipartisan.\n  There is bipartisan support for the extension of both the production \ntax credit and the investment tax credit, and we should get that done \nin this Congress. I also heard in Iowa from Warren McKenna, the manager \nat the Farmer Electric Cooperative in Kalona, IA. Kalona is a town of \nabout 2,400 people. It has Iowa's first community solar garden, with 25 \nkilowatts of capacity. For the co-op's 800 owner-members, that 25 \nkilowatts of energy helps reduce their monthly bills. And for members \nwho have their own solar panels, they also get paid for the energy they \nadd into the co-op's system. And this year, off of those successes, the \nco-op is breaking ground on an 800,000-kilowatt solar installation, \ntaking advantage of a State solar tax credit that was passed by a \nDemocratic senate and a Republican house and signed into law by a \nRepublican Governor.\n\n  This body could learn a thing or two from the Iowa State legislature. \nIt shows what can happen when the polluter money doesn't have a \nDemocratic institution locked down the way Congress has been.\n  I also visited BioProcess Algae. This is a Rhode Island-based \ncompany. The CEO, Timmy Burns, is right here--a Quidnick Islander like \nmyself. They design, build, and operate commercial-scale algae \nbioreactors. The commercial demonstration project shown here is located \ndown in the southwest corner of Iowa in Shenandoah.\n  BioProcess Algae uses the wastewater and the waste heat and the \ncarbon dioxide emissions from the nearby ethanol refinery to grow \nalgae. The algae can then be used for animal feed, can be used for \nbiofuels, and, while it is growing, it eats up the carbon dioxide that \nwould otherwise be emitted to pollute the atmosphere. Here in \nShenandoah, American ingenuity is turning carbon pollution into \neconomic opportunity.\n  I also visited this wind turbine. This is the base of a wind turbine. \nThis is the stairway up into where you can go inside to serve it. You \ncan see it is pretty big. There is the arc of the round steel base, and \nit towers up hundreds of feet. I think the blade diameter was 160 \nmeters. It is a pretty serious-sized wind turbine. It is located in one \nof five wind parks which have a combined 500 wind turbines that are \noperated by a company called MidAmerican Energy.\n  Thanks to pioneering companies such as MidAmerican, and to the State \ntax incentives that encourage these projects, more than a quarter of \nIowa's electricity is generated by wind. They are leading the country. \nMore than a quarter of their electricity is generated by wind. It \nmeasures in the gigawatts. That is a lot of wind power. And they love \nit. The farmers get paid for having the wind turbine on their farm. If \nyou look--I don't know how well the camera can see this--this is the \nturbine itself, the stand that it rises up on, the column. That is the \ndoorway into it. We are standing on a gravel sort of service road ring \naround it so that equipment can be pulled up to it for maintenance \npurposes. But look right here. That is not too far away. That is maybe \n25 feet. They are farming right up to 25 feet away from this thing. So \nyou farm and you get paid for having the wind turbine located on your \nfarm. It is a wonderful two-fer.\n  The conclusion I drew from all of this--from the exciting new types \nof energy being grown from algae, from the huge commitment to wind, \nfrom the audiences that came out and expressed their support for \ngetting stuff done on climate, for the bipartisan support from so much \nof this clean energy stuff--is that Iowans have awoken to the threat of \nclimate change. And that is important. Because Iowa plays a key role in \nour politics. Iowa helps determine which issues our Presidential \ncandidates will be judged on. In 2016, I will bet that Iowans are going \nto insist they all address carbon pollution and they are not going to \naccept a lot of nonsense denial out of those candidates.\n  In fact, I believe if the Republican Party tries to nominate a \nclimate denier for President, they are in big trouble. Of course, the \ncarbon fuel-funded denial machine will do its best to change the \nsubject, to muddy the waters, to create doubt, to use its anonymous \ndark political money to keep candidates quiet. But all the money in the \nworld can't change the fact that Iowans know, just like Rhode Islanders \ndo, that climate change is real. And those Iowans are going to put \nthose Presidential candidates on\n\n[[Page S1722]]\n\nrecord. If you are a denier, good luck in Iowa. Iowans see the changes \ntaking place and they are speaking up. Farmers in Iowa and fishermen in \nRhode Island may be miles from each other geographically, but they both \nsee in their lives around them the facts of the changes that are \nalready happening.\n  The time to sit on the sidelines is over. If we fight hard, if we are \nwilling to have this fight, I am confident we can do a strong climate \nbill in Congress and soon--a climate bill that will strengthen our \neconomy, because it will; a climate bill that will redirect our future, \nas it must; a climate bill that will protect our democracy, because the \npollution of our atmosphere and oceans that the carbon polluters are \ndoing is matched by the pollution of our democracy that they are doing \nwith their dirty and anonymous money; and finally, a bill that will \nhonor our duty to the generations that will follow us, because each \nAmerican generation takes that duty as a very high duty. Right now we \nare dishonoring that duty and we are not leaving for future generations \nthe kind of country we should.\n  I went recently to Ukraine. I met with one of the leaders of the \nUkrainian freedom movement. His name is Vitali Klitschko. If you are a \nboxing fan, you know who Vitali Klitschko is because he is a huge guy \nwho was the world heavyweight boxing champion for years, and he has now \nthrown himself into the struggle of Ukraine for freedom; first of all, \nfreedom from Russian influence and control, and more recently freedom \nfrom the oligarchs who basically robbed the country blind but were \nfinally run out after that long bloody siege at the square in Kiev, the \nMaidan.\n  Vitali has an interesting phrase that he uses. Because when he \nstarted this fight, it wasn't the least bit clear that anybody could \nwin this thing. The oligarchs are billionaires. They have immense \nresources at their disposal. And they keep stealing, so there is always \nmore. And, of course, the Russians are right there with their baleful \ninfluence, trying to make sure there is as little freedom and \nopportunity as possible and to keep Ukraine under their thrall. Those \nare some powerful forces. So people would ask him: Can you win? And he \nhad a very simple answer. I can't imitate the good Slavic accent, and I \ncan't imitate the basso profundo voice of a man that big, but his \nphrase was memorable: No fight, no win.\n  Well, we have had no fight in us for too long on climate. It is time \nto put some more fight into this thing, because I think on climate the \nopposite is true. This isn't a no-fight, no-win situation. This is a \n``if we fight, we will win'' situation. The facts are there. The public \nis ready. There is nothing between us and doing our duty other than the \nbarricade of lies, the polluter-funded denial beast that is out there \nshopping their nonsense, and we can outdo them. It doesn't take much. \nBecause, among other things, it is always easier for the truth to win \nover a lie. You just have to be willing to go out there and have that \nfight. So we have to wake up. When we do, we will win. I am more \nconfident than ever, having been back from Iowa.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Iowa Climate Statement 2013: A Rising Challenge to Iowa Agriculture\n\n       Our state has long held a proud tradition of helping to \n     ``feed the world.'' Our ability to do so is now increasingly \n     threatened by rising greenhouse gas emissions and resulting \n     climate change. Our climate has disrupted agricultural \n     production profoundly during the past two years and is \n     projected to become even more harmful in coming decades as \n     our climate continues to warm and change.\n       Swings from one extreme to another have characterized \n     Iowa's 2013 weather patterns. Iowa started the year under the \n     widespread drought that began in 2011 and persisted \n     throughout 2012. But the spring of 2013 (March-May) was the \n     wettest in the 140 years of record-keeping, creating \n     conditions that hampered the timely planting of corn and \n     soybean fields. During those months, sixty-two Iowa counties \n     experienced storms and flooding severe enough to result in \n     federal disaster declarations.\n       By mid-August, very dry conditions had returned to Iowa, \n     subjecting many of the state's croplands to moderate drought. \n     These types of weather extremes, which are highly detrimental \n     to Iowa's crops, were discussed in our 2012 Iowa Climate \n     Statement, where we also noted that globally over the past 30 \n     years extreme high temperatures are becoming increasingly \n     more common than extreme low temperatures. In a warming \n     climate, wet years get wetter and dry years get dryer and \n     hotter. The climate likely will continue to warm due to \n     increasing emissions of heat-trapping gases.\n       Climate change damages agriculture in additional ways. \n     Intense rain events, the most notable evidence of climate \n     change in Iowa, dramatically increase soil erosion, which \n     degrades the future of agricultural production.\n       As Iowa farmers continue to adjust to more intense rain \n     events, they must also manage the negative effects of hot and \n     dry weather. The increase in hot nights that accompanies hot, \n     dry periods reduces dairy and egg production, weight gain of \n     meat animals, and conception rates in breeding stock. Warmer \n     winters and earlier springs allow disease-causing agents and \n     parasites to proliferate, and these then require greater use \n     of agricultural pesticides.\n       Local food producers, fruit producers, plant-nursery \n     owners, and even gardeners have also felt the stresses of \n     recent weather extremes. Following on the heels of the \n     disastrous 2012 loss of 90% of Iowa's apple crop, the 2013 \n     cool March and record-breaking March-through-May rainfall set \n     most ornamental and garden plants back well behind seasonal \n     norms. Events such as these are bringing climate change home \n     to the many Iowans who work the land on a small scale, visit \n     the Farmer's Market, or simply love Iowa's sweet corn and \n     tomatoes.\n       Iowa's soils and agriculture remain our most important \n     economic resources, but these resources are threatened by \n     climate change. It is time for all Iowans to work together to \n     limit future climate change and make Iowa more resilient to \n     extreme weather. Doing so will allow us to pass on to future \n     generations our proud tradition of helping to feed the world.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I am here to express my support for \nS. 2124, which expresses the American people's support for the \nsovereignty, integrity, democracy, and economic stability of Ukraine. I \nalso support the Senate taking up a modified version of H.R. 4152 so we \ncan get this measure to the President's desk--something we should have \ndone weeks ago.\n  I thank and praise Majority Leader Reid for his commitment to this \nissue, his fortitude, and his patience--as well as our colleagues \nSenator Murphy, the head of the subcommittee of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, and my colleague from Connecticut and Senator Menendez, \nalong with Senator McCain, whose leadership in spearheading this \nmeasure has been so instrumental.\n  I believe the people of Ukraine need and deserve the opportunity to \ndetermine their own future. This goal is not an exceedingly ambitious \none. It is hardly novel. It is the universally accepted principle that \nforms the basis for the sovereignty of all nations.\n  Together with our European allies, the United States has encouraged \nUkrainians to stabilize their country and hold elections this spring. \nWe have taken these actions not to bring Ukraine closer to the European \nfold or separate it from its historic ties to any of its neighbors but \nto affirm the principle of human rights, freedom, and sovereignty, \nwhich is the bedrock of our own national security and ultimately the \nsecurity of our global order and the rule of law.\n  Russia's territorial expansion into Crimea destabilizes and calls \ninto question the security of Russia's neighbors from Finland to China. \nWho will be next? What pretext and implausible denials will Russia use \nnext time? Who knows, other than Putin and his inner circle.\n  The United States needs a productive working relationship with \nRussia, and the world relies on us to be the one nation that can always \nbe counted on to speak clearly and honestly about world events. \nUkraine's deep internal division and chronic economic challenges are \nexacerbated by Russia's less than neighborly interests.\n  I support targeted individual sanctions already put in place by the \nPresident. I thank him for his leadership. We will vote on those this \nweek. But we and our European allies must do more. These measures must \nbe the beginning, not the end. What we do on this measure is a start, a \ngood step in the right direction, but it must be accompanied by \nadditional action--not\n\n[[Page S1723]]\n\njust words or rhetoric on the floor of the Senate but action that \nspeaks louder than words, sanctions that bite, just as the sanctions on \nIran had their effect and brought Iran to the table.\n  Two years ago I worked successfully with my Senate colleagues on the \nHelsinki Commission to impose sanctions on government officials in \nRussia who were complicit in the murder and coverup of Sergei \nMagnitsky, a Russian lawyer and auditor who died in a Moscow prison \nafter investigating fraud. This law serves as good groundwork and a \nframework for expanding these types of individually targeted sanctions, \nwhich should include travel and banking restrictions on anybody \ninciting violence and anyone who profits from the theft of state \nassets.\n  I believe the legislation before us is an important matter of \nnational security, and we should delay it no further. We have taken a \nweek with extraneous amendments, and delay and time do not strengthen \nour hand.\n  The fact is, as we have seen with Iran, we will need strong and \nstrengthening sanctions on Russia to have real effect. This first step \nmust be followed by more, and maybe equally important we need close \ncooperation with our regional allies to create a really effective \ndeterrent so the Russians know their unilateral seizure of Crimea is \ncondemned by all law-abiding nations and we are taking positive steps \nto isolate Russia.\n  Russia's attack ought to be an alarm to the harm of Russian arms \nexports and military expansion that have brought effects globally and \nshould be a focus of ours and international efforts countering Russian \nexpansion. That expansion takes place at the expense of its neighbors, \nalso sovereign nations, and at the expense of more than 140,000 \ncivilian casualties.\n  To my dismay and to the sadness of much of the international \ncommunity, Russia remains the largest arms supplier to the Syrian \nGovernment. Russia is a chief obstacle in achieving meaningful progress \ntoward a peaceful resolution in Syria, and they have undermined \nprogress in Geneva, obstructing or watering down efforts at the U.N. \nSecurity Council and a variety of international forums to bring \nhumanitarian relief so desperately needed within Syria and in the \nrefugee camps.\n  The Senate should take meaningful action to sanction Russia's arms \nexporters. These companies and individuals who benefit from contracts, \nboth for the fuel they provide to the civil war in Syria and the \ntakeover of Crimea, truly deserve not only our condemnation but action. \nThat is why I am cosponsoring an amendment with my colleagues, Senator \nCornyn and Senator Coats, to take exactly such action and why I \nintroduced the Syria Sanctions Enhancement Act of 2013, which would \ncreate comprehensive sanctions against anyone who finances the \nmurderous actions of Bashar al-Assad or sustains his military.\n  I have also written the U.S. Department of Treasury urging them to \ntake action against Russian banks that have undermined U.S. sanctions \nby facilitating transactions with the Syrian Government. That is \nright--Russian banks facilitating actions with the Syrian Government. \nSanctions on them can have an effect because their activities have \nreportedly included facilitating payments for S-300 missile batteries, \nAssad's personal offshore funds, as well as payments for crude oil. In \nmy view, these institutions--Russian banks, the financial structure of \nRussia--are complicit in prolonging the brutal conflict in Syria and \nshould be barred from the U.S. financial system.\n  Secretary Kerry said in February:\n\n       Russia needs to be part of the solution, not contributing \n     so many more weapons and so much more aid that they are \n     really enabling Assad to double down.\n\n  As the majority leader has said, we need to act quickly on the \nlegislation before us. But let's begin and let this action be the \nbeginning of the Senate working together on a bipartisan basis to push \nback against Russian adventurism and aggression in all its forms, \nwhether it is in Crimea or Syria, and the institutions--financial, \nenergy, and otherwise--that support those efforts. I look forward to \njoining with my colleagues in those efforts and approving this \nimportant measure.\n\n\n                           GM Call for Action\n\n  Madam President, there is no question at this hour on the Senate \nfloor that serious and severe defects in the ignition switches in \nGeneral Motors vehicles have caused at least 31 crashes and 12 deaths. \nThat tragic loss of life--not even counting the damage to cars, \nresulting in economic loss, and the injuries to people, resulting in \nsuffering and emotional pain--is part of a situation that calls for \naction. These defects meant that in a car going full speed down the \nhighway, simply bumping or weighing down the key in the ignition could \ncause the engine to shut down--as well as disabling the airbags.\n  That situation has prompted leadership on the part of a number of my \ncolleagues, and I want to thank Senator Markey for his legislative \nproposal on NHTSA, Senator McCaskill for her convening a hearing of our \nconsumer protection subcommittee of the commerce committee, as well as \nothers who have taken action to criticize General Motors.\n  There is also no question, as the New York Times reported this past \nSaturday, that GM was aware of that situation--those problems with the \nswitches--as early as 2001. That was 8 years before GM went into \nbankruptcy. The old GM and the new GM were separated. Now the \nDepartment of Justice is investigating whether GM committed fraud when \nit did not disclose those defects in the context of its 2009 \nbankruptcy.\n  I have been a Federal prosecutor, and I can tell you about people who \nhave been prosecuted very severely for lying to banks or lying to the \nFederal Government--lying to banks when they got a loan sometimes for \nas little as a couple of thousand dollars and false statements to the \nFederal Government in connection with a seemingly small matter.\n  At the time it went into bankruptcy and then emerged, GM signed a \ndocument--section 6.12--entitled ``True and Complete Disclosure,'' and \nit said to the Federal Government that in return for not a couple of \nthousand dollars, not even a couple million dollars, not a couple of \nbillion dollars, but tens of billions of dollars, more than $40 \nbillion--I am quoting:\n\n       There is no fact known to a Responsible Person of any Loan \n     Party that, after due inquiry, could reasonably be expected \n     to have a Material Adverse Effect that has not been disclosed \n     herein.\n\n  It also said that the documents that were submitted to the U.S. \nGovernment at that time ``do not contain any untrue statement of \nmaterial fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the \nstatements herein or therein.''\n  And that section is replete with other representations that now \npretty clearly were false because those defects and the role of those \ndefects in causing the crashes were known to GM. It knew also that \nthose defects and the death, injury, and damage seem almost certainly \nthen and now to be a material fact and have a material adverse effect \non that agreement.\n  Well, when GM was restructured in 2009, it was split into an old GM, \nwhich took most of the bad assets, such as GM's closed-down plants, and \nthe new GM, which took the good assets. Old GM took the liability for \naccidents that occurred before the bankruptcy, effectively granting the \nnew GM a shield from responsibility but not a shield from criminal \nliability. That is why the Department of Justice investigation is so \ncritically important in holding GM officials and GM itself responsible.\n  Although some prebankruptcy claims have been settled, they have a \ngreatly reduced pool of money to draw upon so that the potential claims \non the part of those 12 families whose loved ones perished, not to \nmention the injured parties who are due money for their suffering as \nwell as economic loss and others who may have claims--all those claims \nwill be without recourse unless something is done.\n  Let's be clear about the 2009 bankruptcy. It was not the kind of \nreorganization that involved Manville, where a fund was created with a \ntrustee. That kind of reorganization is a way that bankruptcies are \noften pursued. This was a sale of assets. It was fast and easy because \nthe government wanted it so. And, of course, the old GM and the new \nGM--GM officials, shareholders, everyone interested--wanted it to be \nso.\n  I was serving as attorney general of Connecticut at the time, and I \nwarned\n\n[[Page S1724]]\n\nthat this bankruptcy agreement would leave many injured victims without \nrecourse. I led a group of eight State attorneys general in warning the \nFederal Government--which supported and sponsored the bankruptcy plan--\nthat the situation we see now would come to pass. I don't take a lot of \nsatisfaction in knowing that now we have learned the real facts GM \nconcealed then. I don't take any satisfaction in the potential denial \nof what is due to the victims of GM's concealment, not to mention its \nreprehensible and potentially illegal failure to repair those defects \nrather than conceal them. But, unfortunately, that is what has \nhappened.\n  Due to GM's failure to disclose that known defect in its vehicles and \nfacts that will continue to come to light in this investigation, \neverything suggests that this failure to disclose was, in fact, \ndeliberate, fraudulent concealment of information from consumers and \nfrom government officials. That is criminal, and that is why the \nDepartment of Justice is investigating.\n  As we stand here, we may be too early to reach conclusions but not \ntoo early for the Department of Justice to make things right and for GM \nto do the right thing.\n  Yesterday I sent a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder. I told \nGeneral Holder respectfully that I believe the Federal Government has a \nmoral if not a legal obligation to take certain steps to protect \ninnocent consumers, and I requested that he give it his personal \nattention. I do that again today--make that request--and urge his \npersonal attention.\n  Although consumer victims may be barred from seeking relief before \nthe bankruptcy court, the Department of Justice can take steps now in \nthe context of this criminal investigation that could greatly help \npeople who have been injured--innocent victims who were driving that \ncar down the freeway or on a country road when the ignition was bumped, \nwhen the key ring had too many keys and their car stopped, the airbag \nfailed to operate, and some died.\n  I requested the DOJ to have GM establish a fund to compensate injured \nconsumers. It is a civil remedy that can be done as an interim step in \na criminal prosecution. The Department of Justice has the authority to \nrequest many kinds of relief, and in light of the continuity of \npersonnel between the old GM and the new GM, this kind of remedy would \nbe absolutely appropriate for the new GM and it could simply allocate \nsome of its assets. And fortunately it is doing well. No one begrudges \nGM its success. We welcome its profitability. But it can do what is \nright and use some of those profits to correct this wrong.\n  If necessary, the Department of Justice also could enter into a \ndeferred prosecution agreement, as it did recently with Toyota, and it \nreached a settlement there of $1.2 billion.\n  There is also a precedent for criminal investigations of this nature \nbeing resolved by settlements in the BP oil spill in the Gulf of \nMexico. A $4 billion criminal settlement was distributed among groups \nworking to mitigate the spill's effects and prevent future problems, \nincluding the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, which has done \ngreat work, and the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund.\n  If such a settlement were reached here, there should be priority on \nensuring that funds compensate consumers who suffered the worst \nlosses--the loved ones of people killed as well as the innocent victims \nwho were injured or suffered economic loss.\n  In addition to the fund, I also requested that the Department of \nJustice intervene in pending civil actions to oppose GM's effort to \ndeny knowledge or responsibility for damage. What GM has done is to \nremove State court cases to Federal court and then asked for a transfer \nto the bankruptcy court, all the while knowing that the bankruptcy \nproceeding cannot be reopened, and in any event the old GM has vastly \ninsufficient assets to satisfy any real judgment.\n  I believe there are answers here that will satisfy fairness and \njustice and enable GM to live up to the integrity and image that befits \nthem. I believe that the Department of Justice, or another consumer \nprotection agency, must ensure that consumers are aware of the \npotential dangers in this continuing defective series of vehicles, \nincluding the Cobalt, the Saturn, and other models over those same \nyears.\n  I would never let one of my children behind the wheel of one of those \ncars without a major repair. I don't know that anyone else should--or \nanyone driving themselves--be behind the wheel of these cars.\n  When a large national company such as GM markets a product, they have \na responsibility. They have a moral and legal responsibility to ensure \nthat the product is safe. When one of those companies--any company--\nbecomes aware of safety issues, it has a responsibility to disclose \nthem.\n  I joined a bill--with the leadership of Senator Markey--that would \nrequire better, faster disclosure by NHTSA, and I will speak on another \noccasion about the lapses in responsibility on the part of Federal \nwatchdogs who failed to protect the public, failed to detect a pattern \nof problems in these cars, and failed to blow the whistle.\n  GM has its own responsibility, and I know that a new era of \nleadership at GM under a new leader may mean a new day in its \nacknowledging its moral and legal responsibility, and I hope for that \nnew day.\n  The innocent victims of defective cars suffered life-ending and life-\nchanging injuries. Many of them could have been avoided but for the \npurposefully misleading and deceptive conduct by GM. Our responsibility \nnow is to see that justice is done either through ensuring that \ncompensation is made available or through appropriate criminal \nenforcement or both. The criminal law, as we know in this body, is a \nmeans of seeking justice, and it can provide a good outcome if it is \nproperly framed and enforced.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

MANNING\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I congratulate Jean Manning on her \nretirement from the Senate and thank her for her 21 years of dedicated \nservice. Her wise counsel will be missed in the Senate. That is why the \nSenate recently passed S. Res. 391 designating Jean Manning as Chief \nCounsel for Employment Emeritus of the United States Senate.\n  Jean grew up in the heart of Chicago and received three degrees from \nthe University of Illinois--a B.A., an M.B.A., and a J.D. While \npursuing her law degree, Jean was a member and the articles editor of \nthe University of Illinois Law Review and was awarded the Rickert Award \nfor Excellence in Legal Writing. Not forgetting where she came from, \ntoday Jean remains very active at the University of Illinois, where she \nis a member of the University of Illinois Foundation and of the College \nof Law Board of Advisors, serving as president at one time.\n  In the early 1990s, Congress as a workplace underwent a sea change \nwhen all major employment laws became applicable. In 1993, following a \nnationwide search, Jean was tapped to establish and manage the Office \nof the Senate Chief Counsel for Employment. She and her staff helped \nguide Senate offices as these employment laws were implemented and has \ncontinued to assist our offices to this day. Jean has counseled Senate \noffices to ensure compliance with the Equal Pay Act, the Family and \nMedical Leave Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Age \nDiscrimination in Employment Act and many other laws. It was her \nresponsibility to see that Senate offices understood and followed \nemployment laws so that Senate employees have the rights and \nprotections the laws provide.\n  To Jean's credit, the Office of the Senate Chief Counsel for \nEmployment\n\n[[Page S1725]]\n\nhas earned a stellar reputation throughout the Senate. Her office \nprovides impartial and discreet legal advice, training, and \nrepresentation to Senate committees, support services, and the 247 \nSenators who have served in this body since Jean's hiring. Jean and the \nattorneys under her supervision have resolved countless administrative \nmatters within the Senate and have always been ready to assist with any \nquestion a Senate office may have on employment matters. Considering \nthe Senate is comprised of some 150 offices--Member, committee, and \nsupport services--this is no small task.\n  Jean also has represented Senate offices at all levels of the Federal \ncourt system, including the U.S. Supreme Court.

Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senator Isakson \nand Representatives Dingell and Whitfield in the introduction of the \nSunscreen Innovation Act.\n  According to the American Cancer Society, skin cancer is the most \ncommon form of cancer in the United States. In 2014, over 2 million \npeople will be diagnosed with skin cancer, and 20 percent of Americans \nwill get skin cancer at some point during their lifetime. Melanoma, a \ndangerous form of skin cancer that often spreads throughout the body if \nnot treated, will be diagnosed in an estimated 76,000 individuals this \nyear, and will take the lives of almost 10,000 Americans. Many skin \ncancers are preventable with the use of effective sunscreen and by \navoiding certain activities, like the excessive use of tanning beds.\n  Throughout my time in Congress, I have been working to ensure \nconsumers have adequate information to prevent skin cancer. For \nexample, I authored the 2007 Tanning Accountability and Notification \nAct, which has helped spur the Food and Drug Administration's, FDA \nreview of indoor tanning bed labels. Through letters to the FDA and \nreport language in the annual appropriations bill, I continue to press \nthe FDA to implement new tanning bed labeling standards found to be \nmost effective in warning consumers about the harm caused by indoor \ntanning.\n  In addition, after working with my former colleague, Senator Chris \nDodd, since 1997 to compel the FDA to strengthen sunscreen labeling \nstandards, in 2011 the FDA finally began to take action to finalize \nparts of the sunscreen monograph relating to the testing and labeling \nof sunscreen lotions. These regulations were over 30 years in the \nmaking. Last year, I urged the FDA to complete its review of sunscreen \nsprays and the use of sun protection factor, SPF, numbers higher than \n50 on product labels.\n  One barrier to improved sunscreens has been the rate at which new \nover-the-counter, OTC sunscreen ingredients have been approved by the \nFDA. Indeed, the last such ingredient approved by the FDA was in the \n1990s, with the eight new ingredients submitted since 2002 still \nawaiting review. It is critical that the FDA perform its due diligence \nto guarantee that the sunscreen products are safe and effective, but \nthis review process also needs to occur in a timeline that allows these \nnecessary products to get into the hands of consumers.\n  Many of these ingredients have been used in sunscreen products in \nEurope, Asia, and Central and South America, in some cases for many \nyears. Unfortunately, delays in the FDA review process have kept these \nproducts off of the shelves in the United States for years while \nawaiting approval.\n  Our bipartisan, bicameral Sunscreen Innovation Act aims to improve \nthe application process for these new OTC ingredients and ensure \nconsumers have access to new and potentially more effective sunscreen \nproducts in a timely manner. Americans have waited far too long for the \nmost advanced, effective ways to protect themselves from the sun.\n  I am pleased that this legislation has the support of the PASS \nCoalition, which is made up of such organizations as the Melanoma \nResearch Alliance, the Prevent Cancer Foundation, the Skin Cancer \nFoundation, and many others.\n  I look forward to working with these and other stakeholders, as well \nas Senator Isakson, Representatives Dingell and Whitfield, and the rest \nof our colleagues to pass the Sunscreen Innovation Act in order to \nimprove access to new and more effective sunscreen products. Indeed, as \nwe look to the coming warmer months, it is important that we undertake \nserious efforts that will give consumers greater peace of mind that the \nsunscreen products they purchase offer the strongest possible \nprotection against the sun's harmful rays.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/25/senate-section/article/S1725-2", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1725-S1726]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           GOULDSBORO, MAINE\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I wish to commemorate the 225th \nanniversary of the town of Gouldsboro, ME. Known today as a beautiful \ngateway to the Schoodic Peninsula section of Acadia National Park, \nGouldsboro was built with a spirit of determination and resiliency that \nstill guides the community today.\n  Gouldsboro's incorporation in 1789 was but one milestone on a long \njourney of progress. For more than 10,000 years, the area was a \nfavorite hunting and fishing grounds of the Abenaki, the Native \nAmerican tribe of northeastern North America. The name ``Schoodic'' \ncomes from their word for a place of plentiful fish in waters kept ice-\nfree through the winter by the moderating currents of the Gulf of \nMaine. The reverence of the Abenaki for nature remains strong among all \nwho call the peninsula home today.\n  The original name of Acadia National Park--Sieur de Monts National \nMonument recognizes the ongoing influence of the French explorers who \nvisited the area in the early 1600s. In 1763, the Seven Years' War \nbetween France and Great Britain for control of North America ended \nwith a British victory. With peace came bold pioneers seeking \nopportunity.\n  The first recorded non-Native American settler on the peninsula was \nThomas Frazer, who built a salt works at the mouth of a creek that \ntoday bears his name. Another early settler was the town's namesake, \nRobert Gould, whose untiring efforts and boundless optimism helped \nattract new members to the growing community. By the early 1800s, \nGouldsboro was a thriving town of lumber and grain mills, fishing, and \nshipbuilding.\n  The character of the people of Gouldsboro of years gone by and of \ntoday is best represented by one of the town's historic treasures, the \nbell of the SS Queen Victoria. In 1864, leaders of the Canadian \nConfederation gathered on that great steamship anchored at \nCharlottetown, Prince Edward Island, and reached the agreement to found \na new nation.\n  Two years later, the Queen Victoria sank in a hurricane off the coast \nof Cape Hatteras, NC. Captain Rufus Allen, from the Gouldsboro village \nof Prospect Harbor, steered his Gouldsboro-built brig Ponvert into \nharm's way and was able to rescue 42 of the 43 officers and crew. In \nrecognition of his heroism, Captain Allen was presented with one of the \nfew items saved from the doomed steamship--the bronze bell. He gave the \n95-pound bell to the Prospect Harbor School upon his retirement in \n1875.\n  In 2004, 138 years after Captain Allen's daring rescue, the people of \nGouldsboro recognized the significance of the Queen Victoria to \nCanadian history and commissioned Prospect Harbor artist and craftsman \nDick Fisher to create a replica, which was given to the people of \nCharlottetown.\n  That single gesture reaffirmed Gouldsboro's connection to the sea and \nstrengthened the enduring friendship between the United States and \nCanada.\n  Today, Gouldsboro is a place where fishing families and summer \nvisitors cherish that connection to the sea. Through hard work and \ningenuity, Gouldsboro has become not just a gateway but an essential \npart of the Acadia experience. With its charming villages, working \nwaterfronts, artist studios, and many recreation opportunities, \nGouldsboro is a true gem on the Maine coast.\n\n[[Page S1726]]\n\n  One of Gouldsboro's early and most influential citizens was David \nCobb of Massachusetts, a hero of the American Revolution who served as \nGeneral Washington's aide during the British surrender at Yorktown.\n  As the war neared its end and American independence was secured, \nGeneral Washington urged his aide to leave rocky and cold New England \nand make his future in Virginia, which he argued had a superior climate \nand more fertile soil. With his sights already set on Maine, Colonel \nCobb replied, ``Sir, we have our heads and our hands.''\n  That is the spirit that made a thriving town out of the wilderness \nmore than two centuries ago and that sustains a vibrant community \ntoday. It is a pleasure to congratulate the people of Gouldsboro, ME, \non their 225th anniversary and to wish them all the best in the years \nto come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/25/senate-section/article/S1726-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1726]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         COSI 50TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN.

In 1964, COSI opened its doors as a hands-on center of \nscience education. Fifty years later, COSI has witnessed tremendous \ngrowth and expansion as well as national recognition. COSI has welcomed \nmore than 30 million visitors from all 50 States and in 2008 COSI was \nnamed America's No. 1 science center for families by Parents Magazine.\n  COSI has collaborated with schools and organizations across Ohio to \nprovide interactive STEM education in order to prepare our children for \nthe future, and inspire the innovators of tomorrow. Part of COSI's \nmission is to ``motivate a desire toward a better understanding of \nscience, industry, health, and history . . . for the enrichment of the \nindividual and for a more rewarding life on our planet, Earth.'' They \naccomplish this mission through partnerships with organizations \nincluding WOSU@COSI, the only working television station in a science \ncenter, the Columbus Historical Society, and Battelle.\n  I have visited COSI a number of times, starting with my children when \nthey were in grade school. I have been able to see firsthand the great \nexperience it provides to visitors. I am pleased to honor 50 years of \nsuccess as COSI continues to lead the way in science education in Ohio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/25/senate-section/article/S1726-2", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1726]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO ROSS ARAGON\n\n Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, today we recognize the \ndistinguished public service of Ross Aragon on the occasion of his \nretirement after serving 36 years as mayor of Pagosa Springs--the \nlongest serving mayor in Colorado. Since taking office in 1978, Mayor \nAragon has fulfilled his duties with passion, diligence, and honor. \nOver his more than three decades of service he has never missed a \nregular monthly scheduled meeting. For over a generation, the citizens \nof Pagosa Springs have known Ross Aragon as the best man for the job.\n  Mayor Aragon's steadfast approach to city management led to many \nnotable accomplishments, including improving the quality of police and \nfire protection, expanding the community's recreational programs and \nfacilities, and establishing the town's popular river walk. He also \nspearheaded the development of the San Juan River's kayaking, rafting, \nand tubing features, improving the community for both residents and \ntourists alike.\n  Of his many achievements, which are too many to list here, two \nprojects in particular embody Mayor Aragon's approach to leadership \nmore than most: his advocacy for local food produced using Pagosa \nSprings' geothermal resources was a clear demonstration of Mayor \nAragon's ability to harness Pagosa's rich assets and translate them \ninto a brighter future; and his successful efforts to designate Chimney \nRock as a national monument exemplified the enthusiasm, dedication, and \ncollaborative mindset Mayor Aragon brought to his job. Thanks to his \nleadership, an important part of Southwest Colorado's cultural heritage \nwill forever be protected.\n  On behalf of Pagosa Springs in particular and Southwest Colorado in \ngeneral, thank you, Mayor Aragon, for your many years of public \nservice. We wish you well in your retirement and we can't wait to see \nwhat challenges you tackle next.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/25/senate-section/article/S1726-3", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1726]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JOHN LANIGAN\n\n Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I wish to honor John Lanigan, the \nlongtime northeast Ohio radio personality, who will broadcast his final \nshow on WMJI/Cleveland on March 31, 2014.\n  John and I haven't always agreed on all of the issues, but he has \nalways been well-read and outspoken, and his at times sharp-witted, \ncontroversial personality captured the attention of Cleveland \nlisteners, whether you agreed with him or not.\n  John grew up in Ogallala, NE, and got his start in radio broadcasting \nwhile still in high school. He worked in Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, \nand Colorado--where he would work the overnight shift in Denver and \nthen travel to Colorado Springs for the dayshift--before coming to \nCleveland in 1970.\n  He was hired at WGAR to replace Don Imus, and, within a year, the \nshow's ratings had nearly doubled, no doubt thanks to his trademark \nstyle of interjecting jokes in between songs.\n  John would go on to Tampa for 2 years, but returned to Cleveland and \nWMJI in 1985, where he made his mark.\n  In 1989, comedian Jimmy Malone appeared on the show, and the \n``Lanigan and Malone Show'' was created soon after. No topic was off \nlimits for John--politics, sports, music, and entertainment--he covered \nit all. And, if you were a guest, you had better come prepared because \nJohn was always ready to fire off the tough questions.\n  John would occasionally take the show on the road to DC and broadcast \nlive from my office in the Senate. I would arrange for guests like \nthen-Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton or Barack Obama, to come on and be \ninterviewed with me.\n  While John cemented his loyal following on the radio, they came with \nhim when he took his skills to the silver screen, hosting a weekly TV \nshow named ``Prize Movie'' on WUAB.\n  While he is not on the air, John dedicates his time to benefitting \nhis adopted city. He volunteers for the Our Lady of the Wayside, an \norganization that serves hundreds of children and adults with \ndevelopmental disabilities throughout northeast Ohio, even winning \ntheir Starlight Guardian Humanitarian Award in 2012.\n  John came to Cleveland nearly 40 years ago, and though his talents \ncould have taken him to any big city in the country, he chose to stay \nin Cleveland. He won the ear of his listeners and viewers because they \ncould trust him.\n  It is that admirable trait that we will miss with his retirement, but \nit is also what has earned him this retirement--and no more early \nmorning wake-up calls.\n  John, I wish you all the best in your retirement. Thank you for all \nyou have done for your listeners, viewers, and for the city of \nCleveland.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/25/senate-section/article/S1726-4", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1726-S1727]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     FIGHT AGAINST CHILDHOOD HUNGER\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, on this day I hope Marylanders \nacross our State can ``Hear the Maryland Crunch!'' of students eating a \nhealthy school breakfast. Thanks to the leadership of Maryland Hunger \nSolutions, the ``Hear the Maryland Crunch!'' campaign offers all \nMarylanders the opportunity to become more aware of the daily struggle \nof our food insecure children and stand together in support of school \nbreakfast. I wish to continue to highlight this critical issue facing \nour children.\n  Maryland has the highest median income in the nation. Yet even in \nMaryland one in five children is food insecure. These children lack \nconsistent access to adequate food resources. Yet I am happy to \nannounce we are making strides to ensure our children are fed and ready \nto learn. Approximately 262,000 students in Maryland participate in the \n100 percent federally funded National School Lunch Program and receive \neither free or reduced price lunches. These students know that when \nthey come to school, they are able to receive a nutritious school \nlunch.\n  Only 149,000 children or 59 percent of students receiving a school \nlunch start\n\n[[Page S1727]]\n\ntheir day ready to learn with a school breakfast. At this time, \nMaryland ranks 14th in the nation in school breakfast participation \nrate after making tremendous progress over the past 5 years to ensure \nall children have access to nutritious meals. Over the course of 5 \nyears Maryland's school breakfast program participation rate has \nincreased by 37 percent, and our school lunch participation rate has \nmore than doubled with a 56 percent increase.\n  I am encouraged by these developments and efforts to continue to \nexpand school breakfast access for all children. Marylanders are united \nin the vision that the ability of children to learn and succeed in our \nclassrooms should not be impaired because they come to school hungry. \nThanks to the partnership between Governor Martin O'Malley, the \nMaryland General Assembly, national organizations such as the Share Our \nStrength's No Kid Hungry campaign, the Family League of Baltimore, and \nMaryland Hunger Solutions, our State has continued to make efforts to \nexpand access to school breakfast with the Maryland Meals for \nAchievement Program.\n  Maryland Meals for Achievement allows schools where 40 percent of \nstudents or more qualify for free or reduced price school lunch to \nprovide school breakfast meals for all students at no cost to the \nchild. This program combines the expansion of the school breakfast \nprogram with innovative efforts to encourage increased participation, \nincluding a change in the traditional breakfast delivery model of \nserving school breakfast meals in the cafeteria to an in-classroom \nsetting. Schools have shown a positive increase in school breakfast \nparticipation rates from the new ``Grab and Go'' breakfasts or \n``Breakfast After the Bell'' programs, allowing more students to be \nbetter prepared to succeed in the classroom. I commend Governor \nO'Malley for requesting additional funding this fiscal year for the \nMaryland Meals for Achievement Program that will allow an additional \n40,000 students to receive a healthy breakfast.\n  According to a study sponsored by the Share Our Strength's No Kid \nHungry campaign, research has shown students who receive a school \nbreakfast are better prepared to learn and perform in their classwork, \nare less likely to be overweight, have more strength and endurance \nthroughout the day, are less likely to cause classroom disruptions, and \nare less likely to be absent from school than if they were not \nreceiving a school breakfast.\n  In closing, I am honored to join with Maryland Hunger Solutions and \nMarylanders across our State who are committed to do better for our \nchildren. On this Maryland day, we reflect on our rich past and look \nforward to a bright future in which the only hunger our schoolchildren \nhave is a hunger to learn. I am proud that Maryland is leading the \nfight against childhood hunger. Together, let's all ``Hear the Maryland \nCrunch!''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/25/senate-section/article/S1727-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1727-S1728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              MARYLAND DAY\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I wish to celebrate Maryland Day \nand the proud history of my home State. Marylanders across the State \nare taking a moment to reflect on our proud history and contributions \nto the Nation. I wish to spend a few minutes to highlight the \nimportance of this State holiday and the activities that are underway.\n  On this day 380 years ago, two ships commissioned by Lord Baltimore, \nThe Ark and The Dove, carried the first English settlers to land at St. \nClement's Island in what is now recognized as St. Mary's County. \nLeonard Calvert, a son of Lord Baltimore who eventually served as the \nfirst Governor of Maryland, led the 150 settlers who came ashore to St. \nClement's Island after spending more than four months at sea. This \nlanding represented the first time European settlers came to Maryland \nand those settlers eventually formed just the third English colony to \nbe settled in British North America.\n  The origin of Maryland Day began with the Maryland State Board of \nEducation placing an emphasis on State and local histories in public \nschools. In 1903, the Maryland State Board of Education officially \nrecognized Maryland Day as a tool for students and teachers to increase \ninstruction of Maryland history in public schools. The Maryland General \nAssembly, which held its first session in St. Mary's County not long \nafter the landing at St. Clement's Island, enacted Maryland Day as an \nofficial State holiday in 1916. Young learners across our State will \nspend today learning about the significant contributions of Maryland to \nthe Nation and important historical figures in Maryland.\n  I am proud to say that every region of my home State has played a \nrole in shaping our Nation. From the Eastern Shore of Maryland, for \ninstance, Harriet Ross Tubman was born into slavery in 1820 in \nBuckstown, MD along the marshes of the Blackwater River in Dorchester \nCounty. After learning she would be sold to settle her late master's \ndebts, Tubman escaped from slavery to Philadelphia, PA, marking the \nfirst of many expeditions over the course of the next 11 years to and \nfrom the Eastern Shore of Maryland to lead nearly 70 slaves out of \nslavery. In addition to becoming a famous conductor on the Underground \nRailroad, she held a lifelong commitment to the women's suffrage \nmovement and worked as a nurse, cook, spy, and scout for the Union Army \nduring the Civil War in Port Royal, SC. She became the first woman to \nlead an armed assault during the Civil War in Combahee Ferry Raid, \nliberating nearly 750 slaves. In her later years, she worked tirelessly \nfor the women's suffrage movement, speaking before countless women's \ngroups with fellow suffrage movement leaders Susan B. Anthony and Emily \nHowland. When asked if she believed women deserved the right to vote, \nshe would reply, ``I suffered enough to believe it.''\n  In Western Maryland, Maryland citizens played a key role in the \nmilitary and political struggles of the Civil War. The control of \nMaryland territory was crucial due to the State's proximity to \nWashington, DC, the State's border with Virginia and with other States \nthat remained in the Union, and Baltimore's position as a key railroad \nlink to the West. In 1862, GEN Robert E. Lee led his Confederate Army \nof Northern Virginia across the Potomac River around Leesburg, VA into \nMaryland, marking his first invasion into the North during the Civil \nWar. The Maryland Campaign consisted of a number of battles along \nMaryland's westernmost counties and often pitted Marylanders on \nopposite sides of the fighting. In the single bloodiest day battle in \nAmerican history, the Battle of Antietam in Sharpsburg, MD formed a \nturning point in the Civil War. With savage close range fighting \nlasting over a period of 12 hours, the Union and Confederate forces \nsuffered nearly 23,000 total casualties. This battle forced General Lee \nto withdraw his Confederate Army back across the Potomac River into \nVirginia, thus ending the invasion of the North and the last major \nbattle that took place on Union soil. The people of Maryland honor \nthose who valiantly fought in the Civil War, endured the hardships \nbrought on by the conflict, and made the ultimate sacrifice in order to \nform a more perfect Union.\n  Perhaps the most recognizable contribution Maryland has provided to \nour Nation is the national anthem. During the War of 1812, British \ntroops enacted heavy damage to Washington, DC, setting both the U.S. \nCapitol and the White House ablaze. The British forces then marched \ntowards Baltimore. Citizens of Baltimore, including free blacks, \nquickly mobilized to protect their city. Barricades stretching more \nthan 1 mile long were constructed to protect the harbor, hulls were \nsunk to impede navigation, and a chain of masts was erected across the \nharbor entrance. When the British fleet approached Baltimore at North \nPoint, Marylanders fought the British Army and helped repulse the \nBritish Navy from Fort McHenry during the Battle of Baltimore. It's \nimportant to note that American forces during the Battle of North Point \nwere volunteer militia, heavily outnumbered by the highly trained \nBritish infantry, but they managed to delay the British forces long \nenough for 10,000 American reinforcements to arrive, preventing a land \nattack against Baltimore. Following 25 hours of intense British naval \nbombardment at Fort McHenry, the American defenders refused to yield, \nand the British were forced to depart.\n  During the bombardment, American lawyer Francis Scott Key, who was\n\n[[Page S1728]]\n\nbeing held on board an American flag-of-truce vessel in Baltimore \nHarbor, took notice of the American flag still flying atop Fort \nMcHenry. Key realized then that the Americans had survived the battle \nand stopped the enemy advance. He was so moved by the sight of the \nAmerican flag flying following the horrific bombardment, he composed a \npoem called the ``The Defense of Fort McHenry,'' which was published in \nthe Baltimore Patriot and Advertiser newspaper later that year. This \npoem, and later the song, inspired love of country among the American \npeople and not only helped usher in the Era of Good Feelings \nimmediately after the war, but became a timeless reminder of American \nresolve. ``The Star Spangled Banner'' officially became our national \nanthem in 1931. The flag that flew over Fort McHenry and inspired this \nanthem is now a national treasure on display at the Smithsonian \nInstitution, a very short distance from where we are today.\n  On this Maryland Day, Marylanders are in the midst of celebrating \nBaltimore's role in the bicentennial anniversary of the War of 1812. \nThe Pride of Baltimore II, named in honor of the Baltimore clipper the \nChasseur, set sail from the Baltimore Inner Harbor to the State capital \nwhile carrying a replica of the Star Spangled Banner ``that was still \nthere'' after the bombardment of Fort McHenry in September 1814. Sewn \nby volunteers of the Maryland Historical Society, this flag will be \npresented to Governor Martin O'Malley and members of the Maryland \nGeneral Assembly at the Annapolis Statehouse.\n  I am proud of the legacy of my home State and the efforts Marylanders \nhave made and continue to make to remember those who have come before \nus. I thank all of those who participated in Maryland Day ceremonies \nand congratulate the students who learned something new about our great \nState today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/25/senate-section/article/S1728-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             CONGRATULATING PENNY REYNOLDS AND ANDREA DAVIS\n\n Mr. HELLER.

Mr. President, this month, the Utah Valley Chamber of \nCommerce will honor Raymond John Noorda, posthumously, with the 2014 \n``Pillar of the Valley'' Award. I would like to take a moment to \nrecognize the achievements of this great Utahn.\n  Raymond Noorda, or ``Ray,'' as everyone knew him, was born in Ogden, \nUT in 1924 to Dutch immigrants, Bertus and Alida Noorda. Like nearly \nall Americans who grew up during the Depression, Ray learned the virtue \nof hard work early on, and he never stopped working throughout his \nlife. The Deseret News reports that during his youth, Ray worked ``in a \ncandy shop, setting pins in a bowling alley, as a loading clerk at a \ntrain station, picking cherries, selling magazines, and even herding \nsheep.''\n  He was an outstanding baseball player, and he was asked to join a \nprofessional team right out of high school. However, his mother had \nother plans for young Ray, and he subsequently enrolled in classes at \nWeber State College. During World War II, Ray put school on hold and \nserved in the Navy as an electronics technician, working on radar \nsystems. At the conclusion of his military service, he returned to his \nstudies, transferring from Weber to the University of Utah, where he \nearned a degree in engineering. Ray married his sweetheart Tye shortly \nafter graduating from college, and they were together for 56 years, \nuntil Ray's passing in 2006.\n  After his graduation from college, Ray worked for General Electric \nfor 21 years, where he was known as an innovator and entrepreneur. He \neventually left the company and led a number of businesses to success \nin the following years. In the early 1980s, Ray became the leader of a \nstruggling Utah company called Novell Data Systems, which would shortly \nthereafter become Novell.\n  Ray worked to put together a team of engineers, dubbed ``SuperSet.'' \nThe team eventually invented powerful networking software, which opened \nthe doors to modern networking. For this and other contributions, Ray \nhas been called the ``Father of Network Computing.'' This development \nset Novell on a path to success and pushed the company far ahead of \ntheir early competitors in computer networking throughout the 1980s and \ninto the 1990s.\n  Of Novell's success under Ray's leadership, The Independent reported, \n``Novell's NetWare product was to become the de facto standard \nnetworking software from the late 1980s through to the mid-1990s. \nNoorda oversaw the growth of the company from 17 to 12,000 staff, \nwhilst still maintaining a community spirit for his employees, whom he \ntreated with immense respect and who, in turn, affectionately referred \nto him as Uncle Ray.'''\n  Ray was a visionary and humble leader, who believed that cooperation \nwith competitors would help grow the emerging computer networking \nindustry. Thus, he led his company with a term he coined--``co-\nopetition''--and Novell was a leader in cooperative advancements in the \ncomputing industry. One of Novell's Vice Presidents once said of Ray, \n``What he preaches is what you always wanted to hear from your father--\nlove, sharing--and he uses those words.'' When Ray spoke to employees, \nhe was rarely, if ever, without a joke, and he was always positive and \nencouraging.\n  Ray's success in business was a testament to his personal character \nand virtues. He loved children, and enjoyed serving in his church. His \nphilanthropy knew no bounds, and his family continues that legacy in \nUtah and throughout the country each day. Ray was a titan of business, \nand his life is a shining example for not only business leaders, but \nalso Americans in general. I join with the Utah Valley Chamber in \nhonoring his wife Tye and his family, and I thank them for their \nsupport of such a great man. I pray that we will honor the life of Ray \nNoorda by doing the best we can in our individual capacities, and by \nhelping those around us achieve greatness, success, and happiness \nthroughout life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/25/senate-section/article/S1728-3", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1728-S1729]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO ELDER DALLIN H. OAKS\n\n Mr. LEE. Mr. President, this month, the Utah Valley Chamber of \nCommerce will honor Elder Dallin H. Oaks, of the Quorum of the Twelve \nApostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, with the \n2014 ``Pillar of the Valley'' Award. I would like to take a moment to \nrecognize the achievements of\n\n[[Page S1729]]\n\nthis great man who is dear to my heart.\n  Elder Oaks was born in Provo, UT in 1932. He spent his youth in Utah \nValley and Vernal, and he started working from a very young age to \nsupport his two younger siblings and widowed mother. Elder Oaks \nremembers that his mother was ``an extraordinary mother,'' who gave him \n``a great deal of responsibility and freedom'' and ``encouraged [him] \nto have a job.'' He graduated from Brigham Young High School in 1950, \nwhere he was the senior class president and played on the football \nteam. He also became a licensed first-class radiotelephone operator in \nhis teenage years.\n  Elder Oaks was a member of the National Guard from 1949 to 1954. \nDuring this period, he met his wife June Dixon, and they were married \nin 1952. They raised six beautiful children together. After more than \n45 years of marriage, June, stricken with cancer, passed from this \nmortal existence. Elder Oaks' extraordinary faith and trust in God's \nplan during this time of trial was an example for all of us who have \nlost a loved one to cancer.\n  Elder Oaks has worked tirelessly to lift those around him and to \nachieve greatness throughout his life. After graduating from Brigham \nYoung University, BYU, with a bachelor's degree in accounting, Oaks \nwent on to law school at the University of Chicago. His hard work at \nChicago led him to the tremendous opportunity of clerking at the \nSupreme Court for Chief Justice Warren. He subsequently returned to \nChicago to go into private practice, and eventually joined the faculty \nat the University of Chicago.\n  It was during this time that my parents moved to Chicago so that my \nfather could earn his law degree at the University of Chicago. Elder \nOaks and June kindly welcomed them, and they became lifelong friends. \nWhile in Chicago, Elder Oaks also had the opportunity to serve as \nassistant state's attorney for Cook County, a position in which he \nexcelled.\n  After years of extraordinary work and service in Chicago, the Oaks \nfamily was called home to Utah Valley, as Elder Oaks was appointed \npresident of BYU in 1971. He was a brilliant leader, who inspired the \nstudents to learn as much as possible and to be advocates for virtue \nand goodness throughout the world. He also set a high bar for his \nsuccessors, one of whom was my father, who praised Elder Oaks as a man \nof great humility and wisdom.\n  After 9 years as president, he was nominated and confirmed as a \njustice of the Utah Supreme Court. Before and during his service as a \njustice, Elder Oaks was on multiple short lists for nomination to the \nSupreme Court of the United States. He served with distinction on the \nUtah Supreme Court from 1980 to 1984, when he resigned to answer a call \nto serve in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus \nChrist of Latter-day Saints. Placing his faith above worldly success, \nElder Oaks has travelled the world, bearing testimony of Jesus Christ \nand strengthening the faith of millions. He has been an ardent defender \nof religious liberty, and continually works to bring members of all \nfaiths together to accomplish good.\n  Elder Oaks has been an inspiration to millions of individuals all \nover the world. I congratulate him and his wife Kristen on their many \nwonderful accomplishments over the last 14 years together. Elder Oaks \nis not only an example of a genius legal mind to which all jurists, \nincluding myself, aspire, but also a tireless advocate for truth, \nvirtue, freedom, and goodness throughout the world. I am proud to say \nthat I know such an individual, and I believe that our world would be a \nmuch better place if more men strived to emulate his virtues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/25/senate-section/article/S1729-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1729]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:03 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 3771.

A bill to direct Federal investment in carbon capture and \nstorage and other clean coal technologies, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Advanced \nClean Coal Technology for Our Nation (ACCTION) Act. This bill seeks to \nremedy one of the main impediments to the development of advanced clean \ncoal technologies, in particular carbon capture and sequestration, CCS, \nby laying out concrete funding mechanisms to encourage investment, \ninnovation, and collaboration between the Federal Government and \ncompanies looking to build the next generation of coal-fired power \nplants in this country. The Federal Government continues to put in \nplace regulations that seek to further reduce emissions from our \nnation's coal-fired power plants, yet they provide little to no \nincentive for utilities and other coal stakeholders to invest in and \ndevelop advanced clean coal technologies.\n  The Federal Government invests heavily in our renewable resources and \nprovides an environment for oil and gas producers, efforts that I \nwholeheartedly support. However, if we are to truly invest in an all-\nof-the-above energy policy that will provide the most robust and \ndiverse portfolio of energy sources then we must find a path forward \nfor coal-fired power. The ACCTION Act will put coal back on a level \nplaying field with our other resources by incentivizing technologies \nthat reduce the carbon footprint of coal-fired power through Federal \nfunding programs, offering Federal support for private investment, and \nputting forth recommendations on how best to support future CCS \nprojects in the United States.\n  The ACCTION Act will increase Federal investment in clean coal \ntechnology by: developing large-scale carbon storage programs to \nsupport the commercial-scale application of enhanced oil recovery and \ngeologic storage of carbon dioxide; increasing access to and \nstreamlining existing Federal funding programs for coal projects and; \nrevamping existing research and development programs for advanced coal, \nand carbon capture and sequestration technologies by including \ntransformational coal-related technologies; increasing to 30 percent \nthe current tax credit for carbon sequestration from coal facilities; \nestablishing a variable price support for companies that capture \nCO2 for use in enhanced oil recovery operations; creating \nclean energy coal bonds to provide tax credits for coal-powered \nfacilities that sequester CO2 or meet efficiency targets; \nand requiring reports and recommendations to Congress on existing \ncarbon capture projects and how those projects can be duplicated with a \ncombination of public and private financing.\n  The ACCTION Act takes into account two very important realities and \nattempts to address the seemingly divergent points by looking for a \nsolution. First, the climate is changing, and we need to recognize we \nwill be functioning in a carbon constrained world moving forward. We \nwill have to continue to innovate and look for new ways to reduce \nemissions while at the same time meeting our energy needs. Second, coal \nis not going anywhere. The Energy Information Administration has stated \nthat coal will still be providing a third of our electricity decades \ninto the future. If we continue to support and invest in advanced \ntechnologies, coal will remain in the energy mix for decades beyond \nthat.\n  Finding a path forward for coal is critical for our Nation and my \nState. North Dakota is one of the top ten states for percentage of our \nelectricity generated from coal, with coal-fired power providing almost \n80 percent of the State's electricity needs. At the same time, our \nstate maintains some of the lowest rates per kilowatt-hour in the \nNation. North Dakota is also one of the top 10 coal producing States in \nthe Nation. It is estimated that over 4,000 North Dakotans were \ndirectly employed as a result of lignite-related coal activities in \n2012, and as many as 13,000 other jobs in the state were supported \nindirectly by the lignite coal industry.\n  Coal use continues to increase around the world, and if the United \nStates wants to truly be a leader on emissions reduction and advanced \nenergy technologies, then we must be fully committed in investing the \nnecessary funding and resources to develop and implement clean coal \ntechnologies here and abroad. These efforts will come with significant \ncosts, and will not happen overnight, but we must take the necessary \nsteps now to further reduce emissions while providing a path-forward \nfor coal-fired power.\n  Coal-fired power remains the most reliable, redundant, affordable \nsource of electricity for major portions of this country.
