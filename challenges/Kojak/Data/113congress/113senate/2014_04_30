Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 354, the \nminimum-wage legislation.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 354, S. 2223, a bill to \n     provide for an increase in the Federal minimum wage and to \n     amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend increased \n     expensing limitations and the treatment of certain real \n     property as section 179 property.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, following my remarks and those of the \nRepublican leader, the Senate will be in morning business until 10:30 \na.m. this morning. The Republicans will control the first half and the \nmajority will control the final half. Following morning business, the \ntime until noon will be equally divided and controlled between the two \nleaders or their designees prior to a cloture vote on the motion to \nproceed to the minimum-wage bill at 12 p.m. today. At 4 p.m. there will \nbe additional rollcall votes in relation to nominations.\n  Mr. President, later today, as I have announced, we are going to \nhave, we hope, the beginning of a debate on the increase of the Federal \nminimum wage. Millions of American workers will be watching how each \nSenator votes today. To them it is a matter of survival.\n  They will be observing to see if we ensure that a full-time worker in \nAmerica receives a livable wage.\n  For Republicans, this vote will demonstrate whether they truly care \nabout our economy. Republicans have fashioned themselves over the years \nas defenders of the economy. Congressional Republicans have told the \nAmerican people they are the party of jobs and financial prosperity. \nHow illogical then that the Senate Republicans today will not be \nsupportive of legislation to increase the minimum wage.\n  What is preventing my Republican colleagues from giving the American \nworkers a livable wage--a fair shot--knowing that 75 percent of the \nAmerican people support increasing the minimum wage? If Americans are \nsearching for an answer as to why they would refuse to raise the \nminimum wage, they should look no farther than the Republicans' \nbillionaire benefactors--I repeat, billionaire benefactors--the Koch \nbrothers. Absolutely no one was surprised yesterday when Americans for \nProsperity, which is only one of the Koch-funded political \norganizations, instructed Republicans in Congress to vote against a \nminimum-wage increase. They said: We are going to score this vote.\n  What does that mean? It means if you vote yes, you are not going to \nget any help from Charlie and David. They want a ``no'' vote so they \ncan make Charlie and Dave happy.\n  In case any of their followers in the Senate were to experience a \nchange of heart and be inclined to vote for an increase, the \norganizations have warned that they will really go after these people. \nAgain, I repeat, score the vote.\n  In other words, when it comes time for the Koch brothers to play the \nrole of Santa Claus, Republicans should know that Charles and David are \nmaking a list and checking it twice--probably more than that. Even \nthough 75 percent of Americans support this legislation--and our \neconomy stands to profit from a wage increase--the will of the Koch \nbrothers seems to be the top priority for my Republican colleagues.\n\n[[Page S2528]]\n\n  Former Governor Pawlenty, who was considered by many people in the \nlast election cycle to be the right person for the Republicans to \nnominate for President, came out today strongly and said words to the \neffect of: I am not afraid of the Koch brothers. I believe the minimum \nwage should be increased.\n  My Republican colleagues should listen to this respected Republican \nleader.\n  To add to the Republicans' theater of the absurd, the House of \nRepresentatives Budget Committee is holding a hearing today on poverty \nin America. How about that.\n  The Presiding Officer will recall that committee chairman Paul Ryan \nran for Vice President. He was part of the ticket that labeled 47 \npercent of Americans as moochers and not deserving the Republicans' \nattention--moochers. Representative Paul Ryan himself has even called \nstruggling Americans ``takers.'' Taking into account his well-\ndocumented disdain for hard-working Americans trying to help their \nfamilies, I am anxious to learn how Representative Ryan plans to \neradicate poverty since he considers them takers and moochers. Maybe he \nwill need to check with the Koch brothers first, as it seems he did \nwith his recent budget proposal.\n  While House Republicans hold hearings and Senate Republicans do \nnothing, Senate Democrats are doing something. We continue to propose \nmeaningful legislation, such as this minimum-wage bill, that gives \nAmerican families a fair shot at prosperity. The Republicans \nfilibustered extended unemployment benefits. They filibustered giving \nwomen the right to make the same amount of money as men. Why should my \ndaughter get 77 cents when a man doing the same job she does gets $1? \nIt is unfair, but they filibustered that. We are going to continue to \npropose meaningful legislation.\n  Senate Republicans assert that increasing the minimum wage will not \nhelp working families. That assertion is not only wrong, it makes no \nsense. It is illogical. Twenty-eight million Americans stand to benefit \nfrom an increase in the minimum wage. I repeat: About 10 percent of all \nAmericans stand to gain from the legislation before this body. We are \ngoing to vote to see if we can begin debate at noon today.\n  Republicans assert that boosting the minimum wage would hurt \nbusinesses and slow down our economic recovery. Almost 75 percent of \nsmall businesses support raising the minimum wage. Why? It creates more \nbusiness for them. It is good for the economy. The assertion that \nboosting the minimum wage would hurt businesses, again, is wrong and it \nis illogical.\n  Researchers at the Chicago Federal Reserve Bank have found consumer \nspending increases--yes, increases--dramatically following a minimum-\nwage hike and businesses reap the benefits of a minimum-wage increase. \nThat is what these experts said. This minimum-wage legislation is good \nfor American workers, businesses, and the economy, but Republicans \nrefuse to even allow us to debate the issue. Instead, they have \nsignaled their intention to filibuster the minimum-wage legislation \njust as they have filibustered virtually everything the President \nsuggested during the past 5 years.\n  When it comes to helping working-class families, the Republicans in \nWashington are echoing what the Republican leader declared last week in \nKentucky: It is not my job to create jobs.\n  Well, it is his job. It is the Republicans' job, it is my job, and it \nis the job of every Member of Congress to do everything we can to help \ncreate jobs. That is why in addition to raising the minimum wage, which \nwill create jobs, we believe there should be something done about the \ninfrastructure deficit we have in this country which would help create \ntens of thousands of jobs. It is so badly needed.\n  Today we have an opportunity to help our hard-working constituents \nfrom sea to shining sea and show them that we are attentive to their \nneeds.\n  I urge my Republican colleagues to join us and Governor Pawlenty and \ngive American workers a fair shot at the American dream by ensuring \nthey are paid a livable wage. At the end of the day our job is to give \nevery American a fair shot to provide for themselves and their \nfamilies--no welfare, just a job.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  Will the Chair announce the business of the day.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I would like to start this morning by \nreading an excerpt from a 1998 memo from Gene Sperling to President \nClinton. It relates to a minimum-wage proposal similar to the one we \nare considering today. Here is what he wrote:\n\n       Your entire economic team believes that this approach is \n     too aggressive and are concerned that . . . [it] could prove \n     damaging to employment prospects of low-skilled workers, as \n     well as to the general macroeconomic performance of the \n     economy.\n\n  But the memo noted there was a plus side to supporting that proposal. \n``[It] would unify [the] liberal wing of the Democratic party.''\n  Today feels like deejaa vu all over again because even though our \nconstituents keep telling us they expect Washington to focus on jobs, \nthat is clearly not what they are getting from the Senate. Instead, \nSenate Democrats are pushing legislation today that would cost as many \nas 1 million jobs in this country--legislation that the left flank of \ntheir party demands. That is their response to the pleas of our \nconstituents to do something about jobs--a proposal that nonpartisan \nanalysts tell us could cost jobs.\n  But then again, these are the same Washington Democrats who have been \nat the helm of our economy for 5\\1/2\\ years, the same ones who have \nbeen bragging about a recovery for the past 4.\n  We learned this morning the economy grew by just 0.1 percent--0.1 \npercent. So I can assure you that if this is the Democrats' idea of a \nrecovery, the people in my State at least are not terribly impressed. \nThey are ready for new ideas. They are ready to turn the page from the \nliberal playbook that just has not worked.\n  It is clearer every day that the DC liberal establishment is \ncompletely out of ideas. They do not even pretend to be serious about \njobs anymore. The clearest proof of that is today's vote--on a bill \nthat could cost about 17,000 jobs in Kentucky alone, and potentially as \nmany as a million nationwide.\n  But Senate Democrats do not seem to care. They do not seem to care \nthat about 6 in 10 Americans oppose a bill like this if--if--it means \nlosing hundreds of thousands of American jobs. Washington Democrats' \ntrue focus these days seems to be making the far left happy--not \nhelping the middle class.\n  They seem to think they can coast on talking points and stale ideas \nand that the American people have not been paying attention to their \nrecent dismal record at actually helping the people they claim to care \nabout.\n  They seem to think people will not notice that time and time and time \nagain they have ended up making things harder for the people they claim \nthey want to help.\n  But the American people see through that game. It is crystal clear \nfrom new polling that we have seen this week.\n\n[[Page S2529]]\n\nPeople realize the Washington liberal establishment is just out of \nenergy and out of ideas. If they did not realize it before this year, \nthey got confirmation of it when Senate Democrats effectively admitted \nthat their so-called agenda for the rest of the year was drafted by \ncampaign staffers.\n  In short, Washington Democrats are just not serious about helping the \nmiddle class. That helps explain why they would even consider \nlegislation that we all know could cost up to a million jobs at a time \nwhen Americans need those jobs more than ever.\n  It helps explain why satisfying their leftwing patrons has become a \nmore urgent priority than helping to create the kind of well-paying \nmiddle-class jobs our country needs.\n  I think our constituents deserve a lot better than what they have \nbeen getting this year from Democrats who control the Senate. They are \nalready struggling under the weight of Washington Democrats' last \nideological adventure--ObamaCare.\n  Washington Democrats promised the Sun and the Moon to sell that law, \nand then just rammed it through anyway when Americans refused to buy \nwhat they were selling.\n  Washington Democrats told us ObamaCare would lower costs, but polls \nshow that nearly twice as many people believe the government is adding \nsecret mind-control technology to our TVs as believe the law is \nactually decreasing health care costs.\n  Washington Democrats promised Americans that they could keep their \nplans if they liked them too. As we know, that turned out to be the \n``Lie of the Year.''\n  Washington Democrats downplayed ObamaCare's negative impact on jobs, \njust as they are doing with this legislation we will consider later \ntoday.\n  Yet the government's own nonpartisan analysis shows that ObamaCare \nwill effectively drive 2.5 million people out of the American \nworkforce. We are already seeing the effects in Kentucky, where \nhospitals are laying off workers and cutting salaries because of the \nimpact of this law.\n  One of the largest health care systems in the State recently let go \nnearly 500 employees, and its CEO stated that ObamaCare was a factor in \nthat decision. The head of another community hospital in Glasgow, KY, \nalso said that ObamaCare was a factor in his hospital's recent decision \nto reduce salaries and cut as many as 49 employees.\n  It is happening at other businesses too.\n  As a result of ObamaCare, a company in Kentucky with 8,000 employees \nwas forced to cut part-time workers' hours to below 30 hours a week. \nThat was a difficult decision--one that particular company, like so \nmany others, never wanted to make because of the impact it will have on \nits own employees, but one that it felt was necessary to comply with \nObamaCare.\n  I recently read a story about Paul Deskins, who runs an auto \ndealership in Pikeville with about 50 employees. Paul says that \nObamaCare might force him to reduce his workforce or sell his body shop \naltogether. ``We were hoping that Obama thing would go away,'' he said. \nMillions of Americans feel the same way.\n  Washington Democrats promised this law would help the little guy, but \nit ended up hurting many of the people it purported to help.\n  We are seeing the same thing with the legislation before us today. \nSix in 10 Americans do not want a policy like this if--if--it costs \njobs. No matter how Senate Democrats try to spin their support for this \nbill, the bottom line is this: It could cost up to 1 million American \njobs--17,000 of those jobs in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. That is \nreally the opposite of what Americans expect us to do on jobs.\n  So it is time for Washington Democrats to drop the tired ideological \napproach that has failed so miserably the last 5\\1/2\\ years. It is time \nfor them to work with Republicans to boost job creation and start \nhelping the middle class. That has been Republicans' focus all along, \nand it is about time Washington Democrats joined us in working for the \nmiddle class too.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I rise today out of a genuine concern that \nthe foreign policy that our administration is conducting is creating \ndanger for the U.S. citizenry and creating danger throughout the world. \nLet me speak a little bit about that.\n  I think all of us have seen what happened in Syria when the \nadministration had an opportunity on the front end of a conflict to put \nits thumb on the scale to change the dynamic of what was happening \ninside the country and stated that it would do so. It did not.\n  This weekend I was at a security conference and people on both sides \nof the aisle expressed dismay at the way the administration had \nconducted its operations--or actually had not conducted it operations \nin Syria, and yet had stated so many times what it was going to do.\n  Today we find ourselves in a situation where I am absolutely certain \nthat one of the policies we will end up carrying out in Syria will be a \ncounterterrorism policy because of our concern about the fact that \nbecause we did not act when we could--not with American boots on the \nground; that is not what anybody has proposed--but when the \nadministration could have done something to prevent the disaster that \nhas occurred there, to prevent 60,000 more Syrians from being killed \nindiscriminately--in many cases by helicopters from the administration \ndropping barrel bombs on innocent civilians there--when the \nadministration could have acted to keep those types of atrocities from \noccurring, to keep Al Qaeda and other extremists from coming into the \ncountry--when it said it was going to act and did not, when it could \nhave done that--now we are going to find ourselves, very quickly, in a \nsituation, in my opinion, where we realize this is a threat to our \nhomeland, and we are going to be engaged in counterterrorism \nactivities.\n  I say that as a predicate to the issue I am going to discuss, which \nis Ukraine.\n  So many Members of our body have recently been to Ukraine. As a \nmatter of fact, I count 12 Members--Members on both sides of the \naisle--who have spent time visiting Ukraine and going to Maidan and \nseeing what the people there did. They rose up to hope for a free \nworld, to hope for human rights, to hope for democracy, and to rid the \ncountry of corruption.\n  Today, we have a prime minister who is young, who is taking on the \nissues of the day, and doing everything he can to usher this country \ninto a new era--a country that is destined to join the West on its \ncurrent path.\n  At the same time, we see a country whose greatest threat to that \noccurring is Russia--a country that, as we know, illegally went into \nCrimea and annexed it, a country that today has 40,000 troops on the \nborder, a country that has black ops operators inside eastern Ukraine, \nthe industrial part of Ukraine that it hopes over time will, in a \nsense, become a part of what they are doing in Russia.\n  We see every day the destabilization occurring. We know the most \nimportant next step in Ukraine is for them to go to this May 25 \nelection and have an election that the world community believes was a \nvalid election. Yet we know that daily Putin and Russia do everything \nthey can to destabilize Ukraine and to delegitimize this process of \nelections and moving forward.\n  So a number of us, out of grave concern for what is happening--out of \nconcern about where this is going to lead America, where this is going \nto lead Europe--have come together to write a piece of legislation \nbecause what we have seen from the administration is a lot of rhetoric. \nUnfortunately, what we see is an administration that cannot help itself \nbut to try to be in every 24-hour news circle, talking about what it is \ngoing to do, but then when it actually comes to the time of actually \ndoing it, that is not what has occurred.\n  This week I was very disappointed when the administration unveiled \nits next round of sanctions. We had all hoped the administration would \nput in place sectoral sanctions, sanctions that would have an impact on \nthe Russian economy, so that Putin and all those around him who are \ncarrying out these activities would understand they would pay a price \nfor what they are doing illegally in this part of the world, which, by \nthe way, goes against the agreements we all came to around the Budapest \nMemorandum, where we said we would honor the sovereignty of this \ncountry.\n\n[[Page S2530]]\n\n  For that reason, a number of us have come together to write a piece \nof legislation. It is legislation that is intended to try to drive an \noutcome. It is a piece of legislation that moves away from the way the \nadministration has been dealing with this, where they are always a day \nlate and a dollar short. They are always responding to what Russia \ndoes. They are always doing something that, in essence, deals with the \nsituation after something bad has already occurred. This legislation is \ndesigned to, again, drive an outcome, to show the administration there \nis a strategic way to deal with this issue.\n  Let me tell you what this does not do. I was very disappointed to \npick up the Wall Street Journal this morning and read on the front page \nthat those of us who are concerned--which, by the way, is strongly \nbipartisan, strongly bipartisan in this Senate: concern about what is \nhappening in Ukraine and concern about the fact that the administration \nhas not done those things with economic sanctions in a stronger way to \ncause Russia to pay a price for what it is doing--but I was very \ndisappointed to pick up the paper and read where the President said \nthose people who want to see military action by the United States in \nUkraine--that is not what this bill does. As a matter of fact, what the \nbill does is it lays out a strategy to try to keep that from happening, \nwhich I think numbers of us on both sides of the aisle are concerned \nthat under the current policy of saying what we are going to do and not \ndoing it, of basically continuing to allow Russia to do what it is \ndoing inside eastern Ukraine, that this is actually the very policy \nthat could lead to significant problems down the road. We all \nunderstand these are how major conflicts unfold, and we all understand \nwe are talking about two countries that are armed with nuclear weapons.\n  So today at noon a number of us will gather around and introduce a \npiece of legislation that does three things.\n  No. 1, it strengthens NATO. I think everyone would agree that the \ncommitment of NATO to its allies, our commitment to NATO, our partners' \ncommitment to NATO, has waned over the last period of time.\n  By the way, this is not something that has just occurred under this \nadministration. It has been going on for some time. We have only three \ncountries, as a matter of fact--three countries--within the NATO \nalliance that are actually honoring their commitments relative to the \nsupport of NATO.\n  So the first piece of this is to strengthen NATO. It is to expedite, \nby the way, this administration's own plan relative to missile \ndefense--the plan they have laid out. It does not change that \ntechnology.\n  The second piece of this legislation is intended to deter Russia from \nwhat it is doing.\n  If my colleagues remember, the Geneva accords said Putin would move \nthe Russian troops who are intimidating people inside Eastern Ukraine \naway from the border. But I think what we have seen now is that ``red \nline'' has changed. Now what the administration is focused on is them \nactually not going inside the country, but all of us understand that \nRussia is actually accomplishing what it wishes to accomplish inside \nUkraine without even sending troops in because they are able to do it \nagain with black ops.\n  So this piece of legislation that my friend from Wyoming and so many \nothers were involved in developing lays down clear sanctions first--\nbeginning today, or after passage, beginning with sanctions--sanctions \nthat hit several important entities in the banking sector and in the \nenergy sector, so we actually do something that affects the Russian \neconomy until such time that they pull those troops away from the \nborder and they remove those black ops operators inside the country who \nare fomenting the problems.\n  Secondly, in the event Russia does actually cross the border with \nmilitary troops, this bill again imposes much deeper sanctions on \nRussia and certainly signifies to them what kind of price they would \npay.\n  Again, earlier this week when the administration put forth its \nsanctions, it was a marvel to see that the stock market in Russia, \nseveral days in a row, continued to go up. It had no affect on Russia, \nnone. Editorial writers and people on both sides of the aisle \nunderstand this was nothing more than a slap on the wrist. Putin \nunderstands that. Russia understands that. They understand that we as a \nnation so far have not signified that we are willing to use these \neconomic sanctions in a way--through the President's own Executive \norder, I might add--to change behavior. So we are very concerned about \nthe direction this is taking.\n  The third thing this bill will do is harden our non-NATO allies. I \nthink my colleagues know that in the country of Moldavia, from where I \njust recently returned--and Senator Barrasso on another trip just \nrecently returned as well--and in Georgia and in Ukraine, there are a \nnumber of things we need to do as a nation to help them harden their \ncountry and this bill lays objective things out. Let me give one \nexample. In the Russian-speaking area of Eastern Ukraine, the only \ninformation the people who are Russian-speaking in that part of the \nworld are receiving is coming from Russia. It is propaganda about \nactions the United States is taking, which we aren't, and the great \nlives they will have if Russia is able to annex that part of the world. \nSo at a minimum we need to make sure the information those people are \nreceiving is very different. There are so many actions that we as a \nnation can be taking to ensure that Ukraine is not destabilized, that \nMoldavia is not destabilized, that Georgia is not destabilized.\n  Let me say this in closing because I see my friend is ready to speak \non another topic. This bill we are introducing today is a serious piece \nof legislation. As a matter of fact, I am gratified by the work so many \nMembers have put into making this legislation as it is. It is \nstrategic. It is serious. It tries to accomplish a good outcome. I hope \nthe introduction of this legislation will cause the administration to \nstep away from the microphones and the cameras and to step away from \nthe empty rhetoric that has been shared all across this world, to step \nback and say wouldn't it be good if we laid out a strategic approach to \nEurope.\n  It is time we realized Russia is destabilizing Europe, and that \naffects our citizens. Our citizens are 4\\1/2\\ percent of the world in \npopulation. We benefit from 22 percent of the world's gross domestic \nproduct. So the fact of the world being secure is not only important to \nus because of human rights and democracy and freedom, but it is \nimportant to the very livelihoods of the people of our country.\n  So I thank those involved. I look forward to discussing this more \nfully at noon today when we unveil this. Again, I hope the White House \nand those involved in setting foreign policy will step back, they will \nsit down, and they will begin to do take actions that strengthen NATO \nmore fully. I hope they will take those actions that will certainly \ncause Russia to understand exactly what will happen if they continue on \nthe path they are on, as well as strengthen our non-NATO allies which, \nbecause of the policies we have not put in place, are continually being \ndestabilized.\n  Mr. CORKER. I yield the floor and I thank the Chair for the time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, first, I commend my friend and colleague \nfrom Tennessee for his leadership on foreign affairs and his efforts in \nthese areas. I fully support all of his efforts to bring forth a united \nposition on behalf of our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/30/senate-section/article/S2530-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2530-S2532]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor because the American \npeople have just received more horrible news about our economy.\n  The Commerce Department reported this morning that our economy grew \nat the smallest rate in 3 years. The exact number is 0.1 percent--much \nworse than expected. To be specific, investment in business equipment \ndeclined, residential home construction declined, U.S. exports fell \nsharply, and companies increased inventories at a much slower rate.\n  I wish to read what some of the economists have said about this. Dan \nNorth, a chief economist, said:\n\n       We've been living in sub-3 percent land, and people have \n     gotten used to that as the new normal. But it's not. It's \n     anemic.\n\n  To make matters worse, the Financial Times this morning is reporting\n\n[[Page S2531]]\n\nthat China is poised this year to pass the United States as the world's \nleading economic power.\n  The American people deserve better than this and they shouldn't have \nto accept that anemic growth as the new normal. They deserve growth, \ngood jobs, and better opportunities. That is not what they are finding \nfrom the Obama economy. Instead, the President continues to push an \nagenda that makes it harder for Americans to find good jobs and to \nbring home bigger paychecks. So I wish to speak about how the health \ncare law specifically is slowing growth and how it is making American \npaychecks smaller.\n  I met earlier today with business leaders from Wyoming. They are here \nfrom Casper, Cheyenne, and Jackson, and I have heard input from them \nregarding how the health care law has impacted their businesses, how it \nhas impacted our State of Wyoming, and how it has impacted our economy \nnot just in Wyoming but nationwide.\n  It is interesting to watch the White House and the President \nspecifically spike the ball, claiming that 8 million people signed up \nfor health insurance through the government exchanges. At the same \ntime, President Obama has declared that the national debate about his \nhealth care law is over. The meaning of the number is highly \nquestionable, and the administration's victory lap is premature. In \nfact, the ObamaCare debate is far from over.\n  So I come to the floor to speak about additional side effects of the \nObama health care law. I will continue to do this week after week \nbecause the side effects on the American people and the American \neconomy and on health care in this country continue to be very \ndamaging.\n  I will speak about smaller paychecks as one of the ObamaCare side \neffects, to point out that the debate is not over for the millions of \nAmericans who are experiencing the negative side effects of the \nPresident's health care law voted on by Democrats and not by \nRepublicans. One of the worst of these side effects is the smaller \npaychecks many families are experiencing specifically because of the \nmandates of the health care law. It is happening all around the \ncountry.\n  Let me tell my colleagues what is happening as reported by the New \nHampshire Union Leader. This is just one example. The article was \ntalking about small businesses that have found that paperwork and costs \nrelated to the law are threatening the economic platforms on which \ntheir companies are built. It quoted a man who runs a ski area saying \nthe law could mean he has to open later in the season and close earlier \nin the season. That is because people on his payroll for 120 \nconsecutive days or longer have to be offered health insurance under \nthe Democrats' health care law.\n  Mother Nature might say there is plenty of snow, the skiers and snow \nboarders are ready to go, the resort wants to open, restaurants are \nready to serve people, hotels are ready to host people, but ObamaCare \nsays the resort can't open without facing enormous costs for \nWashington-mandated insurance. It is hurting people working at the ski \nresorts. It is hurting people in businesses in those communities.\n  Who pays for the negative side effects? It is the seasonal workers \nwho will now be limited to fewer than 120 days of work at ski \nfacilities such as this one in New Hampshire. They will work fewer days \nwith smaller paychecks because of the health care law. The New \nHampshire Union Leader summed it up this way: ``As snowboarders say: \nbummer.''\n  It is not just seasonal workers who are being hurt. This column also \ntalks about the ski resorts in Colorado being hurt.\n  In North Carolina, State government agencies are starting to get very \nworried about how to deal with the health care law's mandates. The law \nsays employers--including State and local governments--have to cover \npeople who work 30 hours a week or more. That is whom the law considers \nfull-time workers. When I talk to business leaders from Wyoming, most \npeople think of full-time work as 40 hours. Not President Obama. He is \na 30-hour man.\n  According to a story from WTVD in Raleigh, State agencies are looking \nat cutting the hours of part-time workers to keep them under that 30-\nhour limit.\n  The North Carolina Agriculture Department has about 250 part-time \nemployees who are now working more than 30 hours. They have 250 workers \nin the North Carolina Agriculture Department, and those 250 people are \nworking more than 30 hours, but they are part time. The North Carolina \nDepartment of Transportation has almost 600 people in the same \nsituation. So North Carolina is going to have to look very closely at \nwhat to do with those people, and that can mean smaller paychecks.\n  Local governments are having to make these same decisions because of \nthe health care law. WITN, another station in Greenville, NC, did a \nstory last month about how schools are cutting the hours substitute \nteachers can work--the same 30-hour Obama workweek limit again. The \nhealth care law wasn't about substitute teachers, but they are the ones \nfeeling the negative side effects and they are the ones seeing smaller \npaychecks.\n  The story quoted a teacher in Pitt County, NC, who said she got a \nletter from the school district there telling her she wouldn't be able \nto work as much. Substitute teachers are now limited to 3 days a week. \nWhy? Because of the expensive mandates of ObamaCare.\n  She told the TV station, ``I'm willing and able to work, and now \nthey're telling me I can only work for so long.''\n  This teacher is one of 200 in her North Carolina school district who \nare going to be limited to 21 hours a week, and she is wondering how \nshe is going to make ends meet with 21 hours a week. That is a side \neffect of the health care law that means smaller paychecks for \nsubstitute teachers.\n  President Obama says the debate is over. Is it over for teachers in \nNorth Carolina who are seeing their time cut to under 30 hours a week? \nIs it over in ski resort communities in New Hampshire and in Colorado?\n  Look what is going on in Iowa. An article just last week in the \nOttumwa Courier said that a local school district was cutting the hours \non all paraeducators from 37 hours per week to 29 hours. Those extra \nhours may not mean much to Democrats on the floor of the Senate or the \nHouse Members who voted for this health care law, but they are a real \nbig deal for a lot of families struggling in the Obama economy.\n  In Colorado, the Aspen Daily News reported last month that adjunct \nprofessors at Colorado Mountain College are going to have the same \nlimit of 29 hours a week. This school has 112 full-time faculty, but it \nhas 600 part-time professors. Some of them just want to teach a class \nhere or there to make extra money, but some of them are trying to \nstring together enough hours to support themselves, to support their \nfamilies, and they are getting hammered by the President's health care \nlaw that every Democrat in this body voted for.\n  It is happening all over the country. We have heard stories today \nabout New Hampshire, North Carolina, Colorado. Here is a final example. \nA borough in Alaska announced earlier this year that it was putting a \ncap on the hours of firefighters and emergency medical technicians.\n  According to one technician, some stations are limiting people to \njust 24 hours a week. So we see teachers, firefighters, professors, \nseasonal workers all hurt by the side effects of the Obama health care \nlaw, and they are all getting hit with smaller paychecks--nothing they \nhave asked for. They want to work. They are ready to work. They are \nwilling to work.\n  We have a weak economy, an anemic economy, and the President and \nDemocrats do not seem to care. They do not seem to care. They think the \ndebate is over. President Obama says the debate is over.\n  He says Democrats who voted for this should forcefully defend it and \nbe proud. How can the President forcefully defend these smaller \npaychecks? How can the President be proud of these smaller paychecks \nbecause of his law and what he had Democrats vote for--in North \nCarolina; Alaska, where you hear these stories; New Hampshire; one \nafter another after another; Colorado.\n  Well, it is not over for Americans, who are continuing to get hit in \ntheir wallets, people in New Hampshire, North Carolina, Iowa, Colorado, \nAlaska, all over the rest of the country. It is not over for \nRepublicans, who will continue to stand for those Americans\n\n[[Page S2532]]\n\nand keep pushing for commonsense reforms that will actually help people \nget the care and what they wanted all along, which was better access to \nquality, affordable health care.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise this morning to talk about the \nmatter before us, which is the minimum wage. Today the Senate will vote \non cloture on the motion to proceed to the Minimum Wage Fairness Act, \nthe legislation we are considering, which would increase the minimum \nwage to $10.10 an hour over the course of 3 years. We do not know what \nthe result will be today, but we are working to get as much support as \npossible because getting past this first hurdle, of course, is \nessential to getting the bill passed, to giving Americans who are \nworking very hard a fair shot at some economic security that they may \nnot have right now.\n  We have a lot of work to do because there are still people out \nthere--especially here in Washington--who are making arguments that do \nnot make a lot of sense and, to me, do not make a lot of sense to the \npeople of Pennsylvania. Where I came from, when someone works a full \nday and a full week, they should not--most people believe they should \nhave a fair shot at making not just a living but making sure they have \nenough of a living that they can lift themselves out of poverty. You \nshould not work 40 hours a week and be paid a poverty wage. \nUnfortunately, that is the case for far too many Americans.\n  Increasing the minimum wage would help workers make ends meet, and it \nwould offer a lift up the ladder to the middle class and boost the \neconomy by boosting new spending. We know that is the case. All the \ndata shows that. All the studies show that. But we still have to make \nthe case to some folks here in Washington.\n  Wages for most workers are not keeping up with the cost of living, \nthe cost of paying a mortgage and raising a family and some of the \nother middle-class concerns. The pay for minimum-wage workers is not \nkeeping up with inflation.\n  Six years have passed since the last minimum wage increase was \nenacted. Pay for the middle class is stagnant, while the gap between \nthe haves and the have-nots has widened substantially.\n  The chart on my right tells the story of what could happen if we are \nable to pass an increase in the minimum wage. It is about giving a fair \nshot to our families and to our workers by raising the minimum wage. \nIncreasing the minimum wage helps a lot of folks across the country \nmore broadly. Of course, it helps working families.\n  Look at these numbers. Workers who would get a raise: 27.8 million \nworkers across the country. There are very few things the Senate can do \ntoday or this week that would provide that kind of direct economic \njump-start to so many communities and to 27.8 million people.\n  Look at the boost to GDP. I mentioned that earlier--a $22 billion \nboost to the economy. Again, there are very few things, if any, we \ncould pass in the Senate that would provide that kind of jump-start to \nthe economy when we need it.\n  The number of jobs created across the country: some 85,000. Some \nthink the number is higher than that. I know this would have a job-\nincrease impact into the thousands in Pennsylvania.\n  Look at the number for women. There is mostly an issue about women \nwho are working every day trying to support their families. It also has \nan impact, obviously, on children. Women who would get a raise: 15.3 \nmillion women across the country. I would like to hear someone who is \non the other side of the aisle demonstrate to women across this country \nwhat they will do in place of that if they are going to say that now is \nnot the time for a raise in the minimum wage. What about those women \nwho are shouldering most of the burden to raise their families and to \nmake their way in a tough economy?\n  Children with a parent who would get a raise: 14 million children \nhave a parent who would get a boost in the minimum wage. Again, I would \nsay: What is your answer or what is your strategy to give a boost but \nreally, more appropriately stated, a measure of security to our \nchildren? I am not sure I can name another action this Senate could \ntake to make sure 14 million children have a measure of security that \nthey do not have today even in an economy that--in some parts of the \ncountry--is getting a little better.\n\n  Americans overall lifted out of poverty: 2 million Americans will be \nlifted out of poverty if we pass an increase in the minimum wage.\n  Again, I would ask anyone on the other side, is there an action, is \nthere a bill, is there a vote, is there a step we can take in the \nSenate this week or next week that would do the same to help 14 million \nchildren, to lift 2 million Americans out of poverty? I do not know of \nany. I will wait and see what their answer is. I hope they will answer \nthat question because they should. This is a debate. They should answer \nthat question. Tell us what you will do to help 14 million children if \nyou are not going to support lifting or raising the minimum wage.\n  Less spending on food stamps: $4.6 billion per year. We hear attacks \nall the time--unjustified though they are--from the other side about \nSNAP. We used to call it the food stamp program. They are always \nsaying: We need to reduce spending in that program. Well, instead of \ncutting people, as so many in this body seem to want to do every day of \nthe week, voting for budgets that would slash support for people who \nneed help just having a measure of food security, being able to feed \ntheir families, instead of doing that, why don't we support raising the \nminimum wage, lifting them out of poverty, lifting them out of the \ndependence they have to have on an important program such as SNAP? That \nis the better way to reduce those numbers. It is not just a question of \nwhat is right; it is a question of the best economic strategy for that \nworker, for his or her family, and for the economy overall.\n  Finally, veterans who would get a raise: 1 million veterans. We hear \nspeeches all the time here in Washington from both sides of the aisle. \nIn most cases--in almost every case--they are heartfelt and they are \nhonest about the support that one Senator or a group of Senators \nprovide to help our veterans. I have no doubt that people are sincere \nwhen they say that. But there are some opportunities around here where \nyou can take action. You can cast a vote that has a direct benefit not \njust for 14 million children but in this case for 1 million veterans.\n  You have to ask yourself, if you cannot cast that vote, what are you \ngoing to do? What are you going to do with the power you have to cast \nyour vote, to stand and say: I support an increase in the minimum wage. \nIf you are not going to do that, if you are not going to vote for this \nor ever vote for this, then what are you going to do to help those same \n1 million veterans or those same 14 million children or those 15.3 \nmillion women? If you have an answer for that, if you have a different \nstrategy that will get us to these numbers, let's hear it. I would like \nto hear the answer to that. I have not heard it yet. Maybe I have not \nbeen listening. But I will try to listen closely to what the arguments \nare on the other side of the aisle.\n  So the hashtag #raisethewage is a good way to summarize why this is \nso fundamental but really so simple. This is about giving people a fair \nshot. It is not about some program people are asking to be created. It \nis about basic fairness in giving folks a fair shot in an economy that \nis still very tough for a lot of families.\n\n[[Page S2533]]\n\n  I think it is critical that we emphasize some of these numbers, but \nit is also really about the human trauma so many families have been \nliving through. So many of them have lived through the recession and \nare still climbing out of the hole they are in. They have lost their \njobs; they may have run out of unemployment insurance; they may have \nlost their homes in the course of all of that. There is no question and \nit is irrefutable that the cascading effect of that trauma hits not \nonly the worker and maybe, if they have a spouse or a partner, the \nperson standing next to them, but it also has a cascading effect on the \nchildren as well and the family and then on all of us.\n  We all have a stake in this. The idea of raising the minimum wage is \nabout some other group of people out there who are far away from us \nmakes no sense. If we raise the minimum wage, the economy for everyone \ngets better. Folks don't have to take my word for it. Over 600 \neconomists--600, not 6 or 10 but 600 economists--including 7 Nobel \nlaureates, have signed a letter stating their support for raising the \nminimum wage to $10.10 because it would be good for workers and it \nwould not have a negative effect on jobs and would even provide a boost \nto economic activity.\n  I am not going to read the whole January letter from the 600 \neconomists, but I will read a statement from it and then I will \nconclude.\n\n       At a time when persistent high unemployment is putting \n     enormous downward pressure on wages, such a minimum-wage \n     increase would provide a much-needed boost to the earnings of \n     low-wage workers.\n       In recent years there have been important developments in \n     the academic literature on the effect of increases in the \n     minimum wage on unemployment, with the weight of evidence now \n     showing that increases in the minimum wage have had little or \n     no--\n\n  Let me say it again, ``little or no''--\n\n     negative effect on the unemployment of minimum-wage workers, \n     even during times of weakness in the labor market. Research \n     suggests that a minimum-wage increase could have a small \n     stimulative effect on the economy as low-wage workers spend \n     their additional earnings, raising demand and job growth, and \n     providing some help on the jobs front.\n\n  That is a long statement by 600 economists. It is very measured. It \nis not inflating numbers and saying this is going to cure all of our \neconomic challenges or all of our economic woes, but it is a clear and \nunequivocal endorsement of raising the minimum wage. I would add to \nthat, with all due respect to those smart economists, the data on this \nchart.\n  Let me make one more point and then I will conclude. I don't have it \nin front of me, but one of the organizations that has endorsed the \nincrease in the minimum wage is the American Academy of Pediatrics. \nWhy? Because they know a lot about taking care of kids. They know a lot \nabout providing the best health care for kids. They know a lot about \nthe traumas and the difficulties that a lot of children face, \nespecially if they are poor or if they are in a family getting low \nwages. That child is impacted. There is no doubt about that. All the \nscience tells us that. All the literature tells us that. But if the \nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics is saying we should raise the minimum \nwage because it is good for kids and these 600 economists are saying it \nis good for the economy and so much other information is saying it will \nhelp our veterans, 1 million veterans and 14 million kids, what is the \nargument on the other side against it?\n  I have heard some of the arguments, but I have not heard an argument \nyet that says they have a strategy on the other side of this debate \nthat will help 15.3 million women, that will directly help 14 million \nchildren and that will help 1 million veterans and boost our economy on \ntop of it. I would be for this even if there wasn't a boost to the \neconomy because we could help people individually, but that is an added \nreason to be supportive of this bill.\n  This is long overdue. We shouldn't be having this debate every 5, 6 \nor 8 years. We should raise the minimum wage appropriately, to a \nreasonable number that makes sense, and then index it so we can take \nthis issue off the table, so it would increase appropriately, as it \nshould, over time.\n  If we had done that in the 1960s or 1970s, the minimum wage would be \nnot just higher than it is today, $7.25, it would be more than $10.50 \nan hour, something higher than that.\n  If you are unalterably opposed to raising the minimum wage, I would \nhope you would have a strategy to make sure that 14 million kids are \nbenefited by your action, by your bill--not over 20 years but by some \nother legislative vehicle--and you should have a strategy to make sure \n1 million veterans have some measure of economic security they don't \nhave, and you should be able to answer what the American Academy of \nPediatrics said is good for children. If you can answer those kinds of \nquestions, then I would love to take a look at your bill, but if you \ncan't, you have some explaining to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I thank my colleague for his words on the minimum wage. \nThere were very important points raised in terms of that letter from \nthose economists and the American Academy of Pediatrics. It adds \nwonderfully to the debate.\n  I rise to support, similar to my colleague from Pennsylvania, an \nincrease in the Federal minimum wage. I am a proud cosponsor of the \nMinimum Wage Fairness Act, which would give 16.5 million Americans a \nmuch deserved raise.\n  I am incredibly proud of the important step Minnesota took to raise \nthe minimum wage earlier this week. Just a few weeks ago or earlier \nthis month the Governor and the Minnesota State legislature took this \nbig step for workers and families. Because of this, hundreds of \nthousands of hard-working Minnesotans will themselves receive a raise.\n  This is a big deal. Before this increase, the Minnesota State minimum \nwage was actually lower than the Federal minimum wage.\n  I would like to talk a little bit about why Minnesota has taken this \nimportant step. Minnesotans believe that if someone works full time, 52 \nweeks a year, they should be able to put food on the table and a roof \nover their family's head. They believe that if someone works in \nAmerica, they should have a chance to work their way up into the middle \nclass. As I have traveled around Minnesota, I have heard from people \nall over the State who have been working long hours and yet still \nstruggle to support their families, to work their way to the middle \nclass and provide a brighter future for their children.\n  As a State, we recognized that there were too many people working \nvery hard at one, two, and sometimes three jobs and were still \nstruggling to get by. Parents have been wondering how they are going to \nbe able to pay for their kids' college or even how to make the next car \npayment. Instead, they have been working 60-hour weeks and missing out \non spending precious time with their children.\n  That is why I am proud that Minnesota has now joined 21 other States \nwith minimum wages higher than the Federal minimum. In Washington, I am \ngoing to keep doing my part to help Minnesota workers.\n  Recent research confirms that what we see in Minnesota is happening \nacross America. In a survey last year of workers earning less than $10 \nan hour, two-thirds of these workers said they are not meeting or are \njust meeting their basic living expenses. Two-thirds of these workers \nreport needing public assistance. Two in five said they can't afford \nadditional education and training. With wages too low, these workers \nare trapped. They are trapped in poverty.\n  The economy is getting better, but raising the minimum wage is about \ndoing everything we can to make sure it gets better for everyone. Last \nyear our Nation's largest businesses saw record profits. The market \nfinished last year up over 26 percent, its best return since the 1990s. \nRaising the minimum wage is about making sure Minnesotans and workers \nacross the country get to be a part of this improving economy.\n  That is why Minnesota has taken this important step. We know a strong \nminimum wage and a strong middle class go hand in hand. That is why I \nsupport raising the Federal minimum wage to a level that allows people \nto work their way to a better life.\n  For decades the Federal minimum wage has lost its value. If the \nFederal\n\n[[Page S2534]]\n\nminimum wage had kept pace with inflation since its peak value in the \n1960s, today it would be worth over $10.50 an hour. Today the Federal \nminimum wage is just $7.25 an hour.\n  When families have had to pay more for food, rent, utilities, \nchildcare, and education, the minimum wage not only hasn't kept up, it \nhas gone down. It is not only minimum wage workers who haven't seen an \nincrease in wages. Since the 1970s we have seen worker productivity \ngrow by 135 percent while the average wages for middle-class workers \nhave not changed. Americans are working harder than ever but average \nwages are stuck and the minimum wage actually has been declining.\n  Let me tell you about what raising the minimum wage would mean to one \nMinnesotan. Her name is Misrak. She is the mother of two and works at \nthe airport as a cleaner, where she makes a low wage. Because she \ncouldn't make ends meet, she had to take a second job assisting \npassengers in wheelchairs who need help. She has been doing this for 4 \nyears, and during that time she has received only one raise worth just \n80 cents an hour. She doesn't get vacation days or sick days or time \noff with her children. She wants to help her children finish college, \nand they want to finish college so they can be sure that if they work \nhard, that will be a path out of poverty and into the middle class. For \nMisrak, even though she works over 60 hours per week, she and her \nfamily are just barely scraping by.\n  Bringing the minimum wage back to a level that can support a family \nis the first step in restoring the promise that if someone works hard, \nthey can build a better life for themselves and their family. Sometimes \npeople ask why raise the minimum wage to $9.50 an hour as we did in \nMinnesota or $10.10 as we want to do. They say why not leave minimum \nwage workers alone to figure out things for themselves.\n  I don't believe raising the minimum wage is going to solve all the \nproblems working families face. They need more than a minimum wage. \nThey need good jobs, good schools, and good roads to provide a better \nfuture for themselves and for their children, but I support raising the \nminimum wage to $10.10 an hour because it is a wage that says Americans \nvalue work. It is a minimum guarantee that anyone who shows up 40 hours \na week and ready to work should be able to provide food and shelter for \nthemselves and their children and should not live in poverty.\n  Other people say we don't need to raise the minimum wage because it \nis not working families who earn the minimum wage. Instead they say it \nis mainly teenagers in their first job who earn the minimum wage. In \nfact, the vast majority of workers who would get a raise under this \nbill are working adults, including approximately 350,000 adults in \nMinnesota. One-quarter are parents, including over 85,000 parents in \nour State. Parents who would see a raise from the bill we are \nconsidering are the parents of 14 million children, an estimated \n150,000 of them in Minnesota. These are kids. The American Academy of \nPediatrics says do this. We know that kids who have deprivation have \ntrauma. There are different kinds of deprivation, and we know it makes \nit harder for them to learn. It changes their brain chemistry to be \nunder that much stress, so let's do it for these kids.\n  The majority--56 percent--of Minnesotans who would be affected by an \nincrease are women. Nationwide, one in five working mothers would see a \nraise under this bill, and 6.8 million workers and their families would \nbe lifted out of poverty.\n  Raising the minimum wage is good for working families and it is good \nfor the economy. It boosts economic activity and helps local \nbusinesses. A study from the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago found that \nincreasing the Federal minimum wage to $10 an hour could boost GDP by \nup to 0.3 percentage points. In a recent analysis of State employment \ndata, Goldman Sachs noted that based on their analysis of States that \nincreased their minimum wage at the start of 2014, the employment \nimpact, if any, from a higher Federal minimum wage would be small \nrelative to the normal volatility in the market. A higher minimum \nwage--\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional 2 minutes \nor 1\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. In that case, 2 minutes.\n  A higher minimum wage also helps our economy because increasing the \nminimum wage boosts the purchasing power of consumers and creates more \ncustomers for local businesses. People earning minimum wage spend the \nmoney they are earning. The Economic Policy Institute estimates that \nthe increased economic activity from an increase to $10.10 could create \n85,000 new jobs and boost GDP by $22.2 billion over the 3 years of \nimplementation. Increasing the minimum wage helps businesses in another \nway too. Workers who are better paid are also more productive and less \nlikely to quit. That means businesses save on recruiting and training \ncosts. It also means they have better, more loyal, and harder working \nemployees.\n  Businesses in Minnesota understand this. I spoke with Danny \nSchwartzman, the owner of Common Roots Cafe and Catering in \nMinneapolis. Danny pays his employees a minimum of $11 per hour, plus \nbenefits, such as paid time off and health insurance. Danny has \nwritten:\n\n       Over time, other businesses will see what I have seen--that \n     paying people more yields more for the bottom line. It's \n     easier to recruit and retain people. Happier employees are \n     more likely to provide better customer service. Lower \n     turnover means dramatically lower training costs and better \n     employee performance.\n\n  Danny understands that his business will do better if his workers are \ndoing better.\n  It is time that Congress follow Minnesota's example. The minimum wage \nis about making sure that work pays. It is about the American dream. If \nyou work hard and take responsibility, you can put a roof over your \nhead, provide a decent life for your children, and help them get ready \nfor the future. It has been too long since the Federal minimum wage \nkept that promise to America's workers and their children, and that is \nwhy we need to raise it today.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, I am proud to stand here today to \nsupport raising the minimum wage. No person in America should work full \ntime and not earn enough to be above the poverty level. The poverty \nlevel in the United States in 2014 is about $23,000 for a family of \nfour. Today, if someone works under the minimum wage for 40 hours a \nweek they are still in poverty. No one should work 40 hours a week and \nbe given a salary that does not lift them and their families out of \npoverty. That is absolutely wrong.\n  Millions of people in our country have been trying to climb into the \nmiddle class. But no matter how hard they work, they are stuck in the \nsame place.\n  In America today, nearly half of those who grow up in families in the \nbottom fifth of income earners will stay there as adults. Tens of \nmillions of Americans labor tirelessly for years to scale the economic \nladder but they can never get off the ground. That is unacceptable, it \nis immoral, and that needs to change.\n  Raising the minimum wage is a first step to fighting income \ninequality in our country. We must help restore the dignity and the \nvalue of work and help millions of families escape poverty by \nincreasing the national minimum wage.\n  Today, more than 46 million Americans are living in poverty. The \naverage American household made less in 2012 than it did in 1989. That \nis wrong. It is plain wrong. Over these last 20 years, the top 1 \npercent of wage earners in America has seen their income skyrocket by \n86 percent. In the years ahead it is going to get worse for those \nmaking the minimum wage. Over the next 5 years the real value of the \nminimum wage is projected to decline by 10 percent or over $1,400 of \npurchasing power for a full-time worker, unless we increase the minimum \nwage.\n  What does that mean? It means Americans will be able to buy less if \nwe don't do it, and it will be harder for families to get by. The poor \nwill effectively get even more impoverished. Even as they are working \n40 hours a week, they get poorer and poorer and poorer because that \nminimum wage does not buy as much as it did the year\n\n[[Page S2535]]\n\nbefore and the year before and the year before. So the rich get richer \nand the poor get poorer. That is the system we have right now unless we \ntake action to make sure those who earn the minimum wage are keeping \npace with what it takes to buy the food, to pay the rent, to pay for \nthe schools for the children in their family. If we don't do this, they \nget poorer and poorer while continuing to work 40 hours a week.\n  We know low-income Americans would benefit from raising the minimum \nwage, but they are not the only ones. Hundreds of small businesses in \nmy home State of Massachusetts have signed on to a petition for a fair \nminimum wage of $10.50 per hour. That petition says that raising the \nminimum wage makes good business sense. That same small business \npetition says workers are also customers.\n  They are right. Increasing the purchasing power of minimum-wage \nworkers helps stimulate the economy. Research has shown time and time \nagain that minimum-wage workers spend the additional income they \nreceive when the minimum wage is increased. If we increase the minimum \nwage to $10.10 per hour, 28 million workers would receive about $35 \nbillion in additional wages.\n  Raising the minimum wage does not cause job losses, even during \nperiods of recession. Most minimum-wage workers need the income to make \nends meet and spend it quickly. It goes right into the economy. So \neconomists believe it will actually boost the economy by creating about \n85,000 new jobs and increasing economic activity by about $22 billion. \nThat means everyone in our economy should be on board.\n  Raising the minimum wage is about giving families security, \nopportunity, and dignity--the security to know they can make ends meet, \nthe opportunity to climb out of poverty and into the middle class, and \nthe dignity to know they are getting paid a fair wage for a hard day's \nwork. That is why I am proud to stand here today to urge my colleagues \nto increase the minimum wage so that we give America the raise it needs \nfor those who are working so hard for our economy.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/30/senate-section/article/S2535-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the time until 12 \nnoon will be equally divided and controlled between the two leaders or \ntheir designees.\n  The minority whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I think people listening to the debate \non the minimum wage issue may be a little bit confused, because we all \nwant to see hard-working American families work their way toward the \nAmerican dream, but we are not going to be able to do that with the \nFederal Government setting wages for restaurants, small businesses, and \nother people across the country.\n  I have no objection, obviously, if Massachusetts or Minnesota or some \nother State wants to raise the minimum wage. That is their choice. But \nwhat my colleagues are now asking for is the Federal Government, or the \nNation, to set a minimum wage at a level which will destroy between \\1/\n2\\ and 1 million jobs. That is not just me talking, that is the \nCongressional Budget Office, which is the official scorecard for the \nCongress.\n  Think about this: You are a small business and your biggest expense \nis wages for the people who work there. Now the Federal Government \ncomes in and says: Forget about your local conditions in North Dakota \nor in Texas. We are going to say, from Washington, DC, that everybody \nhas to raise wages by 40 percent. I can't imagine there will be many \nbusinesses, small businesses in particular, that can absorb a 40-\npercent increase in their overhead.\n  This is going to hurt low-wage earners who are currently employed. \nThat is what the Congressional Budget Office has said. And it is going \nto hurt the economy.\n  I heard the distinguished Senator from Minnesota say the economy is \ndoing great. Well, I guess he must have missed the latest report on the \nfirst quarter of 2014. Because of the bad weather--we had an \nunseasonably cold first quarter--the economy grew at .1 percent. In \nother words, it almost went into what would be a negative growth or a \nrecession. Of course, recession is defined as two quarters of negative \ngrowth, but my point is this strong growth he is talking about in the \neconomy is a figment, it is not the fact, and we need to deal with the \nfacts on the ground.\n  I wonder sometimes why public opinion holds Congress and Washington \nin such low esteem. Actually, I don't wonder why. My conclusion is they \nthink we are out of touch. We are out of touch with regular American \nfamilies--people who are working hard to make ends meet, getting the \nkids ready for school and living their version of the American dream. \nThe latest statistic I saw says that 27 percent of the American people \nthink we are on the right track. That is a shocking number. That means \n73 percent think we are on the wrong track.\n  What is the old saying, that the definition of insanity is doing the \nsame thing over and over again and expecting a different outcome? Well, \nlet's not do the same thing over and over again--keep America on the \nwrong track and engage in a policy decision here on this minimum wage, \nthis 40-percent increase in the minimum wage, which will actually hurt \nmore people than it helps.\n  This is not just my view. There was a poll that came out yesterday \nwhich said, basically, once people understood that people would be put \nout of work by increasing the minimum wage, 58 percent said it is not \nworth it. So 58 percent of the respondents said it is not worth it.\n  You know, it would be nice--it would be great--if we lived in a world \nwhere Washington could dictate what wages will be and all of a sudden \npeace, love, and happiness would break out--the age of Aquarius--\nbecause Washington is somehow distributing free money that didn't come \nfrom somewhere, that didn't come out of somebody's pocket or as part of \nsomeone's overhead or it didn't have any negative impact. But that is \nnot the world we live in.\n  Again, this is not just public opinion, it is not just my opinion, it \nis not just the opinion of the Congressional Budget Office about the \njob-killing nature of this dramatic 40-percent increase proposed in the \nminimum wage. Back in 1998, President Clinton's economic adviser Gene \nSperling--who just left the Obama administration--wrote a memo to \nPresident Clinton when a similar proposal was being made to raise the \nminimum wage 41 percent at that time. The Harkin bill we will vote on \nhere shortly proposes to raise the minimum wage 40 percent. This was \nback in 1998 that Gene Sperling is writing to President Clinton on a \nproposed increase of the minimum wage by 41 percent, but for all \npractical purposes it is the same sort of proposal. This is what Mr. \nSperling wrote to President Clinton:\n\n       Your entire economic team believes that this approach is \n     too aggressive and are concerned that Senator Kennedy's \n     proposal could prove damaging to the employment prospects of \n     low-skilled workers . . .\n\n  This was Senator Ted Kennedy's proposal back in 1998. Again, that is \nwhat the Congressional Budget Office has said about this bill. He goes \non to say, ``as well as to the general macroeconomic performance of the \neconomy.''\n\n  So what are our friends across the aisle proposing we do when the \neconomy grew at .1 percent this last quarter? Well, administer a body \nblow to this anemic economic growth. And this is not just my opinion. \nIt is deja vu all over again, as they say. I guess if you are around \nWashington long enough, you are going to see this movie replayed over \nand over.\n  The fact is that our economy is weaker today than it was in 1998. \nSure, unemployment is coming down slowly, but the economy is growing \ntoo slowly and the number of people in the workforce is the lowest it \nhas been for the last 30 years, the so-called labor participation rate.\n  So what did President Clinton do when his economic advisers said: \nDon't do it, Mr. President. While it is good politics, perhaps, it \nreally will hurt the economy, and it will put people out of work.\n\n[[Page S2536]]\n\n  President Clinton, to his credit, decided not to pursue that \nparticular 41-percent increase in the minimum wage.\n  I mention that as a sad contrast with the current situation where \nPresident Obama, seeing his favorability ratings at the lowest they \nhave been since he became President, is trying to change the subject \nand basically make a political point when the fact is that making the \npolitical point will actually hurt a lot of hard-working Americans.\n  So the majority leader has decided that rather than spend the week \ndebating legislation that would actually create jobs, we should spend \nit debating a proposal that would destroy jobs.\n  We all know that a massive minimum wage increase such as this can be \na job killer. So it really wasn't surprising when we saw that \nquantification by the Congressional Budget Office saying this proposal \ncould destroy up to 1 million jobs. Yet, when I was listening here, I \ndidn't hear the distinguished Senators from Massachusetts or from \nMinnesota talk at all about the Congressional Budget Office report. \nThey want to ignore that. They want us to believe that this increase in \nthe minimum wage would have little or no effect on employment and that \nmaybe it would have a positive effect. I heard the Senator from \nMassachusetts make that claim, but the people who actually run \nAmerica's businesses know better.\n  I had dinner the other night with some folks in the restaurant \nbusiness, and I will mention some examples in a moment. Most of these \nfolks I happened to have dinner with are pretty successful, but they \nstarted out washing dishes or bussing tables or waiting on tables. They \nstarted at the bottom and worked their way up because they could find a \njob, get their hand on the first rung of the economic ladder and then \nput the other hand on the next one and work their way up to where now \nthey are very successful businesspeople. But they understand how \nbusinesses work. They understand the negative consequences of this bad \npolicy coming from Washington, DC.\n  Just ask Robert Mayfield from Austin, TX, where I live. Mr. Mayfield \nhas been in business for 35 years now, and he is pretty successful. He \nalso knows a thing or two about the consequences of rising labor costs. \nThis is what we are talking about. For a business, this is the \noverhead. This is the labor costs they have to pay out of their income.\n  Mr. Mayfield wants Members of Congress to know that he strongly \nopposes this proposal because it will cost people jobs. Here is how he \ndescribes it:\n\n       What's most devastating about an increase in the minimum \n     wage is that costs go up, and as a business owner, I have to \n     raise prices--\n\n  So if we think we can pay somebody $10.10 an hour to work in a \nMcDonalds and it won't have an impact on the cost of a Big Mac, well, \nwe are living in a fantasy world. And that is what Mr. Mayfield says.\n\n       I have to raise prices, and sometimes the market [won't \n     bear it]. In the end, jobs will be lost and service will \n     suffer . . . The people in Congress wanting to pass a minimum \n     wage bill don't know any more about how a business works than \n     a hog knows about Sunday School. What makes it worse is \n     Obamacare hanging over our heads. It's a job killer.\n\n  I heard this again today from a friend of mine from San Antonio. \nLouis Barrios, whose family has run Mexican restaurants in San Antonio \nfor many years, talked about the combination of ObamaCare and now this \nproposed minimum wage increase.\n  He said: Right now, we would like to pay a single mom who is working \nin our restaurants to take orders. If Congress lifts the minimum wage \nto $10.10 an hour, we will have no choice but to replace that server, \nthat waitress, with an iPad.\n  That is what is happening in a lot of fast food restaurants these \ndays.\n  Again, Congress shouldn't operate in a vacuum without knowledge or an \nawareness of what the consequences might be.\n  I am not suggesting that any of our friends who are advocating this \nminimum wage increase want to put that single mom out of work, but if \nwe embrace that policy, that is what Louis Barrios told me this morning \nwould likely happen. And people like Robert Mayfield and Louis Barrios \nare supported by countless economists.\n  So we have folks who are actually doing the work, and then we have \nthe big thinkers like the economists who studied this issue and \nconcluded that this size minimum wage increase is a really bad idea in \nterms of the economy. More than 500 of those economists, including \nseveral Nobel Laureates, recently signed an open letter to several \npolicymakers expressing their opposition to this 40-percent minimum \nwage hike. Their letter said:\n\n       Many of the businesses that pay their workers minimum wage \n     operate on extremely tight profit margins, with any increase \n     in the cost of labor threatening this delicate balance.\n\n  That is also what Robert Mayfield said: I can't absorb it without \npassing it along to customers, increasing the prices they have to pay \nor I may have to lay some people off or I may just have to close my \nbusiness altogether.\n  They are operating on tight profit margins.\n  When so many economists and so many folks who are working across \nAmerica are telling us the same thing--and the truth is that it makes \nperfect common sense--it would be the height of arrogance for us to \nignore their concerns. But that is what President Obama and Majority \nLeader Reid are asking us to do today.\n  I made this point at the beginning. I fully share our colleagues' \nconcerns about the stagnant wages being earned by American workers all \nacross America. Indeed, since the Obama economic recovery--that was \nafter the recession of 2008, but after the Obama economic recovery \nstarted kicking in in June 2009, the median household income in this \ncountry has gone down by $1,800. So I understand the concern, but I \nfind it a little depressing that Congress's only answer is to raise the \nminimum wage by 40 percent, which will put people out of work and shut \ndown small businesses, when there are a lot better ways for us to \naddress it, and I will talk about that in a moment. Raising the minimum \nwage by 40 percent will not grow the economy and it will not create \njobs. It will do the opposite.\n  Of course, the truth is--and we read this in newspapers a couple of \nweeks ago--we all know what is happening here, so let's talk about the \n800-pound gorilla here in the Senate Chamber. The truth is that the \nPresident and Majority Leader Reid don't expect this bill to pass \nbecause they actually are very intelligent people and they know the \nfacts as I have just described them here on the floor of the Senate. \nThis is all about politics. This is about trying to make this side of \nthe aisle look bad and hard-hearted to try to rescue this midterm \nelection coming up in November. They see the President's approval \nrating going down, they see a number of midterm races for the Senate in \nplay, and they have to do something. They are desperate. ObamaCare \ndidn't work out the way they thought it would. You can't keep what you \nhave if you like it. Your premiums didn't go down $2,500 if you are an \naverage family of four. And, no, you can't keep your doctor in too many \ncases under the health insurance exchanges. So they are desperate.\n  We know from reporting in the New York Times and elsewhere that this \nminimum wage bill--this show vote we are going to have here shortly--is \npart of a larger messaging package created in collaboration with the \nDemocratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. That is not me talking; that \nis the admission by the leadership on the other side of the aisle. This \nis not about actually solving the problem; this is about political \ntheater, courtesy of Majority Leader Reid.\n  The real tragedy is that millions of Americans don't have any time or \nany patience for this sort of political theater and partisan \ngamesmanship because the numbers are very troubling. The Obama recovery \nis 5 years old. Yet 10.5 million people are still unemployed--including \n3.7 million people who have been unemployed for more than 6 months--\nwith an additional 7.4 million people working part-time because they \ncan't find full-time work or, because of ObamaCare, their employers \nhave taken them off full-time work and put them on part-time work in \norder to avoid the employer penalties.\n  It is true that the hard-working American family needs some help, but \nthe truth is that this remedy being offered today--this medicine--to \ntry to supposedly solve the problem will just make things worse. So I \nhave a proposition to make to our friends across the aisle. If they \nwould work with us, if they would leave these games by the\n\n[[Page S2537]]\n\nwayside, and if they would focus for a minute on trying to work with us \nto engage in solutions that would help grow the economy and help reduce \nunemployment and help raise wages across the Nation, then we would \ngladly embrace that, and we have introduced a number of bills that \nwould do exactly that.\n  I know the distinguished Senator who is presiding comes from an \nenergy-producing State like mine, and this is no mystery to her, but in \nTexas, like North Dakota, there are a lot of really good jobs, but \npeople don't have the skills necessary to qualify for those good jobs.\n  I was in Fredericksburg, TX, recently, where they are training \nwelders at the community college. A welder can make $100,000 or more a \nyear. In the Permian Basin in Midland and Odessa, TX, truckdrivers can \nmake $100,000 a year. It is unbelievable what this renaissance in \nAmerican energy has done to our economy and job creation.\n  One thing we could do that would be a heck of a lot more constructive \nthan this kind of show vote and partisan gamesmanship would be to \nimprove our workforce training programs, the Pell grant program, and \ntry to find ways to get people the training they need in order to \nqualify for these good, high-paying jobs being created by this \nwonderful renaissance in American energy.\n  We could do some other things. We could try to rein in some of the \nregulations that I hear about day in and day out from my constituents \nare constraining businesses. We could approve the Keystone XL Pipeline, \nwhich makes a lot of sense and would create about 42,000 jobs. It would \ngive us a safe source of energy from a friendly country such as Canada. \nWe could do something else constructive. We could provide some relief \nfor those people who have had full-time jobs turned into part-time jobs \nbecause of ObamaCare. Senator Collins from Maine and Senator Scott from \nSouth Carolina have a bill that would do exactly that.\n  Unfortunately, while I am an optimistic person, I am not particularly \noptimistic about the majority leader and the President changing their \ntactics in this election year. So that is why, tragically, under these \ncircumstances we find ourselves here today debating a jobs bill that \nwill actually kill jobs rather than one that would create jobs. What a \nterrible lost opportunity that is.\n\n  I see my friend from Maryland is here ready to speak.\n  I ask unanimous consent that several letters that have been provided \nto us by organizations such as the American Hotel & Lodging \nAssociation, the Wholesale Marketers Association, among other business \norganizations, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, be printed in \nthe Record at the conclusion of my comments. All of these letters are \nopposing this 40-percent minimum wage increase.\n  I would finally ask unanimous consent to make as part of the record a \ncolumn written by a gentleman by the name of Michael Saltsman in the \nIndyStar newspaper entitled ``Wage hike cost is no myth.'' This is the \nsource for the information we got about the Clinton archives and this \nmemo that Gene Sperling wrote to President Clinton advising him that \neven though it might be good temporary politics, it would actually hurt \na lot of low-wage workers. I ask unanimous consent that they be made \npart of the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the Indy Star, Apr. 26, 2014]\n\n                       Wage Hike Cost Is No Myth\n\n                         (By Michael Saltsman)\n\n       President Obama and Democrats in Congress have made a 40 \n     percent increase in the minimum wage their signature \n     election-year initiative. Supporters of the policy have \n     dismissed concerns that the policy will hurt jobs as a \n     ``myth'' (Indiana University's Fran Quigley made the claim in \n     his April 15 column). But the ``myth'' argument has become \n     increasingly difficult to defend. Not only has the \n     nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office validated opponents' \n     worst fears about a higher minimum wage and job loss, but the \n     release of new papers from President Clinton's archives shows \n     that his own economic team had misgivings about a 40 percent \n     wage hike.\n       In 1998, the U.S. economy was relatively strong: Business \n     was booming, unemployment was at 4.6 percent, and just under \n     14 percent of teens were unemployed. (That's a relatively low \n     figure for this demographic group.) The late Democratic Sen. \n     Ted Kennedy had proposed a 40 percent increase in the federal \n     minimum wage, from $5.15 an hour to $7.25.\n       But in a memo to President Clinton, chief economic adviser \n     Gene Sperling warned against supporting the senator's plans: \n     ``Your entire economic team believes that this [40 percent \n     increase] approach is too aggressive . . . and could prove \n     damaging to the employment prospects of low-skilled \n     workers.'' Clinton took his team's advice. Flash forward 16 \n     years: The U.S. economy today is dramatically weaker than it \n     was in the late 1990s. Unemployment stands at 6.8 percent, \n     and the unemployment rate for young adults is 20.6 percent. \n     (The jobless rate for this young age group has been above 20 \n     percent for 66 months, a historical record.) If President \n     Clinton's economic team was concerned about enacting a 40 \n     percent wage hike in 1998, they'd be scared to death of doing \n     it now.\n       And with good reason: The CBO analyzed the minimum wage \n     proposal on the table, and estimated that as many as 1 \n     million jobs would be lost if it was passed. A recent \n     national survey of affected employers indicates that nearly \n     40 percent would be forced to cut staff to adapt to the \n     higher labor costs. Even the Obama White House, in private \n     conversations in 2013, was uneasy with a dramatic wage \n     increase in this environment: According to the Washington \n     Post, the president's team ``rejected a figure so high, \n     worried that it could destroy jobs.''\n       What explains this year's lapse of economic judgment, then? \n     One explanation, supported by reporting in The New York \n     Times, is that the push for $10.10 is an election-year ploy \n     to boost enthusiasm among the party's base. It's also a \n     useful tactic to change the conversation away from the deeply \n     unpopular health-care law--even if it comes with collateral \n     damage for the least skilled in America. We won't know for \n     certain if President Obama endorsed this cynical strategy \n     until his own records and papers are released--perhaps 10 or \n     15 years from now. What we can say for certain today is that \n     supporters of a higher minimum wage are flat-out wrong when \n     they dismiss the employment consequences of a 40 percent \n     hike. If claiming that a minimum wage hike will harm jobs \n     truly is a ``right-wing myth,'' it's the only such myth that \n     both the Obama and Clinton White Houses believed in.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   April 28, 2014.\n       Dear Senator: The undersigned associations, representing a \n     broad cross section of the U.S. economy, urge you to reject \n     current proposals to raise the Federal minimum wage. One such \n     proposal is S. 2223, the Minimum Wage Fairness Act, which \n     will increase the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour for non-\n     tipped employees and tie future minimum wage increases to \n     inflation.\n       For many businesses, this 39 percent increase could truly \n     be the difference between continuing to operate and going out \n     of business. For the employees it attempts to help, it may be \n     the difference between a job and unemployment.\n       As the Congressional Budget Office recently confirmed, \n     raising the minimum wage will be detrimental to job creation \n     and low-skilled workers trying to get started on the economic \n     ladder. Traditional economic theory and modeling holds that \n     the more expensive something is, the less of it one can \n     afford. This is exactly what will happen if the minimum wage \n     is increased--there will be fewer low-skilled workers hired, \n     other workers will lose hours, and employers will have more \n     incentive to find other ways to be productive, such as using \n     technology or automation where they would previously have \n     hired someone. When Congress' own economists say increasing \n     the minimum wage will reduce employment, Congress should \n     listen.\n       Any discussion about raising the minimum wage needs to \n     recognize that many businesses run under very slim operating \n     margins and will have the hardest time absorbing these higher \n     labor costs. They will have to find more revenues or trim \n     costs to make up the difference. Furthermore, indexing the \n     minimum wage to inflation means that employers will likely be \n     faced with automatically increasing labor costs without an \n     automatic increase in revenues or profits.\n       Further, while the legislative package may contain benefits \n     intended to help small businesses, these are insufficient to \n     mitigate the negative impact the wage increase will surely \n     have on businesses.\n       We respectfully ask that you oppose S. 1737 and other \n     similar proposals to raise the minimum wage. The best way to \n     help low-skilled and low-income workers is to favor more \n     comprehensive, pro-growth solutions to our nation's most \n     pressing economic issues.\n           Sincerely,\n       American Hotel and Lodging Association, American Wholesale \n     Marketers Association, Asian American Hotel Owners \n     Association, Association of Kentucky Fried Chicken \n     Franchisees, International Franchise Association, \n     International Warehouse Logistics Association, National \n     Association of Manufacturers, National Association of Theatre \n     Owners, National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors, \n     National Council of Chain Restaurants, National Federation of \n     Independent Business, National Franchisee Association, \n     National Grocers Association, National Office Products \n     Alliance, National Restaurant Association, National Retail \n     Federation, NATSO, representing America's Travel Plazas and \n     Truckstops, Petroleum\n\n[[Page S2538]]\n\n     Marketers Association of America, Professional Landcare \n     Network, Society of American Florists, U.S. Chamber of \n     Commerce.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                              American Farm Bureau Federation,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 29, 2014.\n     Re: American Farm Bureau Federation Opposition of S. 2223\n\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington DC.\n       Dear Senator: For agricultural producers across America, \n     remaining economically competitive on fruits, vegetables and \n     other commodities that are labor intensive is a continual \n     struggle. Particularly over the last few decades, the \n     American market has seen tremendous increases in the \n     importation of foreign-grown produce, especially from nations \n     where labor costs are substantially lower than those in the \n     United States. Nevertheless, hired labor (including contract \n     labor) remains an important input to U.S. agricultural \n     production, accounting for about 17 percent of variable \n     production expenses and about 40 percent of such expenses for \n     fruits, vegetables, and nursery products.\n       As the Congressional Budget Office recently confirmed, \n     raising the minimum wage will be detrimental to job creation \n     and low-skilled workers trying to get started on the economic \n     ladder. As the minimum wage is increased, workers risk losing \n     hours and employers will have more incentive to invest in \n     technology rather than hiring the low-skilled worker. \n     Additionally, in the agricultural sector, where margins are \n     historically slim, any proposal that escalates labor costs \n     can put growers in a precarious position. S. 2223, the \n     Minimum Wage Fairness Act, proposes to increase the federal \n     minimum wage by nearly 40 percent, making it even more \n     difficult for growers to remain competitive. Growers will \n     have to find more revenues or trim costs to make up the \n     difference. The increased pressure from higher labor costs \n     would only make it harder for farmers, particularly small- \n     and medium-sized growers, to compete or even stay in \n     business.\n       S. 2223 threatens the economic well-being of many \n     agricultural producers in labor-intensive crops. Farm Bureau \n     urges you to vote ``no'' on this bill when it is taken up on \n     the Senate floor.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bob Stallman,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                        Chamber of Commerce of the\n\n\n                                     United States of America,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 29, 2014.\n       To the Members of the United States Senate: The U.S. \n     Chamber of Commerce, the world's largest business federation \n     representing the interests of more than three million \n     businesses of all sizes, sectors, and regions, as well as \n     state and local chambers and industry associations, and \n     dedicated to promoting, protecting, and defending America's \n     free enterprise system, urges you to vote against S. 2223, \n     the ``Minimum Wage Fairness Act,'' which would ultimately \n     increase the federal minimum wage by $2.85 per hour, and \n     index it to inflation.\n       The proposed increase--almost 40 %--would cause small \n     business employers who have very tight operating margins and \n     are least able to absorb higher costs to eliminate entry-\n     level jobs, reduce hours and benefits for current employees, \n     and possibly dismiss current employees. Furthermore, indexing \n     the minimum wage to inflation means labor costs would \n     continue to increase even though employer revenues and \n     profits may not.\n       Many economists, including those used by Congress, have \n     concluded that raising the minimum wage would be detrimental \n     to job creation and low-skilled workers trying to get started \n     on the economic ladder. The Congressional Budget Office \n     recently determined that as many as 500,000 jobs could be \n     lost by late 2016 if this increase is passed. This \n     determination was later endorsed by Chairman of the Federal \n     Reserve Janet Yellen--if the minimum wage is increased there \n     would be fewer low skilled workers hired, other workers would \n     lose hours, and employers would have more incentive to \n     replace employees with technology or automation.\n       The economics columnist Robert Samuelson summed it up well: \n     ``Many studies find negative job effects. The CBO didn't make \n     them up. Hiking the minimum wage is more compelling as \n     politics than as social policy . . . weak labor markets still \n     reflect the Great Recession's hangover.''\n       Additionally, the temporary tax breaks included in this \n     bill to soften the impact would not offset the harm of the \n     additional labor costs. The push for this increase in the \n     minimum wage comes against the backdrop of employers \n     struggling to recover from the recession and to figure out \n     the impact of Obamacare on their operations. The last thing \n     they need is for the cost of their labor to go up as well.\n       Increasing the minimum wage would be a further drag on the \n     economy and Chamber members trying to be part of the \n     recovery, both big and small. The Chamber strongly opposes S. \n     2223, the ``Minimum Wage Fairness Act.'' The Chamber may \n     consider including votes on, or in relation to, S. 2223--\n     including votes on the motion to proceed--in our annual How \n     They Voted scorecard.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              R.

As our economy \n     continues to struggle amid uncertainty around issues such as \n     healthcare, now is not the time for government to impose \n     additional new costs on American businesses.\n       IFDA is the non-profit trade association that represents \n     businesses in the foodservice distribution industry \n     throughout the United States and internationally. IFDA \n     members include broadline, systems, and specialty foodservice \n     distributors that supply food and related products to \n     professional kitchens from restaurants, colleges and \n     universities, to hospitals and care facilities, hotels and \n     resorts, and other foodservice operations. Our members \n     operate more than 800 distribution facilities with more than \n     $125 billion in annual sales.\n       Increasing the minimum wage at this time makes little \n     sense, especially with our foodservice operator customers \n     continuing to face tremendous headwinds from a wide variety \n     of factors. As employers struggle to create jobs, the \n     nation's job participation rate remains at historically low \n     levels. This has resulted in severe reductions in consumer's \n     disposable income, a critical element in the growth of food \n     away from home.\n       Other challenges have come from additional government \n     requirements. The employer mandate in the Affordable Care Act \n     will result in dramatic cost increases as operators must \n     provide healthcare for their employees or move their \n     workforce away from full time employment. The continued \n     diversion of corn to the fuel supply created by the Renewable \n     Fuel Standard has increased costs by as much as $18,000 per \n     year to individual restaurant operators.\n       Increasing the minimum wage now will do nothing to solve \n     what continues to be the most critical issue facing our \n     nation today, the stagnant economy and continuing high \n     unemployment rate. I strongly urge you to oppose any effort \n     to increase the minimum wage.\n           With best wishes,\n\n                                               Jonathan Eisen,\n\n                                            Senior Vice President,\n     Government Relations.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           International Franchise\n\n\n                                                  Association,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 29, 2014.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the nation's 825,000 franchise \n     small businesses and the nearly 18 million workers they \n     support, I write today to urge you to vote against \n     legislation to raise the federal minimum wage. One such \n     proposal is S. 2223, the Minimum Wage Fairness Act, which \n     will increase the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour and tie \n     future minimum wage increases to inflation. For the many \n     franchise businesses that are labor-intensive and already \n     operate on thin profit margins, this legislation could be the \n     difference between continuing to operate and going out of \n     business--between maintaining employees or shedding more \n     jobs.\n       Businesses should be able to determine the most competitive \n     starting wage and subsequent raises for their employees \n     within their industry and local economy. A drastic minimum \n     wage increase would ripple throughout the fragile American \n     economy and undermine employer's desires to reward hard work \n     with wage increases. This effect will be even more pronounced \n     when combined with the full implementation of the Affordable \n     Care Act's employer mandate. According to the Congressional \n     Budget Office, raising the minimum wage will be detrimental \n     to job creation and low-skilled workers trying to get started \n     on the economic ladder. When Congress' own economists say \n     increasing the minimum wage will reduce employment, Congress \n     should listen.\n       Although this legislation contains other benefits for small \n     businesses that the International Franchise Association (IFA) \n     fully supports, they are insufficient to mitigate the \n     negative impact of a drastic increase in the minimum wage. On \n     their own, tax incentives for purchasing or hiring are a \n     significant boon for franchise business owners, and they \n     should be considered along with other business tax extenders \n     that will help the nation's small businesses grow and thrive. \n     Including important pro-growth initiatives as a sweetener for \n     the bitter pill of an artificial wage floor that disrupts the \n     labor market is the type of public policy that holds our \n     nation's franchise owners back from fully contributing to the \n     nation's economic recovery.\n       I urge you to vote ``NO'' on this measure. The IFA will \n     consider all votes on, or in relation to, this issue among \n     our annual list of ``Key Votes.''\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                          Stephen J.

Lamar Alexander,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Alexander: The U.S. Senate is expected to \n     consider S. 2223, legislation seeking to increase the federal \n     minimum wage from its current level of $7.25 an hour to \n     $10.10 an hour, an increase of 40 percent. On behalf of the \n     National Council of Chain Restaurants, I am writing to \n     express our strong opposition to this ill-timed and flawed \n     proposal.\n       At this key juncture in the country's economic recovery, \n     the last thing that the Senate should be considering is a \n     scheme to\n\n[[Page S2539]]\n\n     raise labor costs on many local businesses across the United \n     States. As you may know, the vast majority of workers earning \n     the minimum wage are teens living with their parents, adults \n     living alone, or second household earners. Moreover, as \n     minimum wage workers gain important skills, they receive \n     significant raises. As such, the legislation before the \n     Senate fails to recognize that the federal minimum wage is a \n     starting wage, and that most employees don't stay on this \n     starting wage for very long.\n       In addition, S. 2223 would increase the cash wage for \n     tipped employees by almost 240 percent. This provision is \n     included even though current law already requires employers \n     to pay eligible employees the statutory wage rate in the \n     uncommon instance that tipped income doesn't reach the \n     starting wage rate (on a national level, the median hourly \n     wage for tipped employees is $16-$22/hour). Finally, the \n     proposal links future wage hikes to the consumer price index, \n     injecting an unnecessary degree of uncertainty and volatility \n     into labor cost calculations for chain restaurant businesses.\n       Chain restaurants are employers of opportunity in local \n     communities around the country, whether it is a first job for \n     individuals with limited work skills to long-term careers in \n     a fast-paced, competitive and innovative industry. Rather \n     than considering legislation which raises the cost of staying \n     in business for labor-intensive small establishments while \n     limiting needed job opportunities, the Senate should advance \n     policies proven to foster broad-based economic growth and to \n     address the historically low labor participation rate and the \n     nation's persistently high unemployment rate (including a \n     teen unemployment rate of over 20 percent).\n       We urge you to oppose S. 2223, or related legislation, when \n     it is considered by the U.S. Senate.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Robert J. Green,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            National Federation of\n\n\n                                         Independent Business,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 29, 2014.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the National Federation of \n     Independent Business (NFIB), the nation's leading small \n     business advocacy organization, I am writing in strong \n     opposition to S. 2223, the Minimum Wage Fairness Act, a bill \n     to increase the minimum wage to $10.10 and permanently index \n     it to inflation. NFIB opposes any effort to increase the \n     federal minimum wage, and a vote on S. 2223 will be \n     considered an NFIB KEY VOTE for the 113th Congress.\n       Like most government mandates on business, raising the \n     minimum wage will have a deep and disproportionate impact on \n     the small-business sector because small businesses are the \n     least able to absorb such a dramatic increase in their labor \n     costs. The small-business sector has historically created \n     two-thirds of net new private jobs in the U.S. economy, but \n     has failed to recover in recent years because of a series of \n     policies that increase the burden on small-business owners--\n     increases to healthcare costs, higher taxes, more costly \n     regulations, and now the minimum wage increase proposal.\n       The minimum wage directly affects small businesses because \n     a large amount of their earnings go directly to pay for \n     operating expenses, such as equipment, supplies, property \n     costs, inventory and employee wages and benefits. Increasing \n     labor costs does not incentivize growth or hiring--they make \n     it nearly impossible. Permanently indexing the minimum wage, \n     like S. 2223 proposes, would ensure that it would rise every \n     year, further adding to the burden placed on employers and \n     placing them at a competitive disadvantage. S. 2223 also \n     increases the minimum cash wage for tipped employees until it \n     reaches 70 percent of the federal minimum wage. Raising the \n     cost of labor creates incentives for employers to find ways \n     to use less labor.\n       The latest Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report \n     supports NFIB's Research Foundation findings: significant job \n     loss as a result of increasing the minimum wage. NFIB's \n     Research Foundation analyzed the potential economic impact of \n     raising the California, Illinois, New Jersey and New York \n     minimum wages, and the results were telling. An increase of \n     California's minimum wage to $9.25 per hour would cost the \n     state 68,000 jobs--63 percent of which are in the small \n     business sector--and a $5.7 billion reduction in real \n     economic output. Illinois would lose 21,000 jobs (67 percent \n     in small businesses) and $4.5 billion in economic output from \n     an increase to $10.65 per hour. A New Jersey proposal to \n     increase the minimum wage to $8.25 would cut 31,000 jobs from \n     the state (59 percent in small businesses) and $17.4 billion \n     in lost economic output. The New York study concluded a loss \n     of 68,000 jobs (more than 70 percent in small businesses) and \n     $2.5 billion in lost economic output.\n       The job killing effects of this minimum wage hike are \n     obvious. Small business cannot afford another economically \n     devastating mandate from the federal government. NFIB urges \n     you to vote NO on S. 2223 and will consider it an NFIB KEY \n     VOTE for the 113th Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Susan Eckerly,\n\n                                            Senior Vice President,\n     Public Policy.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 National Grocers Association,\n\n                                                   April 28, 2014.\n     Hon. Senator Harry Reid,\n     Senate Majority Leader, Hart Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Senator Mitch McConnell,\n     Senate Republican Leader, Russell Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid and Senator McConnell: The National \n     Grocers Association (NGA) strongly urges a NO VOTE on the \n     Minimum Wage Fairness Act (S. 2223) as it comes to the floor \n     for a vote. NGA Independent retail and wholesale grocers have \n     a significant economic impact across nearly every community \n     in America. Our industry is accountable for close to 1 \n     percent of the nation's overall economy and is responsible \n     for generating $131 billion in sales, 944,000 jobs, $30 \n     billion in wages, and $27 billion in tax revenue. We are \n     proud that the communities we serve are also the \n     neighborhoods we live in.\n       The Minimum Wage Fairness Act, if enacted would increase \n     the federal minimum wage to $10.10 per hour over a 2 year \n     period and tie future minimum wage increases to inflation. \n     While the independent grocery industry welcomes any focus on \n     the improving economy and creating jobs, a minimum wage \n     increase during a time when our economy continues to recover \n     runs counter to that goal. A recent Congressional Budget \n     Office (CBO) supports this claim noting that increasing the \n     minimum wage to $10.10 an hour could reduce total employment \n     by 500,000 workers by the second half of 2016.\n       According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2012, \n     cashiers in the grocery industry made an hourly mean wage of \n     $10.24, nearly 2 dollars more than the current federal \n     minimum wage and higher than any of the other retail \n     industries including department stores, convenience stores, \n     and restaurants. Grocers are proud of the jobs that we \n     provide and the wide array of career opportunities we offer \n     to our employees. We are often the first job for many teens \n     and offer diverse opportunities for employees of many skill \n     sets, some of which have age restrictions such as meat \n     cutters, bailers, and fork lift operators who must be at \n     least 18 years of age.\n       Because this is a critical issue to our member companies, \n     NGA will be key voting the Minimum Wage Fairness Act (S. \n     2223) and including it on our 2014 Legislative Scorecard. \n     Thank you for your consideration. Independent grocers look \n     forward to your support on this very important issue by \n     VOTING NO on S. 2223.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Peter J. Larkin,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              National Association\n\n\n                                             of Manufacturers,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 29, 2014.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: The National Association of Manufacturers \n     (NAM), the largest manufacturing association in the United \n     States, representing manufacturers in every industrial sector \n     and in all 50 states, urges you to oppose the Motion to \n     Proceed to S. 2223, the Minimum Wage Fairness Act introduced \n     by Senator Tom Harkin (D-IA).\n       The NAM supports labor policies promoting job creation and \n     manufacturers are committed to compensating employees at a \n     competitive wage for their work. High levels of job \n     performance and employee satisfaction are encouraged by \n     relating compensation that is both internally equitable and \n     externally competitive to performance on the job.\n       The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) recently reported \n     raising the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 an hour will be \n     detrimental to job creation. In fact, CBO estimates that an \n     increase in the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour could result \n     in a loss of employment of 500,000 by the second half of \n     2016.\n       The NAM's Key Vote Advisory Committee has indicated that \n     votes on S. 2223, including procedural motions such as a \n     Motion to Proceed, may be considered for designation as Key \n     Manufacturing Votes in the 113th Congress. Thank you for your \n     consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Aric Newhouse,\n\n                                            Senior Vice President,\n     Policy and Government Relations.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                              National Restaurant Association,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 28, 2014.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the nation's restaurant and \n     foodservice industry, we urge you to oppose the Minimum Wage \n     Fairness Act (S. 2223). The National Restaurant Association \n     may consider any votes on, or related to, this legislation in \n     our annual ``How They Voted'' legislative scorecard.\n       The Minimum Wage Fairness Act, would increase the federal \n     minimum wage to $10.10 an hour and raise the minimum cash \n     wage for tipped employees to 70 percent of the minimum wage \n     for non-tipped employees. This represents a nearly 40 percent \n     increase in the current federal wage, and a tripling of the \n     cash wage for employees who receive tips.\n       With over 13.5 million employees, the restaurant and \n     foodservice industry is the second-largest private employer \n     in the United States. As average pre-tax profit margins in \n     the restaurant industry range from 4 to 6 percent, \n     restaurateurs have little ability to absorb or offset higher \n     labor costs, especially at this time of economic and \n     operational uncertainty. Roughly 90 percent of the industry \n     consists of small business owners, with only\n\n[[Page S2540]]\n\n     1 out of 10 restaurants in the U.S. owned and operated by \n     chain corporations.\n       The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) \n     officially concluded that raising the federal minimum wage to \n     $10.10 would result in 500,000 job losses. Moreover, that's a \n     conservative estimate, as CBO recognized in its analysis that \n     the job losses could be as high as 1 million.\n       As the continued fiscal battles at the federal level have \n     negatively affected consumer confidence, the unknown factors \n     associated with potentially significant cost increases from \n     implementation of the 2010 health care law have created an \n     increasingly difficult business environment for Main Street \n     businesses. While we understand the legislation is intended \n     to help low-income families, U.S. Census data reveals that \n     the average household income of restaurant employees who earn \n     the federal minimum wage is $62,507. Moreover, according to \n     U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 71 percent of minimum wage \n     restaurant workers are individuals under the age of 25, most \n     of whom work part-time. These are critical positions for \n     bringing people into the labor force.\n       Mandating such a dramatic increase in the starting wage at \n     this time, when many businesses are already struggling in a \n     difficult economic climate, will limit employment \n     opportunities and slow economic growth in a sector of the \n     economy that is undergoing a tremendous amount of change. We \n     welcome a discussion about wages and economic factors, but we \n     ask you to oppose this proposed wage increase and similar \n     proposals and work with the small business community on a \n     plan to strengthen the economy and create some sense of \n     certainty going forward.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 Scott DeFife,\n\n                                         Executive Vice President,\n     Policy and Government Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   National Retail Federation,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 29, 2014.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Republican Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Republican Leader McConnell: On behalf of the National \n     Retail Federation (NRF) and the nation's retail industry, I \n     am writing to urge you to oppose the proposed forty percent \n     increase in the federal minimum wage that the Senate plans to \n     consider this week. Our nation's economy is continuing to \n     struggle to create jobs, and this legislation will likely \n     make it worse, particularly among younger workers. Please \n     note that we will consider votes on this measure among the \n     Key Retail Votes for our annual voting scorecard.\n       NRF is the world's largest retail trade association, \n     representing discount and department stores, home goods and \n     specialty stores, Main Street merchants, grocers, \n     wholesalers, chain restaurants and Internet retailers from \n     the United States and more than 45 countries. Retail is the \n     nation's largest private sector employer, supporting one in \n     four U.S. jobs--42 million working Americans. Contributing \n     $2.5 trillion to annual GDP, retail is a daily barometer for \n     the nation's economy. NRF's This is Retail campaign \n     highlights the industry's opportunities for life-long \n     careers, how retailers strengthen communities, and the \n     critical role that retail plays in driving innovation.\n       Raising the standard of living for low-skill, low-wage \n     workers is a valid goal, but there is clear evidence that \n     mandated wage hikes undermine the job prospects for less \n     skilled and part-time workers. Policymakers have other tools, \n     such as increasing the earned income tax credit, fixing the \n     tax code, education improvements, immigration reform, \n     transportation funding, and strong trade alliances that will \n     aid in achieving that goal without creating more \n     unemployment. Finding more opportunities for those trying to \n     start out is a better economic approach than restricting the \n     amount of jobs for those seeking employment.\n       What we should be doing is talking about how we improve \n     people's chances to move up. The minimum wage was designed to \n     have young people get into the marketplace to get started. \n     With a workforce of 155 million, a approximately 2 million \n     are on minimum wage. To talk about raising the entry, or \n     starting, wage is to admit we have failed on education and \n     training.\n       Slow job growth is the most pressing issue facing the U.S. \n     economy and our focus should be on the creation of jobs and \n     increasing opportunities for the under-employed. For many \n     businesses, particularly smaller employers, uncertainty is \n     the dominant mood. Higher labor costs also loom in the future \n     with the pending implementation of the Affordable Care Act. \n     All of these factors suggest that now is the least opportune \n     moment to engage in what is essentially an opportunity tax by \n     raising the minimum wage.\n       Employers respond to higher labor costs by hiring fewer \n     workers. A higher minimum wage eliminates entry-level \n     positions that provide unskilled employees the opportunity to \n     gain experience. Less experience makes it harder for workers \n     to become more productive and earn higher wages. There is a \n     domino effect: such an increase creates wage inflation by \n     putting upward pressure on existing wages of those making \n     more than the minimum. It would limit job growth and stunt \n     that group of workers ability to advance. There would be a \n     contraction of jobs instead of an increase in positions \n     available. Lost jobs as a consequence of a higher minimum \n     wage will inevitably make it harder for these individuals to \n     learn new job skills than can create a path to a brighter \n     future.\n       The retail sector has been a leading job creator throughout \n     the recession and the recovery. For many Americans, the \n     retail industry provides the chance to learn new job skills, \n     to earn a living, to find a career, or to earn some extra \n     money. Retail offers a wide range of career opportunities, \n     the vast majority of which are above minimum wage, and \n     supports one out of four U.S. jobs.\n       NRF encourages Congress to forgo sound-bite politics and \n     instead focus on economic policies that find ways of putting \n     people to work. This is not the time for yet another anti-job \n     mandate for those employees that are looking for jobs and \n     those companies who want to help grow the economy.\n       NRF looks forward to working with Congress as you seek to \n     increase economic growth in this country.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 David French,\n\n                                            Senior Vice President,\n                                             Government Relations.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I have been on the floor several times, and many of my colleagues, \nparticularly on this side of the aisle, have been here to talk about a \ngrowing trend in America; that we see a concentration of wealth and a \nshrinking middle class. If you are a business owner, you should be very \nconcerned about that. The growing middle class is what buys the \nproducts that go to the restaurants that keep our economy going. Time \nand time again we have asked to proceed on legislation that would allow \nus to help the growing middle class. This is not our first effort with \nthe minimum wage. Many States have passed increases in the minimum \nwage. It is time for our Federal Government to do the same, to help a \ngrowing middle class.\n  The last effort was on behalf of gender equity, paycheck fairness, \nwhere we sought to have a fair shot for women in the workplace, so they \ndon't have to work extra time to make the same income as a man for \nequal work. A woman receives on average about 77 percent of what a man \ndoes in the same job. So we tried to move forward with a fair shot for \nwomen with paycheck fairness. But, no, the Republicans said, no, we are \nnot even going to consider it. We are not even going to take that up.\n  We are hearing some of the same arguments now in regard to proceeding \non the debate on the minimum wage. My friend from Texas talked about \nthe Affordable Care Act. We are proud the Affordable Care Act gives a \nfair shot for all Americans to have access to quality, affordable \nhealth care. Millions of Americans today have quality health insurance \ncoverage they didn't have before the passage of the Affordable Care \nAct. It is working. We now know that insurance companies cannot \ndiscriminate against women or anyone based upon preexisting conditions. \nThose days are over. There is now a fair shot for health care access--\naccess for all Americans. We know small business owners now can get \ncompetitive plans and they can choose among a lot of different types of \nplans, a fair shot for small business owners to be treated equally with \nlarger companies in regard to the insurance marketplace. We have done \nthat.\n  We have expanded Medicaid to close that coverage gap known as the \ndoughnut hole for prescription drug coverage, and there are no longer \nany copayments on preventive health care. We extended Medicare because \nwe want a fair shot for our seniors for their security, and that is why \nour caucus defends the Social Security system, knowing how important it \nis for our seniors. Yes, we do fight for our children. A fair shot for \nour children means we support Head Start and we support help for higher \neducation because we know that is the ticket to economic growth.\n  In a few moments--in a few moments--we will have a chance for a fair \nshot for working families in this country by moving to consider the \nminimum wage law. We haven't adjusted the minimum wage law for a long \ntime. I heard my friend from Texas talk about job issues. Every time we \nhave increased the minimum wage our economy has grown, and there is a \nreason for that. This legislation will put $34 billion into the \neconomy, will help\n\n[[Page S2541]]\n\ngrow the economy, and will lift 2 million Americans out of poverty.\n  Think about this. If someone works 40 hours a week and they receive \nthe minimum wage, there is not a State in this country where they can \nget affordable housing. People cannot support their family on the \nminimum wage in the United States of America. By passing the Minimum \nWage Act, we give 28 million Americans a raise. This is a fair shot for \nall workers in this country.\n  Let me dispel some of the rumors that are out there. The average age \nof a person on minimum wage is 35 years old. We are not talking about \ncollege students. We are talking about people trying to support a \nfamily on the minimum wage, and they cannot do it. Many have children. \nThe majority are women. It is time we answer this inequity in our \nsystem. We haven't had an increase in the minimum wage--in fact, if we \nlook at what it was in 1968, this increase will basically get us back \nto where we were in 1968. It will help our economy.\n  We have heard these projections before; that every time we do this it \nwill kill jobs. It doesn't do that. Look at the history. Look at what \nhas happened with the previous increases in the minimum wage: Our \neconomy has gotten stronger. It has grown stronger.\n  So it is time to give a raise to American workers. It is time to help \na growing middle class. It is time we give a fair shot to working \nfamilies in America. I urge my colleagues to vote to proceed on this \ndebate. Don't continue a filibuster. Let's give America a fair shot, \nand I urge my colleagues to support the motion to proceed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I rise to offer rebuttal to the claims my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle are making about their proposals to enact an \nunprecedented increase in the Federal minimum wage. I come at this \nissue as a former small business owner and an employee who once worked \nfor the minimum wage. I started as a stock boy. Another time I was a \nwindow washer. I learned some important things while I was doing that: \nI learned work ethic, I learned to show up on time, I learned to do the \njob well, and learned other skills so I could advance. Eventually I got \nthe schooling, skills and the work ethic to own my own business.\n  My colleagues gloss over the fact that minimum wage is for entry-\nlevel employees. Unskilled workers, young people, and those new to the \nworkforce are those who typically earn the minimum wage because it is \ntheir first job or opportunity to gain career skills. This is evidenced \nby the fact that a majority of minimum wage earners are between the \nages of 16 and 24. These are the jobs where the workers learn to be \ndependable, how to work with other employees, and how to obtain that \nwork ethic. A lot of them don't know how to run a cash register. They \ndon't know how to make change. They don't know how to greet a customer. \nThey don't know how to interrupt their texting in order to wait on the \ncustomer. This is why two-thirds of the employees who start at the \nminimum wage are earning more than the minimum wage within 1 year. They \nlearn how to do those things. They pick up skills.\n  Somebody was talking to me about how people who are getting the \nminimum wage are in dead-end jobs such as fast food. I happened to be \nstanding next to a guy who was working at Burger King. He said: Wait a \nminute. I started 6 months ago. I started at minimum wage. I learned \nthe job. I am dependable. I show up. I know what the other work is. I \nam a supervisor now. In 6 months, I am a supervisor. I am making a lot \nmore than the minimum wage, and in another year I might have my own \nstore.\n  That might have some validity because I have a friend in Cheyenne who \nowns a McDonald's, and he points out to me the other people in Wyoming \nwho now own a McDonald's who used to work for him who all started at a \nminimum wage. You have to start somewhere.\n  A lot of people think when they graduate from college they are \nsupposed to move into an executive position. Chances are they will get \na job and they will start at the bottom of the company. If they do \ntheir work well, learn the skills and become dependable, they will work \ntheir way up and they will make more money.\n  Even more troubling are the claims my colleagues are making to \njustify this particular increase. Increasing the Federal minimum wage \nby nearly 40 percent represents an arbitrary and unprecedented increase \nwhich is largely unsupported by economic analysis. Both in the Health, \nEducation, Labor & Pensions Committee and on the Senate floor advocates \nfor this bill have declared that an increase to $10.10 an hour would \nrestore the minimum wage to the purchasing power it had in 1968. They \nmake this claim because they use the Consumer Price Index to justify \ntheir point of view. What they are doing is starting an inflation \ncycle.\n  Look at this. If somebody is making $7 and they get moved to $10, the \nperson who is working for $9 has to go to $12 and the person at $11 has \nto go to $14 and so on up. You cannot put on a new guy with no skills \nat a wage higher than they were before unless everybody gets a pay \nraise. That is wonderful. It goes all the way up the ladder. It just \ndoesn't stop at the $14 level. In fact, it even affects seniors. The \nseniors' cost of living is based on wages, not on what it costs a \nsenior to buy something. So everybody in America is going to get a \nraise, and that is wonderful, except--and here is the catch--in order \nto pay for those raises the money has to come from somewhere.\n  So if you like the dollar deal at your fast-food place, get ready for \na dollar and a half at your fast-food place. Yes, right, it is only a \n40-percent increase, but a buck and a half sounds better than $1.40, so \nthey are going to raise it to the next level where they can pick up the \ncustomers, where it will sound good. Yes, you get a 30-percent \nincrease, but the cost of what you buy goes up 30 percent. Did you get \nahead? I don't think so.\n  The only one that gains in that is the Federal Government. You have \nmoved into a higher tax bracket. That is how we raise taxes in America. \nWe cause an inflation cycle. We give people more money and we make them \npay more taxes and all they get to buy is whatever they bought before. \nSo that purchasing power of 1968 will go up to the purchasing power of \n2009 and beyond because the prices will have to go up.\n  My colleagues are quick to deny the CBO estimates that we have all \nseen which suggest their proposed plan would result in a loss of low-\nwage jobs. The minimum wage does not have to go up for minimum wage \nemployees to get a raise. The proposal before the Senate throws cold \nwater on job creation and adds to the burden businesses are already \nfacing under the President's failed health care program.\n  Instead, the Senate should be considering proposals which promote job \ngrowth. The Workforce Investment Act has been out there for 8 years. It \nwould train millions of people to jobs that are available in their \ncommunity right now. It would give them skills beyond the minimum wage. \nLet's consider tax reform, growing U.S. exports, approving the Keystone \nXL Pipeline, as several of my colleagues and I recently highlighted.\n  But let me also speak on a personal level about the minimum wage. I \nhave noted many times that I was a small business owner. My wife and I \noperated our own shoe stores in Wyoming and Montana. I know that all \nsmall business owners have families, their own and the families who \nwork with them. One cannot credibly claim to be helping workers while \nat the same time hurting the businesses that employ them, especially \nunder the guise of helping working families.\n  At our shoe store we hired people who didn't have basic skills. Some \nof them had never run a cash register. They never sold anything. They \nweren't sure how you dressed in the business community. We put them \nthrough courses. Each course resulted in a pay raise. For several \npeople after several months they were actually able to earn what they \nwere paid. Yes, it costs money to train people, especially those who \nhave little or no skills, and those are the ones whom we need to help.\n  By increasing the minimum wage Congress would shut the employment \ndoor on the very individuals they are trying to help. Small business is \nthe driver of our economy. They take these\n\n[[Page S2542]]\n\nunskilled workers and they train them. The simple fact is that an \nincrease of minimum wage is of no benefit to a worker without a job or \na job seeker without a prospect of getting a job.\n  I want to cover that tax problem again--the inflation issue. Minimum \nwage increases also start an inflation cycle. When some people get a \nwage increase, then everyone has to get a wage increase to recognize \nthose who know more, do more, are more reliable, and have more skills. \nTo pay everyone more, prices have to go up. When this happens, people \nwill make more, but they have to spend more so they actually don't get \nahead. The only one who benefits is the Federal Government because they \nget a tax increase.\n  At some point someone actually has to produce more to get more, and \nthat can be done with new skills or a new idea with training. The \nproblem we face is one of minimum skills, not minimum wages. The effect \nmay be low wages, but the cause is low skills. We need to address those \nworkers who have few, if any, of the skills they need to compete for a \nbetter job and command higher wages.\n  We need to start thinking in terms of skills, the kind of skills that \nwill help students support themselves and their families in the future, \nthat will empower our current workforce to pursue higher-paying jobs \nand those without a job to become selfsustaining. I sincerely hope my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle reconsider their plans to \ncontinue to push this effort. There are a number of bills this Senate \ncan consider that would promote job creation over an arbitrary increase \nin the Federal minimum wage. Our focus should be on small businesses \nand creating a business environment that is friendly for growth, builds \nand gives people jobs that pay more than the minimum wage. Higher \nprices, higher taxes, and fewer jobs is not what Wyoming and the rest \nof the country needs in these fragile times.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Madam President, I say to my colleague from Wyoming that \nI disagree with him on this issue, but I do agree wholeheartedly with \nhis observation about the importance of training people for this 21st \ncentury economy, and I have enjoyed working with him so much on the \nHELP Committee.\n  I am on the floor today to talk about the minimum wage bill that is \nbefore us this week, and once again to have the opportunity to come \nhere and say that Washington, DC, is absolutely decoupled with the \nconversations people are having in Colorado, whether they are \nRepublicans, Democrats or Independents. We had another example of that \nhere today during this debate--if you can call it a debate--because \nonce again there are people in the Senate who are using their \nprerogatives as Senators to keep us from debating a bill fully and to \nkeep us from actually having an up-or-down vote on a bill that the vast \nmajority of Americans support whether they are Democrats, Republicans, \nor Independents.\n  There is a reason why America supports this legislation. If you work \n40 hours a week in the United States of America--the greatest country \nin the world--at a Federal minimum wage, you barely make over $15,000 a \nyear. If you work 40 hours a week--week after week after week--you make \n$15,000 a year. A worker in this country with a spouse and two kids, a \nfamily of four--a typical family in this country--depending on the \nsingle minimum wage paycheck is in deep trouble. They are not just \nbelow the minimum wage, that family makes two-thirds of the poverty \nlevel.\n  A breadwinner in a family of four working at the minimum wage is more \nthan $8,000 below the poverty line. That family with a full-time \nbreadwinner is impoverished in the United States of America to the tune \nof $8,000. If you have a family who depends on you to keep a roof over \ntheir heads and put food on the table, that is not enough to get by. It \nis not even close.\n  It may be hard for people here who are paid $174,000 a year to \nunderstand what it would be like to live on $15,000, but let's think a \nlittle bit about what that family's life is like. The U.S. Department \nof Agriculture says that even under the cheapest plan possible--the \nthriftiest plan possible--where the family cuts every single corner, \nspending as little as can be spent, it costs over $7,000 a year to feed \na family of four with growing kids. It costs $7,000 under the most \ndifficult circumstances possible. At least half of that family's \n$15,000 paycheck goes just to groceries--just to feeding a family and \nkeeping them nourished. After payroll taxes, that leaves a family with \nless than $7,000 to cover every other cost--that is it. Food is half of \nwhat you bring home and you are left with $7,000.\n  In Denver, where my family lives, the average rental unit costs over \n$12,000 a year. That is an average. That includes tiny studio \napartments. In Denver, this family of four would have to squeeze into a \nrental unit well under half that cost. They would need to live in a \nspace woefully inadequate for their needs, their family, and their \nchildren. That family would have to stretch their pocket change--and \nwhatever is left after they spend the money they barely have to feed \nand house their children--to cover utilities, medicine, health, \nclothes, transportation, school supplies, and the countless other \nexpenses that life throws at us. It cannot be done. It is simple \narithmetic.\n  A family such as the one I just described needs thousands of \nadditional dollars from the Federal and local government just to get \nby. We don't want to have a minimum wage that is so low that people who \nare working 40 hours a week have to be on public assistance just to \nsupport their families. Think about how crazy that is. Someone working \nfull time, 40 hours a week in a minimum wage job today, needs thousands \nof dollars in support from the Government to provide for their family. \nThat is not what we want in America.\n  The situation is a lot worse than it used to be because the minimum \nwage is not indexed to inflation. So as costs rise, the minimum wage \nloses its purchasing power and stays the same until Congress raises it, \nwhich is why we are trying to have this debate here. There is no one \nelse who can do this in America. Democratic and Republican Congresses \nthat have dealt with this over the years have found ways to do it. \nCongress has raised the minimum wage over and over for precisely that \nreason.\n  Even so, today, as we stand on this floor with the responsibility to \nthe American people, our minimum wage is down substantially from where \nit used to be. The Federal minimum wage stands at $7.25 an hour. That \nis $3.44 an hour and more than $7,000 a year below what it was in 1968 \nin real inflation-adjusted dollars. It is a $7,000 gap, which makes a \nhuge difference to the family of four we just considered trying to \nsurvive on the minimum wage.\n  In 1968, a minimum wage job kept a family of three out of poverty. \nThat is what the Congress did in 1968. They said if you work 40 hours a \nweek, your family ought to live above the poverty line. A full-time \nworker with two children was 20 percent above the poverty line. Today \nthat same family is 19 percent below the poverty line all because the \nminimum wage has not kept pace with inflation. It also has not kept \npace with average earnings.\n\n  In 1968, the minimum wage was 54 percent of the average hourly pay \nfor a U.S. worker; today it is just 36 percent. At the same time, even \nwhen you account for inflation, college costs are three times what they \nwere four decades ago. It is no wonder that the working families I hear \nfrom in Colorado feel they are working harder than ever before but \nfalling farther behind.\n  The bill we are talking about today raises the Federal minimum wage \nby 39 percent to $10.10 an hour. That is actually less than the 47-\npercent increase that is required to get back to the 1968 level. So we \nare still not going to be back where we were in 1968, but we will make \nprogress in the sense that the people who are earning minimum wage will \nno longer be living in poverty.\n  Consider what this bill does for a family's ability to provide for \nitself. Look at just one major Federal safety net program, the \nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP. Food stamps is what \nthat is. The reason the House of Representatives held up the farm bill \nfor so long was over the issue of food stamps. As we think about what \nwe are doing here and the debate we are having, I think that is \nimportant to keep in context. This is a program that millions of low-\nincome families depend on in order to eat.\n\n[[Page S2543]]\n\n  This minimum wage bill would reduce SNAP enrollments by over 7\\1/2\\ \npercent because people would now be making a living wage. That is over \n3.1 million Americans who would no longer have to depend on a program \nto feed their kids. If you vote for this legislation, you are voting to \nreduce the roles of those who depend on food stamps by 3 million \nAmericans. It is not a virtue that we have those 3 million Americans on \nfood stamps. They ought to be earning a living wage. We would save $46 \nbillion in SNAP payments over the next decade if we pass this bill.\n  It applies to other programs as well. Two-thirds of Americans who \nearn under $10 an hour use public assistance in some form--two-thirds, \ntwo-thirds, two-thirds. Working families--Americans who actually have a \njob who are working 40 hours a week--cost the Government about $243 \nmillion a year through programs such as SNAP, Medicaid, and other \nsafety-net programs. Raising the minimum wage makes American workers \nless dependent on these programs to support their families.\n  There are many compelling reasons to raise the minimum wage. There is \na compelling reason why all the surveys show that the American people, \nno matter what party they are in, think we ought to raise the minimum \nwage. Yet in a few hours, if nothing changes, a minority of Senators \nwill most likely not even come to the floor to vote on this but will \nuse their powers in the Senate to block an honest up-or-down vote about \nwhether we ought to raise the minimum wage in this country. They don't \neven want us to have a proper debate on this bill much less pass it.\n  What is so radical about what we are trying to do that they won't \neven let us have an up or down vote? Is this somehow unprecedented? Is \nwhat we are talking about unknown in the annals of the Senate? \nActually, it is not. Since the minimum wage was enacted by the Congress \nin the 1930s, we have managed to raise the minimum wage on 10 different \noccasions over 70 years. We have raised the minimum wage very routinely \nto try--not always successfully--to keep pace with inflation. We have \ndone it many times.\n  Democratic and Republican Congresses have raised the minimum wage. \nDemocratic Presidents have signed minimum wage increases into law and \nRepublican Presidents have signed minimum wage increases into law. \nPresident Eisenhower signed a 33-percent increase in the minimum wage \nin 1955. President Nixon signed a 44-percent minimum wage increase into \nlaw in 1974. George H. W. Bush signed a 27-percent minimum wage \nincrease into law in 1989. In 1996, a Republican-controlled Congress \nenacted a 21-percent minimum wage increase which President Clinton \nsigned into law. Most recently in 2007, President George W. Bush signed \na 41-percent increase into law.\n  You can see on this chart all the different times the minimum wage \nhas been raised and by how much. If you look at the 10 different times \nwe have increased the minimum wage, the average increase has been about \n41 percent. This increase increases it by 39 percent, and that is below \naverage. But to hear some people talk, you would think this bill is an \nunprecedented assault on American capitalism.\n  Tom Delay described the minimum wage earlier this year as \nunconstitutional. Others have said it doesn't affect a lot of workers. \nSeveral years ago the Speaker--before he was Speaker--said he would \n``commit suicide before [he voted] on a clean minimum-wage bill.'' This \nmakes no sense. It is at war with our history.\n  I see my colleagues are here.\n  I ask and beg my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who are \nnot allowing us to have an up-or-down vote on something that the \nAmerican people want--whether they are Democrats, Republicans or \nIndependents--to allow us to have that vote.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I believe our side has 38 seconds left, \nand I ask unanimous consent for an additional 60 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  What was the request?\n  Mr. VITTER. For an additional 60 seconds to the 38 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Health Care Amendment\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I come to the floor to address what I \nconsider to be a very important issue which we have never voted on, and \nthat is the basic principle that Washington should be treated as all \nother Americans with regard to whatever law we pass, including \nObamaCare. Specifically, my ``no-Washington-exemptions'' proposal \nregarding ObamaCare has yet to get a vote, so I will be filing that \nproposal as an amendment to the Portman-Shaheen bill.\n  As we can remember, late last year it was filed as an amendment to \nthat bill when it was on the floor. There was general agreement at that \ntime, after some back and forth, that it should and would get a vote. \nIt was reported in The Hill on September 17 that Senator Reid agreed to \na vote on the amendment in the context of that bill. Senator Portman \nagreed to this concept at the same time--September 18--on the Senate \nfloor, and Senator Shaheen did as well on September 18. So I am \nrefiling as an amendment to the same bill.\n  I look forward to this important debate. I look forward to a vote. \nObviously, if an alternative in the near future, such as a stand-alone \nvote, is presented, I will be happy to accept that as well. I look \nforward to coming back to the floor to debate this important issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. VITTER. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, we believe that every American who \nworks 40 hours a week deserves a fair shot at getting out of poverty. \nUnder the present minimum-wage law, that doesn't happen. A person can \nwork hard, with pride, as Americans do, and work that 40 hours and \nstill be below the poverty line. That is basically not part of what \nAmerica is all about, because America says to everybody, If you work \nhard, you can provide a decent life for yourself and your family. Since \nthe minimum wage has stagnated, that doesn't happen.\n  Since 1968, the minimum wage has failed to keep up with inflation and \nhas lost a third of its value. That is not a fair shot for Americans. A \nfull-time minimum-wage worker makes only about $15,000 a year--not a \nfair shot for Americans. It is wrong. It flies in the face of the \nAmerican dream.\n  Each Senator is allowed one guest at the State of the Union Address. \nI brought a young woman named Shareeka Elliott. Let me tell my \ncolleagues about her. Shareeka is a cleaner at Kennedy Airport. She \nscrubs toilets and floors from 10 at night until 6 in the morning. \nAfter the overnight shift, she hops on multiple buses each day to take \nher two daughters to school. They are in different parts of the borough \nof Brooklyn. Only then is she able to get home and take care of her \nhousehold. For her hard work, Shareeka is paid $8 an hour--not enough.\n  When we talk to Shareeka, we find she is a beautiful woman. She is \nnot angry. But do my colleagues know what raising the minimum wage to \n$10.10 would do for her? Eighty dollars a week. It would allow her to \nprovide her children with the barest of necessities--when kids can't \nget clothes and can't get a decent meal when they are not in school; \nwhen they can't get any toys for Christmas. That is not America.\n  This woman isn't a freeloader. She is getting on the bus, traveling 2 \nhours to Kennedy Airport, working many 8 hours from 10 at night until 6 \nin the morning, getting back on the bus, and then finding two more \nbuses to take care of her children, and she can't make enough money to \nget out of poverty. What kind of country is this? It is hard to \nbelieve, on both the economics issue and the moral issue, that we have \nopposition from the other side of the aisle to even let this come to a \ndebate.\n  We know what raising the minimum wage will do for the millions of \nShareekas: It gives them a life with some degree of dignity. It gives \ntheir children a little more--not a lot--for\n\n[[Page S2544]]\n\nbasic necessities. It pumps money into the economy. I bet most \nAmericans would say that even if it costs me a little more--a nickel \nmore on my hamburger to give people such as Shareeka a decent living--\nmost Americans are generous people and they would say that is fair.\n  Here are our colleagues. They are back in the 19th century, saying we \nshouldn't do this. It is hard to believe, when we think of the 1890s \nand the 1930s, how people struggled to get a decent life, and they \ndidn't think of the beauty of the 1940s and 1950s and 1960s and 1970s \nand 1980s when people knew if they worked hard, they could at least \nachieve a decent life. That American dream, symbolized by the lady who \nholds the statue in the harbor of the city I represent, is flickering \nout. We have a chance now to have it at least lit up a little more. We \nsay no? What is going on in America?\n  Our colleagues are saying the economy isn't growing as fast as it \nshould. Yet they don't want to pump money into the economy. Our bill is \na win/win. Seventy-three percent of all Americans, including a majority \nof Republicans, support a $10.10 minimum wage. Tim Pawlenty, former \nGovernor of Minnesota, told his colleagues to support the wage \nincrease. When we have a few small interest groups holding this back, \nit is a shame.\n  I urge my Republican colleagues to look at our economy and then look \ninto their hearts, and I am confident that if they did, they would have \na change of heart and let us pass this bill.\n  I will say one final thing. If we don't succeed this time--we believe \nstrongly in a fair shot for everybody, including those who are paid \nminimum wage and work hard and long--we will bring this bill to the \nfloor again and again and again, and just as with unemployment \ninsurance, sooner or later we will get it done. We will get it done. \nThe American dream, a fair shot for everyone, demands no less.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I wish to express my strong support for \nincreasing the minimum wage. It is outrageous that this Congress will \nnot help middle-class workers.\n  This Congress needs to do two things to make sure we give a fair shot \nto everyone and build a stronger middle class: Raise the minimum wage \nand pass the Paycheck Fairness Act.\n  I am on the side of economic fairness and building a stronger middle \nclass to bring opportunities to families across the Nation. What is \neconomic fairness? It means that if you work hard and play by the \nrules, you deserve a fair shot at the American dream.\n  The minimum wage is at a historic all-time low. It has lost 30 \npercent of its buying power compared to its peak buying power in 1968. \nThe minimum wage only pays $15,000 a year. That is $4,000 below the \npoverty line for a family of three. Increasing the minimum wage to \n$10.10 per hour would pay $20,200 a year--lifting that family of three \nout of poverty.\n  What does increasing the minimum wage mean for Maryland? Increasing \nthe minimum wage will give 450,000 workers in Maryland a raise. \nIncreasing the minimum wage will improve the lives of 210,000 Maryland \nchildren because their parent just got a raise. When we raise the \nminimum wage, we all move a rung up on the opportunity ladder.\n  Congress needs to raise the minimum wage so that hard work is worth \nit--because a full-time job shouldn't mean full-time poverty!\n  That is why I am an enthusiastic cosponsor of the Fair Minimum Wage \nAct. This bill raises minimum wage from $7.25 per hour to $10.10 an \nhour over 3 years and indexes minimum wage to inflation in the future.\n  Minimum wage is a women's issue. Women make up two-thirds of minimum \nwage workers nationwide. Congress needs to raise their wages and make \nsure they are not being redlined or sidelined by outdated policies or \nharassed and intimidated when seeking justice for pay discrimination.\n  Being a woman costs more, and women pay more for everything. Women \npay more in medical costs than men--an estimated $10,000 over a \nlifetime. Women are often responsible for childcare. Women even get \ncharged more for dry cleaning! We are charged more for our blouses than \nmen's shirts, and we are tired of being taken to the cleaners! When we \nearn less, we are asked to pay more.\n  Women are almost half of the workforce and 40 percent of them are the \nsole breadwinners in their families--they are tired of being paid \ncrumbs!\n  Women continue to make less. Women are still making only 77 cents for \nevery dollar a man makes. Women of color suffer even greater injustice. \nIf you are African American, you earn 62 cents for every dollar a man \nmakes. If you are Hispanic, you earn 54 cents for every dollar a man \nmakes.\n  Everybody likes to say to us--``Oh, you've come a long way.'' But I \ndon't think we've come a long way. We've only gained 18 cents in 50 \nyears!\n  By the time she retires, the average woman will lose more than \n$431,000 over her lifetime because of the wage gap. That affects your \nSocial Security and pension. It weakens your retirement security.\n  Not only do women make up two-thirds of minimum wage workers, women \nare nearly three-quarters of workers earning tips at their jobs. The \nminimum wage for employees who earn tips is barely over $2 per hour. \nThe Fair Minimum Wage Act will slowly increase that base wage by less \nthan $1 a year until it reaches 70 percent of the regular minimum wage. \nIncreasing this wage will make a huge difference for women breadwinners \nwho have so much to fear from a slow week in an off-peak season.\n  But this is not about men vs. women. It's about building a middle \nclass. Wages have been flat for everyone. Men need a pay raise too. \nWhen they get it, we'll stand shoulder to shoulder with them--because \nwe all need a raise to raise our families!\n  The Fair Minimum Wage Act is about putting change in the lawbooks and \nchange in family checkbooks. I'm glad that Maryland is leading the way \nby passing legislation to raise the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour by \n2018. I will keep fighting to raise the wage nationwide, and I hope \nCongress will follow Maryland's good example.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we should raise the minimum wage.\n  It is indisputable that the minimum wage now lags far behind the cost \nof living. We last acted to raise the minimum wage in 2009, when we set \nthe current rate of $7.25 an hour. Adjusted for inflation, that is just \n$6.62 in current dollars. And it is far lower than the rate in 1980, \nwhich was nearly $9 an hour when adjusted for inflation.\n  The CBO estimates that nearly 1 million Americans would rise from \npoverty under this legislation. And earlier this year, economists who \nsurveyed the empirical research on this subject estimated that the \nimpact would be far greater: roughly 4.6 million people immediately \nlifted above the poverty line, and 6.8 million over time.\n  And it is indisputable that failure to raise the minimum wage--among \nthe lowest in the developed world--has contributed to growing income \ninequality. Here is what The Economist, a generally conservative \npublication, said in December:\n\n       Skepticism about the merits of minimum wages remains this \n     newspaper's starting-point. But as income inequality widens \n     and workers' share of national income shrinks, the case for \n     action to help the low-paid grows.\n\n  The Economist and others recognize that we should consider this issue \nin the context of a large issue: Increasingly, working hard is not the \npath it used to be to get ahead in this country. Increasingly, income \ngoes not to working families, but to investors, to the owners of \ncapital. The share of our national income that flows to those who work \nfor a living has, by every measure, fallen. That is enormously \ntroubling. This is a Nation built on the idea that hard work is the \npath to success, the path to a better future for our families. That \nbreakdown of the relationship between one's labor and one's prosperity \nthreatens to fracture the understandings that have fed our growth and \nsuccess for more than two centuries.\n  None of the statements I have made so far are particularly \ncontroversial; they represent mainstream economic thinking. Republicans \nso far have one response to these facts: They say raising the minimum \nwage will destroy jobs. They cite this as an unassailable fact. But \nthis position is disproved by history, and refuted by economists. When \nthe University of Chicago surveyed leading economists last year,\n\n[[Page S2545]]\n\nthey said by a four-to-one margin that the benefits of a minimum wage \nincrease outweighed the potential costs.\n  Republicans have opposed minimum wage increases at any time, under \nany economic circumstances. Republicans are wedded to a policy of tax \ncuts for the wealthy, reduced protections for workers and consumers and \nreduced protection for the environment as the answer to any and all \neconomic problems. Corporate profits are at an all-time high, as are \nincome and wealth for the most fortunate Americans. But for average \nworking families, the last 30 years have been an exercise in running to \nstand still, or even losing ground.\n  We can and must raise the minimum wage. Empirical evidence supports \nit, and fairness demands it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 8 minutes remaining on the Democratic \nside.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, in a few moments we are going to vote \nhere in the Senate on whether we are going to bring the minimum-wage \nbill to the floor for debate and a vote. In a few minutes, it will be \nclear where each Senator stands. Who in this Chamber is going to stand \nwith millions of Americans who work full time for a living but who are \nleft in poverty or on the brink of poverty, struggling to make ends \nmeet? Who is going to vote to give these good people a fair shot at the \nAmerican dream, and who is going to vote against them? We are going to \nfind out in a few minutes.\n  There is no question that working families need a raise. Fourteen \nmillion children in America--that is one in every five--are in a family \nthat would get a raise under our minimum-wage bill.\n  Businesses need a raise. Over 600 economists--7 Nobel Prize-winning \neconomists--have said the lack of demand is what is hurting businesses \nin America, because people don't have enough money to go into their \nstores on Main Street and buy what they need. Businesses need \ncustomers. If we raise the minimum wage, the people who are getting the \nraise aren't going to go to Paris, France, and spend that money. They \nwill spend it on Main Street. That is what our businesses need.\n  Our economy needs a raise, because when businesses do better, they \nhire more workers, they add jobs, and it generates more economic \ngrowth.\n  People in poverty definitely need a raise. This bill, our minimum-\nwage bill, will lift an estimated 7 million people out of poverty. All \nworking families need a raise.\n  Some of my friends on the Republican side say not all of this goes to \npeople who are in poverty. That is absolutely true, because 12 million \npeople who have family incomes between $20,000 and $60,000 a year will \nalso get a raise. What is wrong with that? These hard-working families \nneed to be able to put some money aside for a rainy day, provide for \ntheir kids' education, maybe buy a new car, buy a new home, upgrade. \nWhat is wrong with that? So, yes, this helps a lot of American families \nget a fair shot at the American dream.\n  I might add, taxpayers need a raise in the minimum wage. Right now, \nwe are spending about one-third of $1 trillion--$243 billion a year--on \nsocial programs to help families who are struggling to make ends meet, \nwho are low income or who are in poverty. It has been estimated that \nthe minimum-wage bill will save $4.6 billion a year in money we won't \nhave to pay for food stamps--$46 billion over 10 years taxpayers will \nsave when we increase the minimum wage, because people will have the \nmoney. They will be able to go out and buy their own food and they \nwon't need food stamps.\n  Again, any way we look at it, we need to raise the minimum wage.\n  I wish to pick up where Senator Schumer left off. This is about real \npeople. This is not abstract.\n  This is Alicia McCrary of Northwood, IA, a wonderful woman who came \nto testify before our committee. She has four boys. She moved to \nNorthwood from another State. She was in a very abusive relationship. \nShe wanted to get her kids to a safe place, so she moved there with her \nfour boys. She testified. She works at a fast-food restaurant. She \nmakes $7.65 an hour. She has four boys, as I said. She is an amazing \nwoman, working very hard. She rides a bus 20 miles each day, every day, \nto get to work. She wants to work full time, but the bus, which costs \nher $10 a day, by the way, only runs until 3 p.m., so she has to leave \nby then. Her wages are so low that every day she has to tell her \nchildren they can't have things their friends have. They can't play a \ncertain sport. They can't all get a haircut at the same time. They \ncan't even buy shoes at the same time, because she can't afford it.\n  Alicia does not want to be on public assistance, but she has to be. \nShe is participating in a program run by the North Iowa Community \nAction Agency to help her achieve self-sufficiency and get off the \nsystem because she wants to support herself through her own work. Here \nare her own words:\n\n       If the minimum wage is increased, it would be very helpful \n     to my family. . . . I would see more reductions in TANF--\n\n  That is her public assistance and food assistance--\n\n     and would see another increase in my rent, but that would be \n     OK. I will have more money overall and it would come from my \n     own hard work and my family will be better off. I want to \n     work and stand on my own two feet. . . . I work very hard \n     doing my job and I believe I am worth $10.10 an hour. . . . \n     If you can move forward with increasing the minimum wage, my \n     family will be more successful in reaching our goal of a \n     better life.\n\n  This is the real people who will be helped by increasing the minimum \nwage.\n  I have listened to a lot of the debate on the floor and I have heard \nthe objections from my friends on the Republican side. I have heard a \nlot of talk about the Keystone Pipeline and the high-paying jobs it \nwould create. I don't doubt that it probably would. But unless Alicia \nis ready to pick up and move her four kids to Texas and become a \npetroleum engineer, it is not going to help her one bit. I haven't \nheard one offer from the other side that will be a single solution that \nwould help Alicia's life be better. So the Keystone Pipeline isn't \ngoing to help Alicia, a fast-food worker who works hard every day. It \nis not going to put food on her table or help her boys get a haircut or \nget a pair of shoes or buy a computer so they can do their homework. A \nminimum-wage increase will do that. A minimum-wage increase will give \nAlicia a raise.\n  The American people are desperately calling for us to pass this bill. \nThe time has come. In fact, it is past time to do the right thing, the \nmorally correct thing, to raise the minimum wage. The time has come to \ngive realistic hope--realistic hope, not false hope--to people such as \nAlicia McCrary and so many people in our country who work hard every \nday--millions of working Americans--to give them a realistic hope that \nour economic system is not going to continue to leave them further and \nfurther behind. It is time to say yes to giving a fair shot to the \nAmerican dream, to being a part of the middle class, to Alicia McCrary \nand millions of hard-working but low-paid Americans. The time has come \nto raise the minimum wage.\n  Madam President, I yield back any remaining time.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n       225th Anniversary of George Washington's Inaugural Address\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today marks the 225th anniversary of \nGeorge Washington's inaugural address to the Nation. I don't think \nanyone has said anything about it. That is a major thing for us to \nthink about each year. It is the 225th anniversary.\n  It is reported that more than 10,000 people--this is way back 225 \nyears ago--gathered on this day in 1789 to hear from a man who won a \nwar and who is now ushering in an era of peace and freedom in our new \nNation.\n  Peter Lillback is a historian, and he pointed out in his book, which \nI read recently, that our first President, Washington, knew that \neverything he was to say in the first inaugural address would set a \nprecedent for all that was to come after him in establishing our \nNation. It is why Americans should take note at how Washington weaved \nin with intentionality his belief in the Omnipotent.\n  Washington said:\n\n       It would be peculiarly improper to omit in this first \n     official Act, my fervent supplications to that Almighty Being \n     who rules over the Universe.\n\n  Washington went on to say:\n\n       No people can be bound to acknowledge and adore the \n     invisible hand, which conducts the Affairs of men more than \n     the People of the United States. Every step, by which they \n     have advanced to the character of an independent nation, \n     seems to have been distinguished by some token of \n     providential agency.\n\n  We are here because of the hand of God. Washington's leadership was \ngrounded in his belief in God, His law, and that liberty is God's gift. \nAs we reflect on the anniversary of Washington's speech it is important \nwe are reminded as a nation what our Founding Fathers sought to \nestablish.\n  In this same inaugural speech Washington said:\n\n       The destiny of the Republic model of Government, are justly \n     considered as deeply, perhaps as finally staked, on the \n     experiment entrusted to the hands of the American people.\n\n  Washington's conviction was that we as Americans are entrusted by God \nto preserve basic freedoms established in the Constitution, such as the \nfreedom of speech and the freedom of religion. The secular culture we \nsee our Nation embracing today would seek to censor such words from a \nleader such as Washington. Their intolerance fails to acknowledge it \nwas Washington's convictions and our Founding Fathers' faith values \nthat gave us the public square.\n  On September 27 last year, I talked about this issue on the Senate \nfloor--about how Oklahomans regularly ask me--and I don't think this is \nunique to Oklahoma; it can be true in any State--why we have an \nadministration that suppresses our Judeo-Christian values while \npraising Islam. As I said then, I find it sad that our Nation does not \nhave the same belief today that we had back when Washington was \nPresident. We have become arrogant, inward-focused individuals. Rather \nthan submitting to God's authority, we define truth, justice, and \nmorality by what feels good at the time.\n  Today, instead of having leaders who protect the church from \ngovernment, we have leaders who believe it is the government's job to \nimpose on churches what should be universally upheld as truth. As \nleaders, we should be protecting all Americans' freedom to practice \ntheir religion.\n  It is only appropriate that on this anniversary we also consider the \nwords of Washington's Farewell Address in 1796 where he pointed out \nthat the pillars supporting our Republic are morality and religion. In \nhis address he said:\n\n       Let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality \n     can be maintained without religion. Whatever may be conceded \n     to the influence of refined education on minds of particular \n     structure, reason and experience both forbid us to expect \n     that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious \n     principle.\n\n  We have to restore the morality of our Nation given to us by the \nFounding Fathers, as President Washington articulated 225 years ago. \nThat morality is found in the Judeo-Christian values articulated not \njust by Washington but by all of our Founding Fathers.\n  As my son likes to say: Without God, the Constitution is nothing but \na piece of paper.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, it has been 7 years since Congress \nincreased the minimum wage, 7 years since Congress stood up for our \nworking families, 7 years since Congress gave America a raise.\n  Earlier today the Senate had a chance to do something about that when \nwe voted on whether to increase the minimum wage. Earlier today we had \na chance to give a raise to the parents of at least 14 million \nchildren, a chance to lift nearly 1 million full-time workers out of \npoverty. A majority of Senators tried to do that today. Fifty-five \nSenators supported raising the minimum wage, but Republicans \nfilibustered the bill, so it didn't pass. This is outrageous.\n  For nearly half a century, as we came out of the Great Depression, \nthe people of this country lived by the basic principle that we all do \nbetter when we work together and build opportunities for everyone. For \nnearly\n\n[[Page S2547]]\n\nhalf a century, as our country got richer, our people got richer, and \nas our people got richer, our country got richer. The basic idea was \nthat as the pie gets bigger, we all get a little more--even those who \nonly make the minimum wage.\n  I know this story because it is my story. Like a lot of folks, I grew \nup in a family who had ups and downs. When I was 12, my daddy had a \nheart attack and was out of work for a long time. The bills piled up. \nWe lost our car, and we were right on the edge of losing our home. My \nmom was 50 years old when she pulled on her best dress and walked to \nthe Sears to get a job. It paid minimum wage, but back then a minimum \nwage job was enough to keep a family of three above water, and that is \nhow it was for us. That is one of the ways our country built and \nprotected America's great middle class. But that is not how it works \nanymore.\n  In 1968 the minimum wage was high enough to keep a working parent \nwith a family of three out of poverty. In 1980 the minimum wage was at \nleast high enough to keep a working parent with a family of two out of \npoverty. Today the minimum wage is not even enough to keep a fully \nemployed mother and a baby out of poverty.\n  Something is fundamentally wrong when millions of Americans can work \nfull time and still live in poverty, and something is fundamentally \nwrong when big companies can get away with paying poverty-level wages \nand then stick taxpayers with the cost when their full-time workers end \nup on food stamps and Medicaid.\n  I understand that some big businesses might like to keep things the \nway they are, but I really don't understand this Republican filibuster. \nThere is nothing conservative about leaving millions of working people \nin poverty. There is nothing conservative about expanding enrollment in \ngovernment-assistance programs. There is nothing conservative about \npreserving a sweetheart deal for companies that would rather milk the \ntaxpayers for more corporate welfare than compete on a level playing \nfield.\n  I am disappointed about what happened today, but I am also hopeful. A \nmajority of the Senate--Democrats in the Senate--voted to honor work, \nto honor the people who get up every day and bust their tails to try to \nbuild a better life for themselves and their children. This is an \nuphill fight, but it is not over yet. It took us 4 months and many \nRepublican filibusters before we finally convinced a handful of our \nRepublican colleagues to support an extension of emergency unemployment \nbenefits, but we passed that bill in the Senate, and we will pass this \nbill too, because after 7 years, with millions of our working families \nstruggling to get by, with millions of children depending on a mom or \ndad who works long hours for low pay, it is long past time to increase \nthe minimum wage.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. KING. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Levy Nomination\n\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, I rise today to take a few moments to talk \nabout Jon David Levy, who is a nominee for the Federal district court \nin Maine who will be voted on this afternoon. Senator Collins and I \nhave come to the floor together to talk about this nominee and his \nextraordinary qualifications for this position.\n  My history with Jon Levy is kind of interesting. He was one of my \nvery first appointments to the bench when I was Governor of Maine in \n1995. The important thing I wish to get across is I didn't know him. He \nwasn't a contributor, a supporter or a political ally in any way, shape \nor form. At that time he was a really smart lawyer with a judicial \ndemeanor. He was recommended to me--he was discovered, if you will--by \na nonpartisan judicial selection committee. I interviewed him, met him, \nliked him, and appointed him to the Maine District Court, which is our \nlower court of general jurisdiction, where it is really the people's \ncourt. He excelled in that court in terms of his decisionmaking skills \nas well as in his demeanor and his ability to interpret and apply the \nlaw in very real and practical circumstances.\n  He was so good, as a matter of fact, that as I was leaving the \ngovernorship in the last year or so, I had the opportunity to appoint \nhim to Maine's Supreme Court. In fact, I believe he is the only person \nto have gone directly from our district court to the supreme court in \nour State without stopping in the middle at our superior court, the \ncourt of general jurisdiction, because he was so outstanding. He has \nproven himself as an appellate judge to be exactly what we all hoped \nand expected would be the case: thoughtful, deliberative, very much \nsensitive to the real needs of the people who are appearing before the \ncourt. He has never forgotten that the law is about serving the public.\n  So I think he is uniquely qualified--perhaps not uniquely but \nespecially well qualified--for this position because he has been a \ntrial-level judge and an appellate judge, and now he is being \nconsidered for a Federal trial-level court where I think he will be an \noutstanding judge. I don't think he will be; I know he will be.\n  The other thing I think is so important--and it happened that just a \nfew years ago I was in our supreme judicial courtroom watching a \nceremony where young lawyers were being admitted to the bar. It is a \nceremony that happens every year. Of course, to the judges, it is \nfairly routine. To the young lawyers, it is the biggest deal in their \nlives thus far. It happened that the day I was there to move the \nadmission of a young friend of mine, Justice Levy was presiding. It was \nan opportunity for me to watch him interact with the members of the bar \nand the public. Of course, a lot of members of the public are in the \ncourtroom on that day. His whole demeanor was so thoughtful, dignified, \nand yet warm and not intimidating.\n  Having practiced law myself, my least favorite judges were those who \ntried to intimidate members of the bar. I remember vividly at one point \nbeing in a trial and making an argument to a judge in Maine that wasn't \nreally going very far, and I said: Judge, I really feel as though I am \nbatting my head against a brick wall here. After a slight pause the \njudge said: Mr. King, I know of no one in Maine better equipped for \nthat venture. I wasn't all that thrilled by that response, although he \nwas probably right.\n  Justice Levy has a wonderful demeanor. He has that wonderful \ncombination of high intelligence and yet at the same time a warm and \nthoughtful demeanor that is not intimidating but allows the litigants, \nthe lawyers, and the witnesses to get their stories out, to get the \nrecord complete so that he or the jury can make the best decision.\n  I think he is a judge's judge. In fact, in seeking comments about his \nappointment to this position, I think one of the most telling comments \ncame from the chief justice of our supreme court where he has been now \nfor some 10 years, and her comment was, ``You tell Angus I am going to \nget him for this,'' which meant she doesn't want to lose him. I think \nthat is pretty high praise--that he has been such a valuable member of \nthat court that his colleagues thought that highly of him.\n  Jon Levy is, as I say, a judge's judge, really a model of what we \nshould want on our Federal bench. I am delighted that he went through \nthe cloture process yesterday. Thanks, in part, to my senior colleague, \nhe received more than 60 votes. In other words, he enjoys a significant \namount of bipartisan support. He was reported out of the Judiciary \nCommittee on a strong bipartisan basis.\n  I am just delighted to be able to rise today and urge my colleagues \nto support this really extraordinary gentleman who will grace the \nFederal bench in Maine and will, I believe, make us all proud for \nhaving supported such an outstanding jurist who has yet many years of \nservice to his State and his country. I believe this is a great \nappointment by the President, and I look forward to Jon Levy's \nperformance on the bench.\n  With that, I yield the floor for my esteemed senior colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I am very pleased to join my colleague \nfrom Maine, Senator King, in supporting the nomination of Justice Jon\n\n[[Page S2548]]\n\nLevy to the U.S. District Court for the State of Maine.\n  As Senator King has pointed out, Justice Levy has had a long career \nas an attorney and as a judge in our great State. His experience makes \nhim well qualified for Maine's Federal district court. He was appointed \nto the bench by my colleague, Senator King, when he was Governor, and \nJustice Levy currently serves as an associate justice on the Maine \nSupreme Judicial Court, a position he has held for more than a decade.\n  Justice Levy's legal skills have been evident for many years. After \nhis graduation from law school where he was an editor of the law \nreview, he clerked in the Southern District of West Virginia. Later, he \nwas appointed to the position of special monitor in the U.S. district \ncourt for southern Texas.\n  In 1982, Jon and his wife had the good sense to relocate to Maine, \nand Jon entered private practice in York. Although his practice spanned \na range of civil and criminal matters, he quickly distinguished himself \nin the area of family law. Jon literally wrote the book on family law. \nHe is the author of ``Maine Family Law,'' which is a key resource on \nthe subject for Maine's attorneys.\n  As both an attorney and a judge, Jon has remained very active with \nthe local bar association and several State committees, working to \nimprove the administration of justice in Maine. He has served as \npresident of the York County Bar Association and received its \nOutstanding Member Award in 2006. He was also honored with the Maine \nState Bar Association's Family Law Achievement Award in 2001.\n  Justice Levy has been an advocate for advancing access to civil \njustice in Maine. He has championed initiatives to improve pro bono \nrepresentation for Maine's elderly and low-income people and affordable \nrepresentation for other Mainers in need of legal assistance. In the \nsame vein, he helped to launch the Katahdin Counsel Recognition \nProgram, an annual statewide program that honors Maine attorneys who \nprovide more than 50 hours of pro bono service per year.\n  Justice Levy has also advocated for these efforts nationally, and \nrecently joined the American Bar Association's Standing Committee on \nLegal Aid and Indigent Defendants. He has worked with Maine's Juvenile \nDrug Treatment Court in Maine's York County, which has seen numerous \nsuccesses over the years.\n  This combination of experiences that Justice Levy brings to the \ncourt--his experience as a private attorney I think is so important; \nhis experience as a State judge is so critical, as is his experience in \nfamily law, in pro bono representation--makes him a well-rounded \nindividual to serve on our courts. Many times our judges are chosen \njust from the ranks of either academia or because they have previously \nserved on the bench.\n  Judge Levy brings both private sector and judicial experience to this \nimportant post. I believe he will serve the people of Maine and the \nNation with distinction, intelligence, and integrity. So I urge my \ncolleagues to support this nomination when we vote later today.\n  Again, I commend my colleague from Maine for having the good sense to \nstart Justice Levy on this path which, I believe later today, will lead \nto his confirmation as a Federal judge.\n  Thank you, Madam President. Seeing no one seeking recognition, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I wish to comment on the vote we took \nearlier today on whether to proceed to a bill that would increase the \nminimum wage to $10.10 an hour.\n  It has been several years since we increased the minimum wage, and I \nsupport an increase in the minimum wage. But I do not believe at a time \nwhen our economy is so fragile, as is indicated by the very slow \nincrease in GDP that was reported this morning, we can afford to \nincrease the minimum wage by some 39 percent.\n  I would note that just a year ago President Obama was suggesting we \nshould increase the minimum wage to $9 an hour. I do not see any change \nin the economic conditions that would have caused him to abruptly \nchange his position and now be advocating $10.10 an hour.\n  I know there are many low-income families who are really struggling \nin this country, and I believe our economy could accommodate an \nincrease in the minimum wage. But the Congressional Budget Office, a \nnonpartisan entity, has told us the consequences of going to $10.10 an \nhour would be a loss of some 500,000 jobs--at a time when our economy \nsimply cannot afford that kind of loss.\n  I have talked with numerous employers in Maine. They care deeply \nabout their employees. They, in most cases, are willing and able to pay \nmore. In fact, many of them do pay more. In fact, all of them pay more \nthan the Federal minimum wage because Maine's minimum wage is $7.50 an \nhour rather than $7.25 an hour. So we are already above the Federal \nminimum wage.\n  But what they told me is that if there is too much of an increase too \nrapidly, they will be forced to shrink their workforces or not bring on \nthose summer part-time employees, those high school students, those \ncollege students, those individuals who do not have the training and \nexperience that are necessary to be productive in the job for which \nthey are hired at that time.\n  There is a huge area of compromise available here between $7.25 and \n$10.10. I think it speaks to what is wrong with Washington today that \nwe were placed in a situation where it was take it or leave it rather \nthan our trying to come together and offer amendments and debate the \nlevel that might be acceptable to Members of this body and our \ncolleagues in the House--a level that would not cause dramatic job \nlosses, which would hurt the very people we are trying to help, and yet \nwould recognize we do need to increase the minimum wage by a reasonable \namount to help struggling low-income families.\n  So I have to express my disappointment and frustration that we cannot \nseem to have a normal legislative process, where ideas could be offered \nas amendments, as compromises between $7.25 and $10.10, where Members \ncould bring other ideas to the Senate floor on how we might spur job \ncreation, on how we could improve job training programs, which is a \nhuge issue in this country.\n  I have talked to so many employers in Maine, particularly in the \ntrades, who have jobs available but cannot find the skilled workers to \nfill those jobs. I had a terrific and enlightening meeting with union \nrepresentatives from Bath Iron Works, who told me we need to do a \nbetter job at our community colleges in training workers for the great \njobs--far above minimum wage--that exist at Bath Iron Works in my \nState.\n  So there are so many ideas out there that would help us improve the \nfinancial condition of our low-income families--from increasing the \nminimum wage by an amount that does not cause massive job losses, to \nimproving our job training programs so we can fix this mismatch between \nthe jobs that are available and the skills that our workers have.\n  I would note that the Department of Commerce Secretary testified \nthere are 4 million jobs that are unfilled nationwide because of that \nmismatch in available jobs to the skills needed to fill them.\n  There are other proposals to give tax incentives to small businesses. \nWe have allowed a very important tax incentive that encouraged hiring \nto expire at the end of last year. The Work Opportunity Tax Credit \nexpired. Why not extend that--not only to those groups who qualify now, \nbut also to people who have been unemployed for a long time, to \nencourage employers to take a chance on them, to bring them back into \nthe workforce, where they want to be.\n  We could also include other provisions. For example, I have a \nbipartisan bill with Senator Donnelly and Senator Manchin and Members \non my side of the aisle that would fix the definition of full-time work \nunder ObamaCare so it would be 40 hours a week and not 30 hours a week. \nWe would go back to the standard definition of 40 hours a week.\n  There are tax incentives having to do with bonus depreciation and \nsmall\n\n[[Page S2549]]\n\nbusiness expensing that would encourage small businesses to make the \ninvestments so they can hire more employees.\n  We ought to have a full debate on all of these options, not just stop \nwith one vote on whether to proceed to one bill to raise the minimum \nwage to $10.10 an hour, with no amendments allowed, with no alternative \nproposals being permitted.\n  I so believe if we could get back to the normal way of doing \nbusiness, we would so much better serve the people of this country, \nincluding low-income workers who are struggling to get by. I believe we \ncould come up with a compromise that would enjoy bipartisan support. I \nam not saying it would be easy, but we ought to at least try. I have \ntalked with colleagues on both sides of the aisle who are willing to \ntry, and we need to be given that opportunity.\n  Each and every Member in this body cares about individuals who are \nworking two jobs, who may have two minimum-wage jobs because they are \ntrying to support their families. I think we could come together. But \nwe cannot come together unless we are allowed to offer alternatives, to \nfully debate the issues, and to bring forth ideas to improve our job \ntraining programs and to encourage the creation of more jobs, as well \nas better-paying jobs, in what, unfortunately, remains a very anemic \neconomy.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Donald Sterling and Daniel Snyder\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, yesterday, all America watched while \nCommissioner Adam Silver and the National Basketball Association acted \njustly in punishing Donald Sterling for his harmful racist behavior.\n  Commissioner Silver banned Mr. Sterling from the NBA for life, and \nthere was a $2.5 million fine.\n  I, along with most all of America, applaud the NBA's work in swiftly \nmoving to stamp out bigotry from its ranks.\n  Commissioner Silver and the NBA leadership have set the standard for \nhow professional sports organizations should act in the face of racism.\n  I wonder today how the leadership in the National Football League, \nthe NFL--that money-making machine--I wonder if they have taken notice \nof the NBA's decisive action?\n  How long will the NFL continue to do nothing--zero--as one of its \nteams bears a name that inflicts so much pain on Native Americans?\n  I have 22 tribal organizations in Nevada. All over America, \nespecially in the western part of the United States--but not only in \nthe western part of the United States--we have large numbers of Native \nAmericans.\n  It is untoward of Daniel Snyder to try and hide behind \n``tradition''--tradition? That is what he says--in refusing to change \nthe name of the team.\n  Tradition? What tradition? A tradition of racism is all that name \nleaves in its wake.\n  Mr. Snyder knows that in sports the only tradition that matters is \nwinning.\n  So I urge Daniel Snyder to do what is morally right and remove this \ndegrading term from the league by changing his team's name.\n  It has been done before--right here in Washington, DC.\n  Seventeen years ago, the owner of the Washington Bullets, the late \nAbe Pollin--a wonderful man--saw all the gun violence and murders \ntaking place in the DC area. And what did he do? He voluntarily decided \nthat name--the Washington Bullets--was not any good and changed it. He \ndid not want his team to be associated with bullets. So he changed the \nname of the organization from the Washington Bullets to the Washington \nWizards.\n  We have all followed the Washington Wizards over the last couple \nweeks. They are now in the second round of the playoffs. We are all \nhappy about that. They have struggled for a long time. We support--the \nAmerican people support--the Wizards, as do the people in the DC \nmetropolitan area. Wizards is a good name.\n  Don't you think Daniel Snyder can come up with a name? It should be \neasy. He could invite the fans to choose a name. He could ask high \nschool kids to come up with a name. Anything they came up with, with \nrare exception, would be better than the Washington team name they have \nnow.\n  But since Snyder fails to show any leadership, the National Football \nLeague should take an assist from the NBA and pick up the slack. It \nwould be a slam dunk, Madam President.\n  For far too long, the NFL has been sitting on its hands, doing \nnothing, while an entire population of Americans has been denigrated.\n  So I say to Commissioner Roger Goodell--I believe Roger Goodell is a \ngood man--it is time to act. Remove this hateful term from your \nleague's vocabulary. Follow the NBA's example and rid the league of \nbigotry and racism. I am sure your fans will support it.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Executive Overreach\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise today in defense of the U.S. \nConstitution, the separation of government powers it established, the \nrule of law it enshrined, and the legitimate prerogatives of the \nlegislative branch--and this body in particular--under our \nconstitutional system of government.\n  I am very concerned about what has been going on. Last week the \nJustice Department announced their plan to extend clemency \nconsideration to a large new class of drug offenders.\n  Both the New York Times and the Washington Post estimate that the \nDepartment's new guidelines will potentially apply to tens of thousands \nof cases, with clemency likely to be granted to perhaps thousands of \ncurrent Federal inmates.\n  This surprise announcement by the administration marks a worrying \nshift away from the longstanding norm requiring individualized \ndeterminations based on the particularly compelling circumstances of \nspecific cases. Instead, the Justice Department has laid the groundwork \nfor mass clemency based on a few widely shared and broad criteria.\n  Of course, the Constitution gives the President the power to grant \nclemency in individual cases. No one disputes this authority. It has \nbeen exercised by Presidents throughout our Nation's history, and it is \nproperly used on a limited, case-by-case basis to ameliorate specific \ninstances of injustice experienced by particular individuals.\n  By contrast, it is the rightful province of the legislative branch to \nestablish broader sentencing policy through duly enacted Federal \nstatute.\n  There is sentencing law on the books and Congress periodically \nrevisits and revises this sentencing policy. But in our constitutional \nsystem, changing the law requires legislative action by Congress.\n  In the face of this most basic constitutional requirement, the \nPresident has apparently instead decided to use--or, rather, abuse--the \nclemency power in an attempt to rewrite sentencing law unilaterally. \nHis invocation of clemency is merely a fig leaf to disguise a blatant \neffort to usurp legislative authority.\n  The President's clemency power is not a vehicle by which the \nexecutive branch may effectively revise or discard lawful statutes with \nwhich the President disagrees. But that is precisely what President \nObama and his Justice Department have promised to do.\n  The amount of time that entire classes of drug offenders spend in \njail will no longer be based on uniform sentencing law passed by \nCongress and administered by the Federal court and Judiciary. Instead, \nit will be determined by the President's personal views of ``justice,'' \nby the Attorney General's subjective notions of what he considers \n``fair,'' and by some Justice Department bureaucrat's sense of \n``proportionality.''\n\n[[Page S2550]]\n\n  Such a result turns our system of government on its head, and it \nrepresents an abdication of the President's core constitutional duty.\n  Instead of faithfully executing the law, President Obama is simply \nseeking to enforce his personal ideological preferences. It is \nprecisely this sort of unchecked and unaccountable rule that our \nNation's Founders sought to prevent.\n  The Obama administration's unilateral action on drug sentencing is \nespecially troubling since Congress is actively considering a number of \npotential sentencing reforms. Indeed, an ideologically diverse, \nbipartisan group of Senators has demonstrated they are eager to \nlegislate on this issue. Several sentencing reform bills have been \ndrafted and introduced. Legislation has been considered and reported by \nthe Judiciary Committee.\n  Although a President should never expect to get every single idea he \nwants through the legislative process, bipartisan agreement here seems \nwell within reach--especially if the administration chose to focus on \nworking with Congress to change the law rather than acting alone to \nundermine it.\n  Yet even in an area where constructive action is achievable, the \nPresident has decided to go it alone, and in doing so he violates the \nmost basic constitutional principles he once taught to his law school \nstudents.\n  Examples of such executive abuse have become all too common under \nthis administration, especially since President Obama announced his new \n``pen and phone'' strategy of unilateral action specifically designed \nto bypass Congress and evade constitutional restraints.\n  Just last week the Associated Press reported that, under orders from \nthe White House, the Department of Homeland Security is considering \nlimiting deportations to only criminal aliens with felony convictions.\n  Using the excuse of prosecutorial discretion--another executive tool \nlimited to individual cases and particular circumstances--the \nadministration is seeking to frustrate duly enacted immigration law and \ninstead implement its own broad immigration policies.\n  Whatever our thoughts on the sensitive questions of immigration \npolicy, everyone can agree that such an act requires legislative action \nand should not be brought into effect through executive fiat.\n  I am struck by how far this approach contrasts with the President's \nown judgment as recently as last fall. If the administration continued \nbroadening enforcement carve-outs, he said, ``then essentially I'll be \nignoring the law in a way that I think would be very difficult to \ndefend legally.''\n  Given the lawlessness of broad enforcement carve-outs, the President \nstated flatly, ``that's not an option.''\n  President Obama went on to acknowledge that he does not in fact have \nthe authority to halt most deportations. In his own words:\n\n       If in fact I could pass all these laws without Congress, I \n     would do so. But we're also a nation of laws, that's part of \n     our tradition. The easy way out is to . . . pretend that I \n     can do something by violating our laws, but what I'm \n     proposing is the harder path, which is to use our democratic \n     process to achieve the same goals.\n\n  I wish to associate myself wholeheartedly with President Obama's \nexhortation last fall that we are a nation of laws, and that \nsubstantive changes to the law must come about through the democratic \nprocess.\n  As public servants, our common allegiance must first be to the rule \nof law under the Constitution, as it--more than anything else--is what \nsecures the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.\n  I fear that President Obama's frustration with an inability to win \nbroad support for every aspect of his legislative agenda has caused him \nto ignore clear legal and constitutional obligations. He now seems to \nview the longstanding rules, requirements, and traditions central to \nour system of republican self-government as irritants--mere suggestions \nthat he is willing to bend past their breaking point in order to \nadvance his controversial agenda.\n  Concern about the potential for executive overreach has animated \nAmerican political life from the very beginning. Indeed, it predates \nour Republic, and shaped its founding.\n  Centuries ago, absolutist monarchs such as the Stuart dynasty of \nEngland, seizing on the powers of the medieval popes as a model, \nclaimed a ``royal provocative'' to suspend the application of the laws, \nand used this power to justify their oppressive rule.\n  The Stuarts' unchecked reign in England--the nation that pioneered \nthe modern conception of the rule of law--ignited a long and bloody \nstruggle that eventually brought about the Glorious Revolution. \nThereafter, the 1689 English Bill of Rights confirmed the ``ancient \nrights'' of Englishmen and enshrined the notion that the monarch had no \n``dispensing power'' to waive the application of the laws of the realm.\n  As many noted historians and legal scholars have observed, the \nAmerican Founders were well versed in these 17th century English \nconstitutional struggles. Viewing themselves as heirs to the English \npolitical tradition, the Framers of our new Nation set out to establish \na system of government with an eye toward preventing similar abuses.\n  With the old monarchy's abuse of the claimed dispensing power fresh \nin their minds, the Founders' initial plan of government in the \nArticles of Confederation did not even include an executive. When that \nframework proved unworkable, the Framers drafted and the States \nratified a constitution that avoided either historical extreme: an all-\npowerful executive that claimed the power to dispense with the bounds \nof law or a powerless executive lacking the capacity to govern \neffectively.\n  The structural features of our Constitution navigate between these \ntwo poles, creating an energetic executive but carefully cabining his \npower. It vests legislative authority in Congress, not the President.\n  While the precise line between enforcement discretion and lawmaking \nmay sometimes seem blurry, the Constitution makes clear that changes to \nthe law are the province of the legislative rather than the executive \nbranch, and that when Congress and the President have enacted statutory \nlaws, the executive cannot unilaterally displace it.\n  The Constitution also requires the President to ``take Care that the \nLaws be faithfully executed.'' This clause does not suggest or invite \nthe President to enforce the law--it obligates him to do so. And he is \nbound by the text of the Constitution to do so ``faithfully.''\n  To execute the laws faithfully, as defined by the great Samuel \nJohnson, author of the most definitive dictionary of that age, is to do \nso ``honestly, . . . [w]ith strict adherence to duty and allegiance, . \n. . and [w]ithout failure of performance.''\n  As a diverse array of legal scholars have noted, it is ``implausible \nand unnatural'' to read this clause to allow the President authority to \ndeviate from the loyal enforcement of Federal statutes.\n  James Wilson, the original proponent of the take care clause, put it \nthis way:\n\n       [The President has] authority, not to make, or alter, or \n     dispense with the laws, but to execute and enact the laws, \n     which [are] established.\n\n  He continued:\n\n       To contend that the obligation imposed on the President to \n     see the laws faithfully executed, implies a power to forbid \n     their execution, is a novel construction of the constitution, \n     and entirely inadmissible.\n\n  There are certain situations in which the Executive may in fact \nlegitimately ignore or even contravene a duly enacted Federal statute. \nBut such circumstances are few and far between.\n  The Presidents of both parties have long claimed authority not to \nenforce unconstitutional statutes.\n  According to this view, if the considered view of the executive \nbranch determines that a statute clearly violates the Constitution, the \nhighest law, then that statute is no law at all and does not warrant \nenforcement.\n  Presidents have also sought to justify partial nonenforcement based \non a lack of sufficient resources. As the Supreme Court has explained:\n\n       The President performs his full constitutional duty, if, \n     with the means and instruments provided by Congress and \n     within the limitations prescribed by it, he uses his best \n     endeavors to secure the faithful execution of the laws \n     enacted.\n\n  In other words, the Constitution still obligates the President to do \nhis best to ensure that duly enacted laws are faithfully executed, even \nwhen he and his subordinates are working with limited resources. In \nsuch cases he is obligated to ensure that those resources\n\n[[Page S2551]]\n\nare optimally allocated to achieve as faithful execution as is \npossible.\n  Sadly, political expedience and ideological fervor has led our \ncurrent President to disregard his fundamental obligations to `` . . . \ntake care that the laws be faithfully executed.''\n  Take, for example, the Nation's drug laws, an area where the Obama \nadministration has decided it disagrees with the criminal statutes on \nthe books and wants to implement a different policy, no matter the \ngoverning Federal law.\n  As I noted earlier, the administration's massive clemency push seems \nto employ the President's specific constitutional power--one limited to \nrelieve individual instances of injustice--to provide relief to large \nswaths of criminals who fit a few broad criteria.\n  The President also directed major changes over which Federal drug \ncrimes are charged and at what level, citing prosecutorial discretion, \na limited authority derived from the power to adapt enforcement to an \nindividual's specific circumstances, to implement broad criteria \naffecting thousands of prosecutions. Given the scope of this Executive \naction, compared to its narrowly tailored authority, the \nadministration's invocation of prosecutorial discretion has become a \ntransparent excuse used to try to justify flouting existing Federal \nlaw.\n  Much of the same is true in the context of immigration. The \nadministration has advanced a growing number of enforcement carve-outs \nto increasingly expansive classes of illegal immigrants. First, the \nadministration exempted those brought here as children, then veterans, \nthen their families. Now the administration may seek to exclude from \napplication of duly enacted immigration law anyone who has not \ncommitted serious felonies.\n  While, of course, no one disagrees that violent criminals should be \nour highest priority, the administration has come much further and \nessentially made current immigration law a dead letter for virtually \neveryone else. Last week I joined 21 of my colleagues in a letter to \nthe White House highlighting this Executive abuse. How can the \nadministration even claim it was attempting to faithfully execute \nimmigration law when almost all deportations last year were limited to \nconvicted criminals and recent border crossers, when ICE agents were \nforced to release 68,000 potentially deportable aliens last year alone? \nThink about that. When the administration took disciplinary action for \nICE officers for making lawful arrests, when the President of the \nNational ICE Council felt compelled to testify before Congress that \nalthough `` . . . most Americans assume that ICE agents and officers \nare empowered by the Government to enforce the law, nothing could be \nfurther from the truth.''\n  Another egregious example of this administration's willful failure to \nfaithfully execute the law involves education. The Department of \nEducation has given 42 of the 50 States waivers from application of No \nChild Left Behind. Rather than seek a legislative reauthorization of \nthe statute to set realistic goals going forward, the administration \nhas chosen simply to establish their preferred education policy by \nattaching their own conditions to the waivers that the States need to \nreceive Federal money.\n  Recently, the State of Washington became the first to lose its \nwaiver, primarily because it did not meet the administration's mandate \nfor teacher and principal evaluation--a mandate that has no grounding \nin the actual statute. When the vast majority of States receive waivers \nby meeting conditions that bear little resemblance to provisions of the \nlaw itself, is the administration faithfully executing the law as \nrequired under our beloved Constitution? To the contrary, the President \nis using waiver conditions to bring about an entirely different set of \neducation policies, and he is doing so to avoid spending his energies \nand political capital on a legislative process that might expose \ndivisions within his own party or force his administration to \ncompromise with those who do not share all of his policy preferences.\n  Of course any discussion of Executive overreach by this \nadministration must include ObamaCare. Back when the administration was \nwriting that 2,700-plus page monstrosity, the bill's proponents argued \nthat its length and complexity were necessary evils, that its many \nintricate parts were essential to achieve the bill's promised \nobjectives. The individual mandate, the employer mandate, the minimum \ncoverage requirements, the cuts to Medicare Advantage, and the limits \nfor subsidies to State-run exchanges--we were promised that these \nprovisions and others were both critical and carefully timed to expand \ncoverage and rein in costs. Yet when the time came to implement the \nlaw, the administration's tune changed.\n  To justify violating a number of clear statutory mandates, the \nadministration has mustered a weak and unconvincing hodgepodge of legal \nacrobatics all for the purpose of allowing the administration to avoid \nenforcing the central provisions of its own signature law. When we in \nCongress adopted legitimate legislative fixes to provide hard-working \nAmericans relief from ObamaCare's disruptive effects, the White House \ndisplayed shocking audacity in threatening to veto lawful delays to \nsome of these cuts and mandates.\n  I don't know if anyone could imagine a better example of an \nadministration allowing political expediency and ideological \ncommitments to trump the President's constitutional obligations to take \ncare that the laws be faithfully executed. Equally troubling, where \nthe President's legislative efforts have failed, he has decided simply \nto regulate, seemingly undeterred from stretching his existing \nstatutory authorities past their breaking point. Again, this is the \nvery definition of Executive abuse.\n\n  For example, a hallmark of the President's so-called pen-and-phone \nstrategy was to sign an Executive order forcing Federal contractors to \nraise their minimum wage. He issued this directive despite the fact \nthat there is already a Federal statute that governs the minimum wage \nfor Federal contractors.\n  Although a different statute gives the President some discretion in \nthe area of Federal procurement, its plain language demands--as courts \nhave long held--that there be a sufficient nexus between the \nPresident's orders and the statute's stated goal of efficiency and \neconomy in Federal procurement. Increasing a contractor's labor costs \nby hiking their minimum wage is wholly inconsistent with this statutory \ngoal, demonstrating there is no legal basis for the administration's \nExecutive order.\n  Yet another area of grave concern is the effort by this White House \nto establish new institutional arrangements that fail to respect the \nseparation of government powers and the basic principle of checks and \nbalances enshrined in our Constitution. Take the Dodd-Frank bill, \nanother signature piece of the President's agenda.\n  All Americans should be concerned with the unchecked institutional \nform of the newly created Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. This \nadministration's unwaivering devotion to expanding the scope and reach \nof Federal regulation was made manifest in efforts to place the CFPB \nbeyond Congress's constitutional power of the purse. The CFPB Director \nis empowered to collect a certain percentage of the Federal Reserve's \noperating expenses, indexed to inflation, thereby denying Congress its \nrightful authority to allocate Federal spending and keep the agency in \ncheck with respect to its overweening regulatory ambitions. What the \nWhite House sought was unaccountable Executive power, a CFPB that could \nregulate with virtually no meaningful restraint.\n  When a number of my colleagues and I expressed a desire to address \nthe serious objections to the CFPB structure before confirming the \nPresident's choice to lead the agency, the White House decided that \nabiding by the appointments process established by the Constitution was \ntoo inconvenient. Determined to press forward with the administration's \nagenda at all costs, the President simply installed his choice for CFPB \nDirector as well as other key Federal officers without the advice or \nconsent of the Senate--again, the height of Executive arrogance.\n  The administration sought to justify this move by citing the \nPresident's power under the Recess Appointments Clause, but all the \nrelevant legal authority suggested otherwise. The original public \nmeaning of the clause, well-established historical practice, the \nconstitutional requirement for the\n\n[[Page S2552]]\n\nHouse of Representatives to consent before the Senate may adjourn for \nmore than 3 days, the Senate's constitutional authority to set its own \nrules, and the Senate's own determination that it was not in recess at \nthe time, all of this made clear that the President had no authority to \nmake the appointments unilaterally. Yet as an indication of its \nwillingness to simply ignore the law and Constitution, that is \nprecisely what the President did.\n  This brazen lawlessness cannot stand, and it will not. Already \nseveral Federal appeals courts have ruled that these appointments were \nunconstitutional, and most observers expect the Supreme Court to agree.\n  Yet the Obama administration remains undeterred. Having decided to \nbypass Congress and go it alone, the White House has likewise sought to \nremove meaningful accountability by means of the Federal judiciary. As \nin the recess appointments cases, Federal courts have rejected a \nvariety of this administration's lawless actions and vindicated \ncritical constitutional rights. No court has served as a greater check \non Executive overreach than the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, which \noversees most Federal regulatory actions. So the White House has sought \nto remove even this modest restraint.\n  After the DC Circuit rightfully invalidated several key \nadministration actions as outside the bounds of Federal law, the \nPresident then sought to pack that court with compliant judges in order \nto obtain more favorable decisions.\n  The President's allies in this body, in their own words, ``focused \nvery intently on the D.C. Circuit'' determined to ``switch the \nmajority'' on the court, and were willing to ``fill up the D.C. Circuit \none way or another.''\n  In the rush to eliminate any possible judicial obstacle to unilateral \nprogressive advances, they ran roughshod over the rules and traditions \nof this body, working untold and permanent damage to two venerated \ninstitutions of our constitutional system.\n  This whole episode demonstrates a brazen willingness on the part of \nthis administration to ignore virtually any legal or constitutional \nconstraints and even tamper with the judiciary simply for the sake of \nadvancing its own ideological goals or objectives.\n  I have only had time today to scratch the surface of the pattern of \nExecutive abuses in areas as diverse as EPA, and NLRB regulatory \nactions, inappropriate IRS targeting, net neutrality rulemaking, and \nthe refusal to defend the Defense of Marriage Act. Such executive \nlawlessness should be troubling to all Americans regardless of \npolitical stripe or partisan affiliation.\n  It is the Constitution, the political institutions it established, \nthe legal framework it enshrined, the checks and balances it requires, \nthat ensures we remain a government of laws and not of men. Absent \nthese essential restraints, we will all become subject to increasingly \narbitrary rule, a government that knows no bounds and seeks to regulate \nand control virtually every aspect of our lives.\n  President Obama once spoke of the necessity for such restraint. He \nwarned of the dangers associated with unilateral executive action, and \nhe highlighted the critical importance of adhering to constitutional \nprocedures.\n  While campaigning for President in 2008, he said:\n\n       I taught constitutional law for ten years. I take the \n     Constitution very seriously. The biggest problems we're \n     facing right now have to do with [the President] trying to \n     bring more and more power into the executive branch and not \n     go through Congress at all, and that's what I intend to \n     reverse when I am President of the United States.\n\n  How far we have come since Candidate Obama made those empty promises.\n  I have been a Member of this body for nearly four decades. I have \nworked with half a dozen Presidents. On many occasions we have been \nable--working together--to accomplish great good for the American \npeople. My concern today is not partisan. My criticisms are not \nideological, nor is my interest as a Member of the Senate simply \ninstitutional. Throughout my years as a Member of this body, I have \nacknowledged and defended the power of the President when he acts \nlawfully--he or she. In the national security context in particular, \nwhere the President is at the height of his constitutional and \nstatutory authorities, I have defended the prerogatives of the \nPresident no matter the party occupying the White House and no matter \nthe political unpopularity of doing so.\n  The concerns I have expressed today are about legitimacy. What \nauthority to govern does the President or any of us have except that \nwhich we derive from our Constitution? My criticisms are about \nrestoring accountability. How are we going to keep this or any \nadministration honest when it seeks to cut out Congress's legitimate \nrole in the governing process?\n  Above all, my observations today are about liberty. Yes, that is \nright--liberty. If we are to maintain our freedoms, which so many of \nour fellow citizens have fought and died to preserve--including my own \nbrother and two brothers-in-law--we must always remember to heed James \nMadison's warning in Federalist 47:\n\n       The accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and \n     judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, \n     and whether hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may \n     justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.\n\n  It is essential to the continued well-being of our Nation, to the \nlegitimacy of our government, and to the liberties of our citizens that \nthe exercise of Executive power is kept within lawful bounds. Doing so \nrequires continual vigilance by the court, by Congress, and by the \nAmerican people to uphold the standards of the Constitution, and that \nincludes the President as well.\n  I will close with a word of warning from President George Washington \nwhich is perhaps even more true today than when President Washington \nspoke it way back when.\n\n       If, in the opinion of the people, the distribution or \n     modification of the constitutional powers be in any \n     particular wrong, let it be corrected by an amendment in the \n     way which the Constitution designates. But let there be no \n     change by usurpation; for though this, in one instance, may \n     be the instrument of good, it is the customary weapon by \n     which free governments are destroyed.\n\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        World Immunization Week\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, the World Health Organization has deemed \nthis week ``World Immunization Week.'' Every year the WHO designates a \nwhole week to promote the world's most powerful tools in public \nhealth--the use of vaccines to protect people of all ages against \ndisease.\n  Immunization is one of the most successful and cost-effective health \ninterventions ever introduced, preventing up to 3 million deaths a year \nfrom diseases such as diphtheria, tetanus, polio, and measles. Thanks \nto decades of research, there are 25 diseases that can be prevented by \nvaccines, including some forms of influenza, meningitis, and even \ncertain types of liver and cervical cancer.\n  The theme this year is ``Are you up-to-date?'' This year one in five \nchildren worldwide will not receive the vaccinations they need, some \nbecause their parents choose not to and others because it is just not \navailable. Through the Global Vaccine Action Plan, the WHO and other \nmembers of the World Health Assembly are working to close this gap and \npromote equitable access to vaccines for every adult and child in the \nworld. The aim--their goal--is to have all people vaccinated against \npreventable diseases by 2020.\n  One of the diseases the WHO is targeting is polio. I have a few years \non the Presiding Officer, but I can recall growing up in the 1950s. \nWhen you grew up in that era, polio was a real concern. In some years \n60,000 kids would come down with polio, and at that time nobody knew \nwhy. They could not figure out where it was coming from or how to stop \nit.\n  Parents--my mom included--had their theories. Some of those theories \nwere based loosely on health and others on legend. My mother used to \nsay: Don't you go play in that rainwater outside in the street after it \nrains; you could get polio. I can remember hearing that.\n\n[[Page S2553]]\n\n  When we were kids, I remember the earliest television shows showed \npeople in iron lungs and surviving in that machine that kept them alive \nand looking at the world through a mirror that was perched above their \nheads. Many people were afflicted by polio. Some of my closest friends \ngrowing up had polio. Our Republican leader, Senator McConnell, \nsuffered from polio as a child. It was not uncommon. It was way too \ncommon.\n  Then came the day in 1955 when Jonas Salk came up with the Salk \nvaccine. It was such an amazing piece of news. It was shared in every \nclassroom across the country. They had a vaccine. It involved a shot, \nand none of us were excited about that, but the idea of being protected \nfor life from polio was worth it.\n  Then came along the Sabin oral vaccine, which we were even happier to \nhear about.\n  It was an indication to a lot of people that with hard work and \nresearch cures could be found.\n  It was April 12, 1955, when Dr. Thomas Francis, Jr., an \nepidemiologist at the University of Michigan and a mentor to Salk, \nannounced that Salk discovered a polio vaccine that was safe and \neffective. When that announcement was made, families across America \ncelebrated. We couldn't wait to get in line. April 12 was deliberately \nchosen for the announcement because it marked the 10th anniversary of \nthe death of the most famous polio survivor of all--President Franklin \nDelano Roosevelt. Roosevelt also founded the March of Dimes Foundation \nin 1938, without which Salk may not have had the resources to complete \nhis research. A massive field trial led to the release of the vaccine, \nthe first of its kind. It was conducted on 1.8 million children in \nAmerica, and it was proven 80 to 90 percent effective. We achieved this \nvictory over polio. It really was a big deal. As a result, polio was \neradicated in the United States of America in 1979.\n  In February the Senate passed a resolution I cosponsored with Senator \nKirk of Illinois supporting World Polio Day. This resolution commended \nnot only the work of Jonas Salk but also the Rotary Club, WHO, the Bill \nand Melinda Gates Foundation, and UNICEF for their work to eradicate \npolio. These organizations have joined with the United States and other \nnational governments to successfully reduce cases of polio by more than \n99 percent. We now believe there are only three nations on Earth where \nthere is evidence of polio: Nigeria, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. The \nsuccess of the polio vaccine showed the public what medical research \ncould accomplish and encourage.\n  Yesterday Chairman Mikulski of the Senate Appropriations Committee \nhad a hearing on research, and we had some great witnesses. Among them \nwas Dr. Francis Collins, who is the head of the National Institutes of \nHealth. They came to talk about America's investment in research and \ninnovation. You would think that with the success of the Salk polio \nvaccine and all the other things that have followed, that America would \nhave learned a valuable lesson about this investment. Sadly, today, \nsome 60 years after the discovery of the Salk polio vaccine, we are not \nmaking progress as we should. In fact, in some respects we are falling \nbehind.\n  Because of our failure to adequately fund the National Institutes of \nHealth over the last 10 or 12 years, we have seen a 20-percent decline \nin the awards for medical research.\n  I talked to Dr. Francis Collins about this 2 or 3 months ago. He \nheads up the NIH. He is a brilliant, wonderful man who was in charge of \nmapping the Human Genome Project. He did it ahead of time and on budget \nand produced a wealth of information that is now being used to find \ncures for diseases.\n  A month or so ago, the National Institutes of Health introduced their \nAMP Program where they engaged the 10 largest pharmaceutical companies \nin America to join with the NIH to use the human genome to find cures \nfor the following diseases: Alzheimer's, type 2 diabetes, and \nrheumatoid arthritis. Those are the first three targets they are going \nto go after. We need to go after more, and we need to encourage them \nfor several reasons:\n  First, if we don't make an investment in medical research that future \ngenerations of researchers can count on, young people will not dedicate \ntheir lives to medical research.\n  Think of this for a moment: 30 years ago 18 percent of all the NIH \nmedical researchers were under the age of 36. Now it is 3 percent. \nYounger people are not moving toward medical research because they are \nuncertain of our national commitment in this area. Shame on us. At a \ntime when we should be enticing the best and brightest in the world to \nget involved in biomedical research, our indecision and lack of \nleadership at the governmental level is failing to fund these entities \nand this effort.\n  I asked Dr. Collins: What is the kind of commitment we should make as \na nation in medical research that can make a dramatic difference?\n  He said: Senator, if you could give us 5 percent real growth a year \nbeyond inflation, 5 percent a year for 10 years, I will promise you we \nwill make dramatic progress.\n  So I did a calculation. I asked my staff what it would cost us as a \nnation to increase medical research 5 percent a year for 10 years. \nWell, they added the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for \nDisease Control, the Department of Defense medical research, and the \nVeterans' Administration medical research. They said: All right. Put \nthem all together. If we gave them a 5-percent raise each year, how \nmuch would it cost over 10 years? The answer: $150 billion.\n  That is a huge sum of money, but in that same period of time we are \nlikely to budget over $18 trillion in spending for the government. It \nis a very tiny piece of the overall spending of our government.\n  Some people who are budget hawks will step back and say: Great idea, \nSenator, but we just can't afford it. We can't afford to commit to \ncoming up with $150 billion over 10 years.\n  I would ask them to consider two things:\n  First, last year in the United States of America, the Federal \nGovernment spent, through the Medicare and Medicaid Programs, over $200 \nbillion treating one disease: Alzheimer's. If through our medical \nresearch we could find some blessed cure for this terrible disease or \neven delay its onset, it would more than pay for the amount of money we \nwould have to invest in medical research. It is that important.\n  Secondly, there are things we can do which I will stand up and say I \nam prepared to do which would fund a major part of this research. If we \nincreased the Federal tax on tobacco products by 95 cents a package, it \nwould pay for more than half of the medical research I just \nsuggested. Over a 10-year period of time, 900,000 American lives would \nbe saved because children wouldn't be able to afford to buy these \ntobacco products.\n\n  So this medical research commitment is not only a good one in terms \nof reducing our costs of medical care, but it also is something we \nought to achieve in order to make sure there will be breakthroughs in \nthe years ahead to eliminate and treat many of the diseases which haunt \nus and our families across America.\n  The American Cures Act is a bill I have introduced. I am happy to \nhave a number of my colleagues cosponsoring it. It has the support of \nvirtually all of the major medical research organizations. It should be \nbipartisan, and I hope those on the other side of the aisle who share \nmy commitment to medical research will join me.\n  Discovering the polio vaccine won Jonas Salk the Nobel Prize and \nallowed him to create the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, one of \nthe premier institutes for biomedical research. If he had done nothing \nelse, Salk's place in history would have been honored and assured. But \nJonas Salk wasn't content to rest on past achievement. After all, he \nwas an American. In the last years of his life, he spent his time \nsearching for a cure for AIDS. When his early efforts failed, he was \nundeterred. When asked why, he said: You can only fail if you stop too \nsoon. This is a decisive moment in the history of our Nation. We have \nto continue to invest in order to reap the immense rewards of decades \nof work by the best scientific and medical minds in the world. The only \nway we can fail is by stopping too soon.\n\n\n                            Shah Nomination\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I rise to speak in support of Manish\n\n[[Page S2554]]\n\nShah, who has been nominated to serve as a Federal district court judge \nin the Northern District of Illinois. Mr. Shah is an outstanding \nnominee. He has the experience, qualifications and integrity to serve \nwith distinction on the Federal bench.\n  Mr. Shah was nominated to fill the seat that became vacant when Judge \nJoan Lefkow took senior status. He has been reviewed by my judicial \nscreening committee, and he was chosen by Senator Kirk's committee to \nserve and I supported the selection.\n  He is a Federal prosecutor in the Northern District of Illinois. He \nis currently chief of the criminal division of that office and he has a \nlengthy resume of achievements in this field.\n  Mr. Shaw has won numerous awards and recognitions for his work in the \nU.S. attorney's office, including the FBI Director's Award for \nOutstanding Criminal Investigation. He graduated from Stanford \nUniversity and the University of Chicago Law School. He clerked for 2 \nyears for Judge Jim Zagel of the Northern District of Illinois.\n  Incidentally, his nomination in the Northern District of Illinois is \nhistoric. Upon confirmation, he will be the first article III judge of \nSouth Asian descent to serve in the State of Illinois. He appeared \nbefore the Judiciary Committee last November in a hearing that I \nchaired. He was reported out unanimously from that committee.\n  I am sorry it has taken so long for us to get to his nomination on \nthe calendar, but I am certain he will be an excellent addition to the \nbench for the Northern District of Illinois.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                           Bastian Nomination\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I rise today to express my support for \nthe nomination of Stanley Bastian to be a district judge for the \nEastern District of Washington. Stan Bastian is exactly the kind of \nhighly qualified Federal judge eastern Washington needs.\n  The Eastern District of Washington represents a wide swath of \nWashington that includes 20 counties that cover 63 percent of our \nState. Yet the court has been operating with two vacancies. So it is \ntime for the Senate to move forward on filling this position, and I \nhope we confirm Mr. Bastian today. I also hope we can move forward on a \nvote on Salvador Mendoza in the coming weeks as well.\n  Mr. Bastian has been called an ``outstanding choice'' for the Eastern \nDistrict bench, and I want to make sure we understand why. He was born \nin Washington and is well versed in Pacific Northwest issues. As my \ncolleagues Mr. Wyden and Mr. Merkley will note, he is a graduate of the \nUniversity of Oregon, but he also went to law school at the University \nof Washington. Mr. Bastian has handled a diverse portfolio of legal \nmatters, including representing counties, public utility districts, \nfruit growers, medical clinics, brokers, and individuals, and he brings \nmore than 30 years of experience to the Federal bench, including 25 \nyears in private practice.\n  He has well rounded experience from all sides of the legal process, \nfrom civil and criminal trials to mediation, arbitration, and \nnegotiations between various parties. Throughout his career, Mr. \nBastian has shown a dedication to justice and equal access to the law. \nAs an experienced trial attorney, he has earned the support and \nrecognition of his peers.\n  When I interviewed Mr. Bastian, I was impressed by his respect for \nlegal precedent and his commitment to the rule of law, his work to \nimprove access to justice, and his local knowledge that has been very \nimportant in serving eastern Washington and all of Washington.\n  Mr. Bastian also served as a judicial pro tem in municipal courts, \nand recently he had the opportunity to lead the Washington State Bar \nAssociation. As the president of that organization, Mr. Bastian focused \non ethics, professionalism, and civility in the legal profession. He \nhas a long and wide-ranging background in the law and in the legal \ncommunity, and that is exactly why we should put him on the Federal \nbench.\n  His legal career exemplifies public service, a commitment to access \nto justice, and a stellar legal intellect. I am confident he will serve \nthe Eastern District well.\n  So I hope we move forward on these nominees this afternoon and \nconfirm Mr. Bastian.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n            Unanimous Consent Agreement--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that following \ndisposition of the Levy nomination, the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of Calendar No. 711, that there be 2 minutes for debate, \nequally divided between the two leaders or their designees, prior to a \nvote on confirmation of that nomination; further, that notwithstanding \nrule XXII, on Thursday, May 1, 2014, at 11 a.m., the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session and vote on the cloture motions for Calendar Nos. \n591, 592, and 575; further, that if cloture is invoked on any of these \nnominations, all postcloture time be expired and at 1:45 p.m., the \nSenate proceed to vote on confirmation of Calendar Nos. 591, 592, 730, \nand 701; further, that on Monday, May 5, at 5:30 p.m., the Senate \nproceed to executive session and vote on confirmation of Calendar Nos. \n575 and 703; further, that there be 2 minutes for debate prior to each \nvote, equally divided in the usual form, that any rollcall votes \nfollowing the first in each series be 10 minutes in length and, if \nconfirmed, the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon \nthe table with no intervening action or debate; that no further motions \nbe in order to the nominations; that any statements related to the \nnominations be printed in the Record; that the President be immediately \nnotified of the Senate's action and the Senate then resume legislative \nsession.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. With this agreement, we will have up to seven rollcall \nvotes this afternoon and as many as three rollcall votes beginning at \n11 a.m. tomorrow, and as many as four rollcall votes tomorrow afternoon \nbeginning at about a quarter of 2.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that even though we are a \nminute or so short, we start the votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/30/senate-section/article/S2554-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2554-S2557]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n NOMINATION OF SHERYL H.

I thank President Obama for \nnominating him. I thank the Senate for voting to confirm Manish Shah.\n  Senator Durbin, Illinois' senior Senator, and I work to ensure \nIllinois has highly skilled judges to help strengthen our courts. Mr. \nShah was such a judicial nominee.\n  In Illinois, Mr. Shah has established himself as an outstanding \nlawyer and dedicated public servant. He was among the most experienced \nprosecutors in the Northern District of Illinois. Now with Senate \nconfirmation, Mr. Shah starts the next phase of his legal career. He is \nready to take a seat on the Federal bench.\n  We, as Americans, should be proud of Manish Shah. He is a great \nAmerican success story. Mr. Shah was born in New York. His parents \nemigrated from India and raised their two sons in West Hartford, CT. \nMr. Shah attended Stanford University and graduated with honors and \ndistinction. He attended the University of Chicago Law School, and \nagain he graduated with honors.\n  After law school, Shah was a litigation associate at Heller Ehrman in \nSan Francisco and clerked for Hon. James B. Zagel of the U.S. District \nCourt for the Northern District of Illinois.\n  Mr. Shah joined the Chicago U.S. attorney's office in September 2001 \nand prosecuted violent crime, international drug trafficking, complex \nfraud, and public corruption. During his time as a Federal prosecutor, \nMr. Shah developed a stellar record--notably, Mr. Shah worked with \nformer U.S. attorney Patrick Fitzgerald. Mr. Shah and a team of \nprosecutors and Federal agents investigated and prosecuted a series of \ncases arising out of the city of Chicago's Hired Truck Program and \nOffice of Intergovernmental Affairs.\n  While working at the U.S. attorney's office Mr. Shah served in \nseveral leadership positions. He was a deputy chief of the General \nCrimes Section and the Financial Crimes and Special Prosecutions \nSection, and he was the chief of the Appellate Section. Mr. Shah was \nthe chief of the Criminal Division and\n\n[[Page S2556]]\n\nresponsible for supervising the prosecutions in the Northern District \nof Illinois handled by the approximately 130 Assistant U.S. attorneys. \nThese are the types of life and work experiences that make great \njudges.\n  Mr. Shah will be a knowledgeable jurist who will provide a fair forum \nfor the resolution of civil disputes and the prosecution of alleged \ncrimes. I am sure Mr. Shah will have a long and stellar career on the \nFederal bench in the Northern District of Illinois. I am certain Mr. \nShah will be a top-rate judge.\n  I congratulate Mr. Shah on his confirmation. I look forward to \nfollowing his judicial career.\n  Congratulations, Manish Shah.

Under the previous order, the question is, \nWill the Senate advise and consent to the nomination of Cynthia Ann \nBashant, of California, to be United States District Judge for the \nSouthern District of California?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to \nsupport the nomination of Judge Cynthia Bashant to the Federal district \ncourt in San Diego.\n  As my colleagues know, I recommend candidates to the President \nthrough a bipartisan judicial selection process. Judge Bashant excelled \nin this process, earning my recommendation to President Obama.\n  I am confident she will do an outstanding job on the Federal bench.\n  She earned her bachelor's degree from Smith College in 1982 and her \nlaw degree from the University of California, Hastings College of the \nLaw in 1986.\n  She spent 3 years practicing civil litigation at the law firm \nMacDonald Halsted & Layborne, which later became part of the firm Baker \n& McKenzie.\n  In 1989, she joined the U.S. attorney's office in San Diego, where \nshe tried at least 15 cases in Federal court.\n  Judge Bashant served as deputy chief of the narcotics unit in San \nDiego from 1995 to 1997, and then as chief of the border crimes unit \nfrom 1997 to 1998.\n  During her prosecutorial career, she prosecuted numerous important \ncases. One was a major drug trafficking case that involved: the Sinaloa \ndrug cartel; a 1,600-foot tunnel under the southern border; 23 \ndefendants; and wiretaps in Chicago, San Antonio, Los Angeles, and San \nDiego.\n  She prosecuted an individual who robbed more than 20 banks, a local \nrecord in San Diego at the time.\n  Just after the Violence Against Women Act passed in 1994, Judge \nBashant prosecuted the first Federal domestic violence case in the \nSouthern District of California and one of the first in the Nation.\n  The defendant was accused of luring his wife, who had just filed for \ndivorce, into their car, after which he took her to Mexico against her \nwill, beat her black and blue, and cut off all of her hair. The \ndefendant pleaded guilty to violating a provision of VAWA designed to \ncriminalize precisely this sort of conduct.\n  In one of her other cases, the defendant was a human smuggler. To \navoid a checkpoint, he led a large group of undocumented immigrants \nacross the Interstate 5 freeway on foot. The group included a mother \nand her six children, ranging in age from 6 to 15 years old.\n  The 6-year old boy was killed by oncoming traffic in front of his \nmother. The smuggler simply left the mother and her five other children \nby the side of the road.\n  In preparation for trial, Judge Bashant met extensively with the \nmother, who understandably was distraught and afraid to testify. Judge \nBashant and the mother's sister helped the mother be ready to testify \nagainst the smuggler.\n  Ultimately, Judge Bashant secured a guilty plea from the defendant, \nand the court imposed several sentencing enhancements on him.\n  For her work on this case, Judge Bashant won the Justice Department's \nVictim-Witness Award.\n  She also won numerous other DOJ awards, including the Director's \nAward for Superior Performance and special commendations 6 years in a \nrow.\n  In 2000, Judge Bashant was appointed to the San Diego Superior Court.\n\n[[Page S2557]]\n\n  As a judge, she has presided over more than 1,000 cases that have \ngone to verdict or judgment--including more than 100 criminal jury \ntrials.\n  She has been a leader on the superior court, as well as in the San \nDiego community. Most recently, she was presiding judge of the Juvenile \nCourt from 2009 to 2012.\n  In 2012, the San Diego Juvenile Justice Commission named her Judge of \nthe Year.\n  She served as chair of the San Diego Commission on Children, Youth, \nand Families, which advises the county board of supervisors on issues \naffecting family well-being.\n  She served on the San Diego County Child Abuse Prevention \nCoordinating Council as well.\n  She also has served as president and currently serves on the advisory \nboard of the Lawyers Club of San Diego--a highly respected organization \nthat works to promote gender equality in the legal profession.\n  She also has served on the board of the Children's Initiative of San \nDiego, which was established in 1992 to advocate for effective policies \nto support the health and well-being of children, youth, and families \nin San Diego.\n  Simply put, Judge Bashant is a perfect fit for this position. She has \nexperience in private practice. She spent 11 years as a Federal \nprosecutor in San Diego. She has been running her own courtroom for 13 \nyears.\n  I have no doubt she will hit the ground running on the Southern \nDistrict, which has the third-greatest criminal caseload per judgeship \nin the Nation.\n  Beyond her qualifications and experience, Judge Bashant clearly is an \noutstanding woman and a real leader. As one of her judicial colleagues \ntold my judicial selection committee, Judge Bashant is ``an energetic, \nsmart, really impressive hard worker who `really cares.' ''\n  So, I am very proud to have recommended Judge Bashant to the \nPresident, and I urge my colleagues to support her nomination.\n  Mr. SCOTT.

Mr. President, earlier this month, the U.S. Supreme Court \nonce again chose to dismantle campaign finance laws which had protected \nhard-working Americans for decades. In McCutcheon v. Federal Election \nCommission, a sharply divided Court held that aggregate limits on \ncampaign contributions are a violation of the First Amendment. These \nwere the same five justices who, just 4 years ago, reversed a century \nof precedent in Citizens United by declaring that corporations have a \nFirst Amendment right to endlessly finance and influence elections. \nRather than increasing access and encouraging participation for all \nAmericans, this Court continues to rule against our democratic \nprinciples and in favor of moneyed interests.\n  The Court's recent dismantling of campaign finance laws has been \ndevastating. As Justice Breyer warned in his dissent:\n\n       Taken together with Citizens United, [the McCutcheon] \n     decision eviscerates our Nation's campaign finance laws, \n     leaving a remnant incapable of dealing with the grave \n     problems of democratic legitimacy that those laws were \n     intended to resolve.\n\n  I could not agree with him more.\n  Nobody who has watched our elections or even tried to watch \ntelevision since the Citizens United decision can deny the enormous \nimpact that decision has had on our political process. In small states \nlike Vermont, that decision coupled with McCutcheon poses an even \ngreater risk. I have heard time and again from Vermonters concerned \nabout these toxic effects, and I agree that something must be done. \nThat is why I have cosponsored the DISCLOSE Act since 2010 to restore \ntransparency and accountability to campaign finance laws, and that is \nwhy we have held multiple hearings in the Judiciary Committee on the \nimpact of these alarming Supreme Court decisions. Earlier this month I \nannounced that the Judiciary Committee would have another hearing on \nthis issue. That hearing will take place in June. We will hear \ntestimony from individuals who have witnessed the real impact these \nharmful decisions have had on Americans seeking to exercise their right \nto vote and to be heard.\n  The Judiciary Committee's hearing will also take place close to the \nanniversary of yet another devastating Supreme Court decision. Last \nJune, as the Nation prepared to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of the \nMarch on Washington where Dr. Martin Luther King delivered his historic \n``I Have a Dream'' speech, the same narrow majority of the Supreme \nCourt struck down the coverage provision of the Voting Rights Act and \neffectively gutted the most successful piece of civil rights \nlegislation in this Nation's history in Shelby County v. Holder.\n  The Voting Rights Act, including the coverage formula and Section 5, \nwas reauthorized and signed into law by President George W. Bush in \n2006, after the Senate voted 98-0 and the House voted 390-33 in favor \nof the reauthorization. Yet the Court struck down a key provision of \nthe Act despite the fact that it has worked to protect the \nConstitution's guarantees against racial discrimination in voting for \nnearly five decades. In striking down the coverage formula in the \nVoting Rights Act, the Court dramatically undercut Section 5's ability \nto protect American voters from racial discrimination in voting. The \nresult is that many Americans who were protected by this law have now \nbeen left vulnerable to discriminatory practices and have had much \ngreater difficulty accessing the ballot box. Along with other \nlawmakers, I have introduced a bipartisan and bicameral bill, S. 1945, \nto respond to the Court's decision and would reinvigorate the most \nvital protections of the Act. I hope Senate Republicans will work with \nme on this important effort.\n  This current Supreme Court's pattern of denying access to the ballot \nbox for everyday Americans while expanding the ability of billionaires \nand corporations to buy elections is disturbing, to say the least. In \nan article by Ari Berman at The Nation dated April 2, the author states \nthat ``The Court's conservative majority believes that the First \nAmendment gives wealthy donors and powerful corporations the carte \nblanche to buy an election but that the Fifteenth Amendment does not \ngive Americans the right to vote free of racial discrimination.'' Since \nthe Court's ruling in Shelby County, eight states previously covered \nunder Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act have since passed or \nimplemented new voting restrictions and voters are already seeing the \nconsequences of that lack of protection. Mr. Berman concludes that \n``[a] country that expands the rights of the powerful to dominate the \npolitical process but does not protect fundament rights for all \ncitizens doesn't sound much like a functioning democracy to me.'' I \nagree and I ask unanimous consent to have this article printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  Sara Mayeux at Harvard Law School observed that the Court began its \nMcCutcheon opinion by noting that ``There is no right more basic in our \ndemocracy than the right to participate in electing our political \nleaders'' yet, this same narrow majority discarded that very principle \njust last year when it struck down a key provision of the Voting Rights \nAct in Shelby County--a case that was much more about the right to \nparticipate in electing our political leaders than this one.\n  The observation is consistent with the disturbing trend exhibited by \nthis Court in Citizens United, McCutcheon, and Shelby County, which is \nthat the Court underscores and endorses the rights of corporations and \nbillionaires to participate in our democracy, and yet dismisses that \nsame right for the average American to participate in our elections and \nto vote free from discrimination.\n  Every American should understand how devastating these rulings are to \nour system of democracy. Time and again, this narrow majority of \nconservative Justices has substituted their own preferences for those \nof the duly-elected Congress, despite the Supreme Court's own \nprecedents. This Court's disregard for Congressional findings about \nboth the threat of corruption and the irreparable harm of racial \ndiscrimination in voting demonstrates how out of touch with reality \nsome of the Justices have become. These sharply-divided rulings \nundermine the fundamental concept that our democracy is supposed to \nwork for all Americans. I will continue to work on behalf of the \nAmerican people to see that all Americans and not just a wealthy few \nwill continue to have a right to participate in our representative \ndemocracy and to have their voices heard.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From The Nation, Apr. 2, 2014]\n\n         The Supreme Court's Ideology: More Money, Less Voting\n\n                            (By Ari Berman)\n\n       In the past four years, under the leadership of Chief \n     Justice John Roberts, the Supreme Court has made it far \n     easier to buy an election and far harder to vote in one.\n       First came the Court's 2010 decision in Citizens United v. \n     FEC, which brought us the Super PAC era.\n       Then came the Court's 2013 decision in Shelby County v. \n     Holder, which gutted the centerpiece of the Voting Rights \n     Act.\n       Now we have McCutcheon v. FEC, where the Court, in yet \n     another controversial 5-4 opinion written by Roberts, struck \n     down the limits on how much an individual can contribute to \n     candidates, parties and political action committees. So \n     instead of an individual donor being allowed to give $117,000 \n     to campaigns, parties and PACs in an election cycle (the \n     aggregate limit in 2012), they can now give up to $3.5 \n     million, Andy Kroll of Mother Jones reports.\n       The Court's conservative majority believes that the First \n     Amendment gives wealthy donors and powerful corporations the \n     carte blanche right to buy an election, but that the \n     Fifteenth Amendment does not give Americans the right to vote \n     free of racial discrimination.\n       These are not unrelated issues--the same people, like the \n     Koch brothers, who favor unlimited secret money in US \n     elections are the ones funding the effort to make it harder \n     for people to vote. The net effect is an attempt to \n     concentrate the power of the top 1 percent in the political \n     process and to drown out the voices and votes of everyone \n     else.\n       Consider these stats from Demos on the impact of Citizens \n     United in the 2012 election:\n       The top thirty-two Super PAC donors, giving an average of \n     $9.9 million each, matched the $313.0 million that President \n     Obama and Mitt Romney raised from all of their small donors \n     combined--that's at least 3.7 million people giving less than \n     $200 each.\n       Nearly 60 percent of Super PAC funding came from just 159 \n     donors contributing at least $1 million. More than 93 percent \n     of the money Super PACs raised came in contributions of at \n     least $10,000--from just 3,318 donors, or the equivalent of \n     0.0011 percent of the US population.\n       It would take 322,000 average-earning American families \n     giving an equivalent\n\n[[Page S2559]]\n\n     share of their net worth to match the Adelsons' $91.8 million \n     in Super PAC contributions. That trend is only going to get \n     worse in the wake of the McCutcheon decision.\n       Now consider what's happened since Shelby County: eight \n     states previously covered under Section 4 of the Voting \n     Rights Act have passed or implemented new voting restrictions \n     (Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Mississippi, Texas, Virginia, \n     South Carolina and North Carolina).\n       That has had a ripple effect elsewhere.

Mr. President, earlier this month, the U.S. Supreme Court \nonce again chose to dismantle campaign finance laws which had protected \nhard-working Americans for decades. In McCutcheon v. Federal Election \nCommission, a sharply divided Court held that aggregate limits on \ncampaign contributions are a violation of the First Amendment. These \nwere the same five justices who, just 4 years ago, reversed a century \nof precedent in Citizens United by declaring that corporations have a \nFirst Amendment right to endlessly finance and influence elections. \nRather than increasing access and encouraging participation for all \nAmericans, this Court continues to rule against our democratic \nprinciples and in favor of moneyed interests.\n  The Court's recent dismantling of campaign finance laws has been \ndevastating. As Justice Breyer warned in his dissent:\n\n       Taken together with Citizens United, [the McCutcheon] \n     decision eviscerates our Nation's campaign finance laws, \n     leaving a remnant incapable of dealing with the grave \n     problems of democratic legitimacy that those laws were \n     intended to resolve.\n\n  I could not agree with him more.\n  Nobody who has watched our elections or even tried to watch \ntelevision since the Citizens United decision can deny the enormous \nimpact that decision has had on our political process. In small states \nlike Vermont, that decision coupled with McCutcheon poses an even \ngreater risk. I have heard time and again from Vermonters concerned \nabout these toxic effects, and I agree that something must be done. \nThat is why I have cosponsored the DISCLOSE Act since 2010 to restore \ntransparency and accountability to campaign finance laws, and that is \nwhy we have held multiple hearings in the Judiciary Committee on the \nimpact of these alarming Supreme Court decisions. Earlier this month I \nannounced that the Judiciary Committee would have another hearing on \nthis issue. That hearing will take place in June. We will hear \ntestimony from individuals who have witnessed the real impact these \nharmful decisions have had on Americans seeking to exercise their right \nto vote and to be heard.\n  The Judiciary Committee's hearing will also take place close to the \nanniversary of yet another devastating Supreme Court decision.

In \n     addition, the bill would repeal many elements of the Internal \n     Revenue Code that are not used in computing current taxes and \n     thus are obsolete.\n       The staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) \n     estimates that the bill would have no budgetary effect. \n     Enacting the bill would not affect direct spending or \n     revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply.\n       JCT has determined that the bill contains no \n     intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in \n     the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act.\n       The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Logan \n     Timmerhoff.

In some cases those \n     provisions would be extended and amended. The bill also would \n     make several additional changes to tax law.\n       The staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) \n     estimates that enacting the bill would reduce revenues by \n     about $81.3 billion over the 2014-2024 period. A small \n     portion of those estimated reductions in revenues, less than \n     $0.1 billion over the period from 2014 to 2024, results from \n     off-budget (social security) revenues. CBO and JCT also \n     estimate that the bill would increase direct spending by $2.8 \n     billion over the 2014-2024 period.\n       On net, JCT and CBO estimate that enacting the bill would \n     increase deficits by about $84.1 billion over the 2014-2024 \n     period. Pay-as-you-go procedures apply because enacting the \n     legislation would affect revenues and direct spending.\n       JCT has determined that the provisions of the bill contain \n     no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in \n     the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA).\n       Estimated cost to the Federal Government: The estimated \n     budgetary impacts of the bill are shown in the following \n     table.\n\n

   Basis of estimate: JCT provided the estimates of all \n     provisions except one dealing with outlays of certain rum \n     excise taxes. The estimates reflect an assumed enactment date \n     of July 1, 2014.\n       Extensions of individual tax provisions: The individual \n     income tax provisions would reduce revenues by $17.0 billion \n     and increase outlays by $0.1 billion over the 2014-2024 \n     period, JCT estimates. Those amounts include, among others, \n     the extension of provisions that allow:\n       Individuals to claim state and local sales taxes as an \n     itemized deduction in lieu of state and local income taxes in \n     calculating their individual income tax liability; JCT \n     estimates that the revenue reduction would total $6.5 billion \n     over the 2014-2024 period.\n       An exclusion from gross income for the discharge of \n     indebtedness on a principal residence; JCT estimates that the \n     revenue reduction would be $5.4 billion over the 2014-2024 \n     period.\n       Individuals to claim the refundable health coverage tax \n     credit, which JCT estimates would reduce revenues by $28 \n     million and increase outlays for refundable tax credits by \n     $106 million over the 2014-2024 period.\n       Extensions of business tax provisions: The business tax \n     provisions would reduce revenues by $50.4 billion over the \n     2014-2024 period, JCT estimates. In addition, CBO estimates \n     that outlays would increase by $0.3 billion over the 2014-\n     2024 period. Those amounts include, among others, provisions \n     that allow:\n       Businesses to qualify for both additional first-year \n     depreciation of 50 percent of the basis for qualifying \n     property and additional expensing (that is, immediate \n     deduction from taxable income) for qualifying property under \n     section 179 of the Internal Revenue Code. JCT estimates that \n     those provisions would reduce revenues by $101.8 billion over \n     the 2014-2015 period, and increase revenues by $95.7 billion \n     over the 2016-2024 period, with the net effect of reducing \n     revenues by $6.0 billion over the 2014-2024 period.\n       Businesses to claim the research tax credit, which JCT \n     estimates would reduce revenues by $16.0 billion over the \n     2014-2024 period. The provision would extend the credit in \n     effect in 2013 in modified form.\n       Certain foreign subsidiaries that engage in banking, \n     financial, and related businesses to defer taxation of \n     certain income until it is repatriated to the U.S. parent \n     corporation; JCT estimates that the provision would reduce \n     revenues by $10.4 billion over the 2014-2024 period.\n       The Treasuries of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands to \n     receive increased payments relating to excise taxes on rum \n     manufactured in those places as well as rum imported from \n     other countries. CBO estimates that those payments, which are \n     recorded in the budget as outlays, would total $336 million \n     over the 2014-2024 period.\n       Extensions of energy tax provisions: The extension of the \n     energy tax provisions would lower revenues by about $19.6 \n     billion over the 2014-2024 period. The provision with the \n     largest effect on revenues--reducing them by an estimated \n     $13.3 billion over the 2014-2024 period--would extend to the \n     end of 2015, the date by which construction must begin in \n     order for renewable power facilities to be eligible for the \n     electricity production credit or the investment credit in \n     lieu of the production credit.\n       Debt collection contracts: The bill would require the \n     Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to contract with private \n     collection agencies to collect payments of certain tax \n     liabilities. JCT estimates that the provision would increase \n     revenues by $4.8 billion over the period from 2014 to 2024. \n     The IRS would retain up to 25 percent of the amount collected \n     by the private collection agencies to pay for the services of \n     those collection agencies. In addition, up to an additional \n     25 percent would be retained by the IRS to fund a program of \n     personnel hiring and training related to tax compliance, and \n     to administer the contracts with private collection agencies. \n     As a result, direct spending would increase by $2.4 billion \n     over the 2014-2024 period.\n       Other provisions: JCT estimates that the remaining \n     provisions in the bill would increase revenues by $1.0 \n     billion over the 2014-2024 period. The provision with the \n     largest effect on revenues would allow the Treasury \n     Department to levy up to 100 percent of a payment to a \n     Medicare provider to collect unpaid taxes; JCT estimates that \n     the provision would increase revenues by $0.8 billion over \n     the 2014-2024 period. JCT also estimates that a provision \n     that would apply penalties to tax preparers who fail to \n     exercise certain due diligence requirements for claims of the \n     refundable child tax credit would reduce outlays for \n     refundable tax credits by $40 million over the 2014-2024 \n     period.\n       Pay-as-you-go considerations: The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go \n     Act of 2010 establishes budget-reporting and enforcement \n     procedures for legislation affecting direct spending or \n     revenues. The net changes in revenues and outlays that are \n     subject to those pay-as-you-go procedures are shown in the \n     following table. Only on-budget changes to outlays or \n     revenues are subject to pay-as-you-go procedures.\n\n       CBO ESTIMATE OF PAY-AS-YOU-GO EFFECTS FOR THE EXPIRING PROVISIONS IMPROVEMENT AND EFFICIENCY (EXPIRE) ACT, AS ORDERED REPORTED BY THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON FINANCE ON APRIL 3, 2014\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                    By fiscal year, in millions of dollars--\n                                              --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                  2014        2015         2016        2017       2018       2019       2020       2021       2022       2023       2024    2014-2019  2014-2024\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                      NET INCREASE OR DECREASE (-) IN THE ON-BUDGET DEFICIT\n \nStatutory Pay-As-You-Go Effects..............     24,959      112,872       16,007    -31,824    -13,332     -7,137     -2,143        153      1,875      2,388     88,921     84,058\nMemorandum:\n    Changes in Revenues......................    -24,797     -112,587      -15,753     32,045     19,994     13,574      7,390      2,408        125     -1,583     -2,083    -87,526    -81,272\n    Changes in Outlays.......................        162          285          254        221        231        242        253        265        278        292        305      1,395     2,786\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSources: Congressional Budget Office and staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation.\n\n       Intergovernmental and private-sector impact: JCT has \n     determined that the provisions of the EXPIRE Act contain no \n     intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in \n     UMRA.\n       Estimate prepared by: Federal Revenues: Barbara Edwards and \n     staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation Federal Spending: \n     Matthew Pickford\n       Estimate approved by: David Weiner, Assistant Director for \n     Tax Analysis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/30/senate-section/article/S2560-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2560]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO GABRIELLE BATKIN\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Gabrielle Batkin \non the occasion of her becoming the staff director of the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Gabrielle has a long career in public service. She served in Senator \nFrank Lautenburg's office, in Congressman Pallone's office, on the \nSenate Budget Committee, and joined my office in 2001. Gabrielle \nstarted on the Appropriations Committee's Veterans Affairs and Housing \nand Urban Development Subcommittee, then moved to the Commerce, \nJustice, and Science Subcommittee, eventually becoming the clerk of the \nsubcommittee. For the last year she has been the deputy director of the \nAppropriations Committee.\n  Gabby has played a part in some of my biggest achievements, including \nthe most recent passage of the Appropriations Omnibus Package for \nFiscal Year 2014. Her expertise and service ensured that America was \nwell-funded and ready to get back to work after sequester and shutdown.\n  Throughout these wonderful 13 years, Gabrielle has been an invaluable \nmember of my staff. Not only has she helped me immensely in my work as \na U.S. Senator, but she has served the people of Maryland with \ndistinction. Today I want to thank Gabrielle, her husband Josh, and her \nthree wonderful children Henry, Will, and Charlie, for sharing her with \nus. I want to recognize her for all of the important work she has done \nand wish her the very best as she embarks on the next stage in her \ncareer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/30/senate-section/article/S2560-2", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2560-S2561]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        COMBATING GLOBAL HUNGER\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I would like to discuss global \nhunger. From April 28 to May 2, people across the United States and \nacross the globe are participating in the Live Below the Line campaign \nto raise awareness for global hunger and to show support for the \ncritical programs that seek to alleviate hunger. Participants in the \nLive Below the Line campaign, including many of my constituents in \nMaryland, are subsisting on $1.50 a day to demonstrate the challenges \nfaced by millions of people each day. Right now, more than 1.2 billion \npeople involuntarily live on less than $1.50 a day for food and drink.\n  Children are particularly vulnerable to hunger and undernourishment. \nStudies show a child's entire life is shaped by whether or not she or \nhe receives proper nutrition during the first 1,000 days of her or his \nlife. And tragically, 3.1 million children under the age of 5 die each \nyear as a result of poor nutrition and hunger.\n  When we think of global hunger, we often think of Sub-Saharan Africa \nwhere 223 million people, 24.8 percent of the population, face food \ninsecurity. Or we think of Asia, where more than 500\n\n[[Page S2561]]\n\nmillion people suffer from hunger. In Laos, for example, 50 percent of \nchildren under the age of 5 are chronically malnourished. And in Burma, \nit is estimated that about 35 percent of children are undernourished \nand stunted.\n  But hunger is not just a problem for developing countries. Families \nacross America and in my home State of Maryland are also struggling. \nAccording to the latest U.S. department of Agriculture report on \nHousehold Food Security in the United States, 12.5 percent of all \nhouseholds in Maryland were food insecure between 2009 and 2011, and \nmore than 27 percent of children in Maryland are living in poverty.\n  Proper nutrition is not just important to individual health, it is \ncritical to the long-term health and success of nations. Poor nutrition \nand rampant hunger results in a less healthy and less productive \nworkforce, hampers economic development and growth, and ultimately \nperpetuates the cycle of hunger and poverty for successive generations. \nIt should not be that way; every child should have the opportunity to \ngrow up healthy and strong.\n  Thanks to organizations like the World Food Program USA and the \nUnited Nations World Food Program, who together work to solve global \nhunger, the number of hungry people in the world has fallen by 17 \npercent since 1990. And in 2013, the World Food Program provided 24 \nmillion school children in 60 different countries with meals at school. \nThis not only reduces undernourishment and hunger, but also \nincentivizes school attendance. We need more programs like this, and we \nneed more people to be aware of this issue, both here in the United \nStates and abroad.\n  With the world population expected to increase to 9 billion by 2050, \ntransforming how people farm and what people eat is the only way, I \nbelieve, to ensure food security for future generations.\n  We are making great strides in global food security, particularly \nthrough the U.S. Feed The Future Initiative, which focuses on building \nsustainability and resilience into communities by transforming how \npeople farm and what people eat.\n  In 2009, then-Secretary of State Clinton said,\n\n       We have the resources to give every person in the world the \n     tools they need to feed themselves and their children. So the \n     question is not whether we can end hunger. It's whether we \n     will.\n\n  Ending global hunger and poverty will not happen tomorrow, but if we \ncontinue to coordinate with our global partners, harness the power of \nthe private sector and the NGO community, and use our development aid \nin the most effective and transparent way possible, we will have much \nbetter outcomes. The United States must be relentless in striving to \nassure that no one goes hungry.\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO TONY ZEISS\n\n Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize a friend \nof education, a passionate champion for job creation and innovation, \nand a truly outstanding leader from North Carolina.\n  Dr. Tony Zeiss has served as the president of Central Piedmont \nCommunity College in Charlotte, NC, since 1992. CPCC is an institution \nfamiliar to many of my colleagues in this body. In January 2012, during \nhis State of the Union Address, the President held up the partnership \nbetween CPCC and Siemens Energy as a model of customized training for \nworkforce development. Central Piedmont Community College was also \nselected as the 2002 Community College of the Year by the National \nAlliance of Business.\n  The community college's success is due, in large part, to Dr. Zeiss's \nleadership and commitment to fostering innovation in workforce and \ncareer development.\n  Dr. Zeiss is a native of Indiana and a proud alumnus of Indiana State \nUniversity, where he earned his bachelor's and master's degrees. He \nreceived his doctorate degree in community college administration from \nNova Southeastern University.\n  Dr. Zeiss is passionate about his adopted home State of North \nCarolina and the importance of making a difference in his community. He \nhas served on several local, regional, and national boards. He is the \npast chair of the board of the American Association of Community \nColleges, past board chair for the League for Innovation, and was the \nAssociation of Community College Trustees' National Chief Executive \nOfficer of the year for 2004-2005.\n  While it is evident he is deeply engaged in his community, the true \nsources of strength for Dr. Zeiss are his wife Beth, his two sons, his \ndaughter-in-law, and his two grandchildren.\n  One of the first opportunities Dr. Zeiss sought out when he arrived \nin North Carolina was participation in Leadership North Carolina, a \nnonprofit organization that engages current and emerging leaders from \nacross the State through ongoing networking and service opportunities. \nIn 1995, Dr. Zeiss graduated from Leadership North Carolina as an \nalumnus of Class I. In 2005, the LNC board of directors recognized his \ncontributions to the State by presenting him with the L. Richardson \nPreyer Alumni Award, presented annually to an LNC alumnus whose \ndemonstrated leadership has made a significant improvement in the \nquality of life, economic well-being, and/or sense of community in our \nState.\n  Elected as chair of Leadership North Carolina in 2012, Dr. Zeiss has \nbrought his considerable leadership experience and passion as an \nalumnus to strengthen the organization during his 2-year tenure. His \nwork has positioned the program for sustainability for years to come \nand strengthened its reputation among leaders in business, government, \neducation, and the nonprofit sector. The measure of a good leader is \nthe legacy he or she leaves behind. Dr. Tony Zeiss leaves North \nCarolina with 950 informed and engaged leaders and has challenged them \nto leverage their influence for the benefit of our State and Nation.\n  On June 30 of this year, Dr. Tony Zeiss will complete his tenure as \nchair of the Leadership North Carolina board of directors. We need \nstrong, effective, visionary leaders now more than ever. Dr. Zeiss's \nservice to Leadership North Carolina has been focused on promoting the \nLNC program and soliciting financial support for its sustainability and \ngrowth, all while engaging, challenging, and informing future leaders. \nI join the board of directors of Leadership North Carolina in \nrecognizing Dr. Zeiss for his leadership, vision, and determination.\n  As a fellow parent and grandparent, I am grateful for the example Dr. \nZeiss has set for young people and the opportunities he has provided \nthrough the gifts of education and leadership. He is the embodiment of \nour State's motto, Esse Quam Videri, to be rather than to seem, and I \nask all my colleagues to join me in thanking Dr. Tony Zeiss for his \nservice to North Carolina.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/30/senate-section/article/S2561-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2561-S2562]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          FREMONT COUNTY, IOWA\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the strength of my State of Iowa \nlies in its vibrant local communities, where citizens come together to \nfoster economic development, make smart investments to expand \nopportunity, and take the initiative to improve the health and well-\nbeing of residents. Over the decades, I have witnessed the growth and \nrevitalization of so many communities across my State, and it has been \ndeeply gratifying to see how my work in Congress has supported these \nlocal efforts.\n  I have always believed in accountability for public officials, and \nthis, my final year in the Senate, is an appropriate time to give an \naccounting of my work across four decades representing Iowa in \nCongress. I take pride in accomplishments that have been national in \nscope--for instance, passing the Americans with Disabilities Act and \nspearheading successful farm bills. But I take a very special pride in \nprojects that have made a big difference in local communities across my \nState.\n  Today, I would like to give an accounting of my work with leaders and \nresidents of Fremont County to build a legacy of a stronger local \neconomy, better schools and educational opportunities and a healthier, \nsafer community\n  Between 2001 and 2013, the creative leadership in your community has \nworked with me to secure funding in Fremont County worth over $155,000 \nand successfully acquired financial assistance from programs I have \nfought\n\n[[Page S2562]]\n\nhard to support, which have provided more than $4.4 million to the \nlocal economy.\n  Of course my favorite memory of working together has to be Fremont \nCounty's excellent work to secure funding for firefighting equipment \nthrough Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, fire grants. I look \nforward to seeing how Fremont County has implemented this important \nfunding in their community.\n  Among the highlights:\n  Keeping Iowa communities safe: I also firmly believe that our first \nresponders need to be appropriately trained and equipped, able to \nrespond to both local emergencies and to statewide challenges such as--\nfor instance, the methamphetamine epidemic. Since 2001, Fremont \nCounty's fire departments have received over $896,975 for firefighter \nsafety and operations equipment.\n  Investing in Iowa's economic development through targeted community \nprojects: In Southeast Iowa, we have worked together to grow the \neconomy by making targeted investments in important economic \ndevelopment projects including improved roads and bridges, modernized \nsewer and water systems, and better housing options for residents of \nFremont County. In many cases, I have secured Federal funding that has \nleveraged local investments and served as a catalyst for a whole ripple \neffect of positive, creative changes. I have fought for funding for \naffordable housing programs through the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, which local economic development officials have \nsuccessfully won over many years, securing over $475,000 and helping to \ncreate jobs and expand economic opportunities in Fremont County.\n  School grants: Every child in Iowa deserves to be educated in a \nclassroom that is safe, accessible, and modern. That is why, for the \npast decade and a half, I have secured funding for the innovative Iowa \nDemonstration Construction Grant Program--better known among educators \nin Iowa as Harkin Grants for public schools construction and \nrenovation. Across 15 years, Harkin grants worth more than $132 million \nhave helped school districts to fund a range of renovation and repair \nefforts--everything from updating fire safety systems to building new \nschools. In many cases, these Federal dollars have served as the needed \nincentive to leverage local public and private dollars, so it often has \na tremendous multiplier effect within a school district. Over the \nyears, Fremont County has received $150,000 in Harkin grants. \nSimilarly, schools in Fremont County have received funds that I \ndesignated for Iowa Star Schools for technology totaling $47,400.\n  Agricultural and rural development: Because I grew up in a small town \nin rural Iowa, I have always been a loyal friend and fierce advocate \nfor family farmers and rural communities. I have been a member of the \nHouse or Senate Agriculture Committee for 40 years--including more than \n10 years as chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. Across the \ndecades, I have championed farm policies for Iowans that include \neffective farm income protection and commodity programs; strong, \nprogressive conservation assistance for agricultural producers; \nrenewable energy opportunities; and robust economic development in our \nrural communities. Since 1991, through various programs authorized \nthrough the farm bill, Fremont County has received more than $2.6 \nmillion from a variety of farm bill programs.\n  Disability rights: Growing up, I loved and admired my brother Frank, \nwho was deaf. But I was deeply disturbed by the discrimination and \nobstacles he faced every day. That is why I have always been a \npassionate advocate for full equality for people with disabilities. As \nthe primary author of the Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA, and the \nADA Amendments Act, I have had four guiding goals for our fellow \ncitizens with disabilities: equal opportunity, full participation, \nindependent living and economic self-sufficiency. Nearly a quarter \ncentury since passage of the ADA, I see remarkable changes in \ncommunities everywhere I go in Iowa--not just in curb cuts or closed-\ncaptioned television but in the full participation of people with \ndisabilities in our society and economy, folks who at long last have \nthe opportunity to contribute their talents and to be fully included. \nThese changes have increased economic opportunities for all citizens of \nFremont County, both those with and without disabilities, and they make \nus proud to be a part of a community and country that respects the \nworth and civil rights of all of our citizens.\n  This is at least a partial accounting of my work on behalf of Iowa, \nand specifically Fremont County, during my time in Congress. In every \ncase, this work has been about partnerships, cooperation, and \nempowering folks at the State and local level, including in Fremont \nCounty, to fulfill their own dreams and initiatives, and, of course, \nthis work is never complete. Even after I retire from the Senate, I \nhave no intention of retiring from the fight for a better, fairer, \nricher Iowa, and I will always be profoundly grateful for the \nopportunity to serve the people of Iowa as their Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/30/senate-section/article/S2562-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2562-S2563]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SHELBY COUNTY, IOWA\n\n  Mr. HARKIN.

But I take a very special pride in \nprojects that have made a big difference in local communities across my \nState.\n  Today, I would like to give an accounting of my work with leaders and \nresidents of Shelby County to build a legacy of a stronger local \neconomy, better schools and educational opportunities, and a healthier, \nsafer community.\n  Between 2001 and 2013, the creative leadership in your community has \nworked with me to secure funding in Shelby County worth over $544,000 \nand successfully acquired financial assistance from programs I have \nfought hard to support, which have provided more than $8.4 million to \nthe local economy.\n  Of course my favorite memory of working together has to be early in \nmy career when I helped Elk Horn to cut through the bureaucratic red \ntape holding its historical Danish windmill at customs in New York due \nto import levies. I also worked with community leaders to see that they \nreceived a refund of that levy. Soon after, I spent one of my work days \nhelping the people of the community to rebuild it as a bicentennial \nproject. The windmill stood on Danish soil for 127 years before it was \npurchased by the Elk Horn community. I am pleased that my state staff \ndirector, Rob Barron, will be revisiting this site exactly 38 years \nafter my workday on May 1, 1976.\n  Among the highlights:\n  School grants: Every child in Iowa deserves to be educated in a \nclassroom that is safe, accessible, and modern. That is why, for the \npast decade and a half, I have secured funding for the innovative Iowa \nDemonstration Construction Grant Program--better known among educators \nin Iowa as Harkin Grants--for public schools construction and \nrenovation.

Over the \nyears, Shelby County has received $391,730 in Harkin Grants. Similarly, \nschools in Shelby County have received funds that I designated for Iowa \nStar Schools for technology totaling $20,000.\n  Agricultural and rural development: Because I grew up in a small town \nin\n\n[[Page S2563]]\n\nrural Iowa, I have always been a loyal friend and fierce advocate for \nfamily farmers and rural communities. I have been a member of the House \nor Senate Agriculture Committee for 40 years--including more than 10 \nyears as chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. Across the \ndecades, I have championed farm policies for Iowans that include \neffective farm income protection and commodity programs; strong, \nprogressive conservation assistance for agricultural producers; \nrenewable energy opportunities; and robust economic development in our \nrural communities. Since 1991, through various programs authorized \nthrough the farm bill, Shelby County has received more than $2.1 \nmillion from a variety of farm bill programs.\n  Wellness and health care: Improving the health and wellness of all \nAmericans has been something I have been passionate about for decades. \nThat is why I fought to dramatically increase funding for disease \nprevention, innovative medical research, and a whole range of \ninitiatives to improve the health of individuals and families not only \nat the doctor's office but also in our communities, schools, and \nworkplaces. I am so proud that Americans have better access to clinical \npreventive services, nutritious food, smoke-free environments, safe \nplaces to engage in physical activity, and information to make healthy \ndecisions for themselves and their families. These efforts not only \nsave lives, they will also save money for generations to come thanks to \nthe prevention of costly chronic diseases, which account for a whopping \n75 percent of annual health care costs. I am pleased that with the help \nof community leaders like Sheri Bowen with the public health \ndepartment, Shelby County has recognized this important issue by \nsecuring $162,500 for wellness grants and through direct appropriations \nfor mental health services for distressed farmers.\n  Disability rights: Growing up, I loved and admired my brother Frank, \nwho was deaf.

Mr. President, today I wish to honor Mr. David \nJensen, a native of Lemmon, SD, for being awarded the Office of the \nSecretary of the Department of Defense Medal for Valor. The Medal for \nValor is the highest civilian award for valor, and David received this \nhonor for his actions while deployed in Afghanistan on September 10, \n2012. He was recognized for his bravery in an awards ceremony at the \nPentagon's Hall of Heroes on April 14, 2014.\n  David served in the 75th Ranger Regiment and the U.S. Army Special \nOperations Command before he was honorably discharged. He is now a \nspecial operations task force advisor at Fort Bragg, NC, working for \nthe Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization.\n  David has also worked as a contractor for Wexford Group Inc., serving \nwith the U.S. Army Asymmetric Warfare Group. In 2012, David was \ndeployed to Afghanistan as an operational adviser for the Asymmetric \nWarfare Group alongside Company C, 2nd Battalion, 505th Parachute \nInfantry Regiment, 82nd Airborne Division. On September 10, 2012, David \nand Company C were set to fly out of Bagram Airfield with Afghan \nNational Security Forces to conduct a partnered air assault operation \nin Parwan Province. During preflight operations, however, one of the \nCH-47 Chinook helicopters was struck by an enemy rocket, igniting the \nfuel tanks of the aircraft. Despite the high risk of danger and \npersonal harm, David immediately began evacuating wounded soldiers from \nthe burning aircraft, making several trips before the flames overcame \nthe entire aircraft. After evacuating four wounded soldiers from the \nwreckage, David promptly began administering medical attention to the \ninjured. A humble man, David has said that he merely reacted, doing \nwhat needed to be done.\n  David Jensen is most deserving of the Medal for Valor for his \nexemplary bravery in the face of danger and putting the concerns of \nothers before his own. His selfless acts saved the lives of his\n\n[[Page S2564]]\n\ncolleagues, and our Nation will always be grateful for his dedicated \nservice. As thankful citizens, we must never take for granted the \ncourage of heroes like David who selflessly answer the call to \nduty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/30/senate-section/article/S2564-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JOSE ELGUEZABAL\n\n Mr. WALSH. Mr. President, I wish to honor Jose Elguezabal, a \nveteran of the U.S. Army.\n  It is my honor to share the story of Jose's service, because no \nveteran's story should ever go unrecognized.\n  Jose was born in Eagle Pass, TX, and served our Nation during World \nWar II. Unfortunately, most of the records of his service were \ndestroyed in the fire at the National Personnel Records Center in 1973.\n  Jose told his daughter Anna how his platoon came under fire, killing \nevery member but Jose. Jose was captured by enemy forces and spent 6 \nmonths as a prisoner of war in France.\n  When Jose returned home, he and his wife of 63 years had 10 \nchildren--9 girls and 1 boy. His children said he was a great father \nand a true patriot who flew an American flag and a Prisoner of War flag \noutside of his house every day until he passed away.\n  His family pieced Jose's military service record together to finally \ntrack down the medals Jose earned through his service.\n  We were joined by Jose's daughter Anna and her husband John, who \nrecently retired after spending 40 years serving Malmstrom Air Force \nBase as a firefighter.\n  It was my honor, along with the commanding officer at Malmstrom Air \nForce Base, Col.

But these \ndecorations are also powerful reminders that we should never let a \nveteran's service go forgotten.\n  These medals were presented on behalf of a grateful nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/30/senate-section/article/S2564-2", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO JOHN ROBERT VIERECK\n\n Mr. WALSH. Mr. President, I wish to honor John Robert Viereck, \na U.S. Army veteran from World War II.\n  It is my honor to share the story of John's service, because no \nveteran's story should ever go unrecognized.\n  John was born in Wilmington, CA, in 1924.\n  John's father loved the sea and encouraged his son to join the \nMerchant Marines. John joined up but was so seasick after his first \ntrip that his career in the Merchant Marines came to an end.\n  On July 8, 1942, John enlisted in the U.S. Army.\n  John was a radioman and cryptographer for the Big Red One--the Army's \nFirst Infantry Division, Antitank Company, 26th Infantry Regiment.\n  He served in Algeria, Tunisia, Sicily, England, France, Belgium, \nGermany, and Czechoslovakia.\n  John served in seven campaigns, including the Battle of the Bulge, \nand spent a total of 31 months in Europe and Africa.\n  When John returned home to the United States in 1943, he was \ndiagnosed with shell shock, something we know today as post-traumatic \nstress disorder.\n  After World War II, John attended the Frank Wiggins Trade School to \nstudy TV and radio. John bought his first TV in the late 1940s and his \ndaughter Fran remembers that from then on the Viereck household always \nhad a TV.\n  John worked as a truck driver in Wilmington, as a taxi driver in \nGardena, and then as a Zamboni operator in Torrance, CA. He was also a \nham radio operator.\n  Weather, politics, war, and the military have been lifelong topics of \ninterest to him.\n  John moved to Helena in 2003 to be closer to his daughter.\n  In the presence of John's family, it was my honor to present to him \nthe Bronze Star Medal with 1 Oak Leaf Cluster; the Good Conduct Medal; \nthe American Campaign Medal; the European-African-Middle Eastern, EAME, \nCampaign Medal, with 4 bronze stars, meaning he served in four of these \ncampaigns; the WW II Victory Medal; and the Honorable Service Lapel \nButton.\n  The medals are a small token but they are a powerful symbol of \nservice and sacrifice.\n  These medals were presented on behalf of a grateful nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/30/senate-section/article/S2564-3", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  At 12:30 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       S. 994.
