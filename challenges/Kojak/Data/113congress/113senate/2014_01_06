I am optimistic, cautiously optimistic, that the new year \nwill bring a renewed spirit of cooperation to this Chamber. It is very \nbadly needed.\n  Last year the Senate passed a number of momentous pieces of \nlegislation, including comprehensive immigration, a budget agreement, \nand a bill to prevent workplace discrimination based on sexual \norientation.\n  There is so much more that needs to be done and there is so much left \nundone. There has been never-ending obstruction during the entire 5 \nyears that President Obama has been President of the United States.\n  Setting that aside for a brief moment, today we will address two \npressing matters held over from last year: the nomination of Janet \nYellen to be head of the Federal Reserve, and extension of unemployment \nbenefits for 1.3 million Americans still struggling to find work. \nInstead of celebrating the beginning of the New Year on January 1, more \nthan 1 million Americans, including 20,000 veterans and about 20,000 \nNevadans, were left wondering how they would feed their families and \nmake their mortgage payments while they continue to look for jobs. \nFrankly, most of these people aren't making mortgage payments; they are \nrenting. They are trying to make ends meet from month to month.\n\n[[Page S4]]\n\n  Today there is only one job opening for every three people searching. \nWe have never had so many unemployed for such a long period of time.\n  The long-term unemployment rate is twice as high as it was any other \ntime we have allowed emergency unemployment benefits to end. It will be \ncatastrophic for this to happen for men and women, boys and girls.\n  What is more, failing to extend unemployment insurance won't only be \na hardship for hard-working Americans, it will be a drag on our \neconomy. Allowing this important lifeline to lapse will cost 240,000 \njobs.\n  These people who are drawing unemployment benefits are just getting \nby. They have to buy groceries, maybe at 7-Eleven. Sometimes they go to \na regular store. They have to buy gas for their vehicles. They have to \nbuy bus tickets to get across town to look for a job. A multitude of \nother things they need are going to be eliminated. That will cost \nalmost a quarter of a million jobs.\n  By contrast, helping Americans while they search for full-time \nunemployment is one of the most efficient ways to support economic \ngrowth. Each dollar we spend on unemployment insurance benefits \nincreases the gross domestic product by $1.50. According to leading \neconomists--including Mark Zandi, John McCain's chief economic adviser \nwhen he ran for President--they agree that every dollar we spend brings \nback $1.50 to our gross domestic product.\n  In 2012 alone, 500,000 children were kept out of poverty by \nunemployment benefits. That is one reason it is outrageous that \nCongress allowed this program--which helps tens of millions of American \nfamilies with millions of children get by each year--to lapse in \nDecember is unconscionable. Today the Senate has a chance to correct \nthis terrible omission.\n  Just before Christmas my colleague from Nevada, a Republican, Dean \nHeller, joined with the senior Senator from Rhode Island, Jack Reed, a \nDemocrat, to propose an extension of unemployment insurance for 1.3 \nmillion Americans who lost benefits this past week. I commend these two \nSenators for their compassionate stance on this issue. The Senate will \nvote on moving forward on this Reed-Heller bill this evening. I hope a \nfew reasonable and empathetic Republicans will join my colleague from \nNevada Mr. Heller and help us advance this bill today.\n  Passing this measure is one of the best things we can do for our \neconomy, and it is cost-effective. It is cost-effective in so many \ndifferent ways, but it is cost-effective to immediately address the \nworst consequences of growing income inequality in this Nation.\n  Another way to raise millions of Americans out of poverty is to \nincrease the minimum wage and make it a living wage. People can work \ntwo jobs, work so hard--80 hours a week, and some are working over 100 \nhours a week--just to make ends meet. They work minimum-wage jobs. \nMinimum-wage jobs are not living-wage jobs. We are seeing this change \nall over the country. In the State of Washington, there is one \ncommunity that has raised it to $15 an hour.\n  We have to do more to help people who are willing to work. We want \nthem to make a living wage. The reason that is so very important is \nthat it is believed--it is not believed, polling will indicate this--\nthat two-thirds of small businesses want the minimum wage to be \nincreased. Why? Because it helps them grow their businesses.\n  When a mother or a father working two or three jobs still can't \nafford groceries and rent the same month, it is a sign that something \nis wrong in this country.\n  Last year the top 1 percent, the very rich, took home so much money \nthat it broke a 1928 record percentagewise. In the last 30 years the \nincome of the top 1 percent has increased by 300 percent 3 times. But \nwhat has happened in that same 30 years to middle-income Americans and \nthe middle class? Their income has dropped by 10 percent--300 percent \nminus 10 percent. That is not good.\n  Wages for middle-class families have actually fallen, as I have \nindicated. They have fallen by almost 10 percent while the cost of \nhousing, food, and gas has gone up. The rich keep getting richer, the \npoor keep getting poorer, and the middle class is under siege.\n  This country can't afford to allow the gap between the fabulously \nwealthy and those who are barely getting by--to keep their incomes \ngoing up, the middle class going down, and the poor getting poorer. \nThat is why Democrats this year will renew our efforts to address \npoverty and economic disparities.\n  I congratulate wealthy Americans on their good fortune. I think it is \ntremendous that we are a country of opportunity where people could make \nmoney. But we also believe it is time for the middle class to share in \nthe success of economic recovery.\n  (Mr. Murphy assumed the Chair.)\n  The Presiding Officer has spent a great deal of time on the Senate \nfloor trying to bring to the attention of the American people what is \ngoing on in the Republican-dominated Congress. The Presiding Officer \nhasn't come to the floor and berated Republicans about the fact that 90 \npercent of the American people believe that if a person has mental \ndisabilities, severe mental problems or is a criminal, that they \nshouldn't be able to buy a gun without a background check. Ninety \npercent of the American people agree with the Presiding Officer.\n  Members of Congress, or Republicans, disagree, but it is the same on \nthe other two issues I have talked about--minimum wage. The vast \nmajority of Americans agree with this, Democrats, Independents, and \neven Republicans. Unemployment insurance is the same. But in Congress, \nthey disagree with the American people as it relates to background \nchecks. They disagree with the American people as it relates to minimum \nwage. They disagree with the American people as it relates to the \nunemployment insurance extension.\n  They cannot get off the tune they have been singing for such a long \ntime: ObamaCare, ObamaCare, ObamaCare. As we speak, the American people \nare so much better off because of ObamaCare. If they have a disability, \nthey cannot be denied health insurance coverage. Children stay on their \nparents' insurance until they are 26. Seniors get wellness checks, Pap \nsmears, mammograms. Many people could never afford that. The doughnut \nhole for prescription drugs is being closed. Your insurance can't be \nterminated because someone is hurt and the bill is big. They can't do \nthat anymore. But Republicans can't get off trying to repeal ObamaCare.\n  ObamaCare is here to stay. As we speak, there are 9 million people \nwho have insurance who didn't have it before. We have about 2.5 million \npeople who have gotten insurance on the Web, including the 14 exchanges \nof various States, including Nevada.\n  We have 3 million people who have insurance now because they are on \ntheir parents' insurance and can stay there until they are 26. Three \nmillion Americans have that because of ObamaCare, and there are about 3 \nmillion Americans who are so poor they now qualify for Medicaid. That \nis 9 million people who didn't have insurance before.\n\n  But what is the first thing the House of Representatives is doing? \nThey are going to vote on ObamaCare. They voted to repeal it at least \n45 times, which didn't work. We now have one Senator from Wisconsin who \nis filing a lawsuit today, and he is boasting about this lawsuit: It is \na great deal. It would take away the health insurance of the people \nworking in this body--all of these people, plus all of our staffs who \naren't here in this building.\n  Here is what longtime Republican House Member Jim Sensenbrenner from \nWisconsin--with whom I and the Presiding Officer had the good fortune \nto serve in the House of Representatives--said:\n\n       ``Senator Johnson's lawsuit is an unfortunate political \n     stunt. I am committed to repealing ObamaCare, but the \n     employer contribution he's attacking is nothing more than a \n     standard benefit that most private and all federal employees \n     receive--including the President, Sensenbrenner said.\n       ``uccess in the suit will mean that Congress will lose some \n     of its best staff and will be staffed primarily by recent \n     college graduates who are still on their parents' \n     insurance.''\n       Sensenbrenner is a longtime House Member and former \n     chairman of the Judiciary Committee. He is expressing \n     concerns that were shared publicly and privately by many \n     lawmakers and senior aides about the possible ``brain drain'' \n     from taking away the employer contribution. Several \n     Republicans, led by Sen. David Vitter of Louisiana, have\n\n[[Page S5]]\n\n     floated legislative proposals that would accomplish the same \n     goal as the Johnson lawsuit.\n\n  Sensenbrenner went on to say:\n\n       ``Senator Johnson should spend his time legislating rather \n     than litigating as our country is facing big problems that \n     must be addressed by Congress--not the courts. All \n     Republicans want to repeal ObamaCare, but this politically \n     motivated lawsuit only takes public attention away from how \n     bad all of ObamaCare really is and focuses it on a trivial \n     issue. Fortunately, Senator Johnson's suit is likely \n     frivolous and will not achieve the result he's seeking.''\n\n  As I stated in my remarks today, we have been able to get a few \nthings done, but we have been unable to get so many important things \ndone because the goal for the last 5 years by the Republicans in the \nCongress--not Republicans in the country but Republicans in the \nCongress--has been to do everything they could to make President Obama \nlook bad. Remember, my counterpart said his No. 1 goal in the last \nCongress was to do everything he could to defeat Obama from being \nreelected. Well, he was elected overwhelmingly, so that was a futile \neffort.\n  We need to get back to working together, as we have always done--\nuntil this effort which has been made to disparage and damage in any \nway they can the President of the United States and, in the process, \nour country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if I may take one moment while the \ndistinguished leader is here.\n  I wish to commend Senator Reid for his cooperation. He has worked \nvery hard to bring this together. We had a very complex and very \nextensive immigration bill, with 300 amendments filed in the Judiciary \nCommittee. After it went through the committee, Senator Reid worked \nhard to get time on the floor and then we passed it with an \noverwhelming bipartisan majority.\n  Mr. REID. Would my friend yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Of course.\n  Mr. REID. Through the Chair to my friend, the President pro tempore \nof the Senate, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, we hear the \nRepublicans talking that they want to do everything they can to reduce \nthe debt. I ask my friend, twofold: No. 1, the bible for how to reduce \nthe debt was Bowles-Simpson. They set a goal of $4 trillion. Right now \nwe are almost at $3 trillion. We have cut spending to reduce the debt \nby almost $3 trillion.\n  Does my friend acknowledge that, by passing the bill reported out of \nthe Judiciary Committee, it would reduce the debt by another $1 \ntrillion; we would basically reach the goal of Bowles-Simpson if they \nwould just pass immigration reform?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, addressing the majority leader through the \nChair, I would note that even Grover Norquist, who is sort of the guru \nof many of the Republicans, testified before the Judiciary Committee \nthat passing this bill and putting it into law would add nearly $1 \ntrillion or more to the economy. All sorts of business leaders came in \nand said this would add to our economy. It is one of those rare cases \nwhere the AFL-CIO and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce came together \nbecause it would dramatically improve the economy, dramatically improve \nthe wages of people, and it would lower the deficit. It is a no-\nbrainer. That is why we came together in the Senate. With the \nleadership of the distinguished Senator from Nevada and others, \nRepublicans and Democrats, we came together and we passed it.\n  They should take it up. If they want to make some changes, do so. I \nam ready to go to conference on it at a moment's notice so we can get \nthis bill passed and on the President's desk.\n  We have shown we could do it before. We did it with the Violence \nAgainst Women Act, which they at first refused to take up in the House. \nEven the White House was backing off some of the parts we added to it \nhere because they were afraid it might not go through. But Senator \nCrapo and I stuck together. A bipartisan group in the House stuck \ntogether, and they passed it in the House. We passed it, and it went \ninto law. We added sexual trafficking. It is a good bill.\n  We can do it, if people want to. But if we take the position that we \ncannot do anything, that we just want to be naysayers and nihilistic \nabout government, then, of course, we don't do anything. But here is a \nway to get the economy going. Here is a way to improve our Nation.\n  Frankly, I just wanted to stand and compliment the distinguished \nmajority leader for speaking of what we can do, and I hope we do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/06/senate-section/article/S5-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 1845, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 265, S. 1846, a bill to \n     provide for the extension of certain unemployment benefits, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, Senators are \npermitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to vote \nin favor of the Reed-Heller bill, which would extend unemployment \ninsurance for 1.3 million Americans--very critical--for 3 months, \nbecause it is the right thing to do for these workers, and it is the \nsmart thing to do for our economy.\n  Unemployment insurance has been around since the 1930s, and it has \nhistorically received bipartisan support. Indeed, I am pleased that \nSenator Heller has joined me. So this is a bipartisan bill, also. This \nis something we have to deal with today. It is a huge crisis. As I \nsaid, 1.3 million Americans have lost their benefits as of December 28. \nBut we can expect through this next year approximately 3 million more \nto exhaust their State benefits--typically 26 weeks--and not have this \nFederal long-term benefit available to them.\n  This has always received support on a bipartisan basis because it is \nnot a red State and blue State issue. It is something which impacts \nthis entire country. It impacts people who work. You cannot get this \nprogram unless you have a job and, through no fault of your own, you \nhave lost that job. In this economy, people who lose jobs are competing \nwith many others for very few jobs.\n  These 1.3 million Americans were pushed off an economic cliff just 9 \ndays ago. This vital lifeline would help them cope. They were not let \ngo from their jobs because of something they did. It was through no \nfault of their own, and they are searching for work in an economy which \nhas nearly three job seekers for every one job opening.\n  Illustrative of this is a front-page story in the Washington Post \ntoday. In Maryland, they are opening up a new dairy operation, and what \nthis story speaks to is something that is happening across this country \nin so many places:\n\n       When the Good Humor ice cream plant closed here two summers \n     ago, more than 400 jobs and a stable, punch-the-clock way of \n     life melted away, another in a string of plant closings that \n     have battered this once-proud manufacturing town.\n\n  I would add parenthetically that in Connecticut, Rhode Island, west \ncoast, east coast, north and south, we have seen this happen. \nManufacturing plants close, move overseas, and shut down entirely.\n\n       The hulking plant sat vacant until a co-op of Virginia \n     dairy farmers purchased it in summer 2013 to process milk and \n     ice cream, though on a far smaller scale than the 60,000 \n     cases of ice cream that global food giant Unilever churned \n     out every day.\n       Randy Inman, the board president for Shenandoah Family \n     Farms, said he expected the plant's revival to trigger plenty \n     of interest in its three dozen or so initial jobs. What he \n     did not expect: 1,600 applicants and counting--a deluge.\n\n  That is what this economy is about. Skilled people lose jobs through \nplant closures, many of them working for decades, and suddenly they see \na possibility. But it is not one job for one applicant. It is 1,600 \napplicants for about 36 jobs. They are trying--they are trying awfully \nhard. But unless we pass this legislation this evening and begin the \nprocess, we are not trying.\n  On the economic side of the ledger, moving away from the human \ndynamic, the nonpartisan Congressional\n\n[[Page S6]]\n\nBudget Office estimates that failure to renew unemployment insurance \nwill cost the economy 200,000 jobs and sap 0.2 percent of economic \ngrowth by the end of the year. Why? Because these payments go to people \nwho are really desperate. They need this extra cash. It is about $300, \nmaybe $350 a week. They need it to pay rent, to buy groceries, to keep \nthe boiler running in subzero temperatures, to keep their families \ntogether as they look for work. By the way, in order to collect, you \nhave to keep looking for work.\n  So this program is not just fair to people who have worked hard. It \nis smart for our economy. This is one of the best fiscal tools we have \navailable to ensure that we are creating demand, creating additional \njobs. As I indicated, if we do not pass this, if these benefits lapse \nand go away, 200,000 jobs will be lost--at a time when every Member of \nthis body would say one of the most important jobs is to create more \njobs in America. We can do that, but we have to start today on this \nprocedural vote.\n  Our bill is designed to help families who have weathered the toughest \npart of the great recession--2008, 2009, 2010--and many were laid off \nabout 1 year ago. The maximum extended unemployment benefits is 72 \nweeks, which includes, in most cases, 26 weeks of State benefits. So \nthey got through the hardest part of this recession, which suggests to \nme these are good workers. These are people who were struggling and \nworking when unemployment was much higher, and now they need help. I \nbelieve we have to give them that help.\n  We should be working together to create an expanded economy so the \njobs are there, so that when there is a new plant opening it is not \njust 36 jobs and 1,600 applicants, so it is a lot more jobs. In fact, \nwe would like to see it the other way. We would like to see 1,600 jobs \nand 1,600 applicants. We have to do that.\n\n  I have heard from a lot of my colleagues who said they cannot do this \nbecause they need an offset.\n  This has traditionally been emergency spending. It is emergency \nspending up until December 28 because we extended it last year on an \nemergency basis, probably creating on the order of 200,000 jobs--just \nas we will lose 200,000 jobs if we do not extend it--and helping our \neconomy overall. We have to do this.\n  We have tailored this--Senator Heller and I--so that it is just 3 \nmonths, so it provides immediate assistance to unemployed workers. It \nis retroactive, so we will pick up the people who lost their benefits \non December 28. But it also gives the Senate, the appropriate \ncommittees, and the House the ability to think through this program in \nan orderly way, to make changes if necessary, and to look for \nappropriate offsets if it is deemed that those offsets are necessary. \nBut it will in these 3 months ensure that people have something to help \nthem get by while we do our job.\n  By my count, colleagues have voted to move forward on these non-\noffset emergency benefits more than 10 times since 2008. More than ten \ntimes we have taken up this unemployment insurance program and we have \npassed it on an emergency basis without offsets, so this is not a new, \nnovel approach. In fact, what is somewhat new is actually providing \noffsets for this emergency spending.\n  I wouldn't hesitate to say I venture that if we brought up a bill \nthat had huge tax cuts, particularly for the wealthiest corporations \nand individuals, there would be very little discussion on the other \nside that it should be offset, but when we are talking about a program \nthat helps working people, we have to have offsets? Traditionally, we \nhave not done it, and we can have that conversation, but in order to \nhave it appropriately and help these people, we have to move this \nlegislation forward to give us the time to work constructively, \ncollaboratively, and thoughtfully on the program and also on possible \noffsets.\n  We should not be filibustering this measure. We should be passing it \nand then working collegially and cooperatively to improve the program \nif we can and, if we deem it appropriate, to pay for the program.\n  I have heard some of my colleagues say we need offsets. They are very \nvague about what types of offsets. There are some suggestions about \nMedicare, Social Security, or discretionary spending. I do not think \nAmericans, our constituents, would want to see those types of cuts. I \nthink they are relieved, in fact, that through the good work of Senator \nMurray and Congressman Ryan, we have a budget for 2 years and we are \ndoing appropriations bills and we are beginning to provide certainty \nand support for the economy.\n  I do sense, though, that my constituents know there are many people \nout there who are struggling to find a job, who want to work and need a \nlittle help just to get by. That is what we would be doing if we pass \nthese measures this afternoon or begin the process of passing them this \nafternoon.\n  Again, I think if we are going to seriously talk about offsets or \nprogrammatic changes or responding to different dynamics in the \neconomy, it should not be done here on the floor with dueling \namendments or dueling proposals, it should be done through regular \norder in the committee.\n  I offered a 1-year extension that was not offset, and my Republican \ncolleagues objected, and I completely understand the privilege of doing \nthat and the right to do that. One of the arguments was that it should \ngo through committee. This 3-month bill does both. It helps people \nimmediately, and it gives us the time to do our job.\n  A few weeks ago I also came to the floor to address an argument that \nhas been percolating throughout this discussion that somehow this whole \nunemployment insurance program is just being abused, that beneficiaries \nwould rather collect than work. The reality is that I think $300 a week \nor $350 a week is not something for which people would give up good \njobs or allow themselves to be displaced from those jobs just to \ncollect the benefit. I believe Americans really want to work and they \nwant to get back to work as quickly as they can. They want to do the \nwork for which they have been trained. They want to do the work in \nwhich some of them have spent decades investing not just their time but \ntheir whole selves.\n  One of the interesting things about work is that it is not only a \nform of economic remuneration, it is a way we define ourselves. Within \na few minutes of meeting any stranger, I bet one question pops up: What \ndo you do for a living? It is awfully difficult today for millions of \nAmericans to say: I am just looking desperately for a job. But millions \nare.\n  I discussed earlier that there is academic research out there that \nhas been bandied about suggesting that, no, this is a ruse, an abuse. \nBut research actually supports the notion that individuals would rather \nwork than collect unemployment insurance. Unemployment insurance \nbenefits, as I have indicated, are a fraction of what an individual \nwould earn in the job he had previously. These are benefits that keep \npeople whole while they are searching for work.\n  There was a very eloquent editorial by Charles Blow in the New York \nTimes that addressed some of these issues. I think his words are very \nthoughtful because they strike the right tone. He wrote:\n\n       Whereas I am sure that some people will abuse any form of \n     help, I'm by no means convinced that this is the exclusive \n     domain of the poor and put-upon. Businesses and the wealthy \n     regularly take advantage of subsidies and tax loopholes \n     without blinking an eye. But somehow, when some poor people, \n     or those who unexpectedly fall on hard times, take advantage \n     of benefits for which they are eligible, it's an indictment \n     of the morality and character of the poor as a whole.\n\n  I don't think that is the case. I agree with Mr. Blow. These are \npeople who want to work, but they need some help. We have given them \nhelp in the past, and we should continue to do so.\n\n  This program has been a critical, crucial safety net for families, \nhelping them avoid poverty, helping them get back on their feet, \nhelping them get back into the workforce. It has been with us since the \nGreat Depression. It affects a whole spectrum of individuals. Indeed, \nif we look at 2012 data, about 40 percent of the households that \nreceive these benefits had an income prior to job loss of between \n$30,000 and $75,000. These are middle-income Americans who would much \nrather be working and making close to what they made before they were \nlaid off than\n\n[[Page S7]]\n\ncollecting $300 a week. So these benefits are not the exclusive \nprovince of the very poor.\n  In fact, more and more they are middle-class, middle-age people who \nnever thought they would be on unemployment insurance, who need this. \nThey are supporting elderly parents. They have children. They have \nmortgages. They had a professional career--accountant, paralegal, \nbookkeeper. They are now looking desperately for work. They are people \nwho used to work in dairy processing plants or people who used to work \nas vice presidents for sales who are so desperate--I assume some of \nthese people, if we looked at their resumes, would be qualified to do \nmany things other than work at a plant, but they are looking because \nthey desperately need work.\n  We hear this argument, though: Oh, it is a program that doesn't work \nand the people are undeserving and we are not even doing them a favor \nby letting them have this benefit. I disagree. I think we have to pass \nthis measure. We have to do it because it is the right thing for these \nfamilies, it is the right thing for our constituents, and it is the \nright thing for the economy. It would be foolish, frankly, to take a \nprogram that we are confident can save 200,000 jobs, can increase GDP \nby .2 percent, that is one of the best forms of fiscal policy to \nstimulate demand and economic growth, and say we are not going to do \nit. I think we say we have to do it.\n  There is another aspect of this, too, particularly appropriate to the \nissue of long-term unemployment. We are seeing a remarkable number of \nlong-term unemployed individuals in this recession. Typically, Congress \nhas only ended these benefits when the long-term unemployment rate was \n1.3 percent. Today it's double that at 2.6 percent. Again, this program \nis a program that takes care of the long-term unemployed.\n  The standard program in the States is one of 26 weeks. If you have a \nbrief episode of unemployment, if you lose a job and then 5 weeks later \nyou get a job, you are in that first tranche of State benefits. The \nlong-term unemployed are those who have been without work for at least \n26 weeks. We have seen the number of long-term unemployed double since \nprevious recessions--from 1.3 percent to 2.6 percent. So this program \nis more important now than in any previous economic downturn we have \nhad based upon looking at these numbers. This is another reason we have \nto extend these benefits.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this procedural vote so that the full \nSenate can consider the measure and move toward passage. We need to \nmove swiftly to pass this bipartisan bill to provide some certainty, \nsome stability, and some support for families who are struggling in a \nvery difficult market.\n  The answer I suggest to those who are considering voting against \ncloture this evening is, fine, you can come down and tell the clerk no. \nWhat are you going to tell the 1,600 people in Hagerstown, MD, and \nacross this country who are desperately looking for work and need some \nsupport? What are you going to tell them? No? I hope not.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hirono).

Madam President, I hope we will confirm Janet Yellen \nlater today.\n  I come to the floor for a few minutes to do what I have done most \nweeks since the failure of this Senate to pass commonsense gun \nlegislation in the spring of 2013, to talk about the number of \nAmericans who have lost their lives due to gun violence. That number \nstands today at 12,041. Over 12,000 people have died at the hands of \ngun violence since December 14, which of course is the day in which 20 \n6-year-olds and 7-year-olds and 6 teachers and professionals who were \nprotecting them lost their lives in Newtown, CT.\n  This is probably the last time we will have the chance to display \nthis particular number because the Web site which has been totalling \nthis is going to stop doing so. It is probably a good thing in this \nrespect: Once that 1 became a crooked number, we weren't going to have \nroom on this poster any longer; and at some point in the middle of next \nyear, the 1 would click up to a 2 and we would be over 20,000 people \nkilled due to guns. Frankly, this doesn't even count the suicides. This \nis just the people who have died as a result of gun homicides, and the \nnumber just goes up and up at a rate which is hard to comprehend.\n  So I wish to speak for a few minutes about a few of the \nrepresentative victims we have seen across the country in the last \nyear, which make up just a small subset of the 12,000 people, and I \nhope maybe one of these days it will inspire this place to action.\n  I was at the swearing in of the new mayor of New Haven on New Year's \nDay. Toni Harp is the first female mayor of New Haven, the 50th mayor \nof New Haven, and she will inherit a city being absolutely ravaged by \ngun violence--20 gun homicides in the last year and 67 shootings. Each \none of them hurts, but the last one was particularly devastating.\n  Javier Martinez died on December 28, 2013. Javier attended a local \nhigh school focused on learning about and protecting the environment, \nCommon Ground High School. He was described as one of the most \noutstanding participants in the 20-year history of a program put on \nthrough the school whereby kids spent part of their summer on Block \nIsland, a little island in between Connecticut and Rhode Island, where \nthey work to eliminate invasive species and spread the environmental \ngospel to visitors to that small island.\n  He was beloved by his family and by his friends. He was thinking of \nbecoming an arborist or environmental scientist. His community--in \nparticular, his pretty, sleepy neighborhood in which this shooting \nhappened--has been absolutely torn apart through the loss of Javier--\nBebo, as he was called by his grandparents.\n  He is one of 20 people in New Haven, CT, who were lost. Twelve of the \n20 were under 30 years old. Eleven of them were men; 17 of them were \nAfrican American. That is the story in New Haven. It is young African \nAmerican males who are dying almost every week as part of the 12,041.\n  Just a couple of months earlier, John Allen Read died in Texas due to \na gunshot wound. What makes John Allen Reed exceptional is that he was \n5 years old. He is one of dozens of accidental gun deaths happening all \nacross this country.\n  He and his 6-month-old sibling were in the care of a regular baby \nsitter, but a baby sitter who feared for her safety so she carried a \ngun with her. But she left the gun on a table and fell asleep. The 5-\nyear-old got the gun. When she woke up to try to find the kids, she \nfound John dead with a fatal gunshot wound.\n  We heard the stories all throughout 2013. I don't know whether \nstatistically there were more in 2013 than in previous years. But \nbecause we don't require much if any training before buying a gun, we \nhave young baby sitters leaving guns unattended with these absolutely \ndevastating results.\n  How about 4 months before that in Seattle, where Molly Conley, a 15-\nyear-old, a great goalie on her high school team, a straight-A student, \nwas killed while she was walking back with friends after celebrating \nher recent birthday at a sleepover. Detectives believe a shooter opened \nfire on Molly Conley and her group of friends.\n\n[[Page S8]]\n\n  Her nickname was ``4.0'' because she was such a good student. ``She \nalways smiled. She gave people smiles, and she was joyful and kind. She \nhad a generous spirit,'' said Molly's mother.\n  Molly, John, and Javier are just three of the voices of victims we \nneed to start talking about on the floor, because if the statistics \ndon't seem to be moving people to action, maybe the stories will.\n  As I hope we will this year, let's be realistic about what we can and \ncan't do. I have come here every week to talk about the stories of the \npeople who have died at the hands of guns. I understand there is no law \nthat is going to completely eradicate gun violence, and I understand \nthat there is no one solution at hand which will have a radical \ntransformation overnight.\n  I believe this is about gun laws. But I also understand it is about \nbetter mental health treatment. I also understand it is about a culture \nof violence. I also understand it is about a sense of hopelessness felt \nby a lot of kids in poor neighborhoods which leads them to violence as \na way of solving common, everyday disputes.\n  So I am ready on the floor of the Senate to have a real, sober, \ndispassionate argument about what we can do together this year to try \nto make sure this number in 2014 is just a little bit lower than it was \nin 2013.\n  With that in mind, I will leave us with this one last story, and that \nis the story of Zina Daniel.\n  Zina Daniel took out a restraining order on her husband after years \nof violence and abuse. Police were reportedly called to this home \ndozens of times. Her husband was upset about that restraining order, \nand knowing that he couldn't get a gun at a retailer because he \nwouldn't pass a background check, he went online to Armslist. Within \nhours he found a seller who would supply to him a .40 caliber Glock \nhandgun, which he picked up in a McDonald's parking lot for $500 cash. \nThe next day, he went into Zina's workplace, and he murdered her and \ntwo other women. He injured four others.\n  Zina's brother said this:\n\n       I'm a gun owner, a hunter and a member of the National \n     Rifle Association. I believe in the Second Amendment, but I \n     also believe in sensible gun laws. I've seen how devastating \n     gun violence can be. And I know that Radcliffe never should \n     have been able to buy a gun online without a background \n     check. A background check would have saved my sister's life.\n\n  I don't know what we will be able to get done this year. I don't know \nif there are 60 votes in the Senate for the kind of expansion of \nbackground checks that many of us, including Zina's brother, would like \nto see. But let's not let the whole year go by without at least some \nattempt among Senators of good will on both sides of the aisle, so that \nwhen this number does come back up at the end of 2014, it is just a \nlittle bit lower.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                       Unemployment Compensation\n\n  Mr. HELLER. Madam President, I rise today to discuss an issue that \nhas been in the forefront of the minds of many Americans ringing in the \nnew year; that is, extending benefits for the unemployed--something \nthat is important, of course, for a lot of Americans.\n  Before I begin, I wish to thank my colleague, my friend from Rhode \nIsland, Senator Jack Reed, for his hard work and effort on this behalf \nas we and our staffs worked together to get this proposal moved forward \nfor today's vote.\n  I hope that my friends and colleagues in the Senate enjoyed their \nholidays and that everyone returned refreshed and ready to tackle some \nof the tough issues we have here in 2014.\n  Unfortunately, while Congress was in recess, approximately 17,000 \nNevadans greeted the new year not with optimistic expectations of a \nfresh start but with the anxiety of how they are going to feed their \nfamilies and perhaps even pay their utility bills. When Congress left \nWashington, DC, in December, a lot of important matters were left \nundone and expired. As a result, millions of Americans were left with \nno idea whether their unemployment benefits were going to be fixed \nretroactively--something that has become, of course, all too common for \nthis Congress to do.\n  Helping those in need should not be a partisan issue. Providing a \nlimited social safety net is one of the responsibilities of the Federal \nGovernment. Unfortunately, instead of planning ahead and figuring out \nthe best way to do that, we are now forced to decide whether to \nreinstate these benefits after they have expired.\n  We should provide some relief to the millions of Americans who were \nleft hanging when Congress went home in December and temporarily extend \nunemployment benefits for the next 3 months. It is the right thing to \ndo. That short period will help these families whose benefits expired \nabruptly while Congress works out a long-term solution that provides \nAmericans with some certainty and is fiscally responsible.\n  I understand my colleagues' concerns about the cost and their desire \nto pay for this extension. I too want to see our Federal debt brought \nunder control. I think my voting record is proof of that concern.\n  I too believe Congress should be more focused on passing laws that \nactually help create jobs. Growing our economy should be the primary \nfocus and concern of this body. As a Senator of the State that leads \nthe Nation in unemployment, believe me, I understand the importance of \nrefocusing on jobs. I would rather be down here today discussing \ninnovative ways to create jobs instead of the need to extend \nunemployment benefits yet again. But because of this administration and \neven some of the choices of this body, unfortunately, our economy is \nnot growing quickly enough and many Americans are still hurting, \nincluding a lot of Nevadans.\n  My State is struggling. I have repeated often on this floor that \nNevada consistently tops the chart in unemployment, bankruptcies, and \nforeclosures. The statistics are surely revealing. But more startling \nis the obvious increase in impoverished Nevadans whom I meet when I go \nhome. I would like to share an example.\n  Every Thanksgiving one or two of my children join me in serving \nThanksgiving dinner to folks in Reno who are in need and cannot cook a \nThanksgiving meal for themselves. This year my daughter Emmy, who is in \nher freshman year in college, joined me in this experience. Every year \nthat dinner sees more and more attendees. Every year the number of \nindividuals and families who need help increases. This year the venue \nwas absolutely packed. When my daughter and I arrived, the line outside \nthe venue was four blocks long. It is such an obvious example of how so \nmany Nevadans are unable to provide for their basic needs, and this \ncannot be ignored.\n  I know many economists point to a national unemployment rate that is \nimproving, but at home we do not feel it. The unemployment rate in \nNevada has consistently far exceeded the national average. In fact, the \nSilver State has led the Nation for the past 3 years in unemployment. \nThe result is, of course, that people in Nevada are really hurting.\n  It is difficult to stand here in the Nation's Capital--an area that \nhas largely felt little negative impact of the recession--and describe \njust how tough times are for so many of my constituents. At these \nThanksgiving dinners, I hear about the choices individuals are forced \nto make--whether to buy gas for their car or pay for heat in the frigid \nnorthern Nevada winters or buy school supplies for their children or \nperhaps save for the future.\n  These are hard-working individuals who rely on these benefits. They \nare trying to find jobs. They want to provide for their children. But \nfor these benefits to simply vanish without giving families the time to \nplan or figure out alternatives to help them get by is just not right.\n  I too understand the concerns about the cost of these benefits. I \nwould prefer to see them paid for in a manner that does not burden our \nNation with more debt. I have previously introduced legislation that \nwould do just that, legislation that would extend unemployment benefits \nwhile still paying for them. At the time I introduced my legislation as \nan alternative to a more costly bill because I think it is important to \nbring down our Nation's debt.\n  I am ready to work with my colleagues to introduce similar \nlegislation again this year, but in the meantime I propose that we pass \nthis short-term extension now. That would allow Congress the \nopportunity to spend the next 3 months debating how to pay for these\n\n[[Page S9]]\n\nbenefits in the future or perhaps how much longer they should be \nextended. Those are important questions worthy of more debate. But in \nthe meantime, Congress simply must provide some temporary relief for \nthose who are unemployed.\n  Paying for these benefits would be the best approach. Congress could \nhave taken the harder road to figure out the way to do that before \ndeparting for the holiday break and leaving millions of Americans \nhanging, but it did not. So let's pass this short-term extension and \nfocus on a more fiscally responsible solution for the longer term.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                             Global Warming\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I think we are going to have a lot of \ndiscussions on the floor concerning a number of things that happened in \nthe last couple of weeks, not the least of which is what is going on in \nAntarctica right now, and the fact that some people had to be lifted \nout of there.\n  It is kind of interesting, and I don't want anyone to misunderstand \nme and think that I am reviving a lot of the previous interest \nconcerning the issue of global warming for any reason other than the \nfact that right now, after it has been determined, without any doubt, \nthat the House and Senate would never pass anything like cap and trade, \nthe President is attempting to do through regulation what he could not \ndo through legislation. What I am concerned about is the expense, and \nin a minute I will talk about the cost of these issues.\n  We have a real serious problem in this country. People are concerned \nabout the spending and about what is happening with our military. They \nare concerned about a lot of issues, but the cost of the overregulation \nthat has taken place in our society is overlooked quite often.\n  If you ask anyone associated with the farm bureau or anyone in the \nagricultural community what their major problem is, they will tell you \nit is the overregulation by the Environmental Protection Agency that is \nreally making it difficult for them to survive. It is the same thing \nwith manufacturers, producers, and others. When we look at the crown \njewel of all regulations, it is cap and trade. Cap and trade would \nconstitute the largest tax increase in the history of this country.\n  I think it is kind of interesting that what is happening right now up \nin the Antarctic is something that has been happening for quite a long \nperiod of time. While there has been a concerted effort of people who \nbelieve that global warming is taking place and that we are all going \nto die, and all of that, at the same time the evidence out there is \nalmost laughable.\n  In January of 2004, when Al Gore held a global warming rally in New \nYork City, I remember that it was one of the coldest days in New York \nCity in its history. In March of 2007, a Capitol Hill media briefing on \nthe Senate climate bill was canceled due to a snowstorm. In April of \n2007, global warming rallies were greeted by unseasonable snow, and as \na result several of them were canceled. In October of 2007, Gore's \nglobal warming speech at Harvard University coincided with temperatures \nthat nearly broke a 125-year temperature record. In October of 2007, \nthe British House of Commons held a marathon debate on global warming \nduring London's first October snowfall since 1932.\n  In December 2008, Al Gore spoke to an audience in Milan, Italy--by \nthe way, I attended that meeting--about global warming, and outside it \nwas snowing, which is a rare event for that area. Snow and freezing \nrain also struck Rome, Naples, Palermo, and Sicily.\n  A lot of people are not aware that among those who were responsible \nfor the whole global warming movement was the United Nations. It was an \neffort--I will not go into it now unless it becomes appropriate and I \nhave more time to talk about it. But the United Nations has one big \nparty every year--usually in December--and it is what we call the \nglobal warming party. It is where all the countries come to attend, and \nthey have all-you-can-eat and all-you-can-drink. It is the biggest \nparty of the year.\n  I can remember going to one of these annual parties when there was \nsomeone from Benin, which is a Sub-Saharan African country. I went up \nto this person and said: You can't tell me you believe all this stuff. \nThe whole idea was to have the 192 countries that go to this party \nevery year believe global warming is taking place, and we are all going \nto have to stop doing things to try to preclude it from happening, and \nthat would destroy our economies. His response was: Oh, no, but this is \nthe biggest party of the year.\n  That took place, as I said, in Milan, Italy in 2008. I always \nremember that one because they had my picture on telephone poles saying \n``Wanted.'' I saved several of those and brought them back to the \nUnited States so I could distribute it to the people who were enjoying \nit quite a bit. Anyway, the meeting in Milan was about global warming. \nYet there were records set on snowfall and freezing rain.\n  In March of 2009, Nancy Pelosi--at that time she was the Speaker of \nthe House--had a big global warming rally that was supposed to be the \nlargest one that had ever taken place in this country, and it was \nsnowed out.\n  In February of 2010, the Senate EPW, Environment and Public Works \nCommittee--at that time I was the ranking member of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee--had a hearing entitled ``The Global Warming \nImpacts, Including Public Health, in the United States,'' and it was \ncanceled due to a major snowstorm. This goes on and on.\n  One thing that is not on the list, which should be on this list, is \nwhat happened in Copenhagen in 2009, and that was the annual party of \nthe United Nations. I remember it so well because people were trying to \ngo over there and say that the United States of America was going to \npass cap and trade, and that we would encourage all of them to do it. I \nam going from memory now, but I am quite sure that Secretary of State \nHillary Clinton, Nancy Pelosi, Barack Obama, and John Kerry were all \nthere. At that time, John Kerry was a Member of the Senate. All of them \nassured these people--these 191 countries--that we were going to pass \ncap and trade.\n  I went all the way over and all the way back to spend 3 hours on the \nground--and I have to say it was probably the most enjoyable 3 hours I \never spent--to tell them that under no circumstance was the United \nStates going to pass the largest tax increase in history based on \ntrying to stop--something they were calling at that time--global \nwarming. The 191 countries which attended that meeting had one thing in \ncommon, and that was that they all hated me.\n  Nonetheless, I was telling them the truth, and they tried to pass it \nagain and again. There probably aren't 35 votes in the Senate right now \nthat would vote for a cap-and-trade bill which would constitute the \nlargest tax increase in the history of this country.\n  All of that had taken place over a long period of time, and now we \nare up to 2013 and 2014. In November, President Obama issued an \nexecutive order on climate change stating ``excessively high \ntemperatures'' are ``already'' harming natural resources, economies, \nand public health nationwide.\n\n  I guess if you say something long enough, sooner or later people are \ngoing to believe it because they assume if the President says it, it \nmust be true.\n  On January 6, AccuWeather issued a warning that a ``blast of arctic \nair will deliver some of the coldest weather in 20 years'' to the \nmidsection of the United States.\n  Meteorologist Ryan Maue of Florida said about the historic cold \noutbreak: ``If you're under 40 [years old], you've not seen this stuff \nbefore.''\n  The National Weather Service reported that the temperature at \nChicago's O'Hare International Airport hit 16 degrees below zero on \nJanuary 6, breaking the negative 14-degree record in 1884. This makes \nChicago colder than the South Pole where it was 11 degrees below zero. \nThe average temperature in the United States on January 6 was 12.8 \ndegrees.\n  I say all of this because this is kind of a predicate to what is \nhappening\n\n[[Page S10]]\n\nnow. On November 27, the research expedition to gauge the effect of \nclimate change on Antarctica began. This was in the news today.\n  On December 24, the day before Christmas, a Russian ship carrying \nclimate scientists, journalists, tourists, and crew members for the \nexpedition became trapped in deep ice up to 10-feet thick. An \nAustralian icebreaker was sent to rescue the ship, but on December 30 \nefforts were suspended due to bad weather.\n  On January 2, a Chinese icebreaker--and here come the Chinese now--\ncalled the Xue Long, sent a helicopter that airlifted 52 passengers \nfrom the Russian ship to safety to the Australian icebreaker. The \nChinese vessel is now also stuck in ice along with the Russian vessel. \nThere are 22 Russian crew members who are still on board the Russian \nship, and an unreported number of crew members remain on the Chinese \nship.\n  On January 5, the U.S. Coast Guard was called to assist the ships \nwhich were stuck in the Antarctic.\n  That is what is happening today. Let's go back and relive a little \nbit of history when I was under a lot of criticism because I was \nopposed to assertions by Al Gore which the New York Times said might \narguably be the first environmental billionaire.\n  In December 2008, Gore said, ``The entire North Polarized cap will \ndisappear in five years.'' It is 5 years later, and it hasn't \ndisappeared yet. In fact, we have been reading about it.\n  On December 13, the BBC reported that the Arctic ice cap coverage is \n``close to 50% more than in the corresponding period of 2012,'' which \nmeans it has increased by 50 percent over this period of time. That \nmeans it is increasing by 50 percent over this period of time. This is \nthe same icecap Al Gore said was going to disappear 5 years ago.\n\n  President Obama, in May of this last year: ``The climate is warming \nfaster than anybody anticipated five or 10 years ago.''\n  To contrast with The Economist, they said: ``Over the past 15 years, \nair temperatures on the Earth's surface have been flat. . . . ''\n  Gina McCarthy, recently sworn in as the Administrator of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, said: ``Extreme weather events are \nproof enough for me to show why action is necessary.''\n  We are talking about action on CO2.\n  According to preliminary reports, 2013 turned out to be one of the \nleast extreme weather years on record, which is right after she made \nthat statement. But the one I enjoyed so much was--I have a lot of \nrespect for Gina's predecessor, Lisa Jackson. Lisa Jackson came in as \nAdministrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and I remember \nher very well because I asked her the question--keep in mind she was \nappointed by President Obama. Her job is to make people think global \nwarming is taking place and all of these extreme things are going to \nhappen. I asked her the question: In the event that we did the action--\nat that time, there were two or three cap-and-trade bills offered in \nthe House and in the Senate. So I said: Let's assume one of these bills \npasses. Would this reduce CO2 worldwide? Her reaction was: \nNo, because this is just in the United States. This is not where the \nproblem is.\n  So by their own admission, even if we were to sustain the economic \ndisaster we would have to have in the event we passed one of these \nbills, it would not impact or reduce the levels of CO2.\n  The other recent study--15 year pause--from Nature magazine, said:\n\n       For this period, [1998-2012], the observed trend of \n     [temperatures] is . . . not significantly different from zero \n     [and] suggests a temporary `hiatus' in global warming.\n\n  This is a publication that was kind of leading the charge at one \ntime.\n  So we see these things that are happening and we see that even \nthough, time and time again, just the reverse is true, that we are \ngoing through this thing--I always have to go from memory when I go \nback. I remember the earlier years of this, some 12 years ago when they \nwere looking at the Kyoto treaty. We remember the Kyoto treaty, I say \nto the Presiding Officer, which was an agreement we would sign on to--\nan international treaty, the Kyoto treaty--and we would agree to reduce \nall the CO2 in this country and all of that. Of course, that \ndidn't happen, but the cost was discussed at that time. I remember back \nwhen Republicans were in the majority, I chaired the committee called \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee, and some 12 years ago, \nabout the time of Kyoto, I believed it was true--everybody said global \nwarming was coming and we were all going to die. So I assumed it was \ntrue until I started exploring a little bit and hearing quietly from \nsome of the scientists who said: Look. The whole thing is rigged and \nthe science is not the same as the United Nations would have us \nbelieve. So one by one they started coming forth. I stood at this \npodium for about a 3-year period and started naming all of the \nscientists who said the U.N. scientists, the IPCC, were not being \nhonest and that they had their own agenda they were trying to support. \nAt that time, a group of several universities--MIT was one of them, the \nWharton School--a lot of their scientists said what the cost would be \nif we were to pass global warming legislation that had been proposed. \nIt would be between $300 billion and $400 billion a year.\n  Now, $300 billion to $400 billion a year, yes, that would constitute \nthe largest tax increase. I took this to my State of Oklahoma. I did my \ncalculation as I always do. I get the number of people who file Federal \ntax returns and have them pay taxes and it would be about $3,000 a year \nper family. Yet, by their own admission, as Lisa Jackson said, it would \nnot reduce overall temperatures, even if one believes that is a \nproblem, which I don't.\n  Anyway, the cost--Charles River came along with a very similar cost--\n$350 billion a year. So with all of those costs, we wanted to look at \nit and see if, in fact, the science was there, and we determined it was \nnot.\n  If we look at the regulations at the EPA right now--the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers has a cumulative impact study, not \nincluding ozone or the greenhouse gases, of $630 billion annually and \nsome 9 million jobs lost. As per the regulations for ozone, 77 counties \nwould be out of attainment in my State of Oklahoma and 7 million jobs \nlost. That is all of our counties. That means we would have job losses \nin all of those. Utility MACT, that cost is $100 billion, and that has \nalready been implemented. That affected all the coal States in a major \nway. The Boiler MACT cost would be $63 billion. I mentioned the BLM. \nThe hydraulic fracking regulations would cost about $100,000 per well. \nThat is an increase everyone else would have to pay in terms of \nproducing right now. Greenhouse gas costs would be between $300 billion \nand $400 billion, as I mentioned before.\n  If we just take these regulations--the list is a lot longer than \nthat, but this is a huge issue. This is the major problem we are having \nwith the economy right now. Nobody seems to understand it. No one seems \nto care. I think that a time to bring this up as an issue is right now \nbecause of what is happening, what has been publicized recently, so it \nis our intention to continue to do that.\n  This has been a relentless 4\\1/2\\-, 5-year war the President has on \nfossil fuels. It is not just coal, but it is coal, oil, gas, and other \nfossil fuels. The sad part of this is we could be completely \nindependent from all other countries--certainly from the Middle East--\nfrom any other country in terms of supplying our own energy in this \ncountry. All we would have to do is do the same thing--allow drilling \nexploration on Federal public lands as we are doing throughout the \ncountry. Right now, we have had a 40-percent surge, increase, in \nexploration and in production in this country, and at the same time we \nhave had a 40-percent increase overall. That is on State land and on \nprivate land. We have had a reduction on Federal land. So we have an \nexclusion to the problem there, and I think one of the things we can do \nto help people understand is to let them know that what they have been \nlistening to--what the EPA has been telling our people, what our kids \nare learning in school on global warming--people are now realizing this \nis something that is not factual.\n  We are so inundated right now with problems. We have problems in \nAfghanistan. We have problems with our foreign policy in the Middle \nEast. We are all concerned about the problems around the world. The \narea people\n\n[[Page S11]]\n\naren't talking about is the cost of overregulation in America that is \ndoing probably as much damage as all the rest of the problems are doing \nat this time.\n  So I only wish to submit for the Record that some things are \nhappening today that I think the American people need to look at. I \nthink those statements made, which I will come to the floor and talk \nabout later on, from 10 years ago are now becoming a reality.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \nup to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Unemployment Compensation\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, there is no doubt our employment \nsituation in America is not good. Unemployment remains consistently \nhigh long after the administration has told us the recession is over. \nThe growth that has been projected year after year has not been at the \nlevel the experts had projected. CBO has missed the growth levels. The \nFederal Reserve has missed the growth levels. We have come in below \nthat consistently. Growth is not where we need it to be; there is no \ndoubt about it. So we have a serious unemployment situation.\n  Perhaps the most grim concept we need to be well aware of is that \nworkforce participation; that is, the percentage of Americans in the \nworking age group who are actually working is lower today than at any \ntime since the 1970s. That is a stunning statistic. Not since women \nentered the workforce in large numbers have we seen such low workforce \nparticipation numbers.\n  I believe, first and foremost, that an unemployment extension bill is \ntreating the symptoms of the problem. It is an aspirin for a fever, but \nthe fever has been raging for weeks now. Something is causing it, and \nwe need to deal with the cause of it rather than continuing to treat \nthe symptoms. I think that is so important for us to remember.\n  Also, this Nation is struggling economically for a number of reasons.\n  One of them clearly is the size of our debt. Our debt is so large--\n$17-plus trillion--now that it is causing uncertainty in the economic \nmarkets. We have to get our spending under control. We have to do that. \nEvery time we have a desire to do something good, we cannot continue to \nborrow the money to pay for it.\n  The unemployment bill that is before us today makes no attempt \nwhatsoever to find spending reductions in other areas of this \nmonstrosity of a government but borrows every penny of it. They say it \nis $6 billion. Well, it is $6 billion for 90 days--3 months. It is $26 \nbillion over the full year. That is a huge sum of money.\n  We just had a big dispute over cutting retirement pay that our \nmilitary people have earned, and it was a dispute over $4 billion. That \nwas over 10 years--$4 billion over 10 years. This is $6 billion over 3 \nmonths. So this is a lot of money, and effort should have been made to \ntry to find offsetting reductions in wasteful spending that occur \nthroughout here before we go again to treat a symptom of a disease.\n  But the tragedy is--the tragedy is--that the policies of this \nadministration are driving this poor growth record. It just is. First \nand foremost, the proposals have been to tax, tax, tax--tax more. \nTaxing the private sector will not create growth, no matter whom you \ntax. It will not be a growth-producing idea to tax the economy. Experts \ntell us that. The Congressional Budget Office tells us that.\n  So this is what we have been seeing every year. The budget that \npassed out of this Senate, the budget that was proposed by the \nPresident of the United States--the budget that passed the Senate with \nI think virtually every single Democratic Senator voting for it and all \nRepublicans opposing it would have increased taxes $1 trillion and \nincreased spending $1 trillion. The taxes were not used to reduce our \ndeficit, as the balanced approach seems to suggest. ``We have a \nbalanced approach to reduce our deficits. We are going to tax some and \ncut spending some.'' Oh, no, they did not cut spending at all. Their \n10-year budget plan called for raising taxes $1 trillion and raising \nspending $1 trillion. Tax and spend--that is what it was. It was on the \nfloor of the Senate. There is no dispute about that. No one argues \nabout it. But we have agreed to a certain level of spending here to try \nto bring our economy under control--the Budget Control Act--and we have \nacknowledged on both sides of the aisle, as have independent experts, \nthat we need to reduce spending and we need to contain the growth of \nspending and we need to reduce the deficits that are adding to the \nweakness of our economy and the uncertainty in our economy and creating \nrisks in our economy.\n  So this bill borrows every penny of it--just a total violation of \npromised fiscal responsibility. It just is. I wish it were not so. I \nwish we could just do this and it would not cost anything. But it will \ncost, and it will hamper growth in our country.\n  There are other problems. We need more American energy. Energy \nproduced in America creates jobs in America. It creates wealth in \nAmerica. It keeps us from exporting large amounts--billions and \nbillions of dollars--to Venezuela and the Middle East and other places \naround the globe. We could be producing that energy here, creating jobs \nhere, keeping that wealth at home, strengthening our economy, and \ncreating growth. That is what we should be doing.\n  The administration has blocked American energy. They have dragged \ntheir feet in every shape, form, and fashion, whether it is moratoriums \nin the gulf or blocking in Alaska, blocking the pipeline for our \nneighbors in Canada, or blocking production on public lands. This is \nnot the way to create an economy.\n  We need a tax system that is not always going up but is more growth-\noriented, simpler, more focused on creating growth. We need to \neliminate every unnecessary regulation that burdens the American \ncompetitive marketplace and makes us less competitive globally instead \nof adding to them, and we have never seen anything like the plethora of \nnew regulations being issued day after day, week after week, month \nafter month, many of them challengeable constitutionally as being \nbeyond the power of bureaucrats to issue because Congress did not pass \nthe law to justify it. It is driving up the cost of energy, and it is \ndriving up the cost of production in widgets in America, making us less \nable to compete with foreign competitors.\n  We need to stand up for American workers and American manufacturing \non the world stage. It is time to tell our trading partners: We are \nwilling to trade with you, big boy, but you have to play by the rules. \nThis idea that you can violate the rules and we are still going to \ntreat you as a great trading partner has to be over. We need to stand \nup for the American worker on the world stage. It has to be done.\n  Finally, at a time of high unemployment, should we not ask ourselves \nwhy the President of the United States and virtually every Democrat and \na number of Republicans voted to double the number of workers who were \ncoming to America under this comprehensive immigration bill? We admit a \nmillion a year legally. We believe in immigration, we support \nimmigration, but at some point you are bringing in workers to take jobs \nfrom unemployed Americans. So now we are here trying to extend \nunemployment benefits to help unemployed Americans. Is there no common \nsense in this body? How can this possibly be? But that is the deal.\n  I know Senator Reid and Senator Leahy were on the floor earlier \ntoday, and they said we have to pass this comprehensive immigration \nbill. It would not end the illegality. It would reduce it only by about \n40 percent, according to the Congressional Budget Office, but it would \ndouble the number of guest workers coming in. Guest workers, by \ndefinition, are people coming to take jobs.\n  Why are wages down? One reason is--Professor Borjas at Harvard, who \nhas studied this extensively; the Federal Reserve in Atlanta, which has \nexamined this extensively; the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, which \nhas examined it--what do they find? They find\n\n[[Page S12]]\n\nthat for middle- and lower income workers, their wages are \nsignificantly adversely impacted by this unprecedented flow of \nimmigrant labor into America.\n  I do not have anything against people who want to come to America and \nwork. They are good people. They want to have a job. I understand that. \nBut any nation has to ask itself: What is the right amount? How many \npeople can you absorb without causing millions of Americans to lose \ntheir jobs? And we now have to come to the floor of the Senate to ask \nwhat we can do to help them in this period of pain they are going \nthrough.\n\n  So I just want to say a couple things. We can do something now for \nthe unemployed, but we need to be paying for it. We need to be staying \nwithin the spending limits we have agreed to. We do not need to pass \nany more laws that increases the amount of money we borrow. We borrow \nenough. For heaven's sake, we borrow too much right now, and it \nthreatens our financial future, as expert after expert has told us. \nThey have told us we are running a high risk, and nothing could be \nworse--nothing could be worse--for working Americans than that we have \nsome other new financial crisis to spring up in the months or years to \ncome because we were irresponsible today. Wouldn't that be a disaster? \nIt certainly would.\n  So I will urge our colleagues to begin to focus on the underlying \ndisease here; that is, the policies of an administration that has \nproduced the slowest postrecession recovery maybe the Nation has ever \nhad, except for the Great Depression, because it is tax more, regulate \nmore, borrow more. That is all it is, and it will not work systemically \nto put us on the right path.\n  I know this is a tough challenge for us, but I am convinced that if \nthis Congress puts its mind to it, there are more than a few places we \ncan find waste, fraud, and abuse to help pay for and to assist those \nwho have been unemployed for a long time. I believe we can absolutely \ndo better than we are today about that, and I hope we will do so. It is \nnot right to just say the only people who care about American workers \nand care about those who are unemployed are those of us who are willing \nto forget our budget limitations, to forget our financial \nresponsibilities, and just borrow more and spend more, and somehow this \nis going to fix the problem we are facing. It will not. It will not fix \nthe problem. In fact, it is creating the very disease that is causing \nworkers to be suffering today.\n  Madam President, I appreciate the opportunity to share these remarks. \nI will repeat again, we are seeing very tough times for the American \nworker. Particularly, the lower income workers are having a difficult \ntime, and there are many causes for that. But just taxing more, \nspending more, and borrowing more is one of the big causes of the \nproblems we have today, and we are not going to fix that problem by \neven more of the same policies that got us into the situation we are in \ntoday.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask permission to speak for about 10 \nminutes on the Yellen nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, over the past 5 years the Federal \nReserve has pursued unconventional and unprecedented monetary policy. \nAs Vice chair of the Fed, Janet Yellen has been a strong proponent of \nthese policies. As chair, she is likely to continue these same easy-\nmoney policies with the same, if not more, vigor as her predecessor.\n  I have deep concerns about the long-term effects of pursuing these \npolicies. Historical evidence suggests that failing to rein in easy-\nmoney policies on a timely basis risks fueling an economic bubble or \neven hyperinflation.\n  It is true that one of the lessons learned from the Great Depression \nwas that an overly tight monetary policy in a recession risks economic \ndebilitating deflation. Thus, understandably, when the recession hit in \n2008 the Fed sought to avoid the mistakes of the past by lowering \ninterest rates to encourage investment. However, this expansionary \nmonetary policy cannot continue into perpetuity without causing real \nand lasting damage to our economy.\n  Just as we should not repeat the mistakes of the Great Depression, we \nneed to be careful not to repeat the mistakes that fueled our recent \nrecession. Let us not forget that our current economic stagnation began \nwith the bursting of the housing bubble in late 2007--a housing bubble \nfueled by rampant speculation that was driven, in part by historically \nlow interest rates maintained by the Fed between 2001 and 2004.\n  Yet once again we see the Fed embarking on a policy of sustained \nhistorically low interest rates. The Fed has now maintained the Federal \nfunds rate essentially at zero for over 5 years. What may be the future \nconsequences of this policy? What new bubble will arise? At this point, \nI do not think anyone can answer these questions definitively. But no \none can deny that the risks are real and could be devastating.\n  The Fed, though, has not just sought to maintain record-low interest \nrates. With its traditional monetary tool tapped out, the Fed has \nturned to a less conventional and more aggressive program in an attempt \nto jump-start our economy and lower unemployment.\n  The Fed is now engaged in an open-ended policy it has termed \nquantitative easing. Essentially, this is a fancy way to say the Fed is \nflooding the economy with trillions of dollars through large purchases \nof mortgage-backed securities and longer-term Treasury securities. As a \nresult of this program, the Fed has seen its balance sheet more than \nquadruple from around $800 billion to nearly $4 trillion. Vice Chairman \nYellen has not presented a plan to Congress on how the Fed plans to \ndeal with this issue.\n  While I welcome the news from the Fed's December meeting that they \nintend to reduce the monthly purchases, I fear they may already be in \ntoo deep. It remains unclear how the Fed will be able to go about \nunwinding its nearly $4 trillion balance sheet without spooking \ninvestors.\n  The stock market has become addicted to the Fed's easy-money \npolicies. This has led one notable investment advisor to question \nwhether the Fed will ever be able to end the quantitative easing \nprogram.\n  While the stock market has become addicted to easy money, the benefit \nto Main Street has been questionable at best. Unemployment remains \nhigh, bank lending remains tight, and savers discouraged.\n  While the benefits to Main Street remain unnoticeable, they most \ncertainly will feel the pain should the Fed carry on their easy-money \npolicy for too long.\n  For an example of what Main Street could be in store for one need \nlook no further than the late 1970s and early 1980s. The easy-money \npolicies of the 1970s intended to spur employment resulted in \nstagflation, a period of hyperinflation and high unemployment. During \nthis period unemployment topped 10 percent while inflation exceeded 14 \npercent.\n  The experience of the late 1970s and early 1980s made it clear that \nonce you let the inflation genie out of the bottle it is very difficult \nto stamp it out. After suffering years of stagflation, Americans were \nthen subject to the pain of unprecedented interest rates as high as 20 \npercent just to get hyperinflation back under control.\n  Statements by Ms. Yellen indicate she would be open to inflation \nexceeding the Fed target of 2 percent as a means to achieve full \nemployment. While achieving full employment may be a noble goal, the \nFed has a dismal record at being able to produce sustainable job \ncreation through expansionary monetary policy.\n  While inflation may aid employment in the very short term, our \nexperience with stagflation in the 1970's shows this tradeoff falls \napart quickly as people's expectations change. Sustainable job growth \ncomes not from inflation, but price stability that promotes long-run \neconomic growth. We need a chairman focused on a strong dollar and low \ninflation.\n  My concerns about the Fed's easy-money policies and inflation led me \nto vote against Chairman Bernanke for his second term at the Fed. \nBecause it appears that Ms. Yellen will continue to pursue these \nmisguided policies, I cannot in good conscience vote in favor of her \nconfirmation.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, Dr. Yellen's nomination is an opportunity\n\n[[Page S13]]\n\nto review the unprecedented actions of the Federal Reserve over the \nlast several years.\n  Five years ago, the Fed began using unconventional monetary policy \ntools, aggressively pursuing quantitative easing and holding interest \nrates near or at zero percent.\n  The Fed now has a balance sheet of $4 trillion, a level roughly equal \nto one-quarter of annual U.S. economic output.\n  The Fed has accumulated this balance sheet by buying Treasuries and \nmortgage-backed securities at a pace of up to $85 billion each month.\n  I have been a long-time critic of the Fed's quantitative easing \npurchases.\n  Several noted economists have called into question the benefits of \nthese purchases, suggesting they may be outweighed by risks.\n  These policies, specifically purchasing billions in long-term bonds, \ncan distort pricing in markets and lead to excessive risk taking, \ncreating ``bubble-like'' conditions according to experts like Larry \nFink at BlackRock.\n  Bill Gross of PIMCO stated that ``all asset prices, whether it be \nbonds, stocks, or alternative assets are basically mispriced, \nartificially elevated'' as a result of the Fed's actions.\n  I am concerned that the markets have become exceedingly reliant on \nquantitative easing, circumventing pure economic fundamentals in favor \nof government-stimulated economy.\n  Although a reduction in the pace of asset purchases will finally \nbegin this month, in her nomination hearing Dr. Yellen would not commit \nto a firm deadline for cutting off purchases.\n  Even after the Fed stops adding to its balance sheet, the question of \nunwinding the balance sheet remains.\n  Chairman Bernanke and others have suggested that the Fed might \nmaintain the size of the balance sheet for some time, rather than \nreducing it to a normal level.\n  This would mean that the money created to purchase those assets would \nremain in place.\n  The President of the Richmond Federal Reserve Bank has called this \n``tinder on the books of the banking system.''\n  He describes a process where banks begin to rapidly lend out those \nreserves, creating an increase in deposit growth that would put \ninflationary pressure on the economy.\n  All of this unconventional monetary policy has failed to produce the \nbenefits that were promised.\n  A noted economist recently observed that over the last 4 years, the \nshare of adults who are working has not increased and ``GDP has fallen \nfurther behind potential as we would have defined it in the fall of \n2009.''\n  All that is to say that despite unprecedented amounts of monetary \nintervention, the economy has barely responded.\n  I voted against a second term for Chairman Bernanke due to my \nconcerns with the Fed's unconventional monetary policy.\n  I voted against Dr. Yellen in 2010 for the position of Vice Chair for \nsimilar reasons.\n  Since joining the Board as Vice Chair, Dr. Yellen continues to \npromote the policies that led me to vote against her initially.\n  My position remains unchanged, and I will not vote in support of her \nnomination.\n  In addition to unprecedented monetary policy, the next Fed Chair will \nfinalize several key financial regulatory reform rules.\n  These rules must balance the financial stability with the inherent \nneed for markets to take on and accurately price risk.\n  They must be done without putting the U.S. markets at an undue \ncompetitive disadvantage or harming consumers with unintended \nconsequences.\n  The Chair of the Federal Reserve must understand how different rules \ninteract with each other, what impact they have on the affected \nentities and the economy at large.\n  For example, a number of community banks were surprised by certain \nprovisions in the recently adopted Volcker rule pertaining to their \nownership of certain securitized products, including trust-preferred \nsecurities.\n  Notwithstanding assurances by regulators that the final Volcker rule \nwould not disrupt their business model, community banks may now \npotentially have to divest hundreds of millions of dollars in assets to \ncomply with the rule.\n  I am concerned that the rush to finalize the Volcker rule before \nyear's end--for purely political reasons--was a cause of this \ncarelessness by regulators with respect to community banks.\n  It remains to be seen what other unintended consequences will result \nfrom the Volcker rule's adoption.\n  Just as some worried that we did not have enough regulations on the \nbooks to prevent the economic crisis, some of us worry that the post-\ncrisis response will result in a regulatory regime that stifles growth \nand job creation.\n  The Chair of the Federal Reserve must understand the need for that \nbalance and how to carefully manage competing demands without harming \nthe economy.\n  I appreciate Dr. Yellen's comments about the need to monitor the \nrisks to financial stability that current monetary policy creates.\n  I also share her stated concerns about the need to avoid ``one-size-\nfits-all'' regulations on different kinds of financial institutions, \nespecially ensuring that community banks are subject to ``less \nonerous'' supervision and regulation.\n  However, given my concerns about the Fed's monetary policy and Dr. \nYellen's support of quantitative easing and excessively low interest \nrates, I will not vote in favor of her nomination.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, for those who do not remember or those \nwho do not choose to remember, 5 years ago our economy was at the brink \nof collapse after being rocked by a financial crisis because of \nincompetence, Wall Street greed, overreach in the financial sector, and \nmore. Washington had let the financial system run wild through \nderegulation. Banks had overloaded on toxic mortgage securities that \nthey used massive amounts of leverage to purchase. In many cases these \nWall Street banks were so large, so complex, so opaque, so \noverleveraged, they were too big to fail.\n  Increasingly, these banks are too big to manage and too big to \nregulate. I remember that time well. I was in Zanesville, OH, when I \nfirst got a call to discuss what we needed to do from Chairman Bernanke \nand President Bush's Secretary of the Treasury Paulson. Five years \nsince the collapse of the markets, 3 years after the passage of the \nWall Street reform law, we still cannot say that the Dodd-Frank \nlegislation ended this problem.\n  In July of last year, Chairman Bernanke said:\n\n       I wouldn't be saying the truth if I said that the problem \n     is gone. It is not gone.\n\n  That is the Chairman of the Federal Reserve.\n  At her nomination hearing before the Senate Banking Committee, \nGovernor Yellen, then the Vice Chair--still the Vice Chair of the \nFederal Reserve--said that ending ``too Big to Fail'' is ``among the \nmost important goals of the post-crisis period.''\n  That is one of the many reasons I rise today to support and argue for \nJanet Yellen's confirmation as the Chair of the Federal Reserve. In \ntoday's complex financial system, it is more important than ever that \nwe have strong regulators such as Governor Yellen who can recognize \nemerging threats to economic stability and who are not afraid to act \nwhen they find abuses that put American consumers and workers at risk.\n  Throughout her distinguished career at the Fed of more than a decade, \nGovernor Yellen has shown she understands how risky financial practices \ndeep inside the largest Wall Street banks can have a terrible and \nterrifying impact on American families. She was, 8 or 9 years ago, \namong the first to recognize the housing bubble that wiped out \ntrillions in wealth and led to the biggest recession since the Great \nDepression.\n  In the years since the crash, Governor Yellen has been a voice on the\n\n[[Page S14]]\n\nneed for strong, sensible regulation to protect American workers and \nsmall businesses instead of the too-big-to-fail banks. While there are \nmany failures that led the economy to the brink of collapse, one of the \nbiggest mistakes on the Federal level was not keeping the average \nAmerican's financial interest in mind. There is far too much bias in \nthis institution toward Wall Street instead of Main Street.\n  Most people in my home State of Ohio, in the Presiding Officer's home \nState of Hawaii, are not millionaires. They are automakers in \nLordstown, steelworkers in Cleveland, they are farmers in Darke County, \nthey are hairdressers in Toledo, they are police officers in Columbus. \nThey are the people who make the products we depend on every day.\n  My State produces more than any but two States in the United States. \nThey are the people who make these products, who teach our children, \nwho protect our communities. They are the average hard-working \nAmericans trying to create a better life for their children. And they, \nalong with millions of other Americans, deserve better than the crisis \nthat we allowed to happen.\n  Over the years, Washington, the Fed in particular, has too often \nlacked an important connection to Americans whose lives are so affected \nby the decisions it makes. Few have been able to keep a perspective \nwhere they understand what is happening in middle America, among \nworking-class Americans, among middle-class Americans.\n  When President Lincoln was in office, he would go out and meet \nregularly with ordinary Americans either in the White House or outside \nthe White House. While his staff implored him to stay in the White \nHouse and win the war and free the slaves and save the Union, President \nLincoln said: I need to go out and get my public opinion bath.\n  We have also seen the new pope, Francis I, exhort his parish priests \nto ``smell like the flock''--to get among them, to understand their \nlives as much as possible, to drink the water they drink, to be among \nthem, to learn from them and to listen to them. We must know those whom \nwe serve.\n  In a speech last year before the AFL-CIO, Janet Yellen described the \nreal-world implications of unemployment and noted that the unemployed \nare not just statistics. She took stock of the work ahead for the Fed, \nnotably ensuring that Dodd-Frank is fully implemented in ending ``too \nbig to fail.'' I think she will break out of the beltway bubble. I \nthink she will get out in the country far more than any of her \npredecessors have done and consider the lives and work to understand \nthe lives of those people affected by these Federal Central Bank \ndecisions.\n  As Chair of the Fed Subcommittee on Communications, she has played a \nstrong role in monetary policy and its efforts to put people back to \nwork, despite Congress's unwillingness--this body's unwillingness--to \nhelp. Whether it is extending unemployment benefits, which we should be \ndoing today, whether it is raising the minimum wage, it means engaging \nin the lives and helping people in this country who may not be as \nprivileged as those of us who have the opportunity to serve in the \nSenate.\n  Janet Yellen is qualified to take the helm of the Fed and make \nhistory in becoming the first woman to run the Central Bank.\n  In confirming Ms. Yellen, we can look forward to a new era of \nrecovery and growth. I look forward to working with Janet Yellen and \nher staff.\n  I urge my colleagues to confirm Janet Yellen to be Chair of the \nFederal Reserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Janet L. Yellen, of California, to be Chairman of the Board of \nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System?\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask for the ayes and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, extreme weather throughout the \nMidwest created travel delays that prevented me from being in \nWashington today for the vote to confirm Janet Yellen as Chairwoman of \nthe Federal Reserve. She is an excellent candidate, given her long \nhistory of service at the Fed and her vast amount of expertise, and had \nI been here, I would have cast an aye vote in support of her \nnomination, just as I did on the vote to invoke cloture on her \nnomination.\n  Dr. Yellen most currently serves as vice chair of the Board of \nGovernors of the Federal Reserve. Over the span of the last nearly four \ndecades, she has served as a member of the Board of Governors, the \nchair of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisors, and as the \npresident and CEO of the 12th District Federal Reserve Bank in San \nFrancisco. She's also spent a good part of her career in the academic \nworld, currently as a professor at Berkeley's Haas School of Business.\n  The worst financial crisis since the Great Depression sent our \neconomy into a hole that it is still climbing out of today. The good \nnews is that it is emerging from that dark place, thanks in part to the \nrole of the Federal Reserve, led by current Chairman Ben Bernanke. \nSince the depths of the crisis, the Fed has taken on a more creative \nrole in restoring our economy and stabilizing our financial system, \nusing unconventional tools and setting specific goals for growth.\n\n[[Page S15]]\n\n  What makes Dr. Yellen a particularly strong nominee is the attention \nshe has paid to connecting the labor market to monetary policy. Much of \nher career has been devoted to these subjects. In October 2009, our \nunemployment rate reached 10 percent. Today, with the help of the Fed's \nactions, it stands at 7 percent. In my home State of Illinois, \nunemployment stood at 10.7 percent in 2009, and is down to 8.7 percent \ntoday. Though this is far from good enough, it shows real progress.\n  Our next Fed chair should be able to take on the challenges our \neconomy still faces--lowering the unemployment rate even further and \nmeeting inflationary goals. The focus that Dr. Yellen brings to the \nlabor market gives me confidence that she can help our Nation reach new \nhighs when it comes to creating jobs and getting Americans back to \nwork.\n  The Wall Street Journal recently prepared an interesting analysis \nexamining more than 700 predictions made by 14 Fed policymakers. That \nanalysis found Dr. Yellen to be the most accurate of the 14. That did \nnot surprise me. Dr. Yellen could not be more deserving of this \nnomination given her experience and precise economic judgment. She has \nthe know-how to make the decisions that a Fed chair needs to make about \nhow to move our economy further forward successfully and transparently.\n  I support Dr. Yellen's nomination and look forward to working with \nher as she becomes our Nation's first Chairwoman of the Federal \nReserve.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  There will be 2 minutes equally divided prior to the cloture vote.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, on December 28, 1.3 million Americans lost \ntheir extended unemployment benefits. They are the first wave of what \nwill be more than 3 million other Americans. These people have worked, \nthey have qualified for unemployment insurance, they need help, and we \nhave to help them. If we don't do that, not only will these families \nsuffer, the economy will suffer. The CBO estimated we will lose 200,000 \njobs if we don't extend unemployment benefits, and 0.2 percent of \ngrowth.\n\n  If we want to help working families--people who qualify because they \nworked and have to continue to look for work to be qualified--and our \neconomy, then vote to at least let us go forward. Give us 3 months to \nwork on issues, funding, and anything else, but don't throw these \npeople off a cliff and leave them without anything.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, this is a serious issue, but if this was \nanything other than a political exercise, the majority leader would \nhave rescheduled this vote when we did not have 17 Members of the \nSenate unable to be here and vote on this.\n  I have no doubt as to what the outcome will be on this cloture vote, \nbut I believe it is purely a scheduling matter. It ought to be \npostponed to a later time when we can have a real debate so we can look \nfor a way to pay for this extension of unemployment benefits and how to \nget the economy growing again so people can find jobs. That is what \npeople want; they want to work. They don't want unemployment \ncompensation; they want jobs so they can provide for their families.\n  Unfortunately, because of the timing of this vote, we know what the \noutcome is, and it is transparent that this is a political exercise and \nnot a real effort to try to fix the problem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the vote be scheduled tomorrow \nat 10 a.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?

Mr. President, I was on the same flight with Senator \nShaheen. I was looking forward to having the opportunity to vote for \nJanet Yellen to be Chair of the Federal Reserve.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Yellen Nomination\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to secrecy, in \nopposition to the veil of secrecy that cloaks the money changing hands \nthat takes place in the temple of the Federal Reserve. While the money \nchanges hands, the monied class gets richer and the middle class gets \nshortchanged.\n  It is more than time to part the curtain that hides the trillions of \ndollars that changes hands. There is a revolving door from Wall Street \nto the Treasury to the Fed and back again. We have former Secretaries \nof the Treasury who go from government to Wall Street pocketing \nhundreds of millions of dollars.\n  I have called repeatedly for transparency at the Federal Reserve so \nAmericans can see what is being done with their money supply. Every \ntime I call for transparency, people from both sides have said \ntransparency would undermine Fed independence. The problem is that \nCongress created the Fed and Congress was intended to have oversight \nover the Fed, and as time has gone on we have lost that oversight, so \nindependence has really led to abuse.\n  Some say: Well, the Fed is audited each year.\n  The investigator general who is responsible for auditing the Fed came \nto Congress in 2009, and here is what she had to say during a question-\nand-answer session in a House committee. A Congressman asked:\n\n       What have you done to investigate the off-balance sheet \n     transactions conducted by the Federal Reserve which, \n     according to Bloomberg, now total $9 trillion in 8 months?\n\n  She fumbled, she repeated herself, she looked silly, and then she \nsaid:\n\n       You know, I think it may be important at this point to--\n\n  Yadda, yadda, yadda, and then several yaddas later, this bombshell \nfrom the auditor:\n\n       We do not have jurisdiction to directly go out and audit \n     Reserve Bank activities specifically. So, really, there is no \n     audit of the Federal Reserve, so don't let anybody say that \n     we have an audit. No meaningful audit\n\n[[Page S16]]\n\n     exists, and when the primary auditor and overseer of the Fed \n     was asked about $9 trillion, the inspector general had no \n     clue what had been purchased with the money.\n\n  Is there a chance the Fed only has our best interests at heart? Sure. \nBut when trillions of dollars change hands, wouldn't one want to know \nwho got the money and whether anyone enriched themselves in the \nprocess?\n  We know $9 trillion is over half of our entire national debt. This is \nmoney that ultimately becomes debt for all of us. It is being doled \nout, in secret, by our central bank. This is, in a sense, laundering \nmoney from the American people to bail out big banks and Wall Street.\n  This month we learned that the Fed's official balance sheet has \nreached an astounding $4 trillion. To put that in perspective, the \nbalance sheet of the Fed is now larger than the fourth largest economy \nin the world--Germany.\n  Transparency at the Fed would not hurt the Fed, but a complete lack \nof transparency continues to hurt and cheat the rest of us. At the very \nleast the American middle class deserves to know what goes on behind \nthe curtain, what decisions are made, and how they benefit Wall Street \nand the monied class.\n  Being secret and reckless with trillions of dollars is only the tip \nof the iceberg when it comes to the problems associated with the Fed. \nThe history of the Federal Reserve has also been the history of the \ndevaluation of the dollar. There was a time when the dollar was as good \nas gold. When the people grew restless or concerned that the government \nwas debasing the currency, the people would simply express their \ndispleasure by exchanging their paper for gold. Convertibility was a \ncheck and balance against Kings and Queens and any form of government \nthat chose to spend money it did not have. When the government \n``borrowed'' from the currency by diluting its value, the people had \nrecourse to protect themselves. Now, the great American dollar that was \nonce backed by gold is backed by promises.\n  For many decades the dollar was said to be backed by the full faith \nand credit of the Federal Government. Trust lingered from the \nhistorical evolution, from barter to a medium that people valued such \nas gold or silver. The trust that still exists today lingers from the \nthousand-year history when currency had inherent value and that if \npaper substitutes were used, they could always be exchanged for \nsomething of real value.\n  After World War II we instituted a partial gold standard that allowed \nforeign countries to exchange their paper for gold--and exchange they \ndid. During the 1960s, as the United States inflated and borrowed to \npay for the war on poverty and the war in Vietnam, foreign countries \nbecame skittish and turned in their dollars by the millions. Nearly \nhalf of the gold reserves were removed by foreign countries in the \nspace of a few years. President Nixon closed the gold window in 1971, \nand that was that. The last link to gold was severed. But make no \nmistake--the trust that remained in the dollar was derived from the \nhistoric trust engendered by convertibility of paper to gold.\n  For decades the full faith and credit promise allowed the Fed to \ncontinue to inflate, and still the people remained relatively passive \nin their acceptance of an unbacked, completely discretionary paper \ncurrency--but not without hiccups. Inflation nearly got the better of \nus in the 1970s, and now debt threatens to do the same.\n  Something profound, though, occurred in the past few years beginning \nwith the panic of 2008. The Fed began to back the dollar with not just \npromises but perhaps really bad promises.\n  Since early 2008 the Fed has added nearly $3 trillion to its asset \nsheet, and included among these ``assets'' is stuff that nobody else \nseems to want, such as bad car loans and nonperforming mortgages. \nAccording to Mauldin and Tepper's book ``Code Red,'' at $4 trillion, \nand roughly $55 billion in equity, the Fed is leveraged at about 77 to \n1. Think about that. That is an insane amount of leverage for any bank. \nThe Fed is more leveraged than the balance sheets of Lehman Brothers, \nBear Stearns, Freddie or Fannie, before those institutions essentially \nfailed.\n  Jim Rickards, author of ``Currency Wars,'' notes: The Fed is \ninsolvent on a mark-to-market basis. . . . The Fed has wiped out its \ncapital on a mark-to-market basis. Of course, the Fed carries those \nnotes on its balance sheet ``at cost'' and does not mark them down to \nmarket, but if they did, they would be broke. The insolvency of the Fed \nwill become a major issue in the years ahead and may necessitate a \nfinancial bailout of the Fed by the taxpayers.\n\n  So the once-proud dollar that was once backed by gold, then backed by \nthe full faith and credit of the world's greatest economy, is now \nbacked by used car loans and underwater mortgages.\n  But those who trust in paper say: Look. For 50 years now we have had \nno convertibility, and amazing improvements in productivity and wealth \nhave occurred.\n  Perhaps. But one might also argue that we are living on the borrowed \nplumage of the past, that our current acceptance of a paper currency \nrests on the glory of our industrial and monetary past. No one can tell \nfor sure what the future holds, but I for one am concerned that the \npanic of 2008 may not have been an anomaly but a harbinger of something \nfar worse. I am concerned we have papered over our problems in a sea of \nnew currency. That quantitative easing has created an illusion of \nsafety and security, but beneath the surface lurks a bigger and more \nmalevolent future.\n  Don't take my word for it. Listen to some of the economists who \npredicted the financial crisis of 2008.\n  Economist Jim Grant recently said:\n\n       From the United States to Europe and Asia, the world's \n     central banks are flooding markets with liquidity and pushing \n     deeper into unknown monetary policy territory and I feel this \n     journey will not end well.\n\n  Nassim Taleb, author of the ``Black Swan,'' writes:\n\n       Someone made a mistake lending and someone made a mistake \n     borrowing . . . and it is a mistake to transform private \n     problems into public debt. We are facing an environment with \n     a huge amount of debt. The next mistake is going to be to \n     overprint, which is going to be the way out for them, which \n     is why I fear hyperinflation.\n\n  Yale University housing expert and recent Nobel Prize winner Robert \nSchiller:\n\n       This financial crisis that we've been going through in the \n     last 5 years has been one that seems to reveal the failure to \n     understand price movement . . .\n\n  Not shying away from his concerns that the Fed is simply inflating \nthe housing bubble in America's largest cities, he argues:\n\n       [Housing prices] are up 12 percent in the last year. That \n     is a very rapid rise in prices, and I believe it is \n     accelerated somewhat by Fed policies . . . the housing \n     market, it has its own momentum right now as people see it \n     coming back. We're sort of in the beginnings of another \n     housing bubble.\n\n  Since we abandoned the sequester budgetary caps, any pretense of \nfiscal discipline is gone. Politicians can attempt to obfuscate the \ntruth with promises of spending restraint in the outyears, but \neverybody knows that the promise to cut in the outyears is a pipe dream \nand that all that really counts is the first 2 years of the Ryan-Murray \nplan that will add over $60 billion in new spending.\n  What really causes China concern is not the new spending we are \nincurring but that the total new debt added over 10 years will be $7 \ntrillion. China's response to our fiscal lack of discipline was to \ndowngrade our debt. Our $17 trillion debt is manageable only with the \nFed buying it and only with low interest rates.\n  China's Dagong Global Credit Rating said in their statement on the \ndowngrade:\n\n       The deal means only an escape from a debt default for the \n     time being, but hasn't changed the fact that the growth of \n     government borrowing has largely outpaced overall economic \n     growth and fiscal revenues.\n\n  These are facts, and both sides--Republicans and Democrats--are \nignoring the facts. China, when they downgraded us, said it, and we \ncannot escape this fact: The growth of government borrowing has largely \noutpaced economic growth and fiscal revenues. It is sad when the \nChinese Government can see major economic problems for us that \nWashington continues to ignore.\n  At current rates, we pay about $237 billion in interest payments. If \ninterest rates rise by 1 percent, interest spending will increase by \n$1.2 trillion. If interest rates return to the norms of the\n\n[[Page S17]]\n\n1980s, the taxpayer will be on the hook for an additional $6.17 \ntrillion. If interest rates go to 10 percent, ``Katy, bar the door.'' \nThe panic will be upon us.\n  Most conservatives would be aghast if we talked about price controls. \nConservatives realize, as most economists now do, that price controls \nlead to a glut if the price is too high and to bare shelves if the \nprice is too low. The Soviet Union was brought low for that very \nreason. No one, no matter how wise, can determine the correct price of \nbread without a marketplace.\n  Anytime a government tries to set prices, the consequence is \ndisastrous. But many leaders who are quite aware of the destructive \nnature of price controls nevertheless advocate for allowing the Fed to \nset the price of money, for that is what interest rates are--simply the \nprice of money. Like any other price, though, setting interest rates \nlower than the market rate of interest encourages more use of the money \nand more economic activity. But if the rates are kept below the market \nrate, we interrupt the feedback loop that informs producers that they \nare overproducing, and the bubble expands until overproduction has \nreached such a point that the correction is a catastrophe. That is what \nhappened with the housing bubble. We kept interest rates too low for \ntoo long and the bubble grew and grew and grew and we are still \nsuffering from that. And what are we doing now? Exactly the same thing.\n  Jim Rickards explains this phenomenon:\n\n       Market participants and policymakers rely on market prices \n     to make decisions about economic policy. What happens when \n     the price signals upon which policymakers rely are themselves \n     distorted by prior policy manipulation? First you distort the \n     price signal by market manipulation, but then you rely on the \n     ``price'' to guide your policy going forward. This is the \n     blind leading the blind.\n\n  Politicians have been complacent in letting the Fed manipulate \ninterest rates for many reasons. Many politicians are reticent to get \ninvolved in monetary policy. They are worried of being blamed if the \neconomy sours with monetary reforms. Many politicians believe the \neconomy is better off with the Fed than with the panics that occurred \nbefore the Fed. But perhaps the variations in the economy of late \nindicate just as much instability with the Fed as before the Fed.\n  There is some truth to the fact that big debt and deficit financing \nin all likelihood require a central bank to pay the debt with inflated \ndollars, and there is some truth to this.\n  John Mauldin and Jonathan Tepper's new book, ``Code Red,'' highlights \nthis very point:\n\n       In 2011, the Federal Reserve financed about three-quarters \n     of the U.S. deficit; in 2012, it financed over half of it; \n     and in 2013, it will finance most of it.\n\n  We are on course to finance the entire U.S. debt in 2014.\n  Now, for anyone imagining a day without a Fed, they would have to \npropose a government that would balance its budgets annually. Without \nfiscal restraint you cannot ever have monetary restraint. The opposite \nis where we are now. With fiscal irresponsibility, borrowing over $1 \nmillion a minute, you need a compliant monetary policy, and that is \nexactly what we have.\n\n  But there are consequences to massive debts and corresponding massive \npurchases by the Fed. The consequences can be gradual or abrupt. The \ngradual bankrupting of America is proceeding apace. We pay for it with \nnew money created by the Fed.\n  The result is a gradual loss of purchasing power. Over the past 100 \nyears, the dollar has lost 96 percent of its value. A nation can \nsurvive this gradual loss we have, but some would argue that the people \nhurt most are those who are least able to absorb rising prices--the \npoor and the elderly on fixed incomes.\n  The other possible outcome is an abrupt loss of confidence in the \ncurrency. The panic of 2008 approached mass fear that the system was \nunsound. Reports that the emperor had no clothes were taken seriously, \nas even the soundness of money market funds was questioned.\n  Our system of paper currency now backed by the promises of \npoliticians, a $17 trillion debt, and used car loans and bad home \nmortgages is always one panic away from dissolution. When that day \ncomes is uncertain. Can the Fed continue the legerdemain; can the Fed \ncontinue the illusion of wealth that comes with freshly inked money? \nTime will tell. But I, for one, want to know what the Fed is doing. Are \nindividuals enriching themselves at the expense of the public? Does Fed \npolicy enrich one group of individuals at the expense of another? What \nassets does the Fed hold? What informs their decision-making process?\n  I, for one, want answers. I, for one, want transparency.\n  President Obama's choice of Janet Yellen as the new head of the \nFederal Reserve is concerning due to the policies Ms. Yellen has \npromoted in her history at the Fed.\n  The Federal Reserve's answer to economic crisis has long been simply \nto print more money, or what they call ``quantitative easing.'' It does \nnot take a rocket scientist to figure out that printing money out of \nthin air is not sound long-term economic policy. But Ms. Yellen has \nbeen a major cheerleader for it. The Washington Post's Neil Irwin wrote \nthat ``Yellen has been not merely an engineer of the Fed's policies of \n`quantitative easing' and `forward guidance,' but a consistent voice \nwithin the central bank to go further.'' Quantitative easing is not \nenough. She wants more.\n  Will she go further? Will the same policies continue unabated? Those \nof us who think quantitative easing has gotten out of hand are now \nbeing asked to confirm a nominee who thinks the Fed has not done enough \nalong these lines.\n  The vote was overwhelming to confirm Janet Yellen, but I think we \nwill rue the day that we endorsed quantitative easing.\n  I believe the Federal Reserve is structurally flawed. I believe we \nneed to be able to prevent or restrict any Chairman today or in the \nfuture from aiding and abetting the allies of banks and big government. \nAs monetary historian Peter Bernholz wrote in his famous book \n``Monetary Regimes and Inflation'': `` . . . we draw the conclusion \nthat the creation of money to finance a public budget deficit has been \nthe reason for hyperinflations.''\n  I see nothing in Yellen's past performance at the Fed that would \nindicate that her policies will be any different than what we see \ntoday. In fact, I see evidence that things may well get worse.\n  I have introduced a bipartisan bill called Federal Reserve \nTransparency Act, known also as Audit the Fed. The purpose of my bill \nis to eliminate the current restrictions on GAO audits of the Fed, \nalong with mandating that the Federal Reserve's credit facilities, \nsecurities purchases, and quantitative easing activities become subject \nto congressional oversight.\n  Looking into what the Federal Reserve does with our money has \nsignificant support from both parties, many Members of which have heard \nthe same concerns back home in their States and districts.\n  Audit the Fed passed overwhelmingly in the House with 350 votes. \nEvery Republican and 100 Democrats voted for it.\n  The Federal Reserve is one of the most secretive institutions in our \nhistory. For decades, the people in charge at the Fed, politicians, and \nvarious ``experts'' have insisted that such secrecy was integral to its \nindependence and effectiveness.\n  But the results of complete secrecy have been Fed policies that are \nquestionable at the least. This idea that the Federal Reserve is at the \nroot of some of our economic problems is brandnew to many Americans \nprecisely because we are not allowed to know what this powerful \ninstitution does behind closed doors--despite the fact that it has a \ndirect impact on our lives.\n  I can see no reason why the American public should not be allowed to \nsee behind the veil of secrecy at the Fed. I will continue to do what I \ncan to part that veil. I will continue to fight for a full and \npersistent audit of the Fed. Audit the Fed passed the House \noverwhelmingly, but we have been unable to get a vote in the Senate. I \nwill continue to fight for that vote.\n  Although I was delayed by the weather, I am here today to oppose \nJanet Yellen's nomination for two reasons. I believe she will continue \nthe gradual destruction of the dollar's value and because I believe the \ntime is now for a full audit of the Fed.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we have the opportunity today to take care \nof some very important unfinished business. We left town last year \nwithout ensuring that millions of American jobseekers could retain \naccess to vital unemployment insurance. I hope we correct this and \nrestore the Federal unemployment program, the Emergency Unemployment \nCompensation program, which was allowed to expire on December 28.\n  Unemployment insurance has helped tens of millions of Americans \nweather the storm of the difficult economy over the last several years. \nIt has helped workers put food on the table, kept a roof over their \nheads, and kept millions out of poverty.\n  But because Congress has so far failed to extend it, 1.3 million \nAmericans were abruptly cut off from their vital unemployment insurance \nthe week after Christmas. And over the course of this year, another 3.6 \nmillion Americans will be cut off from unemployment insurance as they \nexhaust their State benefits and have nowhere else to turn. That is a \ntotal of 4.9 million Americans--including 35,500 Iowans. They have \nspent 6 months or more trying to find new work, going out and pounding \nthe pavement day after day, but must now worry about how they and their \nfamilies and children are going to survive. How will they keep up with \ntheir heating bill, their rent, their car payment, or their mortgage?\n  We used to all agree here in Washington that if you lose your job \nthrough no fault of your own, especially at a time of chronic \nunemployment, you should have some support while you're looking for new \nwork. The American people certainly agree. A poll released last week \nshows that 55 percent of voters say that Congress should act to \nmaintain the program.\n  Unfortunately, some people in this chamber seem to think that the \nmisfortune of losing a job means that these hardworking folks are to \nblame, or that they don't deserve this basic lifeline. Some here in the \nSenate have even called it a ``disservice'' to continue this program. \nThat kind of harshness toward people who are trying to do the right \nthing but who are victims of circumstance is simply wrong.\n  Jobseekers are not sitting around watching TV and collecting \ncompensation they don't deserve. In fact, participation in the \nunemployment insurance program requires that workers have a significant \nwork history--which means they have paid into the system and earned \nthis insurance. Collecting on the insurance also requires workers to \nhave lost their job through no fault of their own, and to be actively \nlooking for work. Participants in the program are playing by the rules. \nIt is now our responsibility to make sure that workers who are out of \nluck in this economy have some basic income to make ends meet.\n  The fact is times are still tough and jobs are hard to come by. For \nevery job opening there are three job seekers. That is why so many \nmillions of workers have been searching for new work for such a long \ntime. The American people know this, too. In last week's poll, 57 \npercent of voters said that the unemployed ``would rather work, but \ncannot find a job in today's economy.''\n  Although the payments under the Federal program were modest--after \ncuts due to sequestration, payments averaged just $269 per week--these \nfunds were crucial for keeping households afloat. For many, this is \ntheir last lifeline. If Congress fails to restore the Federal program, \nmillions of people will face real economic devastation.\n  Also, we have to remember that unemployment insurance is not just a \nlifeline for families, but for our economy as a whole. After all, one \nof the best ways to grow our economy and to create jobs is to support \nspending power. And that is exactly what unemployment insurance does. \nWhen unemployed workers can continue to pay their bills, businesses can \ncontinue to make sales and provide services, and the economy grows. The \nCongressional Budget Office has found that unemployment insurance is \none of the most efficient policy tools we have to improve economic \ngrowth. If the Federal unemployment insurance program is restored and \nextended through 2014, it will increase GDP by 0.2 percent and create \n200,000 jobs. Those jobs will be lost if we do not act.\n  Congress has a long history of acting to ensure basic security for \nworking people during tough economic times. In the past, when the job \nmarket was this challenging, politicians on both sides of the aisle \nagreed that the Federal Government had an obligation to step in and \nhelp the long-term unemployed while they are struggling to find a work. \nIndeed, the current program of extended unemployment benefits was put \nin place in 2008 by President George W. Bush when the unemployment rate \nwas 5.6 percent. While unemployment is falling, it is still at a high \nrate, 7.0 percent. And that's just the official rate. Unofficially, \nwhen we include those folks who want to work full-time but can only \nfind part-time work and those who have given up actively looking for \nwork, the rate is actually 13.2 percent.\n  Long-term unemployment has been at record highs for years. Currently \n37 percent of unemployed workers have been looking for new work for at \nleast 6 months. Congress has never allowed Federal unemployment \ninsurance to expire when more than 23 percent of unemployed workers \nwere long-term unemployed.\n  Our economy is recovering, but we are not there yet. American \njobseekers and their families still need Federal unemployment \ninsurance. Our economy needs these families to have some basic means of \nsurvival. There is no justification for not restoring the current \nprogram. This is a modest, short-term extension of 3 months. I would \nprefer to see us approve a year-long extension, so that families who \nrely on the program have peace of mind that they will not be cut off \nfrom this lifeline again. But I am pleased that Senator Heller has \njoined with Senator Reed, myself, and others to put forward this \nproposal.\n  Congress has an obligation to restore and continue the Federal \nunemployment insurance program to ensure that Americans and their \nfamilies can survive while trying to get back on their feet and find \nnew work. They are depending on us. I urge the Senate to act to restore \nthe Federal unemployment insurance program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/06/senate-section/article/S18-3", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18-S19]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           JACKSON, MISSOURI\n\n Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Jackson, \nMO, as it celebrates its 200th anniversary in 2014. Jackson is a proud \ncommunity with a long history of hard work and an unmistakable spirit \nof community.\n  Founded in 1814, Jackson is the county seat of Cape Girardeau County \nin southeast Missouri. With only 300 residents at its founding, the \ntown still supported five stores, two shoemakers, and a tannery--a \nthriving hub for the time. Jackson's growth has been slow and steady, \nbut stable. Today, nearly 14,000 people live and work in Jackson.\n  As it embarks on its 200th year, Jackson is one of the fastest \ngrowing communities in Missouri. Its city slogan, `The City of \nBeautiful Homes, Churches, and Schools,' aptly represents a community \ncommitted to progress and improvement. In 2009, Money Magazine named \nJackson 59th on its list of best small towns in the United States. With \nthe many thousands of small towns across our country, this is a \nconsiderable distinction--although, to be sure, Jackson is worthy of a \nspot much higher.\n  Jackson's small town feel makes it a great place to call home. The \ncitizens come together for events ranging from the annual Independence \nDay celebration in the city park, to its\n\n[[Page S19]]\n\nHomecomers event in historic uptown, to cheering for their hometown \nteams under the Friday night lights of football games. There are \nnumerous other activities to keep Jackson residents busy; building \nfamilies and friendships is at the core of each.\n  The city of Jackson's officials and citizens should take pride in the \ncore values of the community they call home on its 200th anniversary. \nPlease join me in saluting Jackson, MO, as it celebrates this \nmilestone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/06/senate-section/article/S19-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S19]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/06/senate-section/article/S19-2", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S19]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.

This \n     role should not be forgotten; and\n       Whereas, Durand, Michigan, is at the historic crossroads of \n     three major railroads and is home to one of the largest \n     surviving train stations in the United States. The existing \n     statuary, structures, and historic railroad equipment at \n     Diamond District Park in Durand make it an ideal location for \n     a National Railroad Memorial; and\n       Whereas, Congressional House Concurrent Resolution 50 would \n     designate a National Railroad Monument located in Diamond \n     District Park in historic downtown Durand, Michigan, as the \n     ``National Railroad Memorial''. This recognition would help \n     draw visitors from around the world to the educational \n     programming and exhibits in Durand, Michigan. It would help \n     ensure that current and future generations do not forget the \n     historical importance of the railroad industry to our nation: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we urge the \n     Congress of the United States to adopt House Concurrent \n     Resolution 50, regarding the National Railroad Monument in \n     Durand; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-168. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of California relative to forest protection and \n     restoration; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 24\n\n       Whereas, One of the greatest ongoing challenges for \n     California is to ensure an adequate supply of water for \n     myriad human uses and other environmental needs while also \n     addressing the increasing and negative impacts of climate \n     change on our watersheds; and\n       Whereas, The large majority of the water used by California \n     originates in the 10 million-acre forested area of northern \n     California feeding the Sacramento River, with the Sacramento \n     River providing 60 percent of the water for the Central \n     Valley and state water projects, drinking water for 25 \n     million Californians, and over 80 percent of the freshwater \n     to San Francisco Bay; and\n       Whereas, California's forests represent our largest, \n     safest, and most expandable opportunity to actively, remove \n     carbon dioxide from the atmosphere; and\n       Whereas, The forests and watersheds of California face \n     multiple challenges and pressures, including the loss and \n     degradation of forests by the subdivision, fragmentation, and \n     development of lands, the planting of unnaturally dense \n     forests as a result of fire suppression, and stresses from a \n     changing climate; and\n       Whereas, California's forests provide an essential natural \n     infrastructure that collects, stores, filters, and transports \n     water in a materially more cost-effective manner than any \n     built infrastructure; and\n       Whereas, Managing these forested watersheds to restore and \n     enhance their sustained water provision services will also \n     create rural jobs and enhance the state's ability to address \n     climate change, including by reducing firefighting costs; and\n\n[[Page S22]]\n\n       Whereas, In addition to supplying the majority of the \n     state's water and sequestering vast amounts of carbon, \n     forests clean our air and provide habitat for wildlife, all \n     while supporting rural economies through outdoor recreation \n     such as hunting, fishing, hiking, and camping, as well as \n     through the forest products industry; and\n       Whereas, Preventing further loss of California's forests, \n     restoring degraded forest areas, and improving management are \n     critical parts of ensuring that our watersheds continue to \n     store carbon and produce high-quality clean water in the \n     future: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and the Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature of California \n     recognizes the value of forests in providing critical \n     ecosystem services, including water supply and climate \n     stabilization services; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the state and federal governmental agencies \n     with jurisdiction over forest resource management are \n     encouraged to collaborate across jurisdictions with regard to \n     landscape-scald efforts to maintain and restore California's \n     forests to protect the state's natural resources and water \n     supply for future generations; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, to the Minority Leader of the House of \n     Representatives, to the Majority Leader of the Senate, to the \n     Minority Leader of the Senate, and to each Senator and \n     Representative from California in the Congress of the United \n     States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-169. A resolution adopted by the Municipal Legislature \n     of Moca, Puerto Rico relative to urging the President and the \n     Congress of the United States of America to initiate the \n     process of admission of Puerto Rico as the 51st state of the \n     United States of America; to the Committee on Energy and \n     Natural Resources.\n\n                           Resolution No. 27\n\n       Whereas, Since the discovery of Puerto Rico in 1493 to the \n     year 1898, the Island was a colony of Spain and from 1898 to \n     the present, it has been a colony of the United States, \n     making Puerto Rico the oldest colony of the Western \n     Hemisphere.\n       Whereas, According to the Unites States Census Bureau, \n     Puerto Ricans who reside in the Island are approximately 3.7 \n     million inhabitants, whereas 4.3 million Puerto Ricans reside \n     in the fifty (50) states of the Union. Although those that \n     live in Puerto Rico and in the U.S. mainland are American \n     citizens by birth, those that reside in Puerto Rico do not \n     have all the privileges, rights and obligations of U.S. \n     citizenship.\n       Whereas, The American citizens who reside in the fifty \n     states of the Union enjoy all the economic, social and \n     political benefits, since they reside in one of the states of \n     the Nation.\n       Whereas, Many of the 4.3 million American citizens of \n     Puerto Rican origin who reside in the states, are \n     professionals in the fields of health, the sciences, \n     security, education and politic that have moved from the \n     Island looking for better quality of life and the totality of \n     the rights and privileges that being a citizen of the great \n     American Nation offers. In addition, they are part of the \n     Hispanic labor force that moves the economy of the Federation \n     of the States.\n       Whereas, The question that we should ask ourselves is: how \n     can the 3.7 million American citizens who live in Puerto Rico \n     reach the fullness of our U.S. citizenship, that is, to be \n     American citizens one hundred percent (100%) with all the \n     rights, privileges and obligations.\n       Whereas, This can be obtained by two forms. First, by means \n     of moving or relocating to any of the fifty (50) states of \n     the great American Nation; or second, by granting the \n     Territory of Puerto Rico the opportunity to become the 51st \n     State of the Union. In this way, we will be able to reach the \n     full rights held by American citizens who reside in the fifty \n     (50) states.\n       Whereas, Puerto Ricans through the vote in the plebiscite \n     of November 6, 2012, rejected by an ample majority the \n     current territorial status known as Commonwealth and favored \n     statehood by an overwhelming majority of the voters among the \n     status options presented in the ballot: Now, therefore, be it \n     Resolved by the Municipal Legislature of Moca, Puerto Rico, \n     the following:\n       Section 1: Request President Barack Obama and the Congress \n     of the United States, initiate the process of admission of \n     Puerto Rico as the 51st State of the United States of \n     America.\n       Section 2: This Resolution will be approved in both \n     official languages of Puerto Rico, Spanish and English.\n       Section 3: This Resolution will take effect immediately \n     upon passage by the Municipal Legislature and signed by the \n     Mayor.\n       Section 4: Copies of this Resolution shall be sent to the \n     President of the United States, the Vice-President of the \n     United States, the Secretary of State of the United States, \n     and to all the Members of the United States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-170. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of California relative to the federal Renewable \n     Fuel Standard program; to the Committee on Environment and \n     Public Works.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 21\n\n       Whereas, The Renewable Fuel Standard program was created \n     under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, and established the \n     first renewable fuel volume mandate in the United States; and\n       Whereas, The Energy Policy Act of 2005 required 7.5 billion \n     gallons of renewable fuel to be blended into gasoline by 2012 \n     and, under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, \n     the Renewable Fuel Standard program was expanded to include \n     diesel, in addition to gasoline; and\n       Whereas, The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 \n     increased the volume of renewable fuel required to be blended \n     into transportation fuel from 9 billion gallons in 2008 to 36 \n     billion gallons by 2022; and\n       Whereas, The 2013 requirement of cornstarch-derived ethanol \n     of 13.8 billion gallons represents approximately 84 percent \n     of the total renewable fuel mandated in the Energy \n     Independence and Security Act of 2007; and\n       Whereas, At the time that the Renewable Fuel Standard \n     program became law, the daily price of a metric ton of corn \n     used in biofuel ethanol production was $99, and at the time \n     the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 became law, \n     the daily price of a metric ton of corn used in biofuel \n     ethanol production had risen to nearly $180, with the latest \n     price of a metric ton of corn currently reported by the \n     United States Department of Agriculture as approximately \n     $310, representing an increase of over 300 percent since the \n     inception of the Renewable Fuel Standard program; and\n       Whereas, The Environmental Protection Agency has determined \n     that as a result of the Renewable Fuel Standard program, the \n     increase in overall commodity prices expected as a result of \n     the demand for agricultural products used in biofuel \n     production will result in an annual increase of food costs to \n     consumers of over $3 billion by 2022; and\n       Whereas, Agriculture is a vital component of California's \n     economic livelihood with livestock, poultry and related \n     products, accounting for approximately 26 percent, or $12.4 \n     billion of California's gross agricultural cash income in \n     2011; and\n       Whereas, California leads the nation in milk production \n     with over 1.75 million dairy cows that primarily depend on \n     feed corn; and\n       Whereas, The loss of alternative feedstock acreage to \n     biofuel crop production combined with the unprecedented rise \n     in corn prices due to the requirements of the Renewable Fuel \n     Standard program have significantly contributed to the loss \n     of dairy production capacity in California, as represented by \n     the 387 California dairies that have gone out of business \n     since 2007, with over 100 dairy farms lost in 2012 alone: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and the Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature recognize and \n     support the benefits from a robust and thriving agricultural \n     sector, and join a diverse group of businesses, industry \n     representatives, and beef, dairy, and poultry producers \n     across California in urging Congress to reform the Renewable \n     Fuel Standard program, or the United States Environmental \n     Protection Agency to use all available authority, to \n     expeditiously transition away from biofuel sources that \n     compete with food production, as well as implement aggressive \n     mechanisms to promote the development of advanced, \n     sustainable noncrop-based fuels, including, but not limited \n     to, cellulosic ethanol; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, to the Minority Leader of the House of \n     Representatives, to the Majority Leader of the Senate, to the \n     Minority Leader of the Senate, and to each Senator and \n     Representative from California in the Congress of the United \n     States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-171. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of California relative to Sickle Cell Anemia \n     Awareness Month; to the Committee on Health, Education, \n     Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 28\n\n       Whereas, Sickle cell anemia and sickle cell disease, used \n     interchangeably, refer to a group of inherited disorders that \n     affect the red blood cells; and\n       Whereas, Sickle cell anemia is a disease in which a \n     person's body produces abnormally shaped red blood cells that \n     resemble a crescent or sickle, and which do not last as long \n     as normal round red blood cells, which leads to anemia. The \n     sickle cells also get stuck in blood vessels and block blood \n     flow, which can cause pain and organ damage; and\n       Whereas, Sickle cell anemia is a genetic disorder where \n     individuals with the disease are born with two sickle cell \n     genes, each inherited from one parent. An individual with \n     only one sickle cell gene has a ``sickle cell trait,'' which \n     occurs in one out of every 12 African Americans and in one \n     out of every 100 Latinos in the United States; and\n       Whereas, Unlike most people with sickle cell anemia, most \n     people who have a sickle cell trait never know they have it \n     and can live their entire lives without any complications \n     from it; and\n       Whereas, Serious problems associated with a sickle cell \n     trait are rare. However, exercise-related sudden death in \n     individuals who have a sickle cell trait most commonly occurs \n     in those undergoing intense physical exertion, such as \n     military recruits in basic training and athletes during \n     conditioning workouts; and\n\n[[Page S23]]\n\n       Whereas, Individuals with a sickle cell trait should not be \n     excluded from physical activity, including sports, unless \n     recommended to by medical personnel. Instead, people should \n     be educated about precautions that should be taken, including \n     drinking adequate amounts of fluids, pacing training with \n     longer periods of rest and recovery, avoiding participation \n     in performance tests such as sprints and mile runs, and, most \n     importantly, being familiar with the symptoms of \n     overexertion; and\n       Whereas, It is estimated that more than 90,000 Americans \n     have sickle cell anemia. Sickle cell anemia occurs in one out \n     of every 500 African American births and in one out of every \n     36,000 Latino births; and\n       Whereas, Sickle cell anemia can be a life-threatening \n     condition, and access to comprehensive care can be limited by \n     social, economic, cultural, and geographic barriers; and\n       Whereas, The average cost of hospitalization for sickle \n     cell anemia in 2004 was $6,223, for more than 84,000 hospital \n     admissions that year. Total hospitalization costs for \n     individuals with sickle cell anemia equaled $488,000,000, of \n     which 65 percent were covered by Medicaid funds; and\n       Whereas, Individuals living with sickle cell anemia \n     encounter barriers to obtaining quality care and improving \n     their quality of life. These barriers include limitations in \n     geographic access to comprehensive care, the varied use of \n     effective treatments, the high reliance on emergency \n     departments and on public health programs, and the limited \n     number of health care providers with knowledge and experience \n     to manage and treat sickle cell anemia; and\n       Whereas, The Sickle Cell Anemia Control Act was signed into \n     law in 1972 by President Richard Nixon after pledging that \n     his administration would ``reverse the record of neglect on \n     the dreaded disease'' by increasing funding for and expanding \n     sickle cell anemia-related programs, including the \n     development of comprehensive sickle cell anemia centers; and\n       Whereas, In 1975, the Sickle Cell Disease Association of \n     America, Inc. and its member organizations began conducting \n     monthlong events in September to call attention to sickle \n     cell anemia and the need to address the problem at national \n     and local levels, and chose September as National Sickle Cell \n     Awareness Month in order for the public to reflect on the \n     children and adults whose lives, education, and careers have \n     been affected by this disease; and\n       Whereas, In 2003, the Sickle Cell Treatment Act was signed \n     into law; and\n       Whereas, The effort to officially recognize Sickle Cell \n     AnemiaAwareness Month succeeded at the federal level in 1983 \n     when the United States House of Representatives unanimously \n     passed, and President Ronald Reagan signed, the first \n     resolution introduced by the Congressional Black Caucus that \n     recognized September as National Sickle Cell AnemiaAwareness \n     Month: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and the Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly,That the Legislature recognizes September \n     2013, and each September thereafter, as Sickle Cell Anemia \n     Awareness Month; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature urges the Congress of the \n     United States to support the President's continuation of \n     funding for the Sickle Cell Disease Treatment Demonstration \n     Program, the Registry and Surveillance System for \n     Hemoglobinopathy Program Initiative, and the Public Health \n     ApproachDisorders program, and to make sickle cell anemia and \n     other genetic hemoglobin disorders a public health priority; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives, the President pro Tempore of the United \n     States Senate, each Senator and Representative from \n     California in the Congress of the United States, and to the \n     author for appropriate distribution.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-172.

Many of our nation's leading companies, \n     such as Dow Chemical and Masco, were founded by immigrants. \n     In Michigan, one-third of high-tech businesses over the last \n     decade were started by immigrants; and\n       Whereas, Our nation remains a leader in developing foreign \n     talent. U.S. universities and colleges educate hundreds of \n     thousands of international students each year. In Michigan, \n     more than 25,000 international students attend Michigan's \n     higher education institutions, ninth most in the nation. Over \n     37 percent of individuals receiving doctorate degrees in \n     science, technology, engineering, and mathematics nationwide \n     are international students; and\n       Whereas, We are failing as a nation to retain foreigners \n     educated in the United States and to welcome talented \n     professionals from other nations. Under the H-1B temporary \n     work visa program, highly educated scientists, engineers, \n     computer programmers, and other technical experts may \n     immigrate to the United States for employment. However, the \n     federal government severely limits the number of visas \n     available. Only 65,000 new H-1B visas are available each year \n     to individuals with a bachelor's degree or higher, with an \n     additional 20,000 visas available to individuals with a U.S. \n     master's degree or higher; and\n       Whereas, The federal cap on H-1B visas is not meeting the \n     demand of U.S. businesses. The 2013 caps were reached in just \n     over two months. These arbitrary caps are holding back \n     economic growth in Michigan and the rest of the United \n     States. These caps should be based on a data-driven approach \n     that, along with the availability of qualified American \n     workers, factors in the positive impact of immigrant \n     professionals to jobs and entrepreneurialism in our economy. \n     In a highly competitive global environment, the United States \n     cannot afford to turn back the brightest and most talented \n     people. Our nation's loss will inevitably be another nation's \n     gain: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we urge \n     Congress to raise permanently the cap on new H-1B temporary \n     work visas available to immigrant professionals and to \n     eliminate the cap for those holding a master's degree or \n     higher from U.S. universities; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-177.

In February 2013, two interpreters \n     were gunned down in Logar Province, south of Kabul, \n     Afghanistan. In December 2012, an interpreter working in \n     Jalalabad was singled out while heading home on leave, and \n     Taliban assailants killed his two brothers in the attack; and\n       Whereas, The United Nations has reported that casualties \n     resulting from targeted killings of civilians by \n     antigovernment elements increased by 53 percent in the first \n     six months of 2012, in comparison to the corresponding period \n     in 2011; and\n       Whereas, The federal Afghan Allies Protection Act of 2009 \n     authorizes the issuance of up to 1,500 special immigrant \n     visas (SIVs) annually through the 2013 fiscal year to Afghan \n     nationals who have worked for or on behalf of the United \n     States Government in Afghanistan and who find their lives in \n     danger as a consequence of their employment; and\n       Whereas, Although 7,500 SIVs were intended to be issued by \n     the federal Afghan Allies Protection Act of 2009, only about \n     1,000 have been issued to date, and as of last fall, there \n     was a backlog of more than 5,000 applicants waiting to begin \n     the process. This delay further risks the lives of important, \n     dedicated allies who have already risked their lives in the \n     call of duty to our soldiers and our country; and\n       Whereas, There are significant differences between the visa \n     programs created for Iraq and Afghanistan. While the Iraq \n     program allowed for up to 25,000 visas, the Afghan Allies \n     Protection Act of 2009 only makes 7,500 visas available. \n     Additionally, the Afghan visa program limits family members \n     to only a spouse and dependent children under 21 years of \n     age, while the Iraq program allowed for parents, siblings, \n     and all children; and\n       Whereas, The Afghan Allies Protection Act of 2009 presents \n     the opportunity to save the lives of Afghans who saved the \n     lives of Americans and to maintain our commitment to these \n     important allies who are in harm's way: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and the Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature calls upon the \n     United States Congress and the President's administration to \n     expedite actions at the United States Department of State to \n     process the visa applications of our Afghan allies who have \n     been identified and vetted by the United States military or \n     other agencies as having risked their lives by supporting and \n     working for United States troops overseas, and to expand the \n     number of visas offered to our Afghan allies; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, the Leader of the United States House of \n     Representatives, the Majority Leader of the Senate, the \n     Minority Leader of the Senate, and each Senator and \n     Representative from California in the Congress of the United \n     States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-178.

It separates families, including same-sex couple \n     families, creates long backlogs for families seeking \n     reunification, and neglects the hard work and financial \n     contributions immigrants make to our country; and\n       Whereas, Since 2008, more than 1.6 million immigrants have \n     been deported, and one in every 10 American children faces \n     the threat of the deportation of a parent; and\n       Whereas, It is estimated that about 11 million undocumented \n     immigrants are in the United States, and California has the \n     largest population of immigrants, both legal and \n     undocumented; and\n       Whereas, Immigrants and their children constitute nearly \n     one-half of California's population and live and work in all \n     58 counties, most notably in the San Diego, Central Valley, \n     Los Angeles, Ventura, and greater San Francisco areas; and\n       Whereas, Approximately 77 percent of undocumented \n     immigrants who reside in California live with family members \n     who are legal United States residents and citizens; and\n       Whereas, One in 10 workers in California is an undocumented \n     immigrant, and immigrants are vibrant, productive, and vital \n     part of the state's growing economy; and\n       Whereas, Immigrants are essential in keeping the American \n     economy strong; from technology programmers in the Silicon \n     Valley to restaurant owners and workers, immigrants are \n     filling an intrinsic need in the labor force; and\n       Whereas, Agricultural workers have been performing very \n     important and difficult work to maintain America's food \n     supply, and have a role of ensuring that Americans have safe \n     and secure agricultural products to sell and consume; and\n       Whereas, Students should not be punished for their \n     immigration status. Instead, they should be given recognition \n     for their sacrifice, hard work, and determination; and\n       Whereas, The United States can do a better job of \n     attracting and keeping the world's best and brightest. A \n     comprehensive immigration reform should also grant immigrants \n     who have received a Ph.D. or master's degree in science, \n     technology, engineering, or mathematics from an American \n     university the opportunity to invest in and contribute to \n     this great nation. For the future of our economy, it makes no \n     sense to educate the world's future innovators and \n     entrepreneurs only to ultimately force them to leave our \n     country at the moment they are most able to contribute to our \n     economy; and\n       Whereas, Modernizing our antiquated and dysfunctional \n     immigration system will uphold our nation's basic values of \n     fairness and equality, as well as access to health care; and\n       Whereas, A comprehensive, as well as compassionate, \n     approach to solve our broken immigration system should be one \n     that works for all communities and families in America; and\n       Whereas, A just immigration reform must ensure that it \n     reflects one of our basic values--that we all are created \n     equal--thus immigration reform must recognize each \n     immigrant's full humanity; and\n       Whereas; A proposal must be comprised of tenets that \n     achieve all of the following: (1) establish an earned \n     citizenship process that requires immigrants to pay back \n     taxes and learn English; (2) enhance security in our ports of \n     entry to secure our nation; (3) reform immigration \n     enforcement programs that separate families to ensure that \n     family unification systems are strengthened; (4) upgrade the \n     current visa programs, including the creation of a guest \n     worker program for agricultural workers, in order to have a \n     legal workforce and a system that better enforces labor \n     protections; and (5) uphold due process as well as the \n     inherent rights of all immigrants: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the Assembly and the Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature urges the President \n     and the Congress of the United States to take a humane and \n     just approach to solving our nation's broken immigration \n     system; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and the Vice \n     President of the United States, to the Speaker of the House \n     of Representatives, to the Majority Leader of the Senate, and \n     to each Senator and Representative from California in the \n     Congress of the United States, to the Governor of California, \n     and to the author of this resolution.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-179. A joint resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     State of California relative to the Startup Act 3.0; to the \n     Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 9\n\n       Whereas, The United States is a nation of immigrants, with \n     a long history of welcoming indigents from other nations and \n     giving them a chance at achieving the American Dream; and\n       Whereas, immigrants have formed the backbone of the \n     nation's economy; and\n       Whereas, Open economies grow faster than closed ones, and \n     as a beacon of hope, America has historically had an \n     unbeatable advantage over societies that shut immigrants out, \n     or stifled their creative and innovative spirit; and\n       Whereas, The United States economy has been enriched by the \n     innovative and entrepreneurial spirit of immigrants from \n     around the world; and\n       Whereas, According to the Kauffman Foundation on \n     Entrepreneurship, of the current Fortune 500 companies, \n     including Apple, Google, and eBay, more than 40 percent were \n     founded by first- or second-generation Americans, and these \n     companies employ more than 10 million people; and\n       Whereas, Foreign nationals residing in the United States \n     were named as inventors or coinventors in one-quarter of all \n     patent applications filed in 2006; and\n       Whereas, Fifty-two percent of Silicon Valley startups \n     between 1995 and 2005 were founded or cofounded by \n     immigrants, generating $52 billion in revenues and employing \n     450,000 workers; and\n       Whereas, In the past seven years, the national rate of \n     startups by immigrants has dropped to 42 percent according to \n     scholars at Harvard and Duke Universities; and\n       Whereas, The number of foreign nationals with advanced \n     degrees awaiting permanent-resident status in the United \n     States has grown to over one million in the past several \n     years; and\n       Whereas, Under current law, only around 120,000 visas are \n     available annually for skilled workers hi key employment \n     categories and only 7 percent of these visas can be allocated \n     to immigrants from any one country. So immigrants from \n     countries with large populations, like India and China, which \n     are the source of the vast majority of startups in the United \n     States, have access to only 8,400 visas per year; and\n\n[[Page S26]]\n\n       Whereas, The result of this policy is that many of these \n     highly skilled immigrants must wait more than a decade for \n     visas; and\n       Whereas, Many of these highly skilled innovators are \n     deciding instead to return home, or immigrate to other \n     countries that welcome them with open arms, such as \n     Singapore, Canada, Dubai, Australia, the United Kingdom, and \n     Chile. As a result, these innovators are founding companies \n     in these other countries and competing with American \n     companies for market share; and\n       Whereas, The issue of illegal immigration has taken on \n     national prominence in recent years and the resolution of the \n     broader issue should be the result of bipartisan efforts; and\n       Whereas, United States Senators Jerry Moran (R-Kansas), \n     Mark Warner (D-Virginia), Chris Coons (D-Delaware), and Roy \n     Blunt (R-Missouri) have introduced S. 310, and United States \n     House Representatives Michael Grimm (R-New York), Loretta \n     Sanchez (D-California), and others have introduced H.R. 714 \n     in the 113th Congress of the United States, and this \n     legislation is known as the Startup Act 3.0; and\n       Whereas, Entrepreneurs and highly skilled workers can \n     contribute to the continued success of the nation and further \n     the development of an innovation-based economy that will help \n     future generations compete in the global marketplace; and\n       Whereas, There has been bipartisan support in Congress for \n     proposed changes to immigration law seeking to create new \n     jobs and drive economic growth; such as:\n       (1) Creation of an Entrepreneur's Visa for up to 75,000 \n     legal immigrants who start up new businesses to create jobs \n     in the United States with a path to permanent residency if \n     their businesses continue to hire more workers.\n       (2) Authorization to adjust the status of not more than \n     50,000 aliens who have earned a master's degree or a \n     doctorate degree at an American institution of higher \n     education in a STEM field (science, technology, engineering, \n     or mathematics) to that of aliens conditionally admitted for \n     permanent residence to remain in this country.\n       (3) Elimination of per-country caps for employment-based \n     immigrant visas: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and the Assembly of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature urge the United \n     States Congress and the President to establish new \n     entrepreneur and STEM-related visa categories for legal \n     immigrants as part of comprehensive federal immigration \n     reform; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate transmit copies \n     of this resolution to the President and Vice President of the \n     United States, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, to the Majority Leader of the Senate, and to \n     each Senator and Representative from California in the \n     Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-180. A joint resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     State of California relative to firearms; to the Committee on \n     the Judiciary.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 1\n\n       Whereas, The Sandy Hook Elementary School mass shooting in \n     Newtown, Connecticut, which resulted in the death of 20 \n     children and 6 adults, demonstrated the need for stronger \n     laws to prevent gun violence; and\n       Whereas, Numerous factors contribute to the occurrence of \n     mass shootings, including unregulated access to assault \n     weapons and assault magazines, insufficient background \n     checks, and needed improvements to our mental health system, \n     among others; and\n       Whereas, Semiautomatic assault weapons designed with \n     military features allow for the rapid fire of potentially \n     large numbers of bullets, and are distinguishable from \n     standard sporting firearms by features such as the ability to \n     accept a detachable magazine, pistol grips, and folding or \n     telescoping stocks; and\n       Whereas, Semiautomatic assault weapons are frequently used \n     in mass shootings, including the 1993 101 California Street \n     shooting in San Francisco that involved two TEC-9 \n     semiautomatic handguns, and the recent Aurora, Colorado, \n     shooting that involved an AR-15 style semiautomatic assault \n     rifle with a 100-round ammunition drum; and\n       Whereas, The United States Supreme Court has affirmed once \n     and for all that Americans have a right to keep and bear \n     arms. However, as conservative justice Antonin Scalia \n     outlined, the District of Columbia v. Heller decision does \n     not prohibit laws forbidding firearms in places such as \n     schools or regulation of unusually dangerous weapons, nor \n     does it restrict laws prohibiting felons and the mentally ill \n     from carrying guns; and\n       Whereas, The National Firearms Act of 1934 regulates the \n     possession and transfer of fully automatic machine guns \n     through background checks, registration, and excise taxes, \n     but individual states are able to enact their own stronger \n     gun legislation and regulations which may or may not be \n     similar to other states; and\n       Whereas, Seven states, including California, have enacted \n     laws strictly regulating the possession, manufacture, and \n     transfer of assault weapons; and\n       Whereas, Because our borders are porous and only a small \n     number of states regulate assault weapons and high-capacity \n     assault magazines, states, like California, that take steps \n     to protect their communities from these weapons are \n     vulnerable to criminals who use those weapons without a \n     comprehensive federal approach to curb gun violence; and\n       Whereas, It is estimated that 40 percent of firearm \n     transfers are completed without a federal background check, \n     including the transfer of semiautomatic firearms from a \n     private collection; and\n       Whereas, California requires background checks for all \n     firearms sales and transfers through various means; and\n       Whereas, Nine categories of individuals are prohibited from \n     purchasing and possessing firearms, including the dangerously \n     mentally ill; and\n       Whereas, Mental health records are reported by the state \n     and imported into the National Instant Criminal Background \n     Check System, but currently many state and federal agencies \n     are not fully participating in this system: now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and the Assembly of the State of \n     California, jointly, That a comprehensive federal approach to \n     reducing and preventing gun violence is needed to protect the \n     Second Amendment rights of law abiding citizens while \n     ensuring that our communities are safe from future mass \n     shootings; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature urges the President and the \n     Congress of the United States to promptly place under the \n     scope of the National Firearms Act generically defined \n     assault weapons, as now is the case with California, and \n     high-capacity assault magazines; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a universal background check through the \n     National Instant Criminal Background Check System should be \n     required for the transfer of all firearms; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the President of the United States should \n     take steps to ensure all states and applicable federal \n     agencies are reporting all necessary records to the National \n     Instant Criminal Background Check System; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate transmit copies \n     of this resolution to the President and Vice President of the \n     United States, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, to the Majority Leader of the Senate to each \n     Senator and Representative from California in the Congress of \n     the United States, and to the author for appropriate \n     distribution.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-181. A joint resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     State of California relative to immigration; to the Committee \n     on the Judiciary.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 8\n\n       Whereas, This country was built by immigrants seeking a \n     better life; and\n       Whereas, Estimates suggest there are 11 million \n     undocumented immigrants living in the shadows in the United \n     States, including millions of children brought to this \n     country undocumented who have grown up here and call the \n     United States home, suffering from the dysfunctional \n     immigration policy; and\n       Whereas, A logical and streamlined path to citizenship for \n     individuals after they gain legal status would stimulate the \n     economy by allowing them to get college degrees and driver's \n     licenses, buy homes, start new companies, and create legal, \n     tax-paying jobs, affording them a chance at the American \n     Dream; and\n       Whereas, The United States Congress last enacted major \n     immigration legislation more than 25 years ago; and\n       Whereas, Since that time, fragmented attempts at \n     immigration reform have failed to create rational and \n     effective systems needed to maintain international \n     competitiveness. Whether in an industry like agriculture, \n     which requires large numbers of workers able to perform \n     physically demanding tasks, or in technology or health care, \n     where the demand for employees with advanced degrees is \n     projected to exceed supply within the next five years, \n     immigration policy must be designed to `respond to emerging \n     labor needs. in all sectors of the United States economy; and\n       Whereas, Our national interests and security are not served \n     by our outdated, inefficient, and slow-moving immigration \n     system. Patchwork attempts to mend its deficiencies undermine \n     our potential for prosperity and leave us vulnerable and \n     unable to meet the needs of the modern world; and\n       Whereas, To help our country recover from the financial \n     crisis, labor mobility is crucial to our economic prosperity. \n     Yet our rigid, outdated immigration policies are making it \n     difficult for our companies and our nation to compete. \n     Information released in a study by the University of \n     California, Los Angeles, stated that legalizing the status of \n     undocumented immigrants working and living in the United \n     States would create around $1.5 trillion in additional gross \n     domestic product growth over the next 10 years and increase \n     wages for all workers. A study done by the University of \n     California, Davis, indicates that the last large wave of \n     immigrants, from 1990 to 2007, raised the income of the \n     native-born American worker by an average of $5,000; and\n       Whereas, California has the largest share of immigrants in \n     the country. They are a vital and productive part of our \n     state's economy and are active in a variety of industries, \n     including technology, biotech, hospitality, agriculture, \n     construction, services, transportation, and textiles. They \n     also represent a large share of our new small business owners \n     and create economic prosperity and needed jobs for everyone; \n     and\n       Whereas, Keeping these families, business owners, and hard \n     workers in the shadows of society serves no one; and\n\n[[Page S27]]\n\n       Whereas, Our state, for economic, social, health, security, \n     and prosperity reasons, must support policies that allow \n     individuals to become legal and enfranchised participants in \n     our society and economy; and\n       Whereas, Comprehensive immigration reform should include a \n     reasonable and timely path to citizenship for undocumented \n     immigrants living and working in the United States already. \n     It should include comprehensive background checks, and \n     require demonstrated proficiency in English and payment of \n     all current and back taxes, and should have the flexibility \n     to respond to emerging business trends; and\n       Whereas, The Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan \n     research group in Washington, D.C., estimated that in 2012 \n     the federal government spent $18 billion on immigration \n     enforcement and that the number of United States Border \n     Patrol agents has doubled since 2004; and\n       Whereas, Increased enforcement has given the federal \n     government the ability to prioritize the deportation of \n     lawbreakers and dangerous individuals and to ensure our \n     border's security. Nevertheless, this enforcement should not \n     be done in an inhumane way; and\n       Whereas, Immigration enforcement should continue to focus \n     on criminals, not on hardworking immigrant families, and not \n     at the expense of efficient trade with two of our top three \n     economic partners; and\n       Whereas, The United States loses large numbers of \n     necessary, highly skilled workers due to the lengthy and \n     complicated processes currently in place to get or keep a \n     legal residency option; and\n       Whereas, Reform should also include an expedited process \n     for those residing abroad and applying for legal visas. \n     Additionally, reform should offer permanent residency \n     opportunities to international students in American \n     universities who are highly trained and in high demand, and \n     in so doing avoid an intellectual vacuum after their \n     graduation; and\n       Whereas, This reform should recognize the societal and \n     cultural benefits of keeping the family unit intact. The \n     system should take into account special circumstances \n     surrounding candidates for probationary legal status, such as \n     those of minors brought to the country as children or workers \n     whose labor is essential to maintain our country's \n     competitiveness: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and the Assembly of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature urges the President \n     and the Congress of the United States to take a comprehensive \n     and workable approach to solving our nation's historically \n     broken immigration system, using the principles described in \n     this resolution; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate transmit copies \n     of this resolution to the President and the Vice President of \n     the United States, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, to the Majority Leader of the Senate, and to \n     each Senator and Representative from California in the \n     Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-182. A resolution adopted by the Municipal Legislature \n     of Aguada, Puerto Rico relative to urging the President of \n     the United States of America to immediately and \n     unconditionally release a political prisoner; to the \n     Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                           Resolution No. 19\n\n       Whereas, Section 5005 of Act No. 81 of August 30, 1991, as \n     amended, known as ``Autonomous Municipalities Act of the \n     Commonwealth of Puerto Rico'', provides that the Municipal \n     Legislature may approve those ordinances, resolutions and \n     regulations on issues and matters of competition or municipal \n     jurisdiction, pursuant to this Act or any other law, must be \n     submitted for consideration or approval.\n       Whereas, Oscar Lopez Rivera has been jailed for more than \n     32 years in the United States, serving a sentence for reasons \n     related to the struggle for the independence of Puerto Rico. \n     Other political prisoners serving sentences equally \n     disproportionate have since been released, first under \n     President Jimmy Carter and then, in 1999, being president, \n     William J. Clinton, Oscar is the political prisoner serving \n     the longest prison sentence, surpassing the Nobel Peace Prize \n     and former South African President Nelson Mandela.\n       Whereas, A cause for the release of Oscar Lopez has joined \n     Puerto Ricans of all faiths. Political, religious and civic \n     organizations have called for Oscar back home. His prolonged \n     confinement, far from serving any purpose, it has become a \n     sign of inhumanity and injustice. The consensus forged in \n     Puerto Rico for the freedom of Oscar, also have joined \n     international entities.\n       Whereas, The Municipal Legislature joins Aguada, in turn, \n     in a gesture of solidarity, to request the President of the \n     United States, Barack Hussein Obama, making use of its \n     prerogatives, available for immediate and unconditional \n     release of Oscar Lopez Rivera: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Municipal Legislature of Aguada, Puerto \n     Rico, the following:\n       Section 1st: Aguada Municipal Legislature requests the \n     President of the United States of America, Barack Hussein \n     Obama, who in the exercise of its powers granted immediate \n     and unconditional freedom of Oscar Lopez Rivera.\n       Section 2nd: Copies of this Resolution, translated into \n     English, will be sent to the President and the Presidents of \n     both legislative bodies of the Congress of the United States.\n       Section 3rd: This Resolution shall take effect immediately \n     after its approval.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-183. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of California relative to veterans; to the \n     Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 19\n\n       Whereas, In 1993, congress adopted a policy known as Don't \n     Ask, Don't Tell (DADT), prohibiting service personnel from \n     inquiring, or volunteering information, about their sexual \n     orientation. Prior to 1993, federal law and military \n     regulations prohibited homosexuality in the Armed Forces of \n     the United States; and\n       Whereas, From 1980 until the repeal of DADT in 2011, over \n     32,000 service personnel were separated from the Armed Forces \n     of the United States under DADT and its predecessor policies; \n     and\n       Whereas, More than 13,000 service personnel were separated \n     from the Armed Forces of the United States after the adoption \n     of DADT. Approximately one-quarter of these discharges \n     occurred during the service member's first four months of \n     service; and\n       Whereas, California law prohibits discrimination on the \n     basis of race, national origin, ethnic group identification, \n     religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, color, genetic \n     information, or disability; and\n       Whereas, Generally, veterans separated from the military \n     with a discharge that is characterized as ``dishonorable'' or \n     ``other than honorable'' are ineligible to receive federal or \n     state veterans' benefits, including applicable spousal \n     benefits; and\n       Whereas, Section 711.1 of the Military and Veterans Code \n     assists veterans by requiring the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs to provide Internet resources, Internet links, and \n     printed materials regarding, or created by, veterans' legal \n     services organizations that specialize in military discharge \n     upgrades, or links to Internet resources that provide \n     information and printed resources provided by veterans' legal \n     services organizations. It also provides that if the federal \n     government acts to provide benefits to discharged veterans \n     who were denied those benefits solely on the basis of sexual \n     orientation pursuant to any federal policy prohibiting \n     homosexual personnel from serving in the Armed Forces of the \n     United States, the state shall provide to those veterans any \n     state-offered benefits; and\n       Whereas, We must work to ensure that California veterans \n     who were discriminated against solely on the basis of their \n     sexual orientation can access benefits regardless of the \n     classification of their discharge: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and the Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature urges Congress and \n     the President to provide benefits, including applicable \n     spousal benefits, to those veterans discriminated against \n     solely on the basis of their sexual orientation; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, to the Majority Leader of the Senate, and to \n     each Senator and Representative from California in the \n     Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-184.

A bill to establish a commission to examine the United \nStates monetary policy, evaluate alternative monetary regimes, and \nrecommend a course for monetary policy going forward; to the Committee \non Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1895\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Centennial Monetary \n     Commission Act of 2013''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Constitution endows Congress with the power ``to \n     coin money, regulate the value thereof''.\n       (2) Following the financial crisis known as the Panic of \n     1907, Congress established the\n\n[[Page S29]]\n\n     National Monetary Commission to provide recommendations for \n     the reform of the financial and monetary systems of the \n     United States.\n       (3) Incorporating several of the recommendations of the \n     National Monetary Commission, Congress created the Federal \n     Reserve System in 1913. As currently organized, the Federal \n     Reserve System consists of the Board of Governors in \n     Washington, District of Columbia, and the Federal Reserve \n     Banks organized into 12 districts around the United States. \n     The stockholders of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks include \n     national and certain state-chartered commercial banks, which \n     operate on a fractional reserve basis.\n       (4) Originally, Congress gave the Federal Reserve a \n     monetary mandate to provide an elastic currency, within the \n     context of a gold standard, in response to seasonal \n     fluctuations in the demand for currency.\n       (5) Congress also gave the Federal Reserve a financial \n     stability mandate to serve as the lender of last resort to \n     solvent but illiquid banks during a financial crisis.\n       (6) In 1977, Congress changed the monetary mandate of the \n     Federal Reserve to a dual mandate for maximum employment and \n     stable prices.\n       (7) Empirical studies and historical evidence, both within \n     the United States and in other countries, demonstrate that \n     price stability is desirable because both inflation and \n     deflation damage the economy.\n       (8) The economic challenge of recent years--most notably \n     the bursting of the housing bubble, the financial crisis of \n     2008, and the ensuing anemic recovery--have occurred at great \n     cost in terms of lost jobs and output.\n       (9) Policymakers are reexamining the structure and \n     functioning of financial institutions and markets to \n     determine what, if any, changes need to be made to place the \n     financial system on a stronger, more sustainable path going \n     forward.\n       (10) The Federal Reserve has taken extraordinary actions in \n     response to the recent economic challenges.\n       (11) The Federal Open Market Committee has engaged in \n     multiple rounds of quantitative easing, providing \n     unprecedented liquidity to financial markets, while \n     committing to holding short-term interest rates low for a \n     seemingly indefinite period, and pursuing a policy of credit \n     allocation by purchasing Federal agency debt and mortgage-\n     backed securities.\n       (12) In the wake of the recent extraordinary actions of the \n     Federal Reserve, Congress--consistent with its constitutional \n     responsibilities and as it has done periodically throughout \n     the history of the United States--has once again renewed its \n     examination of monetary policy.\n       (13) Central in such examination has been a renewed look at \n     what is the most proper mandate for the Federal Reserve to \n     conduct monetary policy in the 21st century.\n\n     SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT.\n\n       There is established a commission to be known as the \n     ``Centennial Monetary Commission'' (in this Act referred to \n     as the ``Commission'').\n\n     SEC. 4.

Res. 328\n\n       Whereas, on September 27, 2013, the President of Iran, \n     Hassan Rouhani, and President Barack Obama engaged in the \n     first direct contact between Iranian and United States \n     leaders since 1979;\n       Whereas the Government of Iran has yet to take any \n     practical steps towards halting Iran's nuclear programs and \n     remains a committed state-sponsor of terrorist groups that \n     have been responsible for American deaths in Lebanon, Saudi \n     Arabia, Iraq, and Afghanistan;\n       Whereas, since the election of President Rouhani, the \n     persecution by the Government of Iran of religious \n     minorities, notably Christians, has increased not decreased;\n       Whereas United States citizens remain imprisoned in Iran, \n     including Pastor Saeed Abedini, Amir Hekmati, and Robert \n     Levinson;\n       Whereas President Rouhani has called Israel the ``Zionist \n     state'' that has been ``a wound that has sat on the body of \n     the Muslim world for years and needs to be removed'', and \n     Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei has called Israel a \n     ``rabid dog'' facing ``annihilation'';\n       Whereas a Joint Plan of Action was released from Geneva on \n     November 24, 2013, outlining first step, voluntary measures \n     to be taken over a six month duration providing the \n     Government of Iran with some $7,000,000,000 in relief from \n     economic sanctions, while extracting no substantive \n     concessions from Iran on their nuclear program; and\n       Whereas the representatives of the United States engaging \n     in these negotiations failed to raise the issue of the United \n     States citizens imprisoned in Iran and to rebuke their \n     Iranian counterparts for their vicious rhetoric against \n     Israel at the highest levels: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That is it the sense of the Senate that, before \n     further bilateral negotiations between the Government of Iran \n     and the United States Government occur, the Government of \n     Iran must--\n       (1) immediately and without conditions release all United \n     States citizens unjustly detained in Iran; and\n       (2) publicly affirm the right of Israel to exist as a \n     Jewish state.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/06/senate-section/article/S30-2", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S30]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PRIVILEGES OF THE FLOOR\n\n  Mr. REID.
