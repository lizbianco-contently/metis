Mr. President, following my remarks and those of the \nRepublican leader, the time until 11:15 a.m. will be equally divided \nand controlled between the two leaders or their designees. At 11:15 \na.m. there will be a series of rollcall votes in relation to several \nnominations. Following those votes, the Senate will recess until 1:45 \np.m. to allow for the caucus meetings we are having today. At 1:45 p.m. \nthere will be another series of rollcall votes in relation to \nnominations as well as a cloture vote on the Wyden substitute amendment \nto the tax extenders legislation. The filing deadline for first-degree \namendments to the substitute and the bill is 1 p.m. and the filing \ndeadline for second-degree amendments to the substitute is 3 p.m. \ntoday.\n\n\n                            Campaign Finance\n\n  Mr. President, a memo from the Koch-funded political organization \nAmericans for Prosperity found its way into the national press last \nweek. The memo details Americans for Prosperity's plan to spend at \nleast $125 million--and more if necessary--ensuring the Koch brothers' \nhand-picked candidates win elections this November. This memo was sent \nto a select group--the ultrarich, the megarich. That is who got it. The \nmemo was entitled ``Confidential Investor Update.''\n  How fitting for the Koch brothers' hostile takeover of the American \nelectoral system to call something ``investor update''--investor \nupdate. You see, these billionaires are dumping unseemly amounts of \nmoney into a shadowy political organization. Their donation is an \ninvestment in an America rigged to benefit themselves at the expense of \nthe middle class.\n  The Kochs' political expenditures are investments--investments--\nsimilar to any other that is listed in their financial portfolios, and \nthey absolutely expect monetary returns on their investments in buying \nAmerica. That is what this is all about.\n  The Kochs' bid for a hostile takeover of American democracy is \ncalculated to make themselves even richer. Yet the Kochs and their \nRepublican followers in Congress continue to assert that these hundreds \nof millions of dollars are free speech.\n  For evidence of that look no further than the Republican leader, who \nhas flatout said: ``In our society, spending is speech.''\n  Let me pose a question to everyone, including my friend the \nRepublican leader. If this unprecedented spending is free speech, where \ndoes that leave our middle-class constituents, the poor? It leaves them \nout in the cold. How could everyday working American families afford to \nmake their voices heard if money equals free speech? Should voters \nmortgage their homes if\n\n[[Page S3048]]\n\nthey are worried about climate change? If they are concerned about \ntheir children's education, should they max out all their credit cards \nmaking political contributions?\n  Is our involvement in government completely dependent on financial \nresources? The answer should be a resounding no, but the shadowy Koch \nbrothers and all their different organizations, in attempting to buy \nAmerica--if they succeed--the answer to that question is yes. \nInvolvement in government, according to them, would be on how much \nmoney they spent.\n  There should be no million-dollar entry fee for participation in our \ndemocracy. As retired Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens noted \nvery recently--he did this before a Senate panel just a couple weeks \nago--``money is not speech.'' He went on to say:\n\n       Speech is only one of the activities that are financed by \n     campaign contributions and expenditures. Those financial \n     activities should not receive the same constitutional \n     protection as speech itself. After all, campaign funds were \n     used to finance the Watergate burglaries--actions that \n     clearly were not protected by the First Amendment.\n\n  At its core the Constitution of our great country is the great \nequalizer. The Constitution gives all Americans, regardless of race, \nbackground or financial status, the same freedoms and rights. The U.S. \nConstitution levels the playing field--but not so calculated by the \nKoch brothers. According to them, lots of money is their name and it is \ntheir game.\n  The playing field of campaign finance is skewed in favor of interest \ngroups and corporations. The more money there is, the more skewed it \nbecomes. Justice Stevens rightly labeled these massive campaign \ncontributors as ``non-voters.''\n  Elections in the United States should be decided by voters--Americans \nwho have a constitutional, fundamental right to elect their \nrepresentatives. Yet more and more we see Koch Industries and Americans \nfor Prosperity--one of their shadowy front groups--dictating the \nresults of primaries and elections across the country. Behind these \nnonvoting organizations are massively wealthy men, hoping for a big \nmonetary return on their political donations. When the candidates they \nbankroll get into office, the winners inevitably begin to legislate \ntheir sponsors' business plans--less regulation and less oversight for \ncorporations.\n  Remember, the Koch brothers' dad was one of the inventors of many \nother strange organizations. It is hard to believe that one of these \nmen ran for Vice President in 1980 as a Libertarian, and the views he \npronounced at that time were so radical--doing away with Social \nSecurity, no taxes whatsoever, no power to enforce the laws, doing away \nwith all environmental regulations. They have now become part of the \nmain stream of the Republican Party. That should frighten everyone. \nTheir dad was one of the beginners of the John Birch Society. Think \nabout that.\n  Let me be very plain for all to hear: No one should be able to pump \nunlimited funds into political campaigns, whether they are a Democrat, \na Republican or an Independent. As one political observer noted, we \ncurrently have a campaign finance system in place which compels each \nparty to pick which billionaires they like best. What a shame. That is \nexactly why the system needs to change.\n  There is absolutely no question the Koch brothers are in a category \nof their own, in both degree and kind. No one else is pumping money \ninto shadowy campaign organizations and campaigns like they are. There \nis not even a close second. They are doing this to promote issues that \nmake themselves even richer. One hundred million dollars is not enough \nfor the Koch brothers. No other individuals are recreating the role of \na national political party. That is what they are doing. They are \nrecreating the Republican Party.\n  I say why not level the playing field for everyone? Let's get this \nmoney out of our political system. Let's undo the damage done by the \nCitizens United decision. We should do it now. The Supreme Court has \nequated money with speech, so the more money, the more speech you get, \nand the more influence in our democracy. What kind of a system is that? \nIt is wrong.\n  Every American should have the same ability to influence our \npolitical system: One American, one vote. That is what the Constitution \nguarantees. The Constitution does not give corporations a vote, and the \nConstitution does not give dollar bills a vote.\n  From what I have heard recently, my Republican colleagues seem to \nhave a different view. Republicans seem to think billionaires, \ncorporations, and special interests should be allowed to drown out the \nvoices of all Americans. That is wrong and it should end.\n  I oppose the notion that a big bank account should give billionaires, \ncorporations or special interest groups a greater place in government \nthan American voters. That is why I support the constitutional \namendment proposed by two Democratic Senators, Senators Tom Udall of \nNew Mexico and Michael Bennet of Colorado. Their amendment curbs \nunlimited campaign spending. This amendment grants Congress the \nauthority to regulate and limit the raising and spending of money for \nFederal political campaigns. That is not a bad idea.\n  Senators Udall and Bennet's amendment reins in the massive spending \nof super PACs, which have grown so much since the Citizens United \ndecision. It also provides States with the authority to institute \ncampaign spending limits at the State level. I know in the State of \nMontana that was in effect for decade after decade after decade. The \ncourts knocked that out because of the Citizens United opinion. It is \nsuch a shame.\n  The proposed amendment makes our Nation's campaigns fairer and allows \ncandidates to represent their voting constituents instead of big-\nspending special interest groups.\n  Here is something else that Justice Stevens said:\n\n       Unlimited campaign expenditures impair the process of \n     democratic self-government. They create a risk that \n     successful candidates will pay more attention to the \n     interests of non-voters who provided them with money than to \n     the interests of the voters who elected them.\n\n  ``That risk is unacceptable,'' Justice Stevens said.\n  So it is unacceptable that the recent Supreme Court decisions have \ntaken away power from the American voter; instead, giving it to a \nselect few megabillionaires.\n  Soon Chairman Leahy and the Senate Judiciary Committee will hold a \nhearing on Senators Udall and Bennet's constitutional amendment. The \nSenate will vote on that legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this constitutional amendment, to \nrally behind our democracy. I understand we Senate Democrats are \nproposing something that is no small thing. Amending our Constitution \nis not something any of us should take lightly, but the flood of \nspecial interest money into our American democracy is one of the most \nglaring threats our system of government has ever faced.\n  Let's keep our elections from becoming speculative ventures for the \nwealthy and put a stop to the hostile takeover of our democratic system \nby a couple of billionaire oil barons.\n  It is time we revive our constituents' faith in our electoral system \nand let them know their voices are being heard because the American \npeople clearly deserve a fair shot.\n\n\n                  RECOGNITION OF THE REPUBLICAN LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                             VA Health Care\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, our All-Volunteer military relies upon \nseveral critical factors to recruit young Americans who are \nsufficiently well educated, physically and mentally qualified, and \nadequately motivated to wear the uniform. Our recruits expect to be \nwell led, well trained, adequately compensated, effectively challenged, \nand fairly treated. Critically, they also expected to receive the \nhealth care promised to them while they were on Active Duty or as \nveterans.\n  Later this morning Secretary Shinseki will testify on stories that \nemerged several weeks ago about administrators at the VA hospital in \nPhoenix falsifying medical records to conceal delays in providing care \nto veterans. In the wake of these reports similar stories from Wyoming, \nNorth Carolina, Missouri, and Texas have come to light about employees \nusing similar tactics to conceal backlogs in medical care. The \nquestions awaiting the Secretary will be tough, but this is his job. \nThe American people are demanding and deserve answers to these \nquestions.\n\n[[Page S3049]]\n\n  To his credit, Secretary Shinseki has ordered an inspector general \nreview of the Phoenix VA health care system. It would not surprise me \nin the least if additional inspector general reviews end up being \nrequired at other VA hospitals.\n  One thing I will be listening for today is whether Secretary Shinseki \nstates a belief that the VA is, in fact, facing a systemic crisis \nbecause just this morning the Wall Street Journal reported that his \nDepartment has made ``minimal progress at best'' on a host of problems \nidentified in 2012 by the nonpartisan Government Accountability \nOffice--``minimal progress at best.'' That is how a nonpartisan GAO \nofficial described it.\n  Many letters have come into my office on this issue. Kentuckians are \nreally concerned. Let me read what one Kentuckian had to say:\n\n       As a veteran, I have read the recent revelations of events \n     in Phoenix with horror. These [Americans] . . . sacrificed \n     for their country . . . In return, we owed them competent \n     care and treatment as a person, and not an obstacle to a \n     ``good evaluation.'' In order to regain the trust of our \n     veterans, it is vital that we hold those responsible \n     accountable . . .\n\n  This Kentucky veteran could not be more right.\n  Last year I called the Obama administration's veterans backlog a \n``national disgrace.'' I have also made several appeals to the \nSecretary. I know, of course, I was not the only one. Yet the initial \nreports of the shocking situation in Phoenix indicate that things have \nonly gotten worse. With similar stories now filtering in from other \nparts of the country, it is getting harder to believe this is not more \nof a sort of systemic, administration-wide crisis. The Veterans' \nAdministration needs to get to the bottom of how widespread the problem \nhas become.\n  My concern is that the Obama administration will treat this scandal \nthe way it does all the others--like a political crisis to get past \nrather than a serious problem to be solved. We know the President \nappointed a member of his staff yesterday to look into it. That is a \nstart, but if the President is truly serious, he needs to treat these \nstories at least as seriously as he did the ObamaCare Web site fiasco \nwhen he pledged his complete attention and the full force of his \nadministration to do whatever needed to be done. That was on the Web \nsite fiasco when he let it be known that his people would not rest \nuntil a solution was worked out. Incredibly, so far the President has \nmade no such pledge when it comes to the treatment of our veterans. The \nPresident needs to understand that our veterans deserve at least as \nmuch attention as a Web site--at least as much attention as a Web site. \nIn fact, they deserve a heck of a lot more.\n  This is a really big deal. It is our job as Senators to get to the \nbottom of it. We need to ask the tough questions. We need to uncover \nthe truth. Any misconduct found at VA hospitals should be met with \nswift punishment.\n  Administration officials need to be held accountable because \nAmerica's ill and wounded veterans have already paid a price. They have \nalready paid a price. They have a right to expect that our country will \nbe there when they need help. If we break faith with them, we are \nbreaking faith with the recruiters who made commitments to the next \ngeneration of American military leaders. All of those people have made \ncommitments. The recruiters, the military leaders have all made \ncommitments. As one of my colleagues put it, American veterans ought to \nbe first in line--first in line--for the best care, not pushed to the \nback of the line for what they are getting.\n  So our joint mission, whether we are Democrats or Republicans, should \nbe to get to the bottom of the Obama administration's veteran crisis \nswiftly and fix it. It means holding officials accountable. It means \ngetting serious about solutions, such as Senator Rubio's bill that \nwould make it easier to remove high-level VA employees for performance \nfailures. I am proud to cosponsor that legislation. I know some of my \ncolleagues will have other good ideas in the coming days and weeks too. \nThe point is, that is where our focus needs to be. We owe it to every \nveteran who has served.\n\n\n               50th Anniversary of the Bourbon Resolution\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to the spirit of Kentucky \nliterally. This month marks the 50th anniversary since the U.S. \nCongress passed S. Con. Res. 19, which recognized bourbon whiskey as a \ndistinctive product of the United States and unlike any other type of \ndistilled spirit, whether foreign or domestic.\n  On May 4, 1964, Congress declared that bourbon whiskey had achieved \nrecognition and acceptance throughout the world as a distinctive \nproduct of the United States and expressed a sense of Congress that the \nUnited States should prohibit the importation of any other whiskey \npurporting to call itself bourbon. This resolution helped to promote \nthe thriving bourbon distillery industry that we can be thankful is \nlocated in the United States today.\n  Kentucky is, of course, the birthplace of bourbon. The drink itself \nis named for Bourbon County, KY. Bourbon County, KY, is in the heart of \nthe Bluegrass State, where the product first emerged. Kentucky produces \n95 percent of the world's bourbon supply, and Kentucky's iconic bourbon \nbrands ship more than 30 million gallons of the spirit to 126 \ncountries, making bourbon the largest export category among all U.S. \ndistilled spirits.\n  Not only is Kentucky the overwhelming producer of the world's \nbourbon, bourbon gives much back to Kentucky. It is a vital part of our \nState's tourism and economy. The industry generates close to 9,000 jobs \nand contributed almost $2 billion to Kentucky's economy in 2010. \nProduction of bourbon in Kentucky has increased by more than 120 \npercent since 1999. Not to go unnoticed, the bourbon industry has taken \nan active role in promoting the responsible and moderate use of its \nproduct by everyone.\n  S. Con. Res. 19 was originally introduced 50 years ago by Kentucky \nSenator Thruston Morton, and a companion measure was introduced in the \nHouse by Representative John C. Watts. They recognized that just as \nScotch whisky is a distinctive product of Scotland, Canadian whiskey a \ndistinctive product of Canada, and cognac a distinctive product of the \nCognac region of France, all with official government recognition, \nbourbon deserved the distinction that comes with official recognition \nas well. However, the International Federation of Manufacturing \nIndustries and Wholesale Trades in Wines, Spirits, and Liqueurs could \nonly enforce the protection of the bourbon appellation if Congress \npassed a resolution declaring such. Therefore, on May 4, 1964, Congress \nadopted the original bourbon resolution.\n  Fifty years later, I rise to introduce, along with my friend and \ncolleague Senator Paul, a new Senate resolution to recognize the 50th \nanniversary of this original declaration of independence for bourbon.\n  Kentucky is celebrating this 50th anniversary in appropriate fashion \nthrough various exhibits, events, and tastings. Perhaps the most \nexciting of these events is the display of the original bourbon \nresolution, which has been released from the National Archives and \nRecords Administration in Washington. For the first time since its \nadoption, it is to be exhibited in Louisville at the Frazier History \nMuseum. I was proud to be able to work with my friend and fellow \nKentucky Representative Andy Barr to assist in bringing the original \nresolution to Kentucky. I thank the Kentucky Distillers Association and \nthe Frazier History Museum for their efforts to honor the anniversary \nof the bourbon resolution. I am also proud today to follow in the \nfootsteps of Kentucky leaders from the past in honoring and recognizing \nthe original bourbon resolution with this 50th anniversary resolution.\n  Bourbon production in Kentucky has grown strong and thrived over the \nlast half century, and I am sure it will continue to do the same for \nthe next 50 years. I thank and congratulate all the hard-working \nKentuckians who contributed to building our State's vibrant bourbon \nindustry.\n  I urge my Senate colleagues to support this resolution and look \nforward to its swift adoption.\n\n\n Recognizing the 50th Anniversary of the Congressional Declaration of \n                            Bourbon Whiskey\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of S. Res. 446, submitted earlier today.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the \nresolution by title.\n\n[[Page S3050]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 446), recognizing the 50th \n     anniversary of the Congressional declaration of bourbon \n     whiskey as a distinctive product of the United States.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed, the preamble be agreed to, and that the motions \nto reconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 446) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  (The resolution, with its preamble, is printed in today's Record \nunder ``Submitted Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nleadership time is reserved.\n\n\n                           Order of Business\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 11:15 a.m. will be equally divided between the two leaders or \ntheir designees.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                             Tax Extenders\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am glad the Senate is finally getting \nserious about passing tax extenders this year. Congress has put off the \nextension of the expired tax provisions until the last minute all too \nfrequently. In 2012 provisions remained expired for an entire year \nbefore finally being extended in January of 2013. Similarly, the \nprevious extension of the expired provisions did not occur until the \nmiddle of December. Such late action by Congress results in \ncomplications come filing season for taxpayers, particularly for people \nwho hire tax preparers; tax forms are not ready and as a result refunds \nare delayed. So we owe it to our constituents to see to it that these \nadded complications are not a factor this year. Tax season is \nunpleasant enough without our adding to it by failing to do our job in \na timely fashion.\n  Already, by allowing these tax provisions to expire for more than 5 \nmonths, we have created a lot of headaches and uncertainty for \nindividuals and businesses. The current expiration causes headaches for \nteachers purchasing school supplies, college students paying for higher \neducation, and seniors making charitable donations from their IRAs. \nThose are only 3 of some 53 provisions we are considering extending. \nThese should have been extended 4 months ago.\n  Furthermore, it creates uncertainty for businesses, which harms \ninvestment and business growth. The enhanced expensing rules under \nsection 179 are of particular importance to small businesses and \nfarmers. I regularly hear from my constituents who are putting off \npurchasing a new truck or tractor for their business operation because \nthey do not know the fate of that provision. This is bad for economic \ngrowth, and it obviously has something to do with us having a high \nunemployment rate and jobs not being created.\n  The lapse of renewable energy incentives has already created a lot of \nuncertainty and slow growth in the renewable industry. This serves only \nto hamper the strides made toward a viable self-sustainable renewable \nenergy and fuel sector.\n  I am aware that some of my colleagues have expressed extreme \nopposition to some of the provisions in the package. I would like to \nspecifically respond to claims that some of my colleagues have made \nabout wind energy and the wind production tax credit.\n  I am sympathetic to the argument that the Tax Code has gotten too \ncluttered with too many special interest provisions. That is the reason \nmany of us for a long period of time have been clamoring for tax \nreform. But just because we haven't cleaned up the Tax Code in a \ncomprehensive way doesn't mean we should pull the rug out from under \ndomestic renewable energy producers. Doing so would cost jobs, harm our \neconomy, harm the environment, and even enhance problems for national \nsecurity.\n  I am glad to defend the wind production tax credit and wind energy. \nWind energy provides more than 4 percent of U.S. electricity, supports \n80,000 American jobs, spurred $105 billion in private investment in the \nUnited States just since 2005, and that source of energy displaces more \nexpensive and more polluting sources of energy, lowering electricity \nprices for consumers.\n  More than 70 percent of U.S. wind turbine value is now produced right \nhere in the United States, compared to just 25 percent prior to 2005. \nMore than 550 industrial facilities across 44 States manufacture for \nthe wind energy industry. The wind industry today supports 80,000 \nAmerican jobs. The tax incentive has spurred $105 billion in private \ninvestment in the United States since 2005.\n  Opponents of the renewable energy provisions want to have this debate \nin a vacuum. They disregard the many incentives and subsidies that \nexist for other sources of energy and are permanent law, but they don't \nseem to talk about those much.\n  For example, the 100-year-old oil and gas industry continues to \nbenefit from tax preferences that benefit only their industry. These \nare not general business tax provisions, as we are led to believe, no \ndifferent from what other industries have. These are specific to the \noil and gas business, the same way a wind energy tax credit is specific \nto wind. I will give a few examples of these tax provisions: expensing \nfor intangible drilling costs, deductions for tertiary injectants, \npercentage depletion for oil wells, and special amortization for \ngeological costs. These four tax preferences for this single industry \nresult in the loss of more than $4 billion annually in tax revenue.\n  Nuclear energy would be another example--in fact, a very great \nexample. The first nuclear powerplant came online in the United States \nin 1958--56 years ago. Nuclear receives special tax treatment for \ninterest from decommissioning trust funds. Congress created a \nproduction tax credit for this mature industry in 2005, and that \nproduction tax credit is going to be available until 2020. Nuclear also \nbenefits from the Price-Anderson Federal liability insurance \nprovisions. Congress provided that as a temporary measure in 1958, but \nit is still here and it was renewed, as I said, through 2025. Nuclear \nenergy has also received $74 billion in Federal research and \ndevelopment dollars since 1950.\n  Are these crony capitalist handouts? I haven't heard it from the same \ncolleagues who talk about wind energy. Is it time to end market \ndistortion for nuclear power? I haven't heard my colleagues talk about \nthat.\n  A Cato study found that ``in truth, nuclear power has never made \neconomic sense and exists purely as a creature of government.''\n  There is also no truth to the claim that wind energy is somehow \nundercutting baseload power. Baseload nuclear and coal energy are being \nharmed by cheap natural gas, transmission congestion, and stagnant \nelectricity demand.\n  The chairman and CEO of NextEra Energy James Robo addressed this \nissue in an op-ed recently. NextEra operates significant wind \ngeneration but also a large nuclear operation. He stated:\n\n       We do not merely advocate for an ``all-of-the-above'' \n     energy strategy--we live it. And from our perspective, \n     nuclear plants in competitive markets are not challenged by \n     wind energy but by low natural gas prices caused by the shale \n     gas revolution.\n       Blaming the wind industry for the challenges in the \n     merchant nuclear business may be politically expedient, but \n     it will not help any company or technology operate more \n     successfully in a low natural gas price environment.\n\n  Wind energy and its incentives are not to blame for the market \nconditions affecting the economics of nuclear energy.\n  So I would ask my colleagues a very simple question: Why is repealing \na subsidy for oil and gas or nuclear energy a tax increase on energy \nproducers and consumers, while repealing an incentive for alternative \nor renewable energy is not? It is not intellectually honest.\n  I authored the wind energy incentive in 1992. We know there is no \njustification for it to go on forever. It was never meant to, and it \nshouldn't. I am happy to discuss a responsible multiyear phaseout of \nthe wind tax\n\n[[Page S3051]]\n\ncredit. In 2012 the wind industry was the only industry to put forward \na phaseout plan. But any phaseout must be done in the context of \ncomprehensive tax reform where all energy tax provisions are on the \ntable at the same time. It should be done responsibly over a few years \nto provide certainty and ensure a viable industry.\n  Thank God Chairman Wyden has expressed his determination that this \nwill be the last tax extenders bill prior to comprehensive tax reform. \nI share Senator Wyden's sentiment in favor of putting an end to the \nannual kabuki dance that is what we call tax extenders, the bill before \nthe Senate we are going to be voting on shortly. Good tax policy \nrequires certainty that can only come from long-term predictable tax \npolicy. Businesses need certainty in the Tax Code so that they can plan \nand invest accordingly. Moreover, taxpayers deserve to know that the \nTax Code is not just being used for another way to dole out funds to \npolitically favored groups. However, the only sound way to reach this \ngoal is through comprehensive tax reform, and Senator Wyden, as \nchairman of the Finance Committee, can make that happen, and he said he \nis going to.\n  I agree that there are provisions in extenders that ultimately should \nbe left on the cutting-room floor, but it is in a tax reform \nenvironment where we should consider the relative merits of individual \nprovisions.\n  Targeting certain provisions for elimination now makes little sense \nfor those of us who want to reduce tax rates as much as possible. Tax \nreform provides an opportunity to use a realistic baseline that will \nallow the revenue generated from cutting back provisions to be used to \npay for reductions in individual and corporate tax rates.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the future to enact \nthat tax reform and put an end to the headaches and uncertainty created \nby the regular expiration of the tax provisions we are considering \nright now on the Senate floor. Right now our focus must be on extending \ncurrent expired or expiring provisions that will end up giving us room \nin the baseline--the baseline CBO always talks about--to work toward \nthat goal of tax reform.\n  It is my hope that we can move quickly to reach a bipartisan \nagreement in the Senate and come to a timely agreement with the House. \nTaxpayers should not have to wait until December or January for us to \nact.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. KAINE. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Kaine pertaining to the introduction of S. 2341 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. KAINE. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, what is the current status of the floor?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate is in divided time until \n11:15.\n  Mr. COATS. I ask to be recognized for part of that time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Indiana is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                          Majority Leadership\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, citizens of Indiana sent me to Washington \nto be their voice. As I travel across the State and listen--whether at \ncoffee shops or factories, small businesses, local schools or people on \nthe street--I hear a lot of good advice about what they think we ought \nto be doing. There are regulations and taxes and policies being imposed \non their businesses and their personal lives. They would like to see \nsome changes, some reforms.\n  Many of their ideas are very sensible because what we do affects \ntheir livelihoods. That is what the Senate is all about. That is why we \nhave a Congress. That is why we have representatives--so we can \nrepresent the voices of the people who sent us--but right now \nRepublicans, as we are in the minority, are being shut out of our \nability to represent their voices.\n  The tradition of the Senate since its inception has been a place \ndescribed as ``the world's greatest deliberative body.'' A place where \nwe can take time to deliberate ideas, reforms, to be able to offer \namendments to legislation brought forward, to talk to our colleagues \nand encourage bipartisan support, work to achieve a majority so the \nideas we bring can be passed into law--coordinated with the House and \nsent to the President to sign and become law.\n  A strange thing has happened under the current leadership of our \nmajority leader; that is, he has found a way to procedurally gag us \nfrom representing the voice of the people of our States. In the last 10 \nmonths, Republicans have been offered a vote on the substitute policy \nmeasure or amendment to a policy measure only nine times.\n  I had the great privilege of serving in the Senate at a previous time \nin my life. I had committed to term limits. So after my two terms were \nfulfilled, I honored those term limits and stepped down. I was out for \n12 years. I was asked to come back at a time when many thought our \ncountry was going in the wrong direction, and they wanted a voice to \nstand for their interests and feelings about what our country ought to \nbe and the kind of policies we ought to have enacted. I had the great \nfortune of being sent back to serve this Senate, only to find, to my \nshock and amazement, that under the procedures used by the majority \nleader, this is no longer the greatest deliberative body. It has turned \ninto the least deliberative body because we haven't been able to \ndeliberate anything.\n  I have served under Republican and Democratic majority leaders: \nSenator Mitchell, a Democratic majority leader; Senator Daschle, a \nDemocratic majority leader; Trent Lott and Bob Dole, Republican \nmajority leaders. Whether Republican or Democratic, they honored the \ntraditions of the Senate. They honored what the Senate was designed to \nbe.\n  No one was more eloquent in allowing the minority to play a role, to \noffer amendments to bills, to debate those bills, and to vote--\nsometimes we won, sometimes we lost, but we at least had an opportunity \nfor our voices to be heard and for our colleagues to cast their yea or \nto cast their nay on what we were offering. No one was a greater \ndefender of those minority rights than then-majority leader Robert Byrd \nfrom West Virginia.\n  Robert Byrd is lionized here in terms of his long service and \nremembered most for the fact that he was so faithful to the \nConstitution of the United States and so faithful to the traditions of \nthe Senate, the rules of the Senate, and the procedures of the Senate. \nWhether one was a Republican or Democrat, liberal or conservative, no \none was a greater defender of the traditions of the Senate allowing \nfull and open debate than Robert Byrd.\n  I had many disagreements with Robert Byrd but great respect for his \nrespect for this institution. We don't see that today. There is no \nRobert Byrd here. There is no one standing on the other side saying: \nWait a minute. This is not what we are here for.\n  The procedures the majority leader has undertaken affect Democrats as \nwell as Republicans. I know many of my friends across the aisle--some \nof them are cosponsors of some of the legislation proposals and \namendment proposals I have made--they are not allowed to offer their \namendments either. We are frozen out by someone who has taken a \ndictatorial position, saying: It is my way or the highway.\n  We see that foreign policy enacted now coming out of Russia with \nVladimir Putin, but that is not what the United States is about. That \nis not what the Senate of the United States is about. We are a \ndemocratic institution. A democratic institution means voices of the \npeople can be heard.\n  The voices of the people I represent are not being heard because I \ncan come down here and talk about my amendments, but I am not allowed \nthe opportunity to have full debate and a vote on those amendments. The \nsame is true for my 44 colleagues on the Republican side.\n  It is unprecedented. It has never happened before. It is dictatorial. \nEven the news media are scratching their heads, saying: We have never \nseen this before. It is a tragedy that this is the case.\n  Here we are coming up to yet another major piece of legislation, the \nso-called tax extenders. These are provisions within the Tax Code that \nallow certain exemptions or credits or special provisions--for \ninstance, research and development. There is a deduction allowed, bonus \ndepreciation for businesses, any number of things that we are going to \nbe talking about that need to be legislated because they expire at the \nend of\n\n[[Page S3052]]\n\nthis year. Normally we would have open debate from those of us who \nsupport some of those, from those of us who oppose some of those, and \nwhat changes might be made. In the end, that debate turns to a vote, \nand the vote determines where the Senate stands.\n  I know some of the things I would be proposing may not be passed by \nthe Senate, but I would like to put it to the test. I would like to \nhave my colleagues have an opportunity to not only hear what they were \nbut to vote on them, let their yea be yea and nay be nay.\n  That is a Biblical injunction that goes back to the beginning of \ntime: Let your yes be a yes and your no be a no. But don't use \nprocedural devices to prevent us from going to yes or going to no.\n  I will mention three provisions I would like to see incorporated in, \ndebated, and voted on in this legislation coming before us.\n  We will find out shortly, but we are told that once again the \nmajority leader will come down and say: I am not allowing Republicans \nto offer any amendments, even if they are sensible, even if they are \nreasonable, even if they are relevant.\n  That is a repetitive process which has been undertaken, and it is \ntragic, it is unfortunate, and it is not the Senate. We all ought to be \nashamed that this is the procedure we are operating under.\n  I want to help Indiana charities. There are a number of small \ncharities--individuals or small groups of individuals with a big heart \ntrying to do the right thing and reach out and provide support. As the \nFederal Government budget is ever shrinking because of our debt and \ndeficit and runaway entitlement spending, much less for other spending \nthat we have control over, these charities have found themselves \nsomewhat in a bind. Some of them are small. They don't have the \nbackroom, the accountants, the lawyers, and so forth and so on to read \nthrough all the regulations. Many of them have lost their nonprofit \nstatus for a very simple reason that can be easily corrected.\n  There are certain procedures which require certain amounts of \ninformation to be provided to the Internal Revenue Service. If it is \nnot provided, the Internal Revenue Service has the authority to close \ndown those charities. Many of them have not realized that this certain \namount of information needs to be provided on an annual basis. All of a \nsudden they get a notice in the mail that their 501(c)(3) or tax-exempt \nstatus has been revoked. Then they call my office and ask: What is \ngoing on here?\n  The IRS says you didn't comply with all the regulations.\n  What regulations?\n  These people are not making a profit. They are trying to provide \nsocial services and needed help to the low-income, poverty, people in \nneed. They don't have the expertise, they don't have the time, they \ndon't have the understanding of what it takes to comply with all of the \nthousands and thousands of pages of regulations.\n  All I am asking with this amendment--and it seems something everybody \nwould agree to and we could do by unanimous consent--is that the IRS \nnotify these people with a special notification basically saying: This \nis what you haven't complied with. You have a certain amount of time to \ndo this or we will have to take away your tax-exempt status.\n  Some of these things are no-brainers. Can we ask the IRS to simply \nsend a notice if they are going to terminate a 501(c)(3) because they \ndidn't fulfill a particular regulation? Can we give them notice so they \nthen can take it to their tax accountant or take whatever actions it \nneeds in order to meet the test and not lose that status? Losing that \nstatus means they are out of business. They are not able to receive \ncontributions that are tax deductible. Many of them will lose that.\n  The ObamaCare bill incorporates a provision that increases the \nthreshold over which someone can deduct medical expenses. Currently, it \nis 7.5 percent of total adjusted gross income. The ObamaCare health \ncare law, unbeknownst to many, raised that level from 7.5 percent to 10 \npercent. I am simply wanting to offer an amendment that would go back \nto the status quo or go back to the current law and keep it at 7.5 \npercent. I believe that could gather and garner bipartisan support. I \nwould like to put that for a vote.\n  Third is a medical device tax repeal which I have been talking about \nad nauseam for 3 years. One of the most egregious things in the \nObamaCare act was the taxing of gross sales in an industry that is \ndynamic, provides high-paying jobs, and is leading edge in terms of \ninnovation and creativity, and providing much needed help for those who \nhave health conditions that can be addressed through certain medical \ndevices. I know we have bipartisan support for the passage of this \nprovision and this repeal because in our nonbinding budget vote--the \nchance when we did have the vote--34 Democrats joined 45 Republicans \nfor a total of 79 out of 100. That is a majority that overrides a veto, \nand that is a majority of bipartisan--near consensus--as to how we \nought to move forward. Yet once again we have been denied despite every \neffort over a period of years by the majority leader from having a \nbinding vote on that. Clearly someone is afraid that this is going to \npass. Therefore on a decision solely made by the majority leader, \nperhaps encouraged by the President, we are not even allowed an \nopportunity to take that vote. So the voice of the people--whether it \nis Indiana or the voice of the people from this country--is being \ngagged, and there is a big gag put on everything that we are trying to \ndo here.\n\n  I got pretty worked up about this yesterday. I guess I have calmed \ndown a little bit today, maybe going from total frustration yesterday \nto pleading with some sense of reason that the procedures here could be \nchanged so that we at least have the opportunity to state our case and \nto take a vote. That is all we are asking for on this--these tax \nextender provisions coming before us. We are willing to address and \noffer a limited number of totally relevant amendments. Give us the \nchance to make our case. Take the vote and let the yea be yea and the \nnay be nay on it and see who prevails on it. Yet the word is that the \nmajority leader once again is going to deny us this opportunity. It is \nmore than tragic because it turns this institution which was venerated \nfor being a deliberative body into a nondeliberative body. None of us \never thought we would see this happen.\n  As I said, had Robert Byrd been here or had George Mitchell been here \nor had a number of other people been here, they never would have \nallowed this. This is not what the Senate has been traditionally, and \nit is something today that none of us recognize and it is just a shame. \nI am not exactly sure how we should best go forward now that the \nmajority leader is apparently going to stifle our efforts. There are \nvery important provisions here that need to be addressed because they \nexpire at the end of the year.\n  I see my colleague Senator Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, with whom I \nhave worked on comprehensive tax reform. These provisions today are \nessential to our moving to where we really need to go, and that is full \ncomprehensive reform--lowering our corporate tax rate, lowering our \nindividual tax rates, and making our Tax Code simpler and more fair and \nmore growth oriented. Those are the provisions of the Wyden-Coats bill. \nWe have to move with that; we have to deal with this first. But we need \nto deal with this in a way that doesn't leave a lot of rancor and a lot \nof frustration on our side that we haven't had an opportunity to have a \nvoice in the matter.\n  So once again, I am pleading with the Senate majority leader and my \ncolleagues on other side of the aisle that we work to find a way to \nturn the Senate back into the Senate. What are we afraid of?\n  Mr. President, with that I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                             Tax Extenders\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, in beginning my remarks on these extenders, \nI want my colleague from Indiana to know that in the Finance Committee \nwe have done everything we could--all 24 of us--to avoid the rancor and \npolarization that has so often accompanied the big economic debates, \nand we passed the bill out of the Finance Committee overwhelmingly on a \nbipartisan basis.\n  Today the Senate is going to have the opportunity to vote against a \nbig\n\n[[Page S3053]]\n\ntax increase--actually, a bunch of big tax increases--that would slam \nour fragile economy hard and would punish innovators, punish our small \nbusinesses, punish homeowners who are underwater with their mortgages, \npunish returning veterans looking for jobs, and punish students and \nclassroom teachers.\n  Colleagues, who here thinks it makes sense to tax innovation? That is \nwhat will happen if the tax extender bill fails to pass today. Who here \nthinks it makes sense to tax millions of hard-working homeowners who \nare underwater on their mortgages and were lucky enough to get a break \nfrom their lender? That is what will happen if the tax extender bill \nfails to pass today. Who here thinks it makes sense to make it more \ndifficult for our employers to hire veterans? Colleagues, that is what \nwill happen if the tax extender bill fails to pass today. And who here \nthinks it makes sense to sock college students already drowning in debt \nwith even higher tuition bills? Once again, colleagues, that is what \nhappens if the tax extender bill fails to pass today.\n  I am very much aware that this bill is not exactly what every Senator \nwants. Little secret: It is not my first choice either.\n  For years I have had the honor to work with my colleague from Indiana \non comprehensive tax reform. We were joined by our former colleague \nSenator Gregg. Senator Begich has done good work. That has long been my \nfirst choice. When Chairman Baucus went to China, I realized it \nwouldn't be possible in the few months that remain in this session to \nenact comprehensive reform, and the Senate shouldn't hit our economy \nonce again with immediate--I say, immediate--tax hikes as work goes \nforward on the broader reforms that Senator Coats and I feel so \nstrongly about.\n  Senator Hatch and all the members of the Finance Committee worked \ncooperatively and helped produce a bipartisan tax extender bill. This \nis essentially the first piece of legislation on my watch as chair of \nthe committee. The process was totally open. Every member of the \nFinance Committee had the opportunity to weigh in and offer proposals.\n  I want to just briefly describe some of the extraordinary \nbipartisanship that went into the bill that we will have an opportunity \nto vote on today. Senators Schumer and Roberts built on the good work \nof another bipartisan duo, Senator Moran and Senator Coons, and \nimproved the research and development credit to make it available to \nthose startups out there in garages who have a dream. The research and \ndevelopment credit is essentially the premiere part of this legislation \nbecause we saw a need for those innovation-driven jobs. We have four \nSenators--two of them Democrats, two of them Republicans--in effect \ncoming together to improve significantly the research and development \ncredit to ensure that it was available to even more of the startups--\neven more of those innovators--the ones just getting out of the gate. \nWe know a lot of our big businesses started that way--the Microsofts, \nthe Intels, and others.\n  Next Senator Cardin and Senator Portman added important provisions to \nhelp the long-term unemployed. We all understand that the nature of \nthose who are unemployed has changed significantly in recent years. We \nhave many more who are long-term unemployed Americans and we had two \nSenators--by the way, two Senators who started working in a bipartisan \nway when they were House members. I remember their good work on the \nWays and Means Committee. They came up with a very promising approach \nto help the long-term unemployed. Senators Hatch, Grassley, and \nRoberts--three Republicans--joined a whole host of Democrats in \nsupporting conservation, which I know the distinguished Senator from \nMontana knows a great deal about. Senator Baucus had a long interest in \nit. What this measure does--again on a bipartisan basis--is protect \nopen spaces and outdoor recreation businesses.\n  On the charity front, I heard my good friend from Indiana speak on \nthis, and he has done wonderful work standing up for our charities. He \nand I and Senator Thune feel so strongly about making sure charities \nget a fair shake in tax policy. I would say to my good friend, I am \nvery pleased that there is a provision in what we will vote on today \nthat would allow retirees who choose to use some of their IRA savings \nand give those IRA savings to charity. This legislation today would \ngive a break to those retirees. In effect, as my friend and I have \ntalked about, it is the IRA rollover concept to help our charities. \nThat too is in this legislation and has long had bipartisan support.\n  I could go even further, but I will simply wrap up by saying that \ntoday the Senate has a chance to push back hard against big tax \nincreases--tax increases that I have indicated punish everyone from \ninnovators to classroom teachers and would hit our small businesses \nhard when the economy is so fragile. The Senate would have the \nopportunity today to push back against those immediate--immediate--tax \nincreases, as well as future tax increases and to support the \nbipartisan work of the 24 members of this body who serve on the Finance \nCommittee.\n  So I hope that my colleagues will see that even though this bill is \nnot everything each Senator wants--and it is very fitting that my good \nfriend from Indiana is on the floor because he knows that I strongly \nprefer the idea of comprehensive reform--it became clear to me that it \nwouldn't be possible to do that in the few short months before the end \nof the year. So the question was, are we going to stop immediate tax \nhikes, which I hope the Senate will vote today to do, or are we just \ngoing to say we will sit by and watch Americans get hurt and in effect \nhave a lot of Americans say, if the Senate can't do this, how are they \npossibly going to go on to the comprehensive tax reform that I and \nothers would like to accomplish.\n  So I hope my colleagues will vote today to advance this bill, vote \nfor cloture, vote to break the gridlock, vote to prevent a massive tax \nincrease, and show that when a committee like the Senate Finance \nCommittee comes together with almost a quarter of the Senate on an \noverwhelming basis, it can set an example for the Senate. I am so \nappreciative of Senator Hatch who has consistently met me half way. I, \nin effect, parachuted into this job as the new chair of the Finance \nCommittee--when certainly I didn't expect it--and was fortunate to be \nreceived with the graciousness of Senator Hatch. This is essentially \nthe first bill on my watch. We had an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote, \nand I hope my colleagues later this afternoon will vote to advance it.\n  With that Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask through the Chair, if the Senator \nfrom Oregon would be willing to enter into a dialogue with me.\n  I have a couple of questions, but I also want to respond to the \nefforts he has made in a bipartisan way so we were able to move forward \nwith this comprehensive reform.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Booker). The Chair recognizes the Senator \nfrom Indiana.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. First of all, it has been a delight to work with the \nSenator from Oregon. Comprehensive tax reform is not easy, and it has \nnot happened in 25 years. This is not what we are talking about today. \nBut we are setting the stage for that, and I think that is important.\n  I agree with the Senator from Oregon when he spoke about the \nbipartisan product that came out of committee. It has been negotiated, \nand Members of the committee had an opportunity to make adjustments and \nget their provisions looked at and voted on. Some provisions were voted \ndown and some were voted up. Now it has moved to the Senate floor, and \nthere are those of us who don't serve on that committee that have some \nsuggestions as to how we think we can make the bill even better.\n  I laid out three provisions that I am interested in. One addition I \nhave for the bill is a very simple piece of legislation that would give \nnotice to charities that are being terminated from their 501(c)3 tax \nexempt status so they have a chance to rectify the error or problem. I \nfeel that is very sensible and totally relevant. Yet I am prohibited--\nunless the majority leader comes forward and allows us to offer \namendments--from offering that specific provision.\n  We all know there are many good things in here we support. There are\n\n[[Page S3054]]\n\nsome provisions we might agree on and other provisions we don't \nsupport, but all we are asking for is the opportunity to enter into the \nprocedure that the Senator and I have both enjoyed in the past so we \ncan debate some of this on the floor.\n  Could the Senator give me an indication as to whether or not they \nhave shut down the process of any additions, modifications or reforms \nto this bill that we can have a vote on?\n  I know the Senator knows this, but I have to say that obviously \npeople are not going to get these higher taxes imposed on them tomorrow \nif we don't pass this today. These provisions will expire at the end of \nthe year. The House is on a different path in terms of dealing with \nthese issues. We are going to have to reconcile the differences.\n  The real issue doesn't take effect--I mean the concern doesn't take \neffect until the end of the year. So that gives us plenty of time to \ndebate and talk about reforms as well as some constructive additions \nthat I have mentioned.\n  I ask my friend from Oregon this. Would he be willing to encourage \nthe majority leader to offer us that opportunity to make some \nrelevant--and hopefully constructive--adjustments, even a limited \namount, to the legislation so we feel we at least had the opportunity \nto represent the voices of the people we represent here in Washington?\n  Mr. WYDEN. First, I want to be clear on a couple of points. This idea \nthat there really are not any immediate consequences--I know my friend \nfrom Indiana spends a lot of time talking to businesses, as I do, and \nthese businesses are up in arms about the fact that the Senate cannot \ndeal with this because it doesn't give them the certainty and \npredictability they need to go out and make those orders and hire those \nworkers. As my friend knows, so many of those businesses make quarterly \npayments--April, June, et cetera.\n  I want my colleagues to understand that the idea that maybe this is \ngoing to get worked out at another time is not in anyone's best \ninterest.\n  When you are home for this recess, walking down Main Street and \ntalking to people who are going to pay those higher taxes and are not \nable to make those investments and hire those workers and make those \ndecisions now, they are not going to be happy that the Senate said: Oh, \nwe will see if maybe it will work out some other time or retroactive or \nsomething like that. They are making quarterly payments and decisions \nright now.\n  Second, the Senator from Indiana knows--because of our work--how much \nI want to do comprehensive reform. One of the reasons that Senator \nHatch and I made the judgment together that we were going to focus on \nextenders is because these are provisions that have essentially already \nexpired. I didn't get a chance to hear all of my friend's presentation, \nbut I know, for example, that he cares a great deal about the medical \ndevice tax. I joined him in voting to repeal the medical device tax \nwhen we had a vote earlier. I think it has real implications, as I know \nmy friend does, for innovation and for jobs.\n  It is not an extender. It is not in line with the framework that \nSenator Hatch and I agreed on a bipartisan basis to do now. We said: We \nare going to do extenders now. To tell you the truth, if we can get \nthrough the extenders, starting with a favorable vote today, it will \ngive us even more time to do what my friend from Indiana is talking \nabout both in terms of comprehensive reform and looking at other \nissues.\n  If, however, we can't deal with the extenders, the message is going \nto go out far and wide: How are they going to address comprehensive tax \nreform on the Senate floor when they couldn't even pass this \nlegislation which got such overwhelming support in the Senate Finance \nCommittee?\n  So I renew my pledge to work very closely with my colleague from \nIndiana and repeat that the idea that somehow everything is going to \nturn out fine down the road, I just don't buy that. In a fragile \neconomy when businesses can't plan and don't have the certainty of \nknowing what the rules are going to be and when they are going to kick \nin, that affects business decisions today in a negative way. When \npeople are making those quarterly payments, you better believe there \nare going to be small businesses, and others, very unhappy if we see a \ntax increase, which is what will happen today.\n  I have to apologize to my colleague from Indiana because I have to be \nsomewhere else and I am late, but I will just close by saying that I \nknow the sincerity of my colleague. That is why I mentioned that \ncharitable provision that allows for the IRA rollover into charity. No \none has done more good work advocating for charities during my time in \npublic service than the distinguished Senator from Indiana. I simply \nwanted him to know that at least we were making a beginning in this \nlegislation, and I am committed to working with him in the days ahead.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I appreciate the accolades from my partner \nin dealing with comprehensive tax reform. I appreciate and understand \nwhere he is trying to come from. It is true that some of the amendments \nthat have been proposed don't directly apply to the extenders, but they \ndo apply to taxes, and they are sensible. If the majority leader would \nagree, we can limit it to those that directly apply to the extenders.\n  Look, everyone knows that even if the majority leader prevents us \nfrom having amendments, we are going to finish this bill by the end of \nnext week--before the recess period. We are not talking about: Do it \ntoday or it is a ``done forever'' situation. This is going to be \nresolved in the Senate within the next several business days, probably \nmoving into next week.\n  All we are really asking for is the opportunity to make some \nimprovements to this. There are some Members who say: I can't vote for \nthis bill because this piece that the committee has agreed to is so \negregious, and it overwhelms all the good that I see in it. Others will \nsimply say: Well, OK, sometimes you have to take the less good--perfect \nbeing the enemy of the good--because it is the only way we can get to a \nbipartisan position. So, yes, I will lean forward even though I object \nto this particular provision. But at least they can say: I had the \nopportunity to make the point to my colleagues as to why certain \nprovisions are in there. I can ask: Why is something that is this \negregious? This doesn't fit the model of what we are looking for in \nterms of growth and innovation and sensible tax policy. Let's put that \nto a vote.\n  In the end we will still have a bill that will either have it in or \nout, but we will have had the opportunity to debate it with our \ncolleagues, and not just simply carte blanche say: Here is what we \ndecided in committee. By doing that, nobody else will have an \nopportunity to have their input in a way that they think will make it \nbetter.\n  Let's put these issues up for a vote. Let's debate it on both sides \nso we can ask: How did it get in there? Why did it get in there? What \ngood does it do? If they can't make the case, they lose the vote. If \nthey make the case, they win the vote.\n  Isn't that what we are here for? Aren't we here to make our case and \nput it to a vote so the American people can look at it and say: At \nleast I know how my Senator voted on this particular issue which is \nvery important to me.\n  When we go home, we can either defend our vote successfully or we \ndon't. If we don't, and enough people think we are on the wrong track, \nthey have the opportunity to go to the polls and send somebody else in \nplace of us.\n  What are my colleagues afraid of? Are they afraid of taking any kind \nof vote that someone back home might not think is the right thing to \ndo?\n  We were sent here to exercise our best judgment, to represent the \npeople who sent us here, to stand up for their interests, and then to \ntake the consequence at the next election--yea or nay. Either they will \nsend us back or they will find someone else to stand here.\n  The gag rule imposed by the majority leader--not my friend from \nOregon--simply says: You are in the minority. You didn't win the \nelection; therefore, you have no rights.\n  Despite what the Senate has done for over 200 years, and despite what \nother Democratic leaders have honored in terms of the rights of the \nSenate, the\n\n[[Page S3055]]\n\nmajority leader is saying: I am shutting all of that off. You have no \nrights. You can't offer any amendments. You can't offer any \nimprovements to this bill.\n  We were taught from the beginning--in terms of how laws are made--\nthat it is a process, and the process is that everybody gets their \ninput and then we decide what we want to support. If you can cobble \ntogether a majority for supporting your issue, you end up winning.\n  All of this will be determined here in the next week. A vote today in \nprotest of our inability to be gagged and shut down by the majority \nleader doesn't mean we are opposed to good provisions that my colleague \nfrom Oregon has said have bipartisan and nearly unanimous consent.\n  The vote today is about whether we are going to have the opportunity \nto say and do anything to make this a better bill and allow us an \nopportunity to have our input. I listed three items here that I think \ndirectly relates to taxes. If the parliamentarian determines that those \nare not relevant to the particular bill, I will accept that even if I \nthink they are relevant. My colleagues will also accept that. We are \ntailoring items we think will go directly to what the issue of the day \nis; yet we are not offered the opportunity to do anything about it.\n  I cannot understand why my Democratic colleagues can't see the \ninjustice and unfairness of that. If they were in the minority, they \nwould be standing where I am and basically making the same point. How \ncan Republicans conceivably say: I have been elected here, but I have \nno way of representing the voice of the people who sent me here. I have \nno way of offering a means of improving this bill or taking on \nsomething that I find totally egregious, but I am willing to accept how \nthe vote turns out. I am not necessarily trying to stop the bill from \ngoing forward, but I am trying to make it better.\n  I think if the shoe was on the other foot, my colleagues would simply \nsay: That is not the way the Senate is supposed to work. That is not \nwhy I came here. I came here to be a participant. I didn't come here to \nbe told by the majority leader that I have no right to offer a relevant \namendment to legislation that is before us. It is a total neuterization \nof the minority rights in a body that was conceived by our Founders--\nand a tradition that has been held for more than 200 years--to be a \ndeliberative body. Deliberative doesn't mean the majority leader walks \nover from his office and says: You have no right to offer an amendment. \nWe are taking that right away from you. Deliberative means we stand and \ntalk to each other as we just did. It is pretty rare for two of us to \nbe on the same page on comprehensive tax reform and probably on the \nextenders, but the two of us have the chance to go back and forth with \neach other.\n\n  I know the time has run out and it is time to call for a vote.\n  No one should mistake a vote against this as a vote against tax \nextenders. It could be a protest. I am not sure where we will end up, \nbut it could be a protest vote on the basis of the fact that we want to \nhave our rights honored. We want to be able to participate. We want to \nbe able to go home and say: I had a chance to take your voice to the \nSenate and debate it. It was voted on. It either passed or it didn't \npass, but I gave it everything I had. I don't want to go home and say: \nI didn't have a chance to even raise my voice on behalf of your voice \nand achieve any kind of debate, deliberation or vote on this amendment. \nThat is not why we are sent here. My Democratic colleagues need to \nunderstand that continuing to support what the majority leader is doing \nimpacts their rights and their people's rights as much as it does ours.\n  With that I know the time has expired and I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, to use our time, my colleague from Indiana \nspoke earlier as though the cloture vote on the extenders determines \nwhether the Senate will have any amendments to the extenders bill. That \nis not the case. A ``yes'' vote today is a vote to move the debate \nforward.\n  In that vein I simply want to announce that if cloture is invoked, I \nwould be happy to work with Senator Hatch and the two leaders to \ndevelop\n\n[[Page S3056]]\n\nan agreed-upon list of amendments, narrowly related to the bill that \nthe Finance Committee did in its consideration of the bill in the \ncommittee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I certainly want to thank my good \nfriend, the chairman of the Finance Committee, for his observation. He \nis moving in the right direction. As everyone is clearly aware, the \nissue of not allowing amendments is a highly sensitive matter. The \nSenate has been changed dramatically in recent years.\n  The time to have a negotiation over amendments is before cloture is \ninvoked, not after. If there is an indication on the other side that we \nare willing to have that negotiation, the time to do it is now because \nour experience postcloture with the ability to offer amendments has not \nbeen good, to put it mildly.\n  So I think the chairman of the Finance Committee is headed in the \nright direction. The timing is a little off. We would like to have this \nnegotiation over amendments before cloture is invoked on the bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/15/senate-section/article/S3056-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, is the next vote in order on the \nunderlying tax extender bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The next vote will be on the motion to invoke \ncloture on amendment No. 3060 to the tax extenders bill.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Thank you, Madam President.\n  The American people actually need to know what is happening in their \nSenate. This body exists to ensure that the citizens of this country \nhave a say in what our government does. The Senate is supposed to be \nthe citadel of our democracy, the place where we guarantee that no one \nin the country is cut out of the legislative process. The whole purpose \nof this body is to make sure that nobody is left out or left behind.\n  Yet today we have a Democratic majority that has turned this body \nliterally on its head. Instead of preserving the Senate's prerogatives, \nthey have systematically weakened or destroyed them all together. They \nhave turned the Senate into a graveyard of good ideas and open \ndemocratic debate.\n  It is a gag order on the American people we represent. Instead of \nrobust, freewheeling debates about the important issues of the day, we \nget bizarre monologues about the Democrats' latest villain.\n\n[[Page S3059]]\n\n  We get silly, shameful attacks on private citizens. So in one sense \nit is fitting that the majority leader announced today he wants to \nrewrite the Constitution. I mean, at least you have to give them marks \nfor consistency.\n  They are already muzzling our constituents by blocking amendments, \nand now they want to muzzle them even more by changing the Bill of \nRights. This is completely out of control.\n  Even if the Democratic majority doesn't like our ideas or those of \nour constituents, the answer isn't to take away their constitutionally \nguaranteed right to speak their minds. The answer isn't to shut down \ntheir representatives' ability to influence legislation through \namendments. The answer, my friends, is to come up with better \narguments. The answer is to actually convince people in a free and open \nmarketplace of ideas that you are right.\n  Why are Washington Democrats so afraid of a free and open exchange of \nideas? What are they afraid of? Do they have that little faith in the \njudgment of the people we represent? Over the past few weeks we have \nseen just how scared our friends on the other side are of a free and \nopen debate.\n  A big majority wants to repeal President Obama's medical device tax; \n79 people in this body voted for it. They won't allow a vote on it.\n  The American people want to see a vote on the Keystone Pipeline. Most \nSenators say they want to vote on it too, but we are not allowed to \nvote on it.\n  We have a tax bill that Members on both sides want to improve and \nMembers on both sides want to support. Yet we don't get a chance to \namend it.\n  We should have certainty in our Tax Code instead of these endless \nexpirations that only make it harder for people to prepare and for \nbusinesses to plan and to compete. They don't want to do that either. \nThey are completely allergic--completely and totally allergic--to \nanything that is constructive.\n  What they are doing is muzzling the people of this country, a gag \norder on the people we were sent to the Senate to represent--all \npresumably to protect their power. This is really quite scandalous. The \nAmerican people need to know what is happening in their Senate because \nthis is bigger than any one bill. It is about protecting the right of \nthe American people to have a say in what goes on in Washington.\n  We represent millions of people on this side of the aisle. They \nrepresent many of the people on their side of the aisle. I think there \nare something like 40 or so Democratic amendments pending to this \nbill--Democratic Senators who offered amendments to this bill who will \nnot be heard.\n  This is all about protecting the one opportunity they have to shut us \nout. It is about a party that has become so afraid of losing its hold \non power that they are willing to do just about anything to hold onto \nit--even if it means, as I said earlier, to try to amend the Bill of \nRights.\n  We have a lot of smart people on the Democratic side, but I expect \nnone of them are smarter than James Madison. Yet apparently they \ndecided--after a couple of hundred years--Madison's work is not \nsufficient. They want to recommend we amend the Bill of Rights. What is \nbefore us today is not that; it is a tax extender bill.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that if cloture is invoked on \nSenate amendment No. 3060, the Wyden substitute, the amendment be \nconsidered original text for the purpose of amendment; and \nnotwithstanding the provisions of rule XXII, it be in order for the \nRepublican leader or his designee to offer the Toomey amendment related \nto the medical device tax, and that amendments then be offered in \nalternating fashion between the majority and the minority, with all \namendments being related to tax policy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Everyone listen. The selfpronounced guardian of gridlock \njust gave us his presentation. That is what the Republican leader calls \nhimself, and that is a good name that he got for himself--the guardian \nof gridlock. That is what we have in the Senate. That is what we have \nhad here for 5\\1/2\\ years. We have struggled through parts of it, but \nit has been difficult.\n  It is no surprise to me or to us that, of course, when something is \nsaid about the Koch brothers, there are people who run down to the \nfloor to defend them. This time we have the Republican leader defending \nthe Koch brothers.\n  What I talked about today is something so radical--listen to what it \nis--that we should have restrictions on how much money people can spend \nin political campaigns and not have the government purchased by the two \nrichest people in America--the Koch brothers. So it is no surprise we \nhave someone running to their rescue.\n  I would also suggest this. My friend, the Republican leader, wants a \nvote on Keystone. They had a vote. They wouldn't take it. As one of my \nDemocratic Senators said, my friend the Republican leader is more \ninterested in an issue than getting the pipeline done.\n\n  So here is where we are. The Republican leader has asked for \nalternating amendments. That is a buzzword for ``we are going to \ncontinue our filibusters.''\n  The chairman of the Finance Committee, Ron Wyden, as the new chair--\nand we all have great expectations from Ron Wyden. He is an experienced \nlegislator. He spent many years in the House, and now he is a veteran \nhere in the Senate. He made a reasonable proposal--it was done before \nthe world--saying: OK, you want amendments, let's do them in relation \nto this bill; that is, the tax extenders bill.\n  But I will go even a step further than that. First of all, everyone \nshould understand that this is a bill which was done by the Finance \nCommittee on a bipartisan basis. But if they are interested in more \namendments, why don't we have Senator Wyden and Senator Hatch see what \nthey can come up with? And if that is good enough for me, it is good \nenough for my caucus.\n  I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senate will resume legislative session.\n  There is now 2 minutes of debate.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I said before that I am willing to debate \nand have votes on amendments related to tax extenders, and we heard \nSenator Reid essentially extend the olive branch once more. That is \nexactly what Senator Hatch and I did on a bipartisan basis in the \nFinance Committee, and I am ready and willing to do that again in the \nfull Senate. But the Senate can't do that if action on the tax \nextenders bill is blocked today.\n  So now the Senate has the opportunity to vote against a big tax \nincrease--actually, a bunch of big tax increases--that would slam our \nfragile economy hard and would punish innovators, punish our small \nbusinesses, punish homeowners who are underwater on their mortgages, \npunish returning veterans looking for jobs, and punish students and \nclassroom teachers.\n  Colleagues, who here thinks it makes sense to tax innovation? That is \nwhat is going to happen if the tax extenders bill fails to pass today. \nWho here thinks it makes sense--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I urge that we not let students, \nveterans, homeowners, and innovators be hurt today. Let's vote for \ncloture this afternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n[[Page S3060]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I compliment the distinguished Senator \nfrom Oregon for the work, the wide-open work he did for the committee \nbecause we did have an open process, but we only comprise a little less \nthan 25 percent of the Senate. To have a bill this important and be \nforeclosed from amendments I think makes the case for the minority \nleader and for this side.\n  I know there are many people on the other side who would like to have \nan open process, who would like to see amendments, who would like to \nhave this be a real debating society from time to time rather than just \nhave a slam-dunk type of approach to everything. I have to say I think \nthere are a lot of people who aren't on the Finance Committee who had \nno say at all on this bill and who might possibly want to participate \nin the process.\n  We have just had, time after time----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Time after time we have been foreclosed. It is time to end \nthat and start acting as the U.S. Senate should act and allow both \nsides at least an opportunity to express their views and allow every \nSenator that opportunity, not just the ones on the Finance Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before \nthe Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state.\n  The assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the substitute \n     amendment No. 3060 to H.R. 3474, an act to amend the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 to allow employers to exempt employees \n     with health coverage under TRICARE or the Veterans \n     Administration from being taken into account for purposes of \n     the employer mandate under the Patient Protection and \n     Affordable Care Act.\n         Harry Reid, Ron Wyden, Angus S.

Madam President, would you repeat the vote?\n  Ms. WARREN. The vote was 53 in favor and 40 opposed.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, once again the Republicans cannot take yes \nfor an answer. They just voted against the second bipartisan bill in \nless than a week. It is hard to comprehend, but that is true.\n  But we have learned on the energy efficiency--with all the different \nagreements that were violated by the Republicans--we learned in the \nlast 24 hours the reason for this. Scott Brown, who is running for the \nSenate--he is from Massachusetts but running for the Senate in New \nHampshire--he asked the Republican caucus: Make sure you don't give \nShaheen a victory on this.\n  So that is what it is all about on that bipartisan bill. That was a \nbill to conserve energy; 200,000 jobs--something really important for \nthe country. They worked on it since last September.\n  Stunningly, my friend the Republican leader today is lamenting how \nthings are going around here: Why won't they give us a vote on \nKeystone?\n  All he has to do is think back a couple days. They were offered an \nup-or-down vote on Keystone. They refused to take it. Talk about \ndouble-talk--triple-talk. And, of course--of course--whom do they come \nrunning to for help? The Koch brothers.\n  I was criticized for thinking that we should do something about this \nobscene campaign spending that is going on. And what, lo and behold, is \nthe first suggestion they have that they want to do on tax extenders? \nThey want to do something about ObamaCare. That is the only mention \nthat is listed there--ObamaCare. Even though it has fallen \nsignificantly as an issue they are going to win anything on, that is \npart of their mindset.\n  Today the Republicans' excuse is they need to vote once again to roll \nback part of ObamaCare, just as I said. And I already went over the \nScott Brown episode. So I wonder who called them today to tell them to \nkill this bill? Maybe Scott Brown has something to do with this also or \nmaybe it is one of the other Republican candidates who are desiring to \nbe in the Senate. No matter the excuse, Republicans continue to wage \nwar against common sense.\n  This tax extenders bill was a bill that was hashed out in the Finance \nCommittee. In the Finance Committee, they didn't allow anything except \ngermane amendments--in the Finance Committee--because the plan was to \nbring that bill here and get it passed. It is a bill that is needed at \nthis time. The business community needs it. Tax reports have to be \nfiled, and until this bill passes, they are not going to be very good \nif you are a big business. If you take a bus or a subway--there is a \nsubsidy in this bill for people who take buses and subways, public \ntransportation--that is not going to pass. And sales tax deductions--\nlots of things that are just common sense. But my friend the Republican \nleader calls himself the guardian of gridlock--the guardian of \ngridlock--and I am not going to do a thing to take away that name he \nloves so much because it is true.\n  Now we will have the weekend to think about this, I guess. I think it \nis irrational to block these tax cuts--tax cuts. That is what just \nhappened. The Republicans voted against tax cuts. So maybe the \nRepublicans will hear from their friends down on K Street and\n\n[[Page S3061]]\n\naround the country, and maybe they will learn that this is pretty \nimportant to everybody--not Democrats, not Republicans; it is important \nfor our country.\n  My door is always open. I indicated that in my statement following \nthe consent request of the Republican leader, but we have heard \nnothing.\n  I don't know how anyone could be more reasonable than Chairman Wyden. \nThey wanted amendments. He offered them amendments.\n  In the meantime, it should not be lost that Republican Senators are \ncontinuing their agenda by just saying no whether it is something as \nlogical and as important as pay equity, so a woman doing the same job \nas a man gets the same amount of money; that was blocked. And this is \nan issue that is more than just something that takes place away from \nthe maddening crowds. Look what happened, it appears, at the New York \nTimes. The woman who ran that newspaper was fired yesterday. Why? It is \nnow in the press. Because she complained she was doing the same work as \nmen in two different jobs and made a lot less money than they did. That \nis why we need that legislation. My daughter should make as much money \nas a man who does the same work. What kind of example are we setting \nhere when a woman who does the same work as a man doesn't get paid the \nsame amount of money? The Republicans blocked that.\n  They even blocked raising the minimum wage. We have had Rick Santorum \ncome out in favor of doing that, Mitt Romney, Jeb Bush, and they keep \ncoming on every day, new people coming on to say the minimum wage \nshould be increased--Republicans. But it doesn't matter. They are \nfunctioning here under the tutelage of the master of gridlock, the \nguardian of gridlock.\n  So as we go back to a few days after President Obama was elected, all \nthe big shot Republicans came here and they came to two conclusions:\n  No. 1. We are going to do everything we can to make sure Obama is not \nreelected.\n  And to the credit of my Republican friend, the Republican leader, he \nstated that on the Senate floor. He said: My No. 1 goal is to make sure \nObama is not reelected.\n  That was a failure.\n  But what else did they say at that meeting? The way we are going to \nmake sure that Obama is not reelected and to make sure the Democrats do \nnot do that well--we are going to block everything.\n  That is what they have done, and here is an example of that right \nhere again today.\n  No to energy conservation, no to pay equity, no to minimum wage, and \nnow today a new one: no to tax cuts.\n  So I would hope that come November the American people would just say \nno to this gridlock we have here in Washington in the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n\n\n                         Veterans' Health Care\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, the front page of yesterday's San \nAntonio Express News featured the heartbreaking story of a former Army \ncombat medic by the name of Anson Dale Richardson, a man from East \nTexas who did multiple tours in Vietnam and went on to work as a heavy \nequipment operator.\n  Last September Dale was diagnosed with a very serious form of throat \ncancer. His doctor says he told medical officials at the Department of \nVeterans Affairs to put Mr. Richardson on an immediate course of \nchemotherapy. What happened next is the sort of tragedy that is \nbecoming all too familiar, with revelations from Veterans' Affairs \nclinics and hospitals around the country.\n  According to the Express News, after being told to start chemotherapy \nright away, Mr. Richardson waited to hear from the VA about his \nappointment. He waited and waited, but he never heard back. On November \n4, Dale Richardson died.\n  We will never know whether he would have or could have survived \ncancer because he wasn't given that chance because he wasn't able to \nstart the chemo treatments when his doctor first diagnosed him. But we \ndo know that the Veterans' Administration's reported failure to give \nhim any chemo treatments took away his one last hope of beating this \nterrible disease.\n  When he died, Dale left behind a wife named Carolyn. In an interview \nwith the Express News, Carolyn Richardson said of her late husband, ``I \njust wish he'd had a chance.''\n  Dale Richardson's Austin-area doctor--the doctor who says he told VA \nofficials that Mr. Richardson needed immediate chemotherapy--got in \ncontact with my office to express his outrage and his tremendous \nsadness and anger and frustration at Mr. Richardson's death. In fact, \nthe doctor said this episode was so disturbing that he is no longer \naccepting contract work from the Veterans' Administration. He also said \nthat a VA physician personally told him: ``The system is broken, and \nI'm glad I'm retiring.''\n  Given all of the stories that have accumulated and those that seem to \nappear with every new edition of the daily newspapers--all the reports \nof veterans dying or suffering because of the long wait times, all the \nreports of appointment data being falsified, all the reports of VA \nemployees participating in coverups--given all that, it seems painfully \nclear to me that the system is indeed broken and that the current VA \nleadership is unable or unwilling to do what is necessary to fix it.\n  With that in mind, I know that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, \nSecretary Shinseki, testified today before the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee. I haven't yet had a chance to read the transcript of his \ntestimony, but I am hoping he will have answered or will at some point \nanswer these questions:\n  No. 1. Can you confirm, Secretary Shinseki, that supervisors of VA \nfacilities have been ordering employees to conceal wait times?\n  I would like for him to answer this question: Secretary Shinseki, can \nyou confirm whether VA cancer patients needing chemotherapy are being \nprovided with treatment in a timely manner?\n  No. 3. Secretary Shinseki, can you confirm whether the VA is \nwithholding all bonuses and pay raises from those employees who have \nbeen accused of falsifying appointment data?\n  No. 4. Secretary Shinseki, can you confirm whether VA facilities are \npreserving all appointment-related documents? In other words, can you \nassure the Congress and the American people that evidence is not being \ndestroyed?\n  Finally, Secretary Shinseki, can you confirm whether all VA staffers \nat the facilities under investigation will not be assigned to \ninvestigate other VA facilities--a case of the fox perhaps watching the \nhenhouse.\n  These questions go to the very heart of the VA's credibility or to \nthe lack thereof. We have millions of veterans in this country and tens \nof millions more people who either know a veteran or are related to \none, and I would like to think that all Americans, whether they know a \nveteran, whether they have a veteran as a family member, all Americans \nare united in our concerns with the way our veterans are being treated \nand join with us in our commitment to get to the bottom of this mess \nand figure out what went wrong and fix it. We all deserve answers, and \nwe deserve them now.\n  If Secretary Shinseki cannot provide the necessary assurances, then \nit will become obvious that the VA is suffering from not only a \nsystemic crisis of competence and accountability but from a systemic \ncrisis of leadership as well.\n  I know everybody claims to be outraged by these news reports, by the \nsteady stream of allegations, and yet I fear the Obama administration \nis not treating this with the kind of urgency it demands.\n  Remember, the administration has now spent more than $4\\1/2\\ billion \nsetting up the ObamaCare exchanges, and we remember what happened with \nthe Web site that was the portal where people would sign up for these \nexchanges failed. It was all hands on deck. I commend the \nadministration for its timely response to that problem, but by \ncomparison, with the tragedies we are reading about in the newspapers \nabout the 40 veterans who died in Phoenix while reportedly waiting for \ntreatment at a VA clinic or hospital when put on a secret waiting list, \nI don't see that sense of urgency coming from the administration or \nfrom this Congress, for that matter.\n  I do commend Senator Sanders and Senator Burr, the chair and ranking\n\n[[Page S3062]]\n\nmember of the Veterans' Affairs Committee of the Senate, for having \nSecretary Shinseki and others here today so we can begin the process of \npeeling the layers of the onion so we can get to the truth.\n  I realize the administration has to balance competing priorities, but \nin my view there are few priorities more important than honoring our \nsacred promise to America's military heroes. I would hope we can all \nagree that even one story like Dale Richardson's is one too many. The \ntime for happy talk and empty promises is long past. What our veterans \ndeserve and need now is real accountability and reform and not this \nsort of ``kick the can down the road'' attitude that seems to pervade \nWashington but, rather, a real sense of urgency to get to the bottom of \nthe problem and to fix it without any delay; otherwise, there will be \nmore veterans who will be forced to suffer and possibly lose their life \nas Dale did because of the incompetence of the administration at the VA \nand the lack of leadership necessary to get to the bottom of this and \nget it on the right course.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Markey). The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, after I speak, I ask unanimous consent my \nfriend and colleague from Utah be given the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank him for letting me say a few words.\n\n\n                             Tax Extenders\n\n  I was listening to the debate between the majority leader and the \nminority leader, and I just wanted to be clear. The tax extender bill \nwas negotiated very well by Senators Wyden and Hatch, with many of us \nin the committee participating, and it was truly a bipartisan product. \nThe ideas in there, I would probably say, were half Republican and half \nDemocratic.\n  Senator Hatch made a very good point. He said that is only about 25 \npercent of the Senate. What about everybody else? If we have no \namendments, no one else can legislate.\n  I want to clarify our offer. Senator McConnell said amendments on the \nwhole Tax Code should be allowed. That is no way to legislate. That \ngoes the opposite way. The Finance Committee knows the Tax Code, and as \na result they should get first crack at it; otherwise, we may as well \nnot have a committee system. But we should allow amendments that are \nrelevant or germane to the extenders. There were many extenders. Many \nMembers who are not on the committee probably have many ideas about how \nto change those amendments--make them longer, make them shorter.\n  The House actually took three of our extenders and made them \npermanent. Maybe that is a debate our colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle want to have, which would be a very legitimate debate, even \nthough some people might say that costs too much or it leaves out some \nextenders, et cetera. Maybe some of them don't want to have certain \nextenders in the legislation. Knock them out or enrich them. All of \nthese things are possible.\n  Instead of Senator McConnell's offer--any amendment on the whole Tax \nCode--Senator Wyden offered to Senator Hatch that the Republicans give \nus a list of amendments they propose, and then the two of them would \nsit down and negotiate that list. There will be Democratic amendments--\nI think there are 30 or 40 on Senator Wyden's list--and Republican \namendments on Senator Hatch's list. The two of them are outstanding \nlegislators. They get along well, and we could come up with a list and \nactually move this bill with amendments. That is what I hope will \nhappen over the weekend and on Tuesday we can move forward.\n  To me, the offer of Leader Reid and Senator Wyden makes eminent \nsense. It is how we used to legislate. We didn't lay it open for every \namendment. When the committee chair and ranking member agreed on a \nbill--Lamar Alexander, my good friend from Tennessee, has reiterated \nthis to me over and over--we would then go to the floor and the two of \nthem would work it out, providing fairness to both sides of the aisle \nsince each of them has the respect of their leadership.\n  Again, our offer is plain and simple: Show us your amendments, and we \nwill show you our amendments. Let them be relevant and germane to the \nbill before us, which is tax extenders, and we will be very reasonable \nand accommodating so we can move the bill forward, pass it, and have a \ndebate on improving it with amendments that come up on both sides.\n  With that, I thank my good friend from Utah for yielding the floor \nand letting me speak ahead of him.\n  I yield the floor to the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my dear friend from New York. I \nconsider him one of the better Senators in the Senate and a dear friend \nand a person I have always been able to work with. He is tough--there \nis no question about that--but so am I, although nobody knows that.\n  I just want to speak for a few minutes on this extender package. It \nis a bipartisan bill. It took a lot of work to put it together. We had \nto bring everybody on the Finance Committee together, and that is about \n25 percent of the Senate. We all had a chance to bring up amendments \nwhether they were germane or not, which is the right of Senators. \nSometimes we get some embarrassing amendments, but that is part of the \ncharm of this body.\n  The fact is, if you just want to have germane amendments, that is not \nwhat the U.S. Senate stands for and that is not what the rules say. I \ndon't blame anybody who wants to do that who is trying to push their \nbill, but let's not take away the rights of Members of the Senate. \nLet's not take away the right of debate we have always had on this \nfloor that gives the Senate such charm and also allows everybody to \nparticipate and bring up whatever they feel is right.\n  Sometimes we have to call a halt to it. After days or weeks of debate \non major bills, such as this one, the majority leader may want to end \nthe debate because he feels as though it is enough. At that point--but \nnot before--you can fill the parliamentary tree in order to get the \nagreement between the two sides to where there are just a few \namendments left, but you don't do it by calling up a bill, filing \ncloture, accusing the other side of filibustering when there is no \nintention to filibuster, and then fill the parliamentary tree so you, \nas the majority leader, can determine the type of amendment and who \ndoes and who doesn't get an amendment. That is not the way this great \nSenate is supposed to operate. It is offensive, and it is starting to \nget to our side.\n  If we were in the majority and we did that to the Democrats, you \nfolks would be so upset it wouldn't even be funny. I think it is time \nfor us to start letting the Senate operate as it always has. We will \nget more done, and it will probably be better legislation than not, and \nfrankly, every one of us will feel better about being Members of the \nSenate.\n  Let's be honest. The Republicans have been given nine amendments \nvoted upon since last July in the greatest deliberative body in the \nworld. That is just plain ridiculous and it is not right.\n  Let's take the House. The House is supposed to be more partisan. In \nthe House you have a rules committee that is nine to four. Republicans \nhave nine members and the Democrats have four members. They double the \nnumber in the majority party, plus one. They could stop anything from \nhappening. In the House they have had well over 130 Democratic \namendments since last July--if my recollection is correct on that, and \nI think it is--compared to nine in the greatest deliberative body in \nthe world. Give me a break.\n  The fact is that is less than one amendment a month. You can imagine \nwhy our side is so upset about it, and then we get a bill as important \nas the extenders package. It is not $100 billion, but it is about $88 \nbillion, as I recall. There are very important provisions in this bill. \nThere are some I love and some I don't love too much, but we worked it \nout between the two parties and we each had our own ideas of what was \nright and what was wrong and we worked it out in a bipartisan way.\n  I want to personally pay tribute to the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Wyden of Oregon. His leadership was very much \nacceptable, and it was easier to work out in the end because he was so \nopen and realized we had some ideas too.\n\n[[Page S3063]]\n\n  Our constituents put faith in us to make these decisions and the \ntough choices around here, and that means making them. A democracy \nfunctions because the rules allow it to function. The rules, in my \nopinion, have been bogged down with partisanship and protection effort \nrather than allowing the Senate to work its will. This is not how a \nreal representative Republic functions.\n  I think we have to find a reasonable way forward. I intend to work \nhard to find that reasonable way. I think we have to find a way that \nboth Democrats and Republicans can have their voices heard.\n  When we marked up this bill, it was a fair and open process. Both \nsides had their opportunity to bring up the amendments they wanted, and \nthat is why we came up with a bill that is as acceptable as this one \nis. We had an open amendment process in committee, and it should be \nthat way here too. This bill passed on a voice vote out of the \ncommittee. It took a lot of effort on the part of Senator Wyden, the \nchairman, myself, and everybody else on the committee, but we were able \nto do that.\n  It is important that the American people know why this disagreement \noccurred today. The only procedural possibility that the Republicans \nhad was to vote against cloture and to make it very clear that we don't \nlike the way the Senate is being run today. We don't think it is fair, \nand we don't think it is right. It has nothing do with policy. It has \nto do with how we proceed, and frankly I think a message was sent \ntoday.\n  It is unconscionable to me that Members on both sides, Republicans \nand Democrats, do not have an opportunity to offer their amendments. I \nmight add, it is nice for the majority to say, well, we only want the \ngermane amendments, but I never heard that when they were in the \nminority. They wanted every nongermane amendment they could get that \nmight embarrass Republicans. I personally don't like to see that very \nmuch, but it is a right that has always existed in the Senate, and it \nshould not be taken away and it should not be dismissed by rote.\n  I am going to do my very best, in a bipartisan way with Senator \nWyden, to work out this impasse, but it is going to have to be fair and \nRepublicans are going to have to have a fair shot at having some \namendments.\n  I hope we get rid of this process of calling up a bill and \nimmediately filing cloture because they think Republicans are going to \nfilibuster when there was no intention to filibuster and then filling \nthe parliamentary tree to foreclose any amendments unless the majority \nleader approves. Come on. That is not the way the Senate should run.\n  Frankly, yes, it is a little unwieldy sometimes. Sometimes it doesn't \nrun smoothly, but that is one of the charming things about the Senate, \nand it is one of the things that will bring us together if we can \noccasionally recognize that we have different points of view. The \nRepublicans are more conservative, there is no question about that, and \nthe Democrats are more liberal, there is no question about that. \nActually, I find that to be probably a good thing in many ways because \nboth sides have to try to work it out. But we can't work it out if we \ncan't call up amendments and if it is a stilted process that is \ndetermined only by the majority leader.\n\n  I am going to do everything in my power to get this resolved. I have \nalready chatted with Senator Wyden, the chairman of the committee. He \nsays he is going to do the same, and I know that is true. He is an \nhonorable man. We are going to see if we can come up with a way to \nbring both sides together so we can pass this bill, and hopefully it \nwill be an example of what we can do if we are willing to work \ntogether.\n  We have to get rid of these procedural approaches on every bill. \nSometimes it is appropriate to use any procedure we want to on some \nbills that should not see the light of day. This is not one of those. \nThis is a bill that has to see the light of day. This is a bill that \nwill make a difference in this country. This is a bill that virtually \neverybody in this body wants, to a more or less degree, and some want \nit very much. This is a bill that really needs to pass. This is a bill \nthat, hopefully, when the House passes their bill, we can get together \nin a conference and work it out, as big boys and girls should.\n  What we have been going through here now for 4 years, really, has \nbeen a disgrace. I think it is time to end the disgrace and get all of \nus working together, not necessarily in agreement--sometimes we have to \nfight things out--but working together in a way that is fair to both \nsides.\n  So far, our side feels it hasn't been fair to the Republican side. \nThere has been too much assertion of power in the wrong way, in \nderivation of the rules. It started long ago, but it really came to a \nfull culmination when the majority broke the rules to change the rules. \nOne reason they were able to do that is because many on the other side \nhave never been in the minority in the Senate. I will do my part to see \nthat my friends on the other side have that wonderful experience \nbecause then they will understand why these rules are made to begin \nwith.\n  The filibuster rule in particular was formulated because they \ncouldn't get anything done in the Senate, and it was a way of invoking \ncloture and ending debate so they could get the matter over with. It \nhas worked amazingly well in spite of the fact that from time to time \nwe couldn't get bills through that we wanted to get through. There was \na reason for that rule, and to break the rules to change the rules was \nthe wrong thing to do to begin with. It has caused a lot of bitterness \non the floor.\n  I have heard some Republicans saying: Let's stick it to them. I am \nnot going to allow that to happen. I hope the same is true on the other \nside because I have heard some of the Democrats are saying: Let's stick \nit to them with some special amendments.\n  Let's try to get this done in a way that is meaningful. Let's try to \nget it done in the best interests of the American people. Let's try to \nget it done so that all of us can hold our heads high and say we did \nour best. If we do that, I think we will have a new day in the Senate \nthat literally will work in the best interests of everyone. I don't \nwant my side treating the Democrats the way we have been treated. I \njust don't think it is right. I don't think it is fair. I think it is a \nbig mistake.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          National Police Week\n\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, today I wish to honor and pay tribute to \nour men and women who serve this country every day as America's peace \nofficers. This week is National Police Week. Back in 1962, President \nKennedy designated May 15 as Peace Officers Memorial Day.\n  This is the day we take pause and thank those peace officers who help \nus every day to keep our families safe, and keep our streets safe, and \nkeep law and order so that we can live the lives we live in the United \nStates of America.\n  Our law officers wake up every morning and put on a uniform to show \nus they are with us. It is a symbol they wear proudly and we look up \nto. They are here to protect our communities, our families, and, in \nfact, every one of us. That is a tall order. They frequently place \nthemselves in dangerous situations.\n  Every day perhaps a wife, perhaps a child, perhaps a mother or \nwhoever is in their family watches them walk out the door and wonders: \nWill they return safely?\n  Few among us know what that is--what it is to make a life-and-death \ndecision, to put your life on the line every day as you are working on \nbehalf of the people of your community and the people of your country.\n  Today is also a day where we pay tribute to those officers who have \nmade the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty, those men and women \nwho swore an oath to serve and protect their communities and, in the \ncourse of doing so, lost their lives.\n  This afternoon I attended the National Peace Officers' Memorial \nService on the lawn outside the Capitol. Just as we paid tribute to our \nfallen officers there, I wish to do the same on the Senate floor.\n\n[[Page S3064]]\n\n  These men and women take their duties to serve and protect very \nseriously, and they make this Nation, as a result, a better place for \nall of us.\n  When I served as North Dakota's attorney general in the 1980s I had \nthe privilege and, in fact, the honor to work side-by-side with the men \nand women of our State's law enforcement community. They were highway \npatrolmen, State and local officers, various Federal officers, and \ntribal police. It was a job that I truly began to appreciate--the job \nof law enforcement--that hard work they engage in to serve our State. I \ncan say without a doubt they were the finest public servants I have \never had the honor to stand side by side with.\n  During that time I also experienced the absolute heartbreak of losing \nofficers in the line of duty. Today I want to recognize two of those \nofficers.\n  They are Deputy Sheriff Valence LeeWayne Pascal from the Benson \nCounty Sheriff's Office: On August 26, 1993, Deputy Pascal executed a \nwarrant for an arrest in Leeds, ND. He took the individual into custody \nfor failure to appear in court on a DUI charge, a fairly routine \npractice for a deputy sheriff. While the deputy was sitting in the \nfront seat of his patrol car, the individual in the back seat leaned \nforward and shot him. He died the next day, August 27, 1993.\n  And I also want to recognize Senior Patrol Officer Keith Allen \nBraddock of the Watford City Police Department. Responding to a call \nover an enraged patron at a local bar in Watford City, Officer Braddock \narrived on the scene when the man returned with two rifles and opened \nfire on Officer Braddock. Despite being wounded, Officer Braddock \nreturned fire, hitting the man in a leg and preventing any further \ncasualties. He succumbed to his wounds at the scene and died early that \nmorning on March 20, 1996.\n  When I became attorney general, I formed a lasting bond with those \nofficers, remembering never to forget. As I stood in that leadership \nrole at funerals and at services, watching the parade of police \nofficers, sheriffs' departments, and deputies pay their respect, I told \nmyself: Remember, never forget. Never forget that they had families, \nthat these two officers had someone in their lives who mattered to \nthem. The children's parents will never see them walk the aisle. Those \nchildren will never see their parents be grandparents. Yet this in the \nline of duty.\n  Today is a special day in this Capital City. It is a special day \nacross America when literally hundreds of law enforcement officers \ngather at memorial walls with names on them, similar to the one that is \non the capitol grounds in North Dakota, and where people gather to \nremember how truly grateful we should all be for the people who stand \non the line. They protect our freedom, they protect our safety, and \nsome of them don't make it home as a result.\n  I believe that we owe all of the men and women who have sacrificed a \ngreat debt of gratitude, and today I bring my voice to express my \nappreciation for and remembrance of the wonderful people of America's \nlaw enforcement community.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp).

GAINER\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I rise today to recognize the \nextraordinary work of the Senate Sergeant at Arms Terrance W. Gainer, \nwho is retiring after a distinguished 47-year career in public service.\n  Mr. Gainer, whom many of us still call ``Chief,'' was sworn in as the \n38th U.S. Senate Sergeant at Arms in January 2007, continuing a \ndistinguished career in law enforcement.\n  As the chief law enforcement and executive officer of the Senate, Mr. \nGainer, successfully and--always with great respect for our \ninstitution--enforced the rules of the Senate, maintained security in \nthe Capitol and Senate office buildings, and provided important \nservices to Senators in our Washington, DC and State offices.\n  Mr. Gainer led a force of approximately 850 personnel, many of whom \nhe knew personally, as he often visited their offices. Mr. Gainer \nalways took the time to write personal notes to his employees during \nimportant milestones or events in their lives. He always was quick to \npick up the phone to provide words of encouragement to employees who \nwere in the hospital or condolences to those who lost a family member. \nHis compassion is unwavering.\n  Mr. Gainer met challenges head-on during his leadership. Faced with \ngovernment cutbacks and sequestration, Mr. Gainer guided the first \nmajor right-sizing of the Sergeant at Arms organization in many years. \nThrough a combination of operational efficiency and reorganization, Mr. \nGainer reduced the SAA's total budget by more than 11 percent over 4 \nyears and reduced the number of employees by 100. At the same time, \nservice outputs increased, and customer and employee satisfaction \nremained extremely high.\n  Mr. Gainer could be seen each year, donning a green necktie as he \nescorted the Prime Minister of Ireland around the Capitol on St. \nPatrick's Day, before celebrating his wife Irene's birthday that \nnight--a fitting tribute to his Irish Catholic roots. He also \nconsidered his time spent with the Dalai Lama in the course of his job \nas very special.\n  Mr. Gainer greeted many visitors from around the world in his office\n\n[[Page S3065]]\n\nthat overlooks the west front of the Capitol, down the National Mall to \nthe Washington Monument. He often relayed the story about putting a \nChicago Cubs sticker in his office before a visit from President Obama, \nwho is known to be a Chicago White Sox fan. The office, after all, is \nthat of the Sergeant at Arms, he would remind the U.S. Secret Service \nagents with a grin.\n  While escorting the President during the annual State of the Union \naddress, those who know Mr. Gainer best would recognize the tug of the \near or adjusting of his tie as a sign to his grandchildren watching \nfrom home.\n  Mr. Gainer, who grew up in a family of 10 siblings, began his law \nenforcement career as a police officer in the Chicago Police Department \nand rose through the ranks, including many years as an experienced \nhomicide detective. An accomplished attorney, Mr. Gainer served as \nchief legal officer of that department before he entered the Illinois \nState government as deputy inspector general and deputy director of the \nIllinois State Police. He served at the U.S. Department of \nTransportation as Special Assistant to the Secretary before being \nappointed as Director of the Illinois State Police.\n  In 1998, Mr. Gainer moved to Washington, DC, where he served as \nexecutive assistant chief of police for the Metropolitan Police \nDepartment, and 4 years later was selected to be the Chief of the U.S. \nCapitol Police. He then entered the private sector as a chief executive \nofficer responsible for a multimillion dollar innovative law \nenforcement program supporting military operations in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. The following year, the U.S. Senate appointed Mr. Gainer \nas the Senate Sergeant at Arms.\n  His tenure in law enforcement in DC included the horrific fatal \nshootings of two Capitol police officers, the September 11 attack on \nthe Pentagon, the discovery of anthrax and ricin in Senate mailrooms, \nand mass evacuations triggered by aircraft straying into restricted \nairspace. As second-in-charge of the Washington Metropolitan Police \nDepartment, as Chief of Capitol Police, and as Sergeant at Arms, he \nspearheaded security during four Presidential inaugurations, including \nthe historic swearing in of the first African-American President.\n  While serving as Sergeant at Arms, Mr. Gainer was appointed a \nCommissioner on the Independent Commission on the Security Forces of \nIraq, charged with conducting an independent assessment of the Iraqi \nSecurity Forces and reporting the findings to Congress. He also served \nwith the Special Envoy for Middle East Regional Security, which was \ncreated to advance the resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute by \nassisting in strengthening security institutions.\n  Mr. Gainer served annually on the Blue Mass Committee, responsible \nfor organizing the Blue Mass Service, which is held at St. Patrick's \nCatholic Church in Washington, DC, to pray for those in law enforcement \nand fire safety, remember those who have fallen, and support those who \nserve.\n  Born in Chicago, Mr. Gainer, the son of a milkman and a homemaker, is \na decorated veteran who served in Vietnam and retired as a captain in \nthe United States Navy Reserve. His degrees include a bachelor's degree \nin sociology, a master of science in management, a juris doctor degree, \nand an honorary doctorate of humane letters. He is married and has six \nchildren and 14 grandchildren. Of all his accomplishments, Mr. Gainer \nwould tell you that his family is his greatest accomplishment of all.\n  Congratulations on your retirement from public service and we wish \nyou the very best in your future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/15/senate-section/article/S3065-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3065]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING CAROL REITAN\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, if you drive into the charming, walkable \ntown center of Normal, IL--yes, the town of Normal--you will see the \nbeautiful Carol A. Reitan Conference Center. Who was Carol Reitan?\n  Carol was the mayor of the Town of Normal from 1972 to 1976. For \nthose of you who have been to Normal recently, you will note what a \nforward-thinking community it is--with a vibrant town center, a state \nuniversity, an auto plant, and a high quality of life.\n  It is a twin city with its slightly larger neighbor, Bloomington, \nwhich is home to State Farm Insurance and Illinois Wesleyan University, \namong so many other things. The area around Bloomington-Normal is some \nof the best farmland in the country.\n  Carol Reitan, who was an early and effective community leader, passed \naway this week at the age of 83. But her legacy can be seen \neverywhere--in the people she helped and the community she served and \nhelped prosper.\n  Carol was ahead of her time, both as the first and only female mayor \nof Normal and because of her foresight as a community leader. If you \ntalk to her friends in Central Illinois, you will quickly pick up on a \ncommon set of phrases--a visionary, a mentor, and a leader ahead of her \ntime. I knew Carol, and those descriptions are all true--and just the \ntip of the iceberg.\n  Her accomplishments and dedication to public service are vast and \nlong-lasting--and certainly didn't end after her service as mayor. As \nmayor of Normal from 1972 to 1976 she first introduced a city-manager \nstyle of government. She was the cofounder and president of \nCollaborative Solutions, a nonprofit providing counseling and mediation \nservices for at-risk youth and adults. She played leadership roles in \nestablishing the Heartland Theater Company, Habitat for Humanity of \nMcLean County, and the Community Foundation of McLean County. She \nhelped with the development of the domestic violence shelter Neville \nHouse, and she served as director and chief executive of Mid Central \nCommunity Action.\n  Her work earned many awards, including the Normal Chamber of Commerce \nCitizen of the Year in 1987, the Martin Luther King Jr. Award in 1987, \nand a McLean County History Maker award by the McLean County Museum of \nHistory in 2014.\n  Carol and her husband Earl were also early visionaries when it came \nto the environment, starting Operation Recycle and building a solar \npowered home together, and she was an early supporter of the town's \nelectric vehicle initiative. In Normal, you can use any number of \npublic charging stations to charge your electric car. In fact, when you \nlook at the growing network of charging stations around the country, \none of the most important is in Normal. That is no accident.\n  In 1990, Carol was appointed to the town's 2015 Commission, which was \nto consider goals for the next 25 years. A further stroll around the \nvibrant town shows the results--a children's museum, a multimodal \ntransportation center that includes high-speed rail from Chicago, \nhistoric movie theater, shops, restaurants, a library, and a new hotel \nand conference center--all adjacent to Illinois State University.\n  I met Carol many times over the decades and was always impressed with \nher many gifts that she gave back to the community. She was a leader. \nWhen she walked into a room, you could feel her leadership and \npresence. When I first ran for office in 1978 for Illinois Lieutenant \nGovernor, she was making her second attempt to win an Illinois State \nsenate seat at the same time. We both lost those races. And in 1996, \nwhen I first ran for the U.S. Senate, she was an early supporter. I \nwill never forget her faith in my candidacy.\n  Some on my staff have equally warm memories of Carol while growing up \nin Normal. One in particular is that she made a point of working with \nthose who defeated her in her attempts to win a seat in the Illinois \nState Senate. We could use a bit of that role model here in the \nCongress today.\n  Perhaps current Normal city manager Mark Peterson said it best as \nreported by Central Illinois radio station WJBC, noting:\n\n       She was a visionary, probably born before her time because \n     she was thinking about things 20 and 30 years ago that are \n     happening in Normal now. . . . She had an impact on this \n     community--and I use that term broadly--Bloomington, Normal \n     and McLean County. . . . Few others have had that ability and \n     few others could rival.\n\n  Central Illinois has lost someone truly special this week. My prayers \nand thoughts go out to her husband Earl, daughter Julie, and son Tom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/15/senate-section/article/S3065-2", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3065-S3066]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING SHERRY ADKINS\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I am grateful for this opportunity today \nto pay tribute to a truly extraordinary woman--Sherry Adkins. Sadly, \nSherry passed away on May 13, 2014.\n  I had the wonderful opportunity of working with Sherry for 37 years. \nShe\n\n[[Page S3066]]\n\nfirst came to work with me as my legal secretary when I was in private \npractice as an attorney. When I took office, she began working in my \nUtah Senate office and brought the same dedication and hard work ethic \nshe had displayed in a demanding legal office. Throughout our years of \nworking together I was always so impressed with Sherry's utmost \nattention to detail and accuracy, and her keen mind and abilities. In \nfact, I still miss her taking dictation today. Her fingers could really \nfly, and she always got it right. It was a true talent that has sadly \nbeen lost in today's computer world.\n  Sherry spent many years as a constituent service representative in my \nState office, helping hundreds if not thousands of Utahns with problems \nthey faced while working with several Federal Government agencies. She \nspecialized in helping people with cases involving such agencies as the \nSocial Security Administration, the IRS, the Office of Personnel \nManagement, OPM, and many others. She always displayed deep concern for \nthe challenges people faced, and worked long and hard to help \nindividuals in my behalf. In fact, she developed lasting friendships \nwith some of the people she had assisted and they continued to visit \nher for many years.\n  Sherry always went above and beyond the call of duty. While I was \nserving as the chairman of the Senate Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee, which dealt in part with issues of alcohol prevention and \ntreatment, Sherry and her husband Bruce obtained their drug counseling \ncertificate. She spent many hours working with individuals struggling \nwith the powers of addiction, and even became the choir director for \nthe Utah Odyssey House, a residential substance abuse treatment \nfacility. She touched many lives through her advocacy, support, and \ntalents.\n  As a former member of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, she absolutely \nloved music. She always generously shared her talents not only as a \nbeautiful singer--but she also played the organ weekly for her local \nward or church congregation.\n  Sherry's work and service was very important to her--but her family \nalways came first. She absolutely loved her family. She was married to \nBruce for 54 years, and they are the proud parents of Michael, Gary, \nand Marianne; and grandparents to four grand-children and four great-\ngrand-children. When it came time for Sherry to retire from the U.S. \nSenate, Sherry and Bruce moved to Alaska to be with their daughter and \nin the end were living in Colorado to be closer to their son and grand-\ndaughter. Sherry and Bruce had a great partnership and they were very \nsupportive of each other and their endeavors.\n  I am sincerely grateful for the opportunity I had to work with and \nknow Sherry Adkins. Her loyalty, dedication, and sincere belief in \npublic service were so appreciated. I wholeheartedly agree with the \nsimple narrative another former staff member used when describing \nSherry: ``She was a gem.''\n  Elaine and I extend our deepest sympathies to Bruce and their family \nmembers. May they find peace and comfort in the cherished memories they \nhave shared with this great lady.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/15/senate-section/article/S3066-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3066]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              POLICE WEEK\n\n  Mr. PRYOR.

Madam President, the strength of my State of Iowa \nlies in its vibrant local communities, where citizens come together to \nfoster economic development, make smart investments to expand \nopportunity, and take the initiative to improve the health and well-\nbeing of residents. Over the decades, I have witnessed the growth and \nrevitalization of so many communities across my State, and it has been \ndeeply gratifying to see how my work in Congress has supported these \nlocal efforts.\n  I have always believed in accountability for public officials, and \nthis, my final year in the Senate, is an appropriate time to give an \naccounting of my work across four decades representing Iowa in \nCongress. I take pride in accomplishments that have been national in \nscope--for instance, passing the Americans with Disabilities Act and \nspearheading successful farm bills. But I take a very special pride in \nprojects that have made a big difference in local communities across my \nState.\n  Today, I would like to give an accounting of my work with leaders and \nresidents of Ringgold County to build a legacy of a stronger local \neconomy, better schools and educational opportunities, and a healthier, \nsafer community.\n  Between 2001 and 2013, the creative leadership in your community has \nworked with me to secure funding in Ringgold County worth over $448,000 \nand successfully acquired financial assistance from programs I have \nfought hard to support, which have provided more than $6.3 million to \nthe local economy.\n  Of course my favorite memory of working together has to be working to \nsecure $264,000 for community wellness activities to improve nutrition, \nphysical activity, workplace wellness and smoking cessation.\n  Among the highlights:\n  Wellness and health care: Improving the health and wellness of all \nAmericans has been something I have been passionate about for decades. \nThat is why I fought to dramatically increase funding for disease \nprevention, innovative medical research, and a whole range of \ninitiatives to improve the health of individuals and families not only \nat the doctor's office but also in our communities, schools, and \nworkplaces. I am so proud that Americans have better access to clinical \npreventive services, nutritious food, smoke-free environments, safe \nplaces to engage in physical activity, and information to make healthy \ndecisions for themselves and their families. These efforts not only \nsave lives, they will also save money for generations to come thanks to \nthe prevention of costly chronic diseases, which account for a whopping \n75 percent of annual health care costs. I am pleased that Ringgold \nCounty has recognized this important issue by securing $264,000 for \ncommunity wellness activities.\n  School grants: Every child in Iowa deserves to be educated in a \nclassroom that is safe, accessible, and modern. That is why, for the \npast decade and a half, I have secured funding for the innovative Iowa \nDemonstration Construction Grant Program--better known among educators \nin Iowa as Harkin grants for public schools construction and \nrenovation. Across 15 years, Harkin grants worth more than $132 million \nhave helped school districts to fund a range of renovation and repair \nefforts--everything from updating fire safety systems to building new \nschools. In many cases, these Federal dollars have served as the needed \nincentive to leverage local public and\n\n[[Page S3067]]\n\nprivate dollars, so it often has a tremendous multiplier effect within \na school district. Over the years, Ringgold County has received \n$412,742 in Harkin grants. Similarly, schools in Ringgold County have \nreceived funds that I designated for Iowa Star Schools for technology \ntotaling $25,000.\n  Agricultural and rural development: Because I grew up in a small town \nin rural Iowa, I have always been a loyal friend and fierce advocate \nfor family farmers and rural communities. I have been a member of the \nHouse or Senate Agriculture Committee for 40 years--including more than \n10 years as chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. Across the \ndecades, I have championed farm policies for Iowans that include \neffective farm income protection and commodity programs; strong, \nprogressive conservation assistance for agricultural producers; \nrenewable energy opportunities; and robust economic development in our \nrural communities. Since 1991, through various programs authorized \nthrough the farm bill, Ringgold County has received more than $1.4 \nmillion from a variety of farm bill programs.\n  Disability Rights: Growing up, I loved and admired my brother Frank, \nwho was deaf, but I was deeply disturbed by the discrimination and \nobstacles he faced every day. That is why I have always been a \npassionate advocate for full equality for people with disabilities. As \nthe primary author of the Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA, and the \nADA Amendments Act, I have had four guiding goals for our fellow \ncitizens with disabilities: equal opportunity, full participation, \nindependent living and economic self-sufficiency. Nearly one-quarter \ncentury since passage of the ADA, I see remarkable changes in \ncommunities everywhere I go in Iowa--not just in curb cuts or closed-\ncaptioned television, but in the full participation of people with \ndisabilities in our society and economy, folks who at long last have \nthe opportunity to contribute their talents and to be fully included. \nThese changes have increased economic opportunities for all citizens of \nRinggold County, both those with and without disabilities, and they \nmake us proud to be a part of a community and country that respects the \nworth and civil rights of all of our citizens.\n  This is at least a partial accounting of my work on behalf of Iowa, \nand specifically Ringgold County, during my time in Congress. In every \ncase, this work has been about partnerships, cooperation, and \nempowering folks at the State and local level, including in Ringgold \nCounty, to fulfill their own dreams and initiatives. And, of course, \nthis work is never complete. Even after I retire from the Senate, I \nhave no intention of retiring from the fight for a better, fairer, \nricher Iowa. I will always be profoundly grateful for the opportunity \nto serve the people of Iowa as their Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/15/senate-section/article/S3067-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3067-S3068]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           LINN COUNTY, IOWA\n\n Mr. HARKIN.

But I take a very special pride in \nprojects that have made a big difference in local communities across my \nState.\n  Today, I would like to give an accounting of my work with leaders and \nresidents of Linn County to build a legacy of a stronger local economy, \nbetter schools and educational opportunities, and a healthier, safer \ncommunity.\n  Between 2001 and 2013, the creative leadership in your community has \nworked with me to secure funding in Linn County worth over $400 million \nand successfully acquired financial assistance from programs I have \nfought hard to support, which have provided more than $600 million to \nthe local economy.\n  Of course my favorite memories of working together have to include \nour work together to build a community health center, working to \nrebuild after disastrous flooding in 2008, funding and relocating the \nCedar Rapids Courthouse, improving the Eastern Iowa Airport, improving \nEdgewood Road, building a major intermodal facility, and funding job \ncreating national defense projects at Rockwell Collins, PMX, and \nIntermec.\n  Among the highlights:\n  Investing in Iowa's economic development through targeted community \nprojects: In Eastern Iowa, we have worked together to grow the economy \nby making targeted investments in important economic development \nprojects including improved roads and bridges, modernized sewer and \nwater systems, and better housing options for residents of Linn County. \nIn many cases, I have secured Federal funding that has leveraged local \ninvestments and served as a catalyst for a whole ripple effect of \npositive, creative changes. For example, working with mayors, city \ncouncil members, and local economic development officials in Linn \nCounty, I have fought for $182 million to rebuild the courthouse, $60 \nmillion to improve the Eastern Iowa Airport, $4 million for \nimprovements to Edgewood Road, almost $5 million for the Cedar Rapids \nintermodal facility, and $170 million for creating national defense \nprojects in Cedar Rapids at Rockwell Collins, PMX, and Intermec, \nhelping to create jobs and expand economic opportunities.\n  Main Street Iowa: One of the greatest challenges we face--in Iowa and \nall across America--is preserving the character and vitality of our \nsmall towns and rural communities. This isn't just about economics. It \nis also about maintaining our identity as Iowans.\n  Main Street Iowa helps preserve Iowa's heart and soul by providing \nfunds to revitalize downtown business districts. This program has \nallowed towns like Central City, Mount Vernon, and Cedar Rapids to use \nthat money to leverage other investments to jumpstart change and \nrenewal. I am so pleased that Linn County has earned $256,000 through \nthis program. These grants build much more than buildings. They build \nup the spirit and morale of people in our small towns and local \ncommunities.\n  School grants: Every child in Iowa deserves to be educated in a \nclassroom that is safe, accessible, and modern. That is why, for the \npast decade and a half, I have secured funding for the innovative Iowa \nDemonstration Construction Grant Program--better known among educators \nin Iowa as Harkin grants for public schools construction and \nrenovation.

In many cases, these Federal dollars have served as the needed \nincentive to leverage local public and private dollars, so it often has \na tremendous multiplier effect within a school district. Over the \nyears, Linn County has received $11,840,759 in Harkin grants. \nSimilarly, schools in Linn County have received funds that I designated \nfor Iowa Star Schools for technology totaling $627,432.\n  Disaster mitigation and prevention: In 1993, when historic floods \nripped through Iowa, it became clear to me that the national emergency \nresponse infrastructure was woefully inadequate to meet the needs of \nIowans in flood-ravaged communities. I went to work dramatically \nexpanding the Federal Emergency Management Agency's hazard mitigation \nprogram, which helps communities reduce the loss of life and property \ndue to natural disasters and enables mitigation measures to be \nimplemented during the immediate recovery period. Disaster relief means \nmore than helping people and businesses get back on their feet after a \ndisaster, it means doing our best to prevent the same predictable flood \nor other catastrophe from recurring in the future. The hazard \nmitigation program that I helped create in 1993 provided critical \nsupport to Iowa communities impacted by the devastating floods of 2008. \nLinn County has received over $12 billion to\n\n[[Page S3068]]\n\nremediate and prevent widespread destruction from natural disasters.\n  Wellness and health care: Improving the health and wellness of all \nAmericans has been something I have been passionate about for decades. \nThat is why I fought to dramatically increase funding for disease \nprevention, innovative medical research, and a whole range of \ninitiatives to improve the health of individuals and families not only \nat the doctor's office but also in our communities, schools, and \nworkplaces.

I am pleased that Linn County \nhas recognized this important issue by securing more than $750,000 for \nthe community health center and over $284,000 in wellness grants.\n  Disability Rights: Growing up, I loved and admired my brother Frank, \nwho was deaf, but I was deeply disturbed by the discrimination and \nobstacles he faced every day.

Madam President, the strength of my State of Iowa \nlies in its vibrant local communities, where citizens come together to \nfoster economic development, make smart investments to expand \nopportunity, and take the initiative to improve the health and well-\nbeing of residents. Over the decades, I have witnessed the growth and \nrevitalization of so many communities across my State, and it has been \ndeeply gratifying to see how my work in Congress has supported these \nlocal efforts.\n  I have always believed in accountability for public officials, and \nthis, my final year in the Senate, is an appropriate time to give an \naccounting of my work across four decades representing Iowa in \nCongress. I take pride in accomplishments that have been national in \nscope--for instance, passing the Americans with Disabilities Act and \nspearheading successful farm bills. But I take a very special pride in \nprojects that have made a big difference in local communities across my \nState.\n  Today, I would like to give an accounting of my work with leaders and \nresidents of Taylor County to build a legacy of a stronger local \neconomy, better schools and educational opportunities, and a healthier, \nsafer community.\n  Between 2001 and 2013, the creative leadership in your community has \nworked with me to successfully acquire financial assistance from \nprograms I have fought hard to support, which have provided more than \n$3.8 million to the local economy.\n  Of course my favorite memory of working together has to be their many \nsuccesses in taking advantage of farm bill and Housing and Urban \nDevelopment funding for a variety of projects, including the \nconstruction of the new Cox Manufacturing Company facility, to purchase \nnew machinery and equipment for the city, and to help create affordable \nhousing for area residents.\n  Among the highlights:\n  Main Street Iowa: One of the greatest challenges we face--in Iowa and \nall across America--is preserving the character and vitality of our \nsmall towns and rural communities. This isn't just about economics. It \nis also about maintaining our identity as Iowans.\n  Main Street Iowa helps preserve Iowa's heart and soul by providing \nfunds to revitalize downtown business districts. This program has \nallowed towns like Bedford to use that money to leverage other \ninvestments to jumpstart change and renewal. I am so pleased that \nTaylor County has earned $40,000 through this program. These grants \nbuild much more than buildings. They build up the spirit and morale of \npeople in our small towns and local communities.\n  School grants: Every child in Iowa deserves to be educated in a \nclassroom that is safe, accessible, and modern. That is why, for the \npast decade and a half, I have secured funding for the innovative Iowa \nDemonstration Construction Grant Program--better known among educators \nin Iowa as Harkin grants for public schools construction and \nrenovation. Across 15 years, Harkin grants worth more than $132 million \nhave helped school districts to fund a range of renovation and repair \nefforts--everything from updating fire safety systems to building new \nschools. In many cases, these Federal dollars have served as the needed \nincentive to leverage local public and private dollars, so it often has \na tremendous multiplier effect within a school district. Over the \nyears, Taylor County has received $368,950 in Harkin grants. Similarly, \nschools in Taylor County have received funds that I designated for Iowa \nStar Schools for technology totaling $25,000.\n  Agricultural and rural development: Because I grew up in a small town \nin rural Iowa, I have always been a loyal friend and fierce advocate \nfor family farmers and rural communities. I have been a member of the \nHouse or Senate Agriculture Committee for 40 years--including more than \n10 years as chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. Across the \ndecades, I have championed farm policies for Iowans that include \neffective farm income protection and commodity programs; strong, \nprogressive conservation assistance for agricultural producers; \nrenewable energy opportunities; and robust economic development in our \nrural communities. Since 1991, through various programs authorized \nthrough the farm bill, Taylor County has received more than $2.3 \nmillion from a variety of farm bill programs.\n  Wellness and health care: Improving the health and wellness of all \nAmericans has been something I have been passionate about for decades. \nThat is why I fought to dramatically increase funding for disease \nprevention, innovative medical research, and a whole range of \ninitiatives to improve the health of individuals and families not only \nat the doctor's office but also in our communities, schools, and \nworkplaces. I am so proud that Americans have better access to clinical \npreventive services, nutritious food, smoke-free environments, safe \nplaces to engage in physical activity, and information to make healthy \ndecisions for themselves and their families. These efforts not only \nsave lives, they will also save money for generations to come thanks to \nthe prevention of costly chronic diseases, which account for a whopping \n75 percent of annual health care costs. I am pleased that Taylor County \nhas recognized this important issue by securing $63,000 for community \nwellness improvements.\n  Disability Rights: Growing up, I loved and admired my brother Frank, \nwho was deaf, but I was deeply disturbed by the discrimination and \nobstacles he faced every day. That is why I have always been a \npassionate advocate for full equality for people with disabilities. As \nthe primary author of\n\n[[Page S3069]]\n\nthe Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA, and the ADA Amendments Act, I \nhave had four guiding goals for our fellow citizens with disabilities: \nequal opportunity, full participation, independent living and economic \nself-sufficiency. Nearly one quarter century since passage of the ADA, \nI see remarkable changes in communities everywhere I go in Iowa--not \njust in curb cuts or closed-captioned television, but in the full \nparticipation of people with disabilities in our society and economy, \nfolks who at long last have the opportunity to contribute their talents \nand to be fully included. These changes have increased economic \nopportunities for all citizens of Taylor County, both those with and \nwithout disabilities, and they make us proud to be a part of a \ncommunity and country that respects the worth and civil rights of all \nof our citizens.\n  This is at least a partial accounting of my work on behalf of Iowa, \nand specifically Taylor County, during my time in Congress. In every \ncase, this work has been about partnerships, cooperation, and \nempowering folks at the State and local level, including in Taylor \nCounty, to fulfill their own dreams and initiatives. And, of course, \nthis work is never complete. Even after I retire from the Senate, I \nhave no intention of retiring from the fight for a better, fairer, \nricher Iowa. I will always be profoundly grateful for the opportunity \nto serve the people of Iowa as their Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/15/senate-section/article/S3069-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNIZING BLUE WATER TECHNOLOGIES\n\n Mr. RISCH. Madam President, there are countless modern \nconveniences we take for granted. Paramount among those is the easy \navailability of clean water. Sanitation has been the single biggest \nfactor in the doubling of life expectancy over the last 200 years. Most \nwater we use comes from municipal systems, and those systems in turn \nrely on manufacturers to provide the filtration and treatment \ntechnology necessary for one of life's building blocks. I rise today in \nhonor of one company whose contribution has aided in our continued \nsupply of water--Hayden, Idaho's Blue Water Technologies.\n  Blue Water Technologies began in 2003 as a commercialized extension \nof an idea that was developed at the University of Idaho. After 5 years \nof research, the university developed the Blue PRO system, a better way \nto remove arsenic from drinking water and phosphorous from wastewater. \nFrom there Blue Water Technologies licensed the patent-pending process \nfrom the University and began several pilot projects. As their \nreputation grew, Blue Water Technologies earned a grant from the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency to conduct a study on metal and \nphosphorus removal. By 2005, the process was demonstrated to be \neffective at full-scale use through the tremendous success of the use \nof the system at the Hayden Wastewater Research Facility. Within 4 \nyears, Blue Water expanded its business internationally.\n  Today, Blue Water Technologies is an international industry leader, \nspanning six continents. Their customers include municipal systems and \nindustrial facilities of all sizes. Providing solutions that are both \ncost-effective and environmentally friendly, Blue Water Technologies is \nconstantly finding new ways to handle emerging problems such as \nwildlife being harmed by the presence of trace amounts of \npharmaceuticals in their water supply.\n  Blue Water Technologies is home to a dynamic and talented team who \npossess the diverse backgrounds and specializations vital to \nunderstanding and adapting to the water needs of a varied group of \nconsumers, both public and private. Their use of best practices is \nvital to the efficiency and sustainability of their organization and to \nthe constantly evolving nature of water treatment technology. I want to \nthank Blue Water Technologies for their efforts in making our water \nsafer in environmentally friendly ways and congratulate them on their \ncontinued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/15/senate-section/article/S3069-2", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/15/senate-section/article/S3069-3", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/15/senate-section/article/S3069-4", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3069-S3070]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n        EC-5777.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania memorializing the Congress of \n     the United States and the President of the United States to \n     reauthorize the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program; to the \n     Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 340\n\n       Whereas, The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program \n     Reauthorization (TRIPRA) maintains stability in the insurance \n     and reinsurance markets by continuing to deliver substantive, \n     direct benefits to businesses, workers, consumers and the \n     economy overall in the aftermath of a terrorist attack on the \n     United States; and\n       Whereas, Insurance protects the United States economy from \n     the adverse effects of the risks inherent in economic growth \n     and development while also providing the resources necessary \n     to rebuild physical and economic infrastructure, offer \n     indemnification for business disruption and provide coverage \n     for medical and liability costs from injuries and loss of \n     life in the event of catastrophic losses to persons or \n     property; and\n       Whereas, The terrorist attack of September 11, 2001, \n     produced insured losses larger than any natural or manmade \n     event in history, with claims paid by insurers to their \n     policyholders eventually totaling approximately $32.5 \n     billion, making it the second most costly insurance event in \n     United States history; and\n       Whereas, The sheer enormity of the terrorist-induced loss, \n     combined with the possibility of future attacks, produced \n     financial shock waves that shook insurance markets, causing \n     insurers and reinsurers to exclude coverage arising from acts \n     of terrorism from virtually all commercial property and \n     liability policies; and\n       Whereas, The lack of terrorism risk insurance contributed \n     to a paralysis in the economy, especially in construction, \n     tourism, business travel and real estate finance; and\n       Whereas, The United States Congress originally passed the \n     Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-297, 116 \n     Stat. 2322) (TRIA), in which the Federal Government agreed to \n     provide terrorism reinsurance to insurers and reauthorized \n     this arrangement via the Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension \n     Act of 2005 (Public Law 109-144, 119 Stat. 2660) and the \n     Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 \n     (Public Law 110-160, 121 Stat. 1839) (TRIPRA); and\n       Whereas, Under TRIPRA, the Federal Government provides \n     reinsurance after industrywide losses attributable to annual \n     certified terrorism events exceeding $100,000,000; and\n       Whereas, Coverage under TRIPRA is provided to an individual \n     insurer after the insurer has incurred losses related to \n     terrorism equal to 20% of the insurer's previous year's \n     earned premium for property-casualty lines; and\n       Whereas, After an individual insurer has reached such a \n     threshold, the insurer pays 15% of residual losses and the \n     Federal Government pays the remaining 85%; and\n       Whereas, The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program has an annual \n     cap of $100,000,000,000 of aggregate-insured losses, beyond \n     which the Federal program does not provide coverage; and\n       Whereas, TRIPRA requires the Federal Government to recoup \n     100% of the benefits provided under the program via \n     policyholder surcharges to the extent the aggregate-insured \n     losses are less than $27,500,000,000 and enables the \n     government to recoup expenditures beyond that mandatory \n     recoupment amount; and\n       Whereas, Without question, TRIA and its successors are the \n     principal reason for the continued stability in the insurance \n     and reinsurance market for terrorism insurance to the benefit \n     of our overall economy; and\n       Whereas, The presence of a robust private/public \n     partnership has provided stability and predictability and has \n     allowed insurers to actively participate in the market in a \n     meaningful way; and\n       Whereas, Without a program such as TRIPRA, many of our \n     citizens who want and need terrorism coverage to operate \n     their businesses all across the nation would be either unable \n     to get insurance or unable to afford the limited coverage \n     that would be available; and\n       Whereas, Without Federally provided reinsurance, property \n     and casualty insurers will face less access to terrorism \n     reinsurance and will therefore be severely restricted in \n     their ability to provide sufficient coverage that is \n     necessary to support our economy when acts of terrorism \n     occur; and\n       Whereas, Despite the hard work and dedication of this \n     nation's counterterrorism agencies and the bravery of the men \n     and women in uniform who fought and continue to fight battles \n     abroad to keep us safe here at home, the threat of terrorist \n     attacks in the United States is both real and substantial and \n     will remain as such for the foreseeable future: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate urge the President of the United \n     States and the Congress\n\n[[Page S3071]]\n\n     of the United States to reauthorize the Terrorism Risk \n     Insurance Program; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, the Speaker and Clerk of \n     the United States House of Representatives, the President Pro \n     Tempore and the Secretary of the United States Senate, each \n     member of Congress from Pennsylvania and to the news media of \n     Pennsylvania.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-225. A joint memorial adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Idaho urging the President of the United States, the \n     Secretary of Agriculture, and Congress to give Idaho \n     authority relative to the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance \n     Program (SNAP); to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, \n     and Forestry.\n\n                     Senate Joint Memorial No. 105\n\n       Whereas, the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program \n     (SNAP) is administered by the states on behalf of the United \n     States Department of Agriculture, and the states are subject \n     to the rules promulgated by the United States Department of \n     Agriculture and Congress; and\n       Whereas, the health and welfare of the citizens of Idaho \n     can be affected by their consumption of food items purchased \n     with SNAP benefits; and\n       Whereas, a comprehensive healthy Supplemental Nutritional \n     Assistance Program (SNAP) for Idaho citizens would include, \n     and should emphasize, consumption of healthy Idaho grown and \n     produced products; and\n       Whereas, individuals who participate in healthy eating \n     choices have less chance of developing chronic diseases and \n     therefore, are able to be more productive employees, citizens \n     and more involved in their families' lives; and\n       Whereas, our children's futures and consequently the future \n     of our nation are directly impacted by the food choices that \n     are made for our children; and\n       Whereas, a healthy diet can consist of all food items, \n     provided there is appropriate education and emphasis given to \n     healthier food options to include proteins, grains, dairy and \n     fruits and vegetables; and\n       Whereas, taxpayers have a right to expect that, whenever \n     possible, decisions regarding the use of their tax dollars \n     will be made at the state and local level; and\n       Whereas, if there is more state and local authority over \n     foods authorized to be purchased with SNAP funds, Idaho can \n     potentially improve the health of SNAP recipients, promote \n     Idaho grown agricultural products and reduce the states' \n     expenses for health care costs; and\n       Whereas, citizens may benefit from education to enable them \n     to make healthier and more cost-effective decisions about \n     purchasing food and having local control over foods \n     authorized to be purchased with SNAP funds would give state-\n     based producers an opportunity to educate citizens about the \n     benefits of consuming their products: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the members of the Second Regular Session of \n     the Sixty-second Idaho Legislature, The Senate and the House \n     of Representatives concurring therein, that the Legislature \n     calls upon the President of the United States, the Secretary \n     of Agriculture and Congress to give Idaho the flexibility to \n     have control over foods authorized for purchase with \n     Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits \n     and to encourage healthy eating and lifestyle choices; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That Idaho should be given the flexibility to \n     determine the best methods of helping our citizens create a \n     comprehensive state-based approach to promote physical \n     activity, nutritional food selections, including a focus on \n     Idaho grown agricultural products, and healthy lifestyle \n     choices; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate be, and she is \n     hereby authorized and directed to forward a copy of this \n     Memorial to the President of the United States, to the \n     President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives of Congress, to the congressional delegation \n     representing the State of Idaho in the Congress of the United \n     States, to the Secretary of the United States Department of \n     Agriculture and the Secretary of the United States Department \n     of Health and Human Services.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-226. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Iowa \n     requesting immediate action be taken by the United States \n     Congress to repeal California legislation relative to the \n     Commerce Clause of the Constitution of the United States; to \n     the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 123\n\n       Whereas, in 2008, California voters approved Proposition 2, \n     a ballot initiative that prohibits California farmers from \n     employing a number of agricultural production methods in \n     widespread use throughout the United States, including the \n     use of industry standards used in egg production; and\n       Whereas, in 2010, in response to the proposition which \n     would have placed California in a competitive disadvantage by \n     increasing the cost of egg production within that state, the \n     California State Legislature enacted AB 1437 which requires \n     other states to comply with California's standards in order \n     to continue to market eggs in that state; and\n       Whereas, Section 25996 of the California Health and Safety \n     Code states that commencing January 1, 2015, a shelled egg \n     cannot be sold or contracted to sell for human consumption in \n     California if the egg was produced on a farm not meeting \n     California standards; and\n       Whereas, the effect of California's legislation is to \n     increase consumer prices, create financial hardship on low-\n     income families, and deny egg farmers their right to access \n     the nation's markets; and\n       Whereas, the ``Commerce Clause'' Article I, Section 8 of \n     the Constitution of the United States provides in relevant \n     part, that ``Congress shall have Power . . . [t]o regulate \n     commerce . . . among the several States . . .''; which has \n     established a free trade zone now encompassing fifty states, \n     the District of Columbia, and the territories of the United \n     States; and\n       Whereas, the Commerce Clause is an enumerated power granted \n     to Congress and is also a restriction imposed on states from \n     enacting legislation that places an undue burden on \n     interstate commerce; and\n       Whereas, in Federalist No. 11, Alexander Hamilton \n     understood that ``a free circulation of the commodities'' \n     among the states constituted a vital component of this \n     nation's prosperity; and\n       Whereas, since 1824, in the landmark decision Gibbons v. \n     Ogden, 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 1 (1824), the United States Supreme \n     Court has found that states are limited in their ability to \n     burden interstate commerce; and\n       Whereas, since then the principle has been long respected \n     that the Commerce Clause bars states from erecting trade \n     barriers that would otherwise inevitably lead to interstate \n     trade wars, incite retaliation among the states, and \n     ultimately irreparably injure our federal union; and\n       Whereas, on February 3, 2014, the Honorable Chris Koster, \n     Attorney General of the State of Missouri, brought suit in \n     the United States District Court in the Eastern District of \n     California, Fresno Division, asking the court to declare the \n     California statute invalid, including as a violation of the \n     Commerce Clause; and\n       Whereas, the Honorable Terry E. Branstad, Governor of the \n     State of Iowa, together with the attorneys general of the \n     states of Alabama, Nebraska, and Oklahoma, and the attorney \n     general of the Commonwealth of Kentucky have joined with the \n     State of Missouri in this case; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That the State of \n     California immediately repeal all unconstitutional provisions \n     enacted in AB 1437, including Section 25996 of the California \n     Health and Safety Code; and be it further\n       Resolved, That all necessary and immediate action be taken \n     by the United States Congress, the United States Attorney \n     General, state legislatures, state governors, and state \n     attorneys general to ensure the repeal of all \n     unconstitutional provisions enacted in AB 1437, including \n     Section 25996 of the California Health and Safety Code; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the Honorable Ellen M.

A resolution adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Nebraska supporting the participation of Taiwan as \n     an observer in the International Civil Aviation Organization \n     and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \n     Change; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n                       Legislative Resolution 38\n\n       Whereas, civil aviation plays a pivotal role in promoting \n     cultural exchange, business, trade, and tourism; and\n       Whereas, the development of international civil aviation in \n     a safe and orderly manner is the supreme cause of the \n     International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO); and\n       Whereas, with an excellent geographic location, Taiwan is a \n     key aviation hub for regions in northeastern and southeastern \n     Asia; and\n       Whereas, the Taipei Flight Information Region (FIR), \n     bordering the FIR of Fukuoka, Manila, Hong Kong, and \n     Shanghai, includes fourteen international airways and four \n     domestic airways, providing services for more than one \n     million flights per year;\n       Whereas, each year, forty million travelers enter, leave, \n     or pass through the Taipei FIR, making Taiwan a key part of \n     air navigation in East Asia; and\n       Whereas, currently, more than fifty domestic and foreign \n     airlines operate flights from Taiwan to one hundred ten \n     cities in the\n\n[[Page S3073]]\n\n     world and the annual number of passengers on international \n     flights is approximately thirty million; and\n       Whereas, in 2010, the number of international passengers at \n     Taiwan's largest airport--Taoyuan International Airport--\n     ranked sixteenth worldwide while international cargo ranked \n     ninth, making Taiwan one of the busiest airspaces in the \n     world; and\n       Whereas, without Taiwan's participation, the international \n     flight plans, regulations, and procedures that the ICAO \n     formulates will be incomplete and unsafe; and\n       Whereas, as an island in the Pacific Ocean, Taiwan is \n     imperiled by rising sea levels and the ravages of extreme \n     weather; and\n       Whereas, it is apparent that to overcome the challenges \n     posed by climate change, there must be concerted effort and \n     cooperation among the world citizenry; and\n       Whereas, Taiwan's exclusion from meaningful participation \n     in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change \n     (UNFCCC) has been to the detriment of both the Taiwan people \n     and the global community, as Taiwan not only has the means \n     but also the incentive to make a meaningful contribution; and\n       Whereas, Taiwan's request to participate in the ICAO and \n     the UNFCCC is fully in line with the United States \n     Government's policy of supporting Taiwan's meaningful \n     participation in United Nations specialized agencies: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Members of the One Hundred Third \n     Legislative of Nebraska, First Session:\n       1. That the Legislature endorses Taiwan's participation in \n     the International Civil Aviation Organization as an observer.\n       2. That the Legislature is supportive of all efforts to \n     grant Taiwan official observer status at the United Nations \n     Framework Convention on Climate Change, and, as a \n     collaborative partner of the United States on a wide range of \n     public issues, Taiwan should be afforded the opportunity to \n     participate in global efforts aimed at reducing and \n     preventing natural disasters.\n       3.

A joint memorial adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Idaho urging the United States Congress to maintain \n     an open and accessible record of states' Article V \n     applications for a constitutional convention; to the \n     Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                     Senate Joint Memorial No. 104\n\n       Whereas, under Article V of the Constitution of the United \n     States, Congress has a duty to call a convention for \n     proposing amendments to the Constitution ``on the application \n     of the legislatures of two-thirds of the several states''; \n     and\n       Whereas, the duty to call an Article V convention on \n     application of the states implies that Congress shall keep an \n     accurate record of such applications of the legislatures of \n     the states; and\n       Whereas, the records of Congress should be open and \n     accessible to the people of the United States; and\n       Whereas, Congress does not currently keep a record of the \n     Article V applications of the states: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Members of the Second Regular Session of \n     the Sixty-second Idaho Legislature, the Senate and the House \n     of Representatives concurring therein, that Congress shall \n     maintain a record of the Article V applications of the states \n     in a form that is open and accessible to the people of the \n     United States; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate be, and she is \n     hereby authorized and directed to forward a copy of this \n     Memorial to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of \n     the House of Representatives of Congress, and the \n     congressional delegation representing the State of Idaho in \n     the Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-232. A resolution adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Nebraska urging the United States Congress to take \n     affirmative action to enact comprehensive reform to update \n     the immigration system; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                       Legislative Resolution 399\n\n       Whereas, the Legislature recognizes that our federal \n     immigration laws are long outdated, causing harm to families, \n     businesses, and communities; and\n       Whereas, common-sense reforms that modernize our outdated \n     immigration laws and that are sensible, fair, and practical \n     are necessary to protect our borders and create a strong \n     foundation for our economy and society; and\n       Whereas, immigration has always been an important part of \n     the social and economic fabric of the United States, and it \n     is in the best interest of all that our nation's immigration \n     laws be kept up-to-date; and\n       Whereas, although comprehensive immigration reform is a \n     federal and not a state matter, the State of Nebraska has \n     legitimate interests in the passage of effective immigration \n     laws at the federal level; and\n       Whereas, Nebraska's towns and cities have experienced \n     significant growth in immigrant population in the last two \n     decades which has helped the state maintain its population; \n     and\n       Whereas, Nebraska community leaders, educators, business \n     owners, cattlemen, farmers, and the immigrant community have \n     recognized that while some challenges are created by \n     integrating new immigrant Nebraskans, the positive impacts of \n     immigration, including economic development, tax collections, \n     and cultural diversity, exceed the costs of resolving these \n     challenges, demonstrated by the fact that many communities \n     with significant immigrant populations are thriving unlike \n     many of those communities which have not attracted \n     immigrants; and\n       Whereas, Nebraska population trends indicate a future \n     shortage of needed and qualified labor in agriculture and the \n     skilled trades and a shortage of professionally-trained \n     workers in our rural communities; and\n       Whereas, pending legislation is before the United States \n     Congress which would accomplish comprehensive immigration \n     reform: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Members of the One Hundred Third \n     Legislature of Nebraska, Second Session:\n       1. That the Legislature recommends that the Nebraska \n     congressional delegation take affirmative action to enact \n     comprehensive immigration reform to update our immigration \n     system.\n       2. That such reform enacted by Congress should recognize \n     the need to protect the borders of the United States, \n     maintain respect for the law, embody fairness, and protect \n     families.\n       3. That such reform should recognize the important role \n     that immigrant Americans play as entrepreneurs, workers, \n     taxpayers, and family members.\n       4. That such reform should protect agriculture, small \n     businesses, and working Nebraskans and facilitate increases \n     in the labor market and the professions necessary to protect \n     rural communities from further economic decline.\n       5. That the Legislature recommends that in order to ensure \n     adequate labor resources to support economic growth and \n     stability, the House of Representatives should pass H.R. 15, \n     the ``Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration \n     Modernization Act,'' as approved by the United States Senate, \n     or alternatively should enact similar legislation in 2014 \n     which embodies the principles and needs outlined in this \n     resolution.\n       6. That a copy of this resolution be delivered to the \n     President of the United States, to the Speaker of the United \n     States House of Representatives, to the President of the \n     United States Senate, and to each member of the Nebraska \n     congressional delegation\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-233. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Louisiana memorializing the Congress of the United States to \n     reauthorize the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program; to the \n     Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 18\n\n       Whereas, insurance protects the United States economy from \n     the adverse effects of the risks inherent in economic growth \n     and development while also providing the resources necessary \n     to rebuild physical and economic infrastructure, offer \n     indemnification for business disruption, and provide coverage \n     for medical and liability costs from injuries and loss of \n     life in the event of catastrophic losses to persons or \n     property; and\n       Whereas, the terrorist attack of September 11, 2001, \n     produced insured losses larger than any natural or man-made \n     event in history, with claims paid by insurers to their \n     policyholders eventually totaling some $32.5 billion, making \n     this the second most costly insurance event in United States \n     history; and\n       Whereas, the sheer enormity of the terrorist-induced loss, \n     combined with the possibility of future attacks, produced \n     financial shockwaves that shook insurance markets causing \n     insurers and reinsurers to exclude coverage arising from acts \n     of terrorism from virtually all commercial property and \n     liability policies; and\n       Whereas, the lack of terrorism risk insurance contributed \n     to a paralysis in the economy, especially in construction, \n     tourism, business travel, and real estate finance; and\n       Whereas, the United States Congress originally passed the \n     Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, in which the federal \n     government agreed to provide terrorism reinsurance to \n     insurers and reauthorized this arrangement via the Terrorism \n     Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005, and the Terrorism Risk \n     Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 (TRIPRA); and\n       Whereas, under TRIPRA the federal government provides such \n     reinsurance after industry-wide losses attributable to annual \n     certified terrorism events exceed one hundred million \n     dollars; and\n       Whereas, coverage under TRIPRA is provided to an individual \n     insurer after the insurer has incurred losses related to \n     terrorism equal to twenty percent of the insurer's previous \n     year earned premium for property-casualty lines; and\n       Whereas, after an individual insurer has reached such a \n     threshold, the insurer pays fifteen percent of residual \n     losses and the federal government pays the remaining eighty-\n     five percent; and\n       Whereas, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program has an annual \n     cap of one hundred billion dollars of aggregate insured \n     losses, beyond which the federal program does not provide \n     coverage; and\n       Whereas, TRIPRA requires the federal government to recoup \n     one hundred percent of\n\n[[Page S3074]]\n\n     the benefits provided under the program via policy holder \n     surcharges to the extent the aggregate insured losses are \n     less than twenty-seven billion five hundred million dollars \n     and enables the government to recoup expenditures beyond that \n     mandatory recoupment amount; and\n       Whereas, without question, TRIPRA and its successors are \n     the principal reason for the continued stability in the \n     insurance and reinsurance market for terrorism insurance to \n     the benefit of our overall economy; and\n       Whereas, the presence of a robust private and public \n     partnership has provided stability and predictability and has \n     allowed insurers to actively participate in the market in a \n     meaningful way; and\n       Whereas, without a program such as TRIPRA, many of our \n     citizens who want and need terrorism coverage to operate \n     their businesses all across the nation would be either unable \n     to get insurance or unable to afford the limited coverage \n     that would be available; and\n       Whereas, without federally provided reinsurance, property \n     and casualty insurers will face less availability of \n     terrorism reinsurance and will therefore be severely \n     restricted in their ability to provide sufficient coverage \n     for acts of terrorism to support our economy; and\n       Whereas, despite the hard work and dedication of this \n     nation's counterterrorism agencies and the bravery of the men \n     and women in uniform who fought and continue to fight battles \n     abroad to keep us safe here at home, the threat from \n     terrorist attacks in the United States is both real and \n     substantial and will remain as such for the foreseeable \n     future: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate of the Legislature of Louisiana \n     hereby memorializes the Congress of the United States to \n     reauthorize the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and \n     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives and \n     to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United \n     States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-234. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana recognizing May 2014 as Amyotrophic \n     Lateral Sclerosis Awareness Month and memorializing the \n     Congress of the United States to enact legislation to provide \n     additional research funding relative to finding a treatment \n     and cure for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; to the Committee \n     on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 52\n\n       Whereas, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, is more \n     commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease; and\n       Whereas, ALS is a fatal neurodegenerative disease \n     characterized by degeneration of cell bodies of the lower \n     motor neurons in the gray matter of the anterior horns of the \n     spinal cord; and\n       Whereas, the initial symptom of ALS is usually weakness of \n     the skeletal muscles, especially those of the extremities; \n     and\n       Whereas, as ALS progresses, the patient typically \n     experiences difficulty in swallowing, talking, and breathing; \n     and\n       Whereas, ALS eventually causes muscles to atrophy and the \n     patient becomes a functional quadriplegic; and\n       Whereas, ALS does not affect mental capacity of the \n     patient, such that the patient remains alert and aware of \n     surroundings and aware of the loss of motor functions and the \n     inevitable outcome of continued deterioration and death; and\n       Whereas, on average, patients diagnosed with ALS survive \n     only two to five years from the time of diagnosis; and\n       Whereas, despite the catastrophic consequences of a \n     diagnosis of ALS, the disease currently has no known cause, \n     means of protection, or cure; and\n       Whereas, research indicates that military veterans are at a \n     sixty percent greater risk of developing ALS than those who \n     have not served in the military; and\n       Whereas, the United States Department of Veterans Affairs \n     has promulgated regulations to establish a presumption of \n     service connection for ALS thereby presuming that the \n     development of ALS was incurred or aggravated by a veteran's \n     service in the military; and\n       Whereas, a national ALS registry, administered by the \n     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is currently \n     identifying cases of ALS in the United States and may become \n     the largest ALS research project ever undertaken; and\n       Whereas, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Awareness Month \n     increases the awareness of the circumstances of living with \n     ALS and acknowledges the terrible impact this disease has not \n     only on the patient, but also on the family and community of \n     anyone receiving such a diagnosis; and\n       Whereas, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Awareness Month also \n     increases awareness of research being done to eradicate this \n     dire disease. Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     recognize May 2014 as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Awareness \n     Month; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to enact \n     legislation to provide additional funding for research in \n     order to find a treatment and cure for Amyotrophic Lateral \n     Sclerosis; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the secretary of the United States Senate and the clerk of \n     the United States House of Representatives and to each member \n     of the Louisiana delegation to the United States Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/15/senate-section/article/S3074-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3074]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. KAINE:\n       S. 2341.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. KAINE:\n  S. 2341. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to enhance the \nauthority for members of the Armed Forces to obtain professional \ncredentials; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, since taking office, one of my highest \npriorities has been finding solutions to the unemployment rate among \nAmerican veterans. We proudly in Virginia proclaim a tighter connection \nwith the American military than any other State--and I know 99 or 98 \nother Senators would argue with me about that, but 1 in 9 Virginians is \na veteran. Virginia has 27 military installations, including the \nlargest naval base in the world in Norfolk, and all marine officers are \ntrained at Quantico. Virginia's map is a map of Virginia's military \nhistory: Yorktown, where the Revolutionary War ended; Appomattox, where \nthe Civil War ended, and other Civil War battlefields; and the \nPentagon, where one of the two attacks on 9/11 occurred.\n  Our servicemembers in Virginia and nationally make a tremendous \nsacrifice for our country, and we have to have a commitment to honor \nthese sacrifices and demonstrate to service men and women the same \ndegree of commitment as they have demonstrated to our country.\n  That is what makes the unemployment rate among our veterans so \ntroubling. Veterans who are exiting military service in the Iraq and \nAfghan war era--especially enlisted men and women who may not have \ncollege degrees--have an unemployment rate significantly higher than \nthe national average. In fact--a statistic that when I heard it really \nstunned me--between the fiscal year 2001 and 2012, the Department of \nDefense spent $9.6 billion on unemployment insurance payments--$9.6 \nbillion in payments to men\n\n[[Page S3077]]\n\nand women who had exited the military and then couldn't find a job. \nObviously, these are men and women who served valiantly during the \nlongest period of war in the history of this country.\n  As our Armed Forces continue to draw down in Afghanistan after nearly \n13 years of combat operations--and those combat operations are \nscheduled to cease this year--we have to do everything we can to ensure \nthat these servicemembers can find a way to quickly transition from \nmilitary to civilian life and find good jobs in the process.\n  We know--and the Presiding Officer knows very well in his personal \ncapacity--that servicemembers gain incredibly valuable skills while \nserving in the military. We make a significant investment as a society \nin training each and every member of our Armed Forces in a military \noccupation or specialty, many of which of have parallel fields in the \ncivilian workforce.\n  I have a child in the military now. Watching the degree of training \nhe undergoes--training that will be very valuable for civilian work \nwhen he chooses to make that transition--and seeing the kind of \ntraining his colleagues undergo as well convinces me of these great \nskills that adhere in our military. But instead of making it easier for \nthese servicemembers to get credit for their skills that would help \nthem as they transition to civilian life, they are often continuing to \nface roadblocks.\n  That inspired me to introduce my first bill as a Senator last year, \nthe Troop Talent Act of 2013. The Troop Talent Act required that \ninformation on civilian credentialing opportunities be made available \nto servicemembers during their Active-Duty training and that \ninformation on military training and experience be provided to civilian \ncredentialing agencies to help them understand how the skills for \nsuccess in military life transfer directly to the skills for success in \ncivilian life. If you are learning to operate heavy equipment in the \nmilitary, get the commercial driver's license right when you are \nlearning it. If you are learning to be a battlefield medic in the \nmilitary, get physician assistant or nursing credits right when you are \ngetting that. If you are at the ordnance school at Fort Lee in Virginia \nlearning to be an ordnance officer, get the American Welding Society's \ncertificate after you take your welding class, put it in the personnel \nfile, and when you get ready to move to civilian life, you will have \ncredentials that will be understood by a civilian workforce.\n\n  I am proud that key parts of the bill were signed into law as part of \nthe national defense authorization bill we passed in December, and with \nthis information servicemembers will be more prepared to transfer into \ncivilian life. They will have a better sense of what skills \nservicemembers possess as they enter civilian life. So the passage of \nthis Troop Talent Act was for me a first step, but there are many more \nsteps we have to take to tackle this problem of veterans' unemployment.\n  In speaking with military leadership, servicemembers and veterans, I \nhave learned there are some additional barriers to the employment of \nour veterans that deal with how tuition assistance monies can be used \nby those in active service. One is the cost of fees associated with \ngetting credentials while on Active Duty. Those costs of credentials \nare not covered by the current military tuition assistance program.\n  Some military members transfer out of the service and they decide to \npursue a degree at a college or university, but others are ready to \nimmediately enter the workforce with the skills they obtained through \nmilitary training. Again, to use the example I started with earlier, if \nyou are a logistics ordnance officer training in Fort Lee in Virginia, \nyou take metalworking courses, you take welding courses, and those are \nthe kinds of skills in very significant demand in the American \nmanufacturing sector right now. Those individuals often have an \nability--they certainly have the skills--to get good jobs when they \nleave. But they often lack something important. They lack the \ncredential the civilian workforce understands--in this case an American \nWelding Society credential, for example.\n  Currently, the military tuition assistance program provides Active-\nDuty servicemembers financial assistance up to $4,500 in aggregate per \nfiscal year for postsecondary courses or degree programs. While you are \nin service, you can take degree programs, and up to $4,500 a year, \nthose degree programs and courses will be supported by the military \ntuition assistance program. But despite the success of this program, \ncertification and license fees are not allowed to be paid with tuition \nassistance benefits.\n  So in other words, if you are in the military and you want to take a \ncollege course, you can get paid. If you are in the military and you \nwant to pass a welding certificate exam to be a welder, the tuition \nassistance program will not pay for that. This is a challenge because \nthese credentialing exams can cost significantly out-of-pocket, often \n$300 to $500, and many of our enlisted men and women don't have that. \nIt is really inequitable we would allow Active-Duty military to draw \ndown up to $4,500 for college courses but not draw down one penny to \nget a credential for a technical skill they maintain.\n  This is part of a larger societal issue. I think we value college and \ncommunity college in a way we do not or have not traditionally valued \ncareer and technical education programs. So many of our programs--Pell \ngrants and Stafford loans, GI bill benefits--often can be used more \neasily for community college or 4-year colleges than they can be used \nfor even the highest quality career and technical programs.\n  That is why today I am introducing the Credentialing Improvement for \nTroop Talent, or CREDIT Act. The legislation will go into that military \ntuition assistance program and expand the authority of the program so \nthat it can cover credentialing expenses for those military men and \nwomen who want to move into career and technical fields. It will give \nservicemembers the means to pay for credentials while they are still on \nActive-Duty and before they transition into civilian workforce.\n  In addition, the legislation will ensure the credentials our \nservicemembers earn are of the highest quality and that they are \nrecognized by national and international standards, and not offered by \nshady or sort of fly-by-night organizations that simply want to pocket \nmoney that our military men and women are entitled to in order to help \nthem get an education for themselves.\n  We in Virginia have seen firsthand how the skills and talents of the \nmen and women who serve our country can benefit our workforce and \ncontribute to our economy. We make a huge investment in our \nservicemembers, and it is a disservice not only to them but also to our \nNation not to take advantage of the skills we bestow on these men and \nwomen once they transition to civilian life. We have to, all of us, Mr. \nPresident, stay focused on this. It is unacceptable for us as a Nation \nto look in the mirror and say: Our servicemen and women who served in \nIraq and Afghanistan have an unemployment rate higher than the national \naverage, but I guess there is nothing we can do about that. No, we can \ndo a lot about it. We can make sure they get skills while in the \nmilitary that a civilian workforce will understand, and that those \nskills can also carry with them credentials that will enable them to \nget a quicker traction when they move into the civilian workforce.\n  It is unacceptable we are paying $800 million a year in the Federal \nbudget to pay for unemployment benefits for people who exit the \nmilitary and then can't find jobs when they do. We need steps such as \nthe CREDIT Act and others to bring down that veterans' unemployment \nrate, to enable people to get the kinds of jobs that will help them \nhave a happy and successful life postservice, and that will enable \nsociety to take advantage of the great skills and talents they have.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/15/senate-section/article/S3077-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3077-S3078]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 446--RECOGNIZING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE \n CONGRESSIONAL DECLARATION OF BOURBON WHISKEY AS A DISTINCTIVE PRODUCT \n                          OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL (for himself and Mr. Paul) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n[[Page S3078]]\n\n                              S.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Stop Subsidizing Childhood \n     Obesity Act''.\n\n     SEC. _02. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Childhood obesity has more than doubled in children and \n     tripled in adolescents in the past 30 years. Currently, more \n     than one-third of children and adolescents are overweight or \n     obese.\n       (2) A report by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation found \n     that if the population of the United States continues on its \n     current trajectory, adult obesity rates could exceed 60 \n     percent in a number of states by 2030.\n       (3) Health-related behaviors, such as eating habits and \n     physical activity patterns, develop early in life and often \n     extend into adulthood. The diets of American children and \n     adolescents depart substantially from recommended patterns \n     that put their health at risk. Overall, American children and \n     youth are not achieving basic nutritional goals. They are \n     consuming excess calories and added sugars and have higher \n     than recommended intakes of sodium, total fat, and saturated \n     fats.\n       (4) Budgets for food marketing to children have spiked into \n     the billions of dollars. According to a 2012 report from the \n     Federal Trade Commission, the total amount spent on food \n     marketing to children is about $2,000,000,000 a year.\n       (5) Companies market food to children through television, \n     radio, Internet, magazines, product placement in movies and \n     video games, schools, product packages, toys, clothing and \n     other merchandise, and almost anywhere a logo or product \n     image can be shown.\n       (6) According to a comprehensive review by the National \n     Academies' Institute of Medicine, studies demonstrate that \n     television food advertising affects children's food choices, \n     food purchase requests, diets, and health.\n       (7) A 2005 report from the Institute of Medicine confirmed \n     that ``aggressive marketing of high-calorie foods to children \n     and adolescents has been identified as one of the major \n     contributors to childhood obesity''.\n       (8) Nearly three-quarters of the foods advertised on \n     television shows intended for children are for sweets and \n     convenience or fast foods.\n       (9) A study published in the Journal of Law and Economics \n     and funded by the National Institutes of Health found that \n     the elimination of the tax deduction that allows companies to \n     deduct costs associated with advertising food of poor \n     nutritional quality to children could reduce the rates of \n     childhood obesity by 5 to 7 percent.\n\n     SEC. _03.

Keeping \n     Internet access affordable promotes consumer access to this \n     critical gateway to jobs, education, healthcare, and \n     entrepreneurial opportunities, regardless of race, income, or \n     neighborhood.\n       (4) Small business owners rely heavily on affordable \n     Internet access, providing them with access to new markets, \n     additional consumers, and an opportunity to compete in the \n     global economy.\n       (5) Economists have recognized that excessive taxation of \n     innovative communications technologies reduces economic \n     welfare more than taxes on other sectors of the economy.\n       (6) The provision of affordable access to the Internet is \n     fundamental to the American economy and access to it must be \n     protected from multiple and discriminatory taxes at the State \n     and local level.\n       (7) As a massive global network that spans political \n     boundaries, the Internet is inherently a matter of interstate \n     and foreign commerce within the jurisdiction of the United \n     States Congress under article I, section 8, clause 3 of the \n     Constitution of the United States.\n\n     SEC. _03.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) on January 1, 1998--nearly 25 years after the Employee \n     Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 was enacted and the \n     employee stock ownership plan (hereafter in this section \n     referred to as an ``ESOP'') was created--employees were first \n     permitted to be owners of subchapter S corporations pursuant \n     to the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 (Public Law \n     104-188);\n       (2) with the passage of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 \n     (Public Law 105-34), Congress designed incentives to \n     encourage businesses to become ESOP-owned S corporations;\n       (3) since that time, several thousand companies have become \n     ESOP-owned S corporations, creating an ownership interest for \n     several million Americans in companies in every State in the \n     country, in industries ranging from heavy manufacturing to \n     technology development to services;\n       (4) while estimates show that 40 percent of working \n     Americans have no formal retirement account at all, every \n     United States worker who is an employee-owner of an S \n     corporation company through an ESOP has a valuable qualified \n     retirement savings account;\n       (5) recent studies have shown that employees of ESOP-owned \n     S corporations enjoy greater job stability than employees of \n     comparable companies;\n       (6) studies also show that employee-owners of S corporation \n     ESOP companies have amassed meaningful retirement savings \n     through their S ESOP accounts that will give them the means \n     to retire with dignity;\n       (7) under the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 631 et seq.) \n     and the regulations promulgated by the Administrator of the \n     Small Business Administration, a small business concern that \n     was eligible under the Small Business Act for the numerous \n     preferences of the Act is denied treatment as a small \n     business concern after an ESOP acquires more than 49\n\n[[Page S3115]]\n\n     percent of the business, even if the number of employees, the \n     revenue of the small business concern, and the racial, \n     gender, or other criteria used under the Act to determine \n     whether the small business concern is eligible for benefits \n     under the Act remain the same, solely because of the \n     acquisition by the ESOP; and\n       (8) it is the goal of Congress to both preserve and foster \n     employee ownership of S corporations through ESOPs.\n\n     SEC. _03.

Keeping \n     Internet access affordable promotes consumer access to this \n     critical gateway to jobs, education, healthcare, and \n     entrepreneurial opportunities, regardless of race, income, or \n     neighborhood.\n       (4) Small business owners rely heavily on affordable \n     Internet access, providing them with access to new markets, \n     additional consumers, and an opportunity to compete in the \n     global economy.\n       (5) Economists have recognized that excessive taxation of \n     innovative communications technologies reduces economic \n     welfare more than taxes on other sectors of the economy.\n       (6) The provision of affordable access to the Internet is \n     fundamental to the American economy and access to it must be \n     protected from multiple and discriminatory taxes at the State \n     and local level.\n       (7) As a massive global network that spans political \n     boundaries, the Internet is inherently a matter of interstate \n     and foreign commerce within the jurisdiction of the United \n     States Congress under article I, section 8, clause 3 of the \n     Constitution of the United States.\n\n     SEC. _03.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Innovation has historically been a catalyzing force in \n     the American economy, driving the production of game-changing \n     technologies, the creation of millions of jobs and the \n     opening of countless new avenues for growth. In an \n     increasingly competitive global economy, our Nation's \n     continued leadership and prosperity will hinge on progress in \n     key innovative areas, most notably exporting, \n     entrepreneurship, research and development, and education in \n     science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), \n     including computer science.\n       (2) Technology-based startups play a critical role in \n     driving innovation. Increasing the flow of capital to these \n     firms would bridge the gap that often exists between their \n     initial startup costs and their long-term capital needs, \n     giving the firms the resources necessary to research, \n     develop, and commercialize new products.\n       (3) Simplifying, expanding, and stabilizing the tax credits \n     that businesses and institutions of higher education rely on \n     to offset the cost of research and would promote greater \n     clarity in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and deliver a \n     powerful incentive for private sector innovation.\n       (4) Increasing the emphasis on STEM education in high \n     schools and institutions of higher education would ensure \n     that more students have the skills and training to not only \n     compete for jobs in a 21st century economy, but also to \n     create the startup companies and revolutionary technologies \n     that will sustain American prosperity for centuries to come.\n       (5) The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts \n     that in the year 2020, of the 9,200,000 ``STEM'' jobs there \n     will be in the United States, half of them will be in \n     computing. With more than 150,000 job openings expected \n     annually in computing, it is one of the fastest growing \n     occupations in the United States. Increasing the teaching and \n     learning of computer science in schools would strengthen the \n     American workforce by helping our students gain the skills \n     and training necessary to fulfill new computer programming \n     jobs.\n       (6) An effective regulatory climate should protect \n     consumers and promote transparency without overburdening the \n     businesses that create jobs. Federal agencies with rulemaking \n     authority should be vigilant in assessing the impact of new \n     regulations on innovation and job creation, particularly in \n     anchor industries like manufacturing.\n       (7) The economic impact of a new product or technology is \n     often dependent on its commercial success. To ensure American \n     products can be bought and sold in markets around the world, \n     the government should identify and remove over burdensome \n     regulations that create barriers for United States exporting \n     companies.\n\n     SEC. _02.

I urge other Senators \nto show their support for the men and women who work tirelessly to \nprotect our communities.\n  This week is National Police Week, a time when thousands of law \nenforcement officers come to our Nation's Capital, and we pause to \nhonor the sacrifices of our men and women in law enforcement. On \nTuesday night the names of 286 officers killed in the line of duty were \nadded to the walls of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial, \n101 of whom were lost in 2013. The memorial now contains the names of \nover 20,000 fallen officers.\n  This resolution pays tribute to those who have fallen, recognizing \nMay 15, 2014, as ``National Peace Officers Memorial Day'' and calling \non the people of the United States to observe that day with solemnity, \nappreciation, and respect. Earlier today, Senator Grassley and I \nattended the 33rd Annual National Peace Officers' Memorial service here \non the West Front of the Capitol. The event was a somber reminder of \nthe sacrifices that law enforcement officers make every day. We have a \nresponsibility to support them in the critical work they do.\n  I also urge the Senate to come together to honor law enforcement \nofficers by supporting the passage of both S.933, the Bulletproof Vest \nPartnership Grant Program, and S. 357, the National Blue Alert Act. \nThese bills are unanimously and strongly supported by law enforcement \nand passing these bills would provide tangible, life-saving assistance \nto those who serve on the front lines, protecting our communities.\n  I thank Senators Grassley, Shaheen, Wicker, Markey, Begich, Udall of \nNew Mexico, Hagan, Coons, Durbin, Franken, Booker, Landrieu, Reed, \nBlumenthal, Schatz, Heitkamp, Feinstein, Udall of Colorado, Wicker, \nPryor, Hirono, Cardin, Cochran, Warner, Mikulski, Warren, Schumer, \nMurray, Whitehouse, Donnelly, Heinrich, and Klobuchar for their \ncosponsorship of this resolution and their support for law enforcement. \nI am very glad to see this resolution pass.\n  Mr. REID.
