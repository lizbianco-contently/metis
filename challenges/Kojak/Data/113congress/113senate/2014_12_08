Mr. President, I am very happy to be here today to talk \nabout a couple of my friends--I should say the Senate's friends. I have \nreceived a lot of gifts while I have been here. My colleagues, over the \nyears, have given me things here in the Senate, but one gift stands out \nreally strongly in my mind. On my desk, not far from here, I have this \nbig painting--it is a very famous painting from the National Portrait \nGallery of Mark Twain.\n  Mark Twain, I tell people, was born in Nevada, which is really true. \nSamuel Clemens wasn't, but Mark Twain was. Orion Clemens was chosen as \nthe Territorial Secretary of Nevada, and he told his younger brother \nSamuel: Come West and I will find you a job. Samuel had been fighting, \nwhich he didn't like, in the Civil War, so he came West to join his \nbrother. But his brother couldn't find him a job, so Samuel Clemens \nbummed around for quite a while.\n  Without belaboring the story too long, the fact is, Mark Twain \nfinally went up to Virginia City, which was booming at the time, and he \nwent to the Territorial Enterprise newspaper and got a job as a \nreporter. This was a stunningly good and important start for his first \nwriting that he had done. That is where he started his fame.\n  He would have stayed in Nevada longer, but someone challenged him to \na duel for some of the things he wrote. So being the smart man he was, \nhe didn't want to duel so he left town, went to California, where he \nwrote two best-selling books, ``The Celebrated Jumping Frog of \nCalaveras County'' and ``Roughing It,'' which was about his experience \nin bumming around Nevada until he found a job. These were best sellers. \nThese were great books.\n  The point of the story, though, is he went to Virginia City as Samuel \nClemens and took the name Mark Twain. That is where the name came from.\n  This means a lot. It is a story I tell many times to people who come \nto my office. So Carl Levin, the wonderful, kind, thoughtful man that \nhe is, said: Can I come and see you? And I said: Sure. He brought to me \nI guess it is one of the rare double signatures of Samuel Clemens. \nThere may be others, I just have never heard of one. This was done at a \nclub in Hannibal, MO. The club's name was Labinnah--Hannibal spelled \nbackwards--and Mark Twain, in 1902, because of how famous he was, \nsigned Samuel Clemens, Mark Twain, and wrote through the whole--he \ndidn't want anybody else's name there. He wanted just his. So that is \nthe gift he gave me.\n  That was so fitting. It fits my office perfectly, and it means a lot \nto me. Carl Levin brought with him this handwritten note: ``I got this \nat an auction 10 yrs. ago not knowing why. It just dawned on me! Best \non the New Year, Carl.''\n  That was so nice of him to do that, and it is so hard to explain my \nappreciation, although I am trying to do that here by outlining what a \nwonderful human being Carl Levin is. What he did for me is an example \nof who Carl Levin is and how he thinks of people. He remembered the \nstory I told him about Mark Twain, and he said, I am sure, to himself: \nI have this thing I got 10 years ago; I will give it to the Senator, my \nfriend. So he gave me that plaque just because that is who he is.\n  He has always been attentive to the interests of the people of \nMichigan and our country. He is the longest serving Senator in the \nhistory of the State of Michigan--36 years. His legislative \naccomplishments are significant. I would say they are unmatched by \nalmost anyone.\n  Carl Levin has stood his ground on controversial issues, and that is \nan understatement. He has fought to give average Americans a fair shot \nat what is going on in the world. He has always spoken with a clear \nvoice, speaking for justice, equality, and fairness.\n  (Mr. MURPHY assumed the Chair.)\n  The Presiding Officer is a lawyer, I am a lawyer, but I am not sure I \nwould be the best person, if you gave me a document, to look it over \nand make sure there was everything in that document you wanted in it, \nbut Carl Levin is the person you want. I call him my nitpicker. He is \nso good at making sure everything is right; that every i is dotted, \nevery t is crossed. Bring in Carl Levin if you have something and you \nreally need someone to look at it and think it through.\n  Carl was a prominent lawyer, as was his dad, in Michigan. His dad \nserved as a member of the Michigan Corrections Commission. After \ngraduating from high school, his father worked as an assembly line \nworker. Carl Levin also knew how to work with his hands, but he \nfollowed in his father's footsteps by being an extremely hard worker. \nHe attended college at Swarthmore and received a bachelor of arts \ndegree there. Then he attended Harvard Law School and received his \njuris doctorate from Harvard.\n  He practiced in the private sector for a while. He began his public \ncareer as the first general counsel for the Michigan Civil Rights \nCommission. He was elected in 1968 to the Detroit City Council, and he \nserved there until 1977. He was elected to the Senate in 1978. Carl has \nfunctioned in this body as a levelheaded mediator who is guided by the \nprotection of people in Michigan and our country.\n  In the past 36 years, Carl has cast over 12,000 votes. Some of those \nvotes were hard, and not always popular, but they were Carl Levin \nvotes. He did what he thought was right. When General Motors and \nChrysler, in the last few years, faced a potential collapse, he \nrecognized their bankruptcy would devastate the people of Michigan and \nhave a detrimental--effect and that is a gross understatement--on this \ncountry. He pressed the incoming Obama administration to support the \ncompanies with loans. There was a hue and cry from people who opposed \nthat, saying that is the wrong thing to do, Levin is wrong, Obama is \nwrong. But they were right. Look what it has done to energize, \nrevitalize the State of Michigan, the whole Detroit metropolitan area \nand our country, with tens of thousands of new jobs as a result of his \nadvocacy. As I said, it wasn't a popular position at the time, but Carl \nknew what was good for Michigan and good for our country and he has \nbeen vindicated a hundred times over.\n  Carl has been chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations for 10 years. During that period of time, he has done \nsome unusually important things for our country through this committee. \nCorporate money laundering--1999. He delved into that very deeply.\n  Carl Levin is not a headline hunter. Carl Levin is a substantive \nlegislator. He could have held a lot more hearings, but he held them \nabout every 6 months because he wanted his hearings to be Carl Levin \nhearings where, I repeat, every i was dotted, every t was crossed, and \nthey were very powerful hearings.\n  Gasoline price manipulation, the Enron scandal--he delved into that \nvery deeply.\n  Misconduct in the United Nations oil-for-food program, tax haven \nbanks and offshore corporate tax evasion--he has talked about that and \ntalked about that. Very notable legislation as a result of the work he \nhas done: Wall Street reform, the Consumer Protection Act, the Credit \nCard Act, the PATRIOT Act.\n  Carl Levin is a very fine legislator. He fought for Wall Street \nreform when others were afraid to do so, and he helped restore the \nbroken financial system that held powerful institutions accountable for \ntheir actions. Carl's persistence earned him a slot in Time magazine's \nlist of America's 10 best U.S. Senators. They called him the ``Bird-\nDogger.''\n  Well, that is what he is. Put him on an issue and he will come back \nwith the prey. He is very good. He never stops. He is a sharp-eyed \noverseer of U.S. defense policy. He has spent his entire career \npromoting defense policy that protects America's interests at home and \nabroad while safeguarding the men and women who serve.\n  Carl is the Chair of the Senate Defense Committee. During the \nNation's most trying of diplomatic times he has done a remarkable job \nto make sure the military is protected.\n  Even though he was Chair of this big powerful committee--the Defense \nCommittee--he felt so strongly and he foresaw what a lot of us didn't \nsee. He saw the disaster that would accompany an\n\n[[Page S6361]]\n\ninvasion of Iraq. Accordingly, he talked about how bad it would be and \nvoted against it. Carl Levin was right and a lot of us were wrong. I \nhave said before on the Senate floor, of all the votes I have cast \nduring the time I have been in government, the worst was voting for the \nIraq war. But I did. Carl Levin did not.\n\n  But for all of his accomplishments in Congress, his greatest \nachievements reside in his home. Carl and his wife of over 50 years, \nBarbara, have three beautiful daughters: Kate, Laura, and Erica. Landra \nand Barbara are good friends. They are part of a book club. They have \nhad a wonderful relationship over these many years. So as Carl retires \nfrom the Senate, I know he is going to cherish the time he is going to \nspend with his family.\n  But also Carl and I have had a long, long ongoing conversation. He \nand his brother Sander own about 100 acres. They have had it for a long \ntime. Carl Levin is not a man of wealth, but he and his brother bought \nthis 100 acres that has nothing on it but trees. He calls it his tree \nfarm. He has shown me pictures of it. I have not seen it lately, but I \nhave had for 15 or 20 years a hat he gave me--a green baseball-type \ncap--that says ``tree farm'' on it. I used to tell him I still have \nthat cap. And I still have that cap, Carl.\n  He will be missed here in Washington. He will be missed in the Senate \nby all of us. But he will be missed more by his older brother Sandy, \nwho is the ranking member on the Ways and Means Committee in the House. \nThey have served together in Congress for 32 years.\n  I have said this on the floor before, and I will say it again. I will \nremember Carl Levin for a lot of things, but when I was in the House, I \ncame over to visit with him. I was thinking about running for the \nSenate. I said: Carl, I came to the House with your brother Sandy. He \nlooked up at me and said: Sandy is not only my brother, he is my best \nfriend. That speaks well of the person who Carl Levin is.\n  It has really been a privilege and an honor to serve with Carl. I \nwill miss him so very, very much. I will miss having somebody to take \nthe difficult issues to, to get his view as to what we should do, how \nwe should handle it.\n  His voice will be missed here in the Senate. I congratulate him on \nhis incomparable career in the Senate, and I wish him the very best.\n\n\n                            Jay Rockefeller\n\n  Mr. President, it is said that you do not choose your family, and \nthat is true. We are born into our families. We have no way to \ndetermine the family we are born into. Yet as a 27-year-old Jay \nRockefeller chose to make the people of West Virginia his family. How \ndid that happen? How did Jay Rockefeller, born in New York to one of \nthe most famous American families, one of the great dynasties in the \nhistory of this country, end up in West Virginia?\n  He was an undergraduate student at Harvard. He decided he did not \nlike some of the things Harvard was doing, and so he left. He dropped \nout of school and went to Japan. He spent 3 years in Japan. He became \nan interpreter. He knows the Japanese language extremely well. He loves \nthe Japanese people. He started out at Harvard. As I indicated, after \nhis junior year, he left for Japan. He was there for 3 years. He came \nhome, returned to Harvard, and finished his degree.\n  Jay Rockefeller, as a 27-year-old, could have done anything, gone \nanyplace, gotten any education, started any business, or he could have \nsat around at a home on one of the beaches around the world and just \ndone nothing. But that is not Jay Rockefeller. He wanted to do \nsomething. He did not know what he wanted to do. This Rockefeller \nwanted to do something that was different.\n  A friend of his published here for many years a magazine called the \nWashington Monthly, a guy by the name of Pete Peters. He was a man-\nabout-town. Everybody liked him very much, but he was very close to Jay \nRockefeller. So Jay talked to him one day trying to find what he should \ndo in life. Here he was, one of the wealthiest men in America. He had a \nHarvard degree.\n  ``What should I do?''\n  Pete Peters told him: ``What you should do is go someplace and work \nwith poor people.''\n  ``Where should I go?''\n  ``Why not West Virginia?''\n  ``West Virginia?''\n  ``West Virginia.''\n  So he joined AmeriCorps. As a VISTA volunteer, he moved to the small \nmining community of Emmons, WV. That was in 1964. This man of means, \nthis man of stature, this man of notoriety went to this small little \ntown in West Virginia.\n  It was not easy for Jay Rockefeller to suddenly find himself in a \nsetting he had never imagined. In the first 6 months he was there, he \ncould hardly get anyone to talk to him. He is kind of an intimidating \nman. His name is Rockefeller. He is 6-foot-7. But eventually his \ngoodness came through. The people of Emmons, WV, started talking to \nhim, and they really liked the man. From 1964 when he moved there, he \nknew he wanted to identify with poor people, and that is what he has \ndone since 1964.\n  In 1966 he was elected to the West Virginia House of Delegates \nassembly.\n  In 1968 he was chosen to serve as the secretary of state in the State \nof West Virginia.\n  He then became the president of West Virginia Wesleyan College and \nserved there for 3 years.\n  He then was twice elected Governor of the State of West Virginia. He \nserved from 1976 to 1984.\n  Governor Rockefeller became Senator Rockefeller in 1985. From the \ntime he first stepped onto the Senate floor, he made it clear he was \nhere for one reason: to fight for the people of West Virginia. Senator \nRockefeller fought to provide his constituents with health care. He was \nan architect of CHIP, a children's health program. It is an insurance \nprogram. The Children's Health Insurance Program is one of the most \nimportant health initiatives in America's history for kids. He fought \nto protect Medicaid for half a million West Virginians but for millions \nand millions of Americans.\n  He has been a senior member of the Committee on Finance, the chairman \nof the Commerce Committee, and chairman of the Intelligence Committee. \nWhat a remarkable career he has had. He fought very hard to protect the \nAmerican people from President Bush's efforts to privatize Social \nSecurity. He has protected retirement disability benefits by doing that \nfor millions and millions of Americans.\n  His efforts to help West Virginia have not been confined to this \nbuilding. As the senior Senator from West Virginia, this big man--I \nrepeat, 6-foot-7--with a very, very long reach, has used that reach to \nbring jobs to his home State as Governor and as Senator. Because of his \nrecruiting, there are thousands and thousands of West Virginians \nemployed at the Toyota factory in Buffalo; Hino Motors in Williamstown; \nand at the Kureha plant in a town called Belle. Thousands and thousands \nof jobs. Diamond Electric, Nippon Thermostat, and NGK Spark Plugs are \nall companies Senator and Governor Rockefeller helped bring to West \nVirginia.\n  The people of West Virginia have been blessed to have Senator Jay \nRockefeller as a family member for the last 50 years. They have been \nblessed to have a person of his integrity and tenacity looking out for \nthem in the Senate.\n  My respect for Jay Rockefeller is unlimited. He has been my colleague \nfor the entire time I have been in the Congress--32 years. Now, as his \ntime in the Senate comes to an end, he will be sorely missed.\n  I am sure Jay is looking forward to spending more time with Sharon, \nthis wonderful, wonderful woman--and by the way, whose father was a \nU.S. Senator--and their children John, Valerie, Charles, and Justin, \nand their six grandchildren.\n  I so admire this good man. I congratulate him on a very distinguished \ncareer, including five terms in the U.S. Senate, two terms as Governor. \nI wish him the very best in life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/08/senate-section/article/S6361-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6361]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  Mr. REID.

He is one of \nthe senior people on that committee and certainly one of the people I \nhave enjoyed working with.

Mr. President, as the Appropriations Committees prepare to \nrelease the product of their negotiations on a spending bill this \nafternoon, I rise today to discuss the troubling development that has \nmade their work all the more challenging: President Obama's immigration \nExecutive order. By circumventing Congress, the President has dispensed \nwith the duly-enacted law of the land in a unilateral attempt to alter \nthe legal status of millions of immigrants.\n  Unfortunately, this issue of Executive overreach is not a new one. \nOver the past year, I have come to the Senate floor repeatedly to lay \nout my objections to President Obama's lawlessness--from the release of \nGuantanamo detainees to ObamaCare, from his purported recess \nappointments to Benghazi. Today I come to discuss this latest \nastonishing instance in the area of immigration.\n  Immigration is a complex and divisive issue, and Americans hold a \nwide variety of views on the matter. But one thing that should not be \ncontroversial is the President's duty to place fidelity to the \nConstitution over partisan politics.\n  The Constitution vests lawmaking authority with Congress, not the \nPresident. And the Framers specifically sought to end centuries of \nabuses by the English monarchs, who claimed the power to dispense with \nthe laws of the land, by requiring the President to take care that the \nlaws be faithfully executed. The Constitution does not suggest or \ninvite the President to enforce the law; it obligates him to do so.\n  The President and his executive branch, of course, exercise \nprosecutorial discretion--the discretion to choose not to prosecute \ncertain cases. But that power stems from considerations of fairness and \nequity in particular cases. Instead of requiring individualized \ndeterminations in specific cases, the President's latest Executive \norder claims the power to sweep up millions of people based on only a \nfew broad, widely shared criteria.\n  The President is also within his rights not to prosecute when there \nare not sufficient resources to do so, but the Obama administration has \nnever explained how the Executive order would save money. In fact, the \nadministration's own policy advisers have acknowledged that a work \npermitting program will be expensive and will take away resources from \nlaw enforcement. While no one disagrees that capturing and removing \nviolent criminals should be our highest immigration priority, President \nObama has gone much further and made current immigration law \nessentially a dead letter for millions of illegal immigrants.\n  President Obama cannot credibly claim that he is attempting to \nexecute immigration law faithfully when ICE agents were forced to \nrelease 68,000 potentially deportable aliens last year alone, when the \nadministration took disciplinary action against ICE officers for making \nlawful arrests, and when the President of the National ICE Council felt \ncompelled to testify before Congress that although ``most Americans \nassume that ICE agents and officers are empowered by the government to \nenforce the law . . . nothing could be further from the truth.''\n  Moreover, despite the administration's claim to the contrary, \nPresident Obama's action is not comparable to the Executive actions \ntaken by President Reagan or even President George H.W. Bush. Even the \nWashington Post's editorial board found that claim by the White House \nto be ``indefensible.'' Presidents Reagan and Bush simply implemented \nthe enforcement priorities established in laws that Congress actually \npassed. By contrast President Obama has sought to change the law before \nCongress has acted, so he cannot rely on Congress's authority to \nenforce the policy he prefers. Here President Obama has acted directly \nin the face of congressional opposition, and we should call his \nExecutive order what it is: an attempt to bypass the constitutionally \nordained legislative process and rewrite the law unilaterally.\n  We are all sometimes disappointed and even angry about the outcomes \nof the legislative process. I have certainly felt that way many times \nover the course of my 38 years here. But the right response is to \nredouble our efforts to get it right, not to try to subvert our \nconstitutional system.\n  The President should heed his own wisdom from as recently as last \nfall when he said that by broadening immigration enforcement carve-outs \n``then essentially I would be ignoring the law in a way that I think \nwould be very difficult to defend legally. So that is not an option. . \n. . What I've said is there is a path to get this done, and that's \nthrough Congress.''\n  Even beyond the legal and constitutional problems with the Executive \norder, the President's approach is also bad policy. His Executive order \ngreatly undercuts the chances for lasting immigration reform because it \nundermines our confidence that the President will live with any \ncompromises we agree to forge through the legislative process. The \nExecutive order is even bad for those who are currently here \nillegally--those who are supposed to benefit from it. Instead of \ntemporary half measures, they need the certainty that only legislation \ncan provide.\n  Last month, in an election in which President Obama insisted that all \nof his policies were on the ballot, the American people delivered the \nPresident a decisive rebuke. Many of us from Congress took the right \nmessage from the election--that it is time for us to come together to \nfind areas of agreement and to govern like adults.\n  Apparently President Obama missed that message. To announce this \nExecutive order after the defeat at the polls displays shocking \narrogance. Given how the White House and its allies in the media keep \nraising the specter of a shutdown or impeachment, it is clear the \nPresident is attempting to goad Congress into a fight rather than work \nwith us in the difficult job of actually legislating.\n  Unlike President Obama, I am committed to making real progress toward \nimplementing lasting immigration reform. I supported the Senate's \ncomprehensive immigration bill last year. Even though the bill was far \nfrom perfect, I voted for it because I believe in working together to \nget something done on this vitally important issue. As I have long \nargued, the way to get real immigration reform back on track is not for \nthe President to insist on his ``my way or the highway'' approach, \neither by trying to enact his preferred policy unilaterally or even for \nhim to demand an all-or-nothing comprehensive bill. Instead we should \nconsider individual immigration reform measures that can win broad \nsupport and help rebuild trust in our country. Only by doing so will we \nclear a path forward for other more far-reaching reforms.\n  Take the area of high-skilled immigration. We face a high-skilled \nworker shortage that has become a national crisis. In April for the \nsecond year in a row the Federal Government reached its current H-1B \nvisa quota for workers just 5 days after accepting applications. \nEmployers submitted 172,500 petitions for just 85,000 available visas, \nso\n\n[[Page S6363]]\n\nAmerican companies were unable to hire nearly 90,000 high-skilled \nworkers essential to help grow their domestic businesses, develop \ninnovative technologies at home rather than abroad, and compete \ninternationally. Keep in mind most of these folks we have educated in \nour colleges and universities. They could be of great help to us.\n  I have been trying to get H-1B expansion through here for a number of \nmonths. I think we will get it through honorably. In response to this \ncrisis I worked with my friends Senators Klobuchar, Rubio, and Coons to \nintroduce the bipartisan immigration innovation or the I-Squared Act. \nOur bill provides a thoughtful, lasting legislative framework that \nwould increase the number of H-1B visas, based on annual market demand, \nto attract the highly skilled workers and innovators our economy so \ndesperately needs.\n  Unilateralism is not the way forward on immigration. If the President \nis serious about enacting meaningful immigration reform, he can choose \nto take the first essential step. Even in the current partisan climate \nthere is a widespread consensus and real opportunity for bipartisan, \nbicameral reform for our outdated visa system for economically \nessential high-skilled immigrants.\n  The concrete legislative victory where there is already considerable \nconsensus would help build trust and good will among those who disagree \nsharply over other areas of immigration policy and would mark a \ncritical first step along the path to broader reform.\n  For the life of me I cannot understand why the President doesn't \naccept this hand we are extending to him, knowing that we educate these \npeople, get them their college degrees, their master's degrees, their \ndoctoral degrees, their Ph.D.s, and then we push them out of the \ncountry when they want to stay and help us in the continually evolving \nand impressive high-tech world. It is mind-boggling to me that we do \nthis.\n  Canada even advertises in California and in the States south of the \nCanadian border: Come to Canada. You are welcome here. I commend Canada \nfor having the brains and guts and ability and the political instincts \nto attract these very highly educated--educated in the United States--\npeople, to help them in their high-tech world, in their engineering \nworld, in their mathematical world, in their science world. Of course \nwe can name a whole host of other areas where they are now helping \nCanadians when they were educated here, wanted to stay here, wanted to \nbe part of America, and we could not provide a means whereby these \npeople could help us and at the same time an intelligent means that \npeople in our society could accept.\n  That is the not the only action we could take. Naturally we should \nwork together as Democrats and Republicans to do real immigration \nreform. We have 11 million or more people here who aren't going to go \nback to their countries. Many of them have never been in their \ncountries, such as the children who were born here and young children \nwho were brought here and never knew anything about their parents' \nformer country. We have to solve these problems, and we don't do it by \nunilateral actions by a President who basically doesn't seem to give a \ndarn, except for his own unilateral approach to things. That is not \nwhat the Presidency should be.\n  There are three branches of government. They are coequal. The \nPresident should enforce laws that are enacted only by Congress. The \nSupreme Court should interpret laws that are enacted by Congress if \nthere are reasons for doing so. In this case we have a President who \nbasically is ignoring the law, just acting on his own, as though \nCongress doesn't mean a thing, even though it means everything in these \nareas.\n  I counsel the President to change these ways and work with us. I \nthink there will be more people willing to work with him should he do \nso, and we can solve these problems--we can solve them--not in some \nstupid, unilateral way that is going to create more problems than it \nsolves but in a way the American people will accept.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN.

Mr. President, in the waning days of the 113th Congress \nit is a bittersweet moment as many of us are saying goodbye--although \nnot on a permanent basis but at least in terms of our official \nrelationships working together as Senators--to so many of our good \nfriends and valued colleagues. Every other December we find ourselves \nbidding farewell to some of the most admired and respected Members of \nthis Chamber. Today I want to say a few words about three of these \nesteemed Members, starting with my good friend, the senior Senator from \nGeorgia.\n\n\n                            Saxby Chambliss\n\n  Saxby Chambliss and I arrived in the Senate at the same time \nfollowing the 2002 elections. At the time, the war on terrorism, as we \nall know, was barely a year old, and it was by far and away the biggest \nissue on the minds of Americans across the country and in the Halls of \nCongress. Senator Saxby Chambliss immediately established himself as \none of the Senate's most important leaders on national security issues, \nwhich came as no surprise to anyone who watched his career in the House \nof Representatives. Indeed, in his capacity as chairman of the House \nIntelligence Subcommittee on Terrorism and Homeland Security, he \noversaw the first official investigation of the 9/11 attacks. It is \nhard to believe it has now been more than 13 years since that fateful \nday, but Senator Chambliss has never lost sight of the continuing \nthreat posed by radical Islamic terrorists and he has never stopped \nworking to uphold bipartisan support for strong national security \npolicies. He has been a consistent leader on important pieces of \nlegislation such as the PATRIOT Act and on the detention facilities at \nGuantanamo Bay. He has also been a leader on the Armed Services \nCommittee on the annual Defense authorization bill which we will be \ntaking up later this week and on controversial but important topics \nsuch as the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Most recently on the \ncampaign to destroy the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, Senator \nChambliss again has been one of the leading voices helping us find our \nway to the right strategy and the right policy. In short, name any \nhigh-profile national security issue and there is a good chance Saxby \nChambliss has been driving the debate and working to move the United \nStates in the right direction. I know he is also especially proud of \nhis efforts to improve current retirement policies for members of the \nNational Guard and military Reserves.\n  Senator Saxby Chambliss comes from a State where agriculture is the \nsingle largest industry and he spent 6 years as chairman or ranking \nmember of the Senate agriculture committee. He was one of the first \nMembers of our class in 2002 to serve as a chairman of any standing \ncommittee, something we were all a little bit envious of, early on in \nhis first term of office. But he has worked on several tough farm bills \nduring the time he has been in Congress and he has been our go-to \nMember on all related issues.\n  In fact, Senator Chambliss understands these issues almost better \nthan anyone on both sides of the aisle, which is another way of saying \nhe understands the challenges facing American farmers better than \nalmost anyone here. That understanding allowed him to play a key role \nin reforming Federal crop insurance.\n  Folks down in Georgia have been justly appreciative of Senator \nChambliss's work on agriculture policy, and they also appreciate his \nefforts to accelerate the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project through a \nFederal-State partnership, which was officially signed back in October. \nIt is an impressive list of accomplishments, and I know I speak for all \nof our Members on both sides of the aisle and staffers alike, when I \nsay that Saxby Chambliss will be missed as much for his warmth and \nfriendship as for his policy work.\n\n[[Page S6364]]\n\n  As a diehard Atlanta Braves and Georgia Bulldogs fan, he is equally \nat ease discussing baseball, football, quail hunting or national \nsecurity. He is unfailingly kind, thoughtful, and considerate to \neveryone with whom he works in this Chamber--whether Senator, staffer \nor casual visitor.\n  Saxby is now preparing for his life's next great chapter, which he \nwill spend with his wife Julianne, to whom he has been married for \nnearly half a century, their two children, and six grandchildren, which \nI know bring them a lot of joy.\n  I wish my good friend all the best in his retirement, and I wish the \nentire Chambliss family a never-ending supply of health and happiness.\n\n\n                              MIKE JOHANNS\n\n  Next, I would like to turn to my colleague from Nebraska, the senior \nSenator Mike Johanns. Even if Mike Johanns had never been a Senator, he \nwould have compiled an extraordinary career of public service. It \nstarted with a stint on the Lancaster County Board of Commissioners and \ncontinued with 2 years on the Lincoln City Council, followed by 8 years \nas mayor of Lincoln, NE.\n  In 1999 Mike left the mayor's office and moved over to the Nebraska \nState Capitol, where he served for 6 years as Governor. He said one of \nhis proudest gubernatorial accomplishments was enacting a mental health \nreform law that helped improve the lives of some of Nebraska's neediest \nand most vulnerable residents. That to me tells a lot about his \ncharacter and sense of compassion.\n  Born and raised as a farm boy, Mike was named America's 28th \nSecretary of Agriculture in 2005. Over the next 3 years, he held more \nthan 50 separate forums on the farm bill--more than 50. Not \nsurprisingly, he continued to work on agriculture-related issues when \nhe joined the Senate. Indeed, he has been a true leader, fighting \npassionately to defend the rights and livelihood of farmers and \nranchers everywhere--especially in Nebraska.\n  These are issues that are vitally important to millions and millions \nof Americans, including Mike's constituents, but they are not the kind \nof issues that help land you prime time appearances on cable news. \nLuckily for us, Mike doesn't care about media attention, but what he \ndoes care about is doing the right thing for his State and for our \ncountry.\n  He understands something that many of us too quickly forget--that \ntaxes and regulations should be forced to pass a simple cost-benefit \ntest. That is why Mike worked so hard to block the national energy tax \nknown as cap and trade, and that is why he has consistently demanded \nthat the Environmental Protection Agency and other Federal agencies \ndemonstrate how their proposed rules would affect American jobs and \nAmerican workers.\n  It is also why he has so aggressively pushed to abolish the IRS 1099 \nreporting requirement in ObamaCare, which would have placed a costly \nnew burden on America's small-business owners and indirectly on the \njobs that they create. Mike did more than anyone else to help highlight \nthe problems with this requirement and to demand its repeal. Thanks in \nlarge part to his efforts, 81 Members of this Chamber voted to abolish \nit back in 2011.\n  There is an old cliche in politics that there are two types of \npoliticians--the show horses and workhorses. Mike has never sought the \nlimelight, and has certainly done more than his fair share of the work. \nBut he has done so in a very quiet and thoughtful manner. He is someone \nwho has kept a low profile while working behind the scenes, building \nbipartisan consensus and being infallibly polite and gentlemanly in the \nprocess.\n  He is the type of Senator who is universally admired and respected by \nall of our colleagues. His accomplishments here in the Senate--I have \njust mentioned a few--have been manifold. Yet I am quite certain his \nproudest accomplishments are his family--his wife Stephanie, their two \nchildren, and five grandchildren. They have been generous enough to \nshare Mike with us for the past 6 years, and now it is time for Mike to \nbe with the people he cares about the most. We will miss him a whole \nlot, but he is moving on to perhaps the most rewarding chapter of his \nlife.\n  Mike, thanks for all you have done. Thanks for your service, your \nguidance, and most of all for your friendship.\n\n\n                               TOM COBURN\n\n  I will close my remarks today on our retiring colleagues by paying \ntribute to Dr. Tom Coburn. He is someone we have all come to know and \nadmire over 20 years as a relentless fighter for limited government and \nconservative values here in the Congress.\n  Tom can be a very charming guy, but I know he can also be a pain in \nour side when he is determined to make sure he gets a chance to get a \nvote on an important matter here in the Senate. I think he is \ncomfortable in both of those roles. In fact, I know he is.\n  Tom Coburn is a man of strong principle, a man of great integrity, \nand, perhaps just as importantly, a man of remarkable humility. Our \ncountry has benefited greatly from the wisdom and leadership Tom has \nprovided during his service in Congress--first in the House and then in \nthe Senate. I have been in the Senate now for a little more than a \ndecade, and during that time our colleague from Oklahoma has done more \nthan anyone else in this Chamber to eliminate wasteful spending, expose \nfraud and abuse in the Federal budget, and get our entitlement programs \non a sustainable path. Tom would be the first one to say that job has \njust begun, but he has certainly given it everything he has.\n  He has educated our Nation on the fiscal threat we live under and \nwhat it means for our children and grandchildren, and he has worked \ntirelessly to correct it.\n  He has done a remarkable job as the ranking member of the Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee, as well as his service on \nthe intelligence and banking committees.\n  Furthermore, Tom has been an unyielding force for protecting liberty \nand improving access to affordable health care by proposing positive \npatient-oriented alternatives, and for these reasons and many more I am \ngrateful for his service.\n  But perhaps the thing he does not want to be remembered for--but that \nhas made such a profound impression on many of us--is his courage and \nability to deal with the fact that he is a three-time cancer survivor. \nEven last week, I know he was receiving treatment for this most recent \nflare up, but he will be back here today. He will be doing what he does \nbest, and that is fighting for his principles and perhaps causing more \nthan a little bit of turbulence in the process in this otherwise stayed \nChamber.\n  I know I speak for this entire Chamber when I say it is an honor to \nserve with a man such as Tom Coburn. I know this to be true because Tom \nis well respected on both sides of the aisle.\n  In fact, when Time magazine named Tom one of the 100 most influential \npeople in the world in 2013, a friend of Tom's and former Democratic \nSenator wrote:\n\n       The people of Oklahoma are lucky to have someone like Tom \n     representing them in Washington--someone who speaks his mind, \n     sticks to his principles, and is committed to the people he \n     was elected to serve.\n\n  The friend I am referring to who made those remarks is none other \nthan our President, Barack Obama, when he served with Tom in the \nSenate. When the President said that, he found out that Tom received a \nnumber of angry letters from constituents that said he and President \nObama looked a little too chummy together, to which Tom replied--and \nthis is classic Tom Coburn: ``What better way to influence someone than \nto love them.''\n  This serves as a testament to his character. You see, Tom has an \nextraordinary ability not just to win the respect of those who agree \nwith him but the admiration and respect of those who disagree with him \nas well. That is a rare thing in politics and especially in today's \nsociety.\n  Nevertheless, Tom has spent his career promoting what is good for the \ncountry while never wavering from his personal conversations. Along the \nway he has racked up a lengthy list of accomplishments that protect \ntaxpayers and increase transparency in government.\n  Tom's resume proves he has been a leader not only in Congress but \nin every aspect of his life. For example, I think many of our \ncolleagues don't realize he had a distinguished career in\n\n[[Page S6365]]\n\nbusiness and medicine before he got here. Tom served as president of \nthe school of business student council while getting his accounting \ndegree at Oklahoma State University. Later he went back to law school--\nexcuse me, that was a Freudian slip he wouldn't be happy with. Later he \nwent back to medical school, where he trained to become a physician and \nserved as president of his class at the University of Oklahoma medical \nschool.\n  Tom has a lot to be proud of about his service in the House and in \nthe Senate. But, again, like all of us, he is most proud of his family. \nHe has been married to the former Miss Oklahoma for nearly 50 years, \nand he and Carolyn have three daughters and seven grandchildren. \nMeanwhile, in his career as a physician, he has delivered more than \n4,000 babies, which perhaps explains the vote totals in some of his \nelections, because I am sure many of them have grown up to vote for \nhim.\n  The things that I mentioned are only a few of Tom Coburn's long list \nof notable achievements. Knowing Tom and his work ethic, I have no \ndoubt he will be giving 110 percent right up until the last minute he \nserves in the 113th Congress on January 3, 2015.\n  I wish Tom and his family the very best as they enter the next season \nof life.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/08/senate-section/article/S6365-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6365]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTES TO DEPARTING SENATORS\n\n\n                               Mark Pryor\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, in just a few moments one of my best \nfriends in the Senate is going to give his farewell address. Senator \nMark Pryor of Arkansas, a former State legislator, former attorney \ngeneral, and two-term Senator, was caught in this tidal wave in the \nlast election that caused those of us in the Democratic Party in the \nformer old Confederacy, now known as the South--and of course parts of \nthe South these days don't look anything like the old Confederacy. As a \nmatter of fact, my State of Florida is a good example. It is a \ncompendium of people from all over the United States because folks from \nall over the country have moved to Florida, and thus it is a microcosm \nof the country.\n  Arkansas is a State where the Pryor family has served with great \ndistinction and enormous public service for decades. Although it \ntemporarily comes to an end with Senator Pryor leaving the Congress in \nJanuary, that is not the end of his public service. His mom and dad \nserved so ably for years and years in the Governor's mansion, as well \nas the Senate, serving the people of this country and Arkansas. Mark \nand his family served our country so ably over the years and that \npublic service will continue.\n\n\n                            Jay Rockefeller\n\n  I reflect back just a few days ago when Senator Rockefeller gave his \nfarewell speech. He is another extraordinary public servant who has \ndemonstrated selfless public service. He is a Senator who, because of \nhis family heritage, could have done anything he wanted, but he chose--\nafter a life of privilege, growing up as a young man, and after having \nspent time abroad--to go to one of the poorest States in the Union. He \nfirst was a volunteer to the poor and later developed a distinguished \nrecord of public service that included secretary of state, Governor, \nand now a five-term Senator. I will speak later about other colleagues \nwho are leaving.\n  These are just two examples. Senator Rockefeller and my seatmate \nSenator Pryor are extraordinary public servants who when you talked to \nthem and when you looked in their eyes, if they gave you their word, \nthat was it. You didn't have to worry about it.\n  Some say it is a throwback to the old days. The old days is a \nthrowback that we ought to go to, when if a Senator gave you his or her \nword, that was it, when there was civility among Senators, when there \nwas not an avalanche of outside money that came in to try to define you \nwith statements that were not true.\n  We see what has happened to our politics in America today with \nexceptional millions of dollars coming into a State, buying up \ntelevision, to create a statement in 27 seconds often that is not true \nand that fact checkers say is not true, factcheck.org and Politifact.\n  Yet when we talk to the TV stations and the broadcast stations and \nshow them the fact checkers, they will still run the TV ads. But rather \nthan talk about the mistakes that were made with the Citizens United \nSupreme Court case and missing by one vote in this Chamber several \nyears ago--we had 59 votes and we needed 60 to cut off debate so we \ncould get to the DISCLOSE Act, a DISCLOSE Act that did not counter the \nSupreme Court decision, it just said if you are going to spend all this \nmoney, you are going to have to say who it is that is doing the \ncontribution.\n\n  Of course, if we had been able to pass that, then all of this money \nwould not be flowing because it is hiding behind this masquerade of the \nCommittee for Good Government or the ABC committee for whatever. So \nthey masquerade behind that veil to spend all of that money in order--\nfor their ultimate purposes.\n  It caught a number of our people. Just look at what happened in the \nrunoff election this last Saturday. Look at the imbalance of the \nspending on TV that occurred since the general election and the runoff \nin the State of Louisiana.\n  I will speak about Senator Landrieu, Senator Udall, Senator Begich, \nand Senator Kay Hagan later.\n  I wanted particularly to talk about Senator Rockefeller, our chairman \nof the commerce committee, and Senator Pryor, one of the finest public \nservants I have ever had a chance to serve with.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/08/senate-section/article/S6365-2", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6365-S6366]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ``ORION'' SPACECRAFT\n\n  Mr. NELSON. I want to speak about a very uplifting topic in more ways \nthan one. Friday morning I was at the Cape. We call it the Cape. It is \ntechnically known as the Kennedy Space Center. America is going to \nMars. The first test flight, the spacecraft Orion, put upon another \nrocket--in this case, a heavy-lift rocket called the Delta IV--twice \norbited around the Earth. On that second orbit it was boosted up way \nbeyond low-Earth orbit to 3,600 miles, and then with a ballistic \nreentry simulating 80 percent of the forces, the stresses on the \nspacecraft, the Gs, as well as the heat shield heating up to 4,000 \ndegrees Fahrenheit in a spacecraft totally instrumented to check out \nthe integrity of the spacecraft and the effectiveness of the heat \nshield as part of it--an ablative heat shield that burns off upon \nreentry--and it was a fantastic success.\n  I talked about this last week ahead of time just to give folks an \nidea of how large this is. The Apollo spacecraft was 12 feet in \ndiameter. It looked like a similar kind of shape, a capsule. That was \nover four decades ago, 12 feet. Orion is 16\\1/2\\ feet and totally new \ntechnology, a new heat shield and up-to-date instrumentation that will \ncarry four astronauts on our goal of our journey to the planet Mars in \nthe decade of the 2030s.\n  This is what I wanted to share. Friday night after the launch with \nthe extensive coverage that the news media gave, I was at a totally \nunrelated charity event for a children's hospital. I had people coming \nup to me and saying we didn't know that we had a space program. It is \nsimply because they associated the shutdown of the space shuttle with \nthe last flight of 135 flights--they associated that with the shutdown \nof the space program in the last flight of 2011 of the space shuttle.\n  They now see what has been happening behind the scenes all along, \nwhere indeed we are in a dual track in America's manned space program, \nthe one track going to Mars way beyond low-Earth orbit where we have \nbeen for the last 40-some years. This is a low earth orbit that \nservices the International Space Station where 6 humans are right now, \nabout 250 miles above the Earth doing research in the program of going \nout and exploring the heavens. The second track of the dual track is, \nin fact, building American rockets, which is being done in a \ncommercially viable way to go to and from\n\n[[Page S6366]]\n\nthe space station as they are right now with cargo, but making those \nspacecraft safe with the escape systems for humans. That is the dual \ntrack. Therefore, as a result, we end up with NASA exploring the \nheavens again. We are back in the human space business.\n\n  The great Senator from the State of Arkansas is here. He does not \nknow I have just spoken about him. It is going to be my privilege to \nlisten to his remarks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/08/senate-section/article/S6366-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6366-S6369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FAREWELL TO THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I have to begin today by saying one thing, \nthat is, to God be the glory. I will finish with that too. But first \nlet me say a few words.\n  Since election night I have had many Arkansans come up to me and \nthank me for my service. I appreciate that. But I need to thank them \nfor allowing me to do this for the last 12 years. It sounds like a \ncliche, but it is not. Serving in the Senate has been the greatest \nhonor of my life. It truly has been. I have loved it. I have always \ndone it with a cheerful heart. When I go back to my beloved Arkansas, I \nhave to thank the people of Arkansas for allowing me to work for you. \nBut I must confess I will miss waking up every morning and thinking, \nhow can I make a difference for Arkansas and for America today? Those \nyears were momentous in so many ways, for our country and for our \nworld. I had a front-row seat to making history, and I hope I made a \nlittle bit of it myself.\n  On a personal level, those years were filled with family and friends, \na remarkable staff, my Senate colleagues, and a whole series of rich, \nonce-in-a-lifetime experiences.\n  The Lord has given me two wonderful children who are now in college. \nI know many of you all saw them for the first time when they were in \nelementary school. I am very proud, and their mother is very proud, of \nAdams and Porter Pryor. I am very excited about their future.\n  God has also brought an old sweetheart back into my life, Joi. She \nand I attended the sixth and seventh grades together. So when I say God \nhas brought joy in my life, I mean it, literally.\n  Many of you know my parents. Of course, I would be nothing without \nthem. Dave and Barbara Pryor have touched so many lives. They continue \nto do so.\n  For the last 8 years, I have lived with my brother David and Judith \nand Hampton Pryor in Washington, when I am here in Washington. I will \nalways be grateful for their love and hospitality.\n  Scott and Diane and Devin Pryor in New York have been a great \ninspiration to me as well.\n  My staff is simply awesome. I love them all and they are all part of \nmy family too. There are too many to mention, but words such as talent, \ncommitment, public service, effectiveness, all come to mind whenever \ntheir names come up. I have said this many times about my staff, and \nthey keep telling me not to say it, but I am going to say it one last \ntime: They do 99 percent of the work and I get 99 percent of the \ncredit. So I want to acknowledge them for a job well done. They should \nall hold their heads high for the difference they have made. I ask \nunanimous consent that a list of their names be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Lisa Ackerman, Adrianna Alley, Ronnie Anderson, Suzanne \n     Bartolomei, Tim Bass, Frank Bateman, Jason Bockenstedt, \n     Patrice Bolling, Cathy Bozynski, Zac Bradley, Becca Bradley, \n     Ruth Bradley, Rachel Brown, Sonya Bryant, LaRonda Bryles, \n     Tamara Buchholz, Britton Burnett, Margery Buzbee, Macio \n     Cameron, Lauren Carter, Rachel Colson, Kim Cooper, Paul Cox, \n     Laura Culver, Emily Culver, Olivia Dedner, Shiloh Dillon, \n     Martine Downs, Wes Duncan, Michael Fangue, William Feland, \n     Greg Feldman, Jeff Fitch, Sherry Flippo, Bradford Foley, \n     Derrick Freeman, Conor Frickel, Bess Ginty, Terri Glaze, \n     Andrew Grobmyer.\n       Russell Hall, Beth Hallmark, Julie Hamilton, Megan \n     Hargraves, Ruth Hargraves, Jacob Hargraves, Justin Harper, \n     Ehren Hartz, Tonya Hass, Mary Grace Hathaway, Whitney Haynes, \n     Brigit Helgen, Larry Henderson, Lauren Henry-Cowles, Hannah \n     Herdlinger, Carrie Hern, Tate Heuer, Gene Higginbotham, \n     Brandon Hirsch, Emily Hoard, Sarah Holland, Greg Holyfield, \n     Vincent Insalaco, Susie James, Mark Johnston, Louis Keller, \n     Hank Kilgore, Caroline Kobek Pezzarossi, Shannon Lane, \n     Stephen Lehrman, Autumn Lewis, Sam Losow, Shannon Lovejoy, \n     Stan Luker, Scott Macconomy, Amanda Manatt-Story, Elizabeth \n     Manney, Randy Massanelli, Eric May, Madra McAdoo, Nathan \n     McCarroll, Lauren McClain.\n       Marietta McClure, Audrey McFarland, Valerie McNeese, Rodell \n     Mollineau, Melissa Moody, Reed Moody, Brook Mumford, Callie \n     Neel, Eric Nelson, Wayne Palmer, Allison Pearson, Mia \n     Petrini, Brad Phelan, Jim Pitcock, Marisa Pryor, Walter \n     Pryor, Hayne Rainey, Candace Randle, Kris Raper, Robbie Reed, \n     Mary Renick, Erin Ridgeway, Jenny Robertson, Kirk Robertson, \n     Bob Russell, Paul Sanders, Amy Schlesing, Kymara Seals, \n     Kristin Sharp, Ashley Shelton, Ashely Simmons, Jason Smedley, \n     Haley Smoot, Kate Melcher, Lucy Speed, Brandon Spicher, \n     Jeffrey Stein, Arthur Stokenbury, Michelle Strikowsky, Kelvin \n     Stroud, Kelsey Stroud, Richard Swan, Frances Tate, Michael \n     Teague, Jennifer Thompson, Courtney Van Buren, Joan Vehik, \n     Crystal Waitekus, Brad Watt, David West, Preston Weyland, \n     Libby Whitbeck, Deke Whitbeck, Marco White, Amanda White, \n     Quinten Whiteside, Elizabeth Wilson, Andy York, Mary Claire \n     York, Julie Zelnick.\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. My colleagues. What can I say about my colleagues that has \nnot been said before? Or maybe I could say, what can I say about my \ncolleagues that they have not said about themselves before?\n  You know, politics is about people; not just the people out there, \nbut the people in here, the people the people elect. I have served with \nsome greats and some giants. Robert C. Byrd, Ted Kennedy, Daniel \nInouye, Ted Stevens are at the top of the list. But the truth is that \nevery single Senator I have served with is a giant.\n  I have served with about 175 other Senators, so there are too many to \nsingle out. But I have made lifelong friendships here. We have done a \nlot of good things together. This is what I will remember: all the \npersonalities, all the times when we came together to do the right \nthing, and all the successes we had together.\n  While in the Senate, I had more than 70 initiatives signed into law. \nAlmost all of those have been bipartisan. I ask unanimous consent to \nhave that list printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Highlights of Senate Accomplishments\n\n       Opened a New Opportunity for the Forestry Industry.

I do not do very many press conferences, as you all know, \nand I have always been first in line to work with any and all of my \ncolleagues to try to get things done. The Senate is a special place. On \na personal level, we talk about the Senate family. It is a family. When \npeople mention the Senate to me, I think of other Senators, of course, \nand I think of legislation, but usually the first thing that comes to \nmind is the people who work here: the Parliamentarians, the clerks, the \ndoormen, the Capitol Police. I am appreciative of the other Senators' \nstaffs and the committee staffs, and even to my House colleagues--most \nof them, anyway. No, even to my House colleagues.\n  But I have always been mindful of the people who really make this \nplace run: the janitorial staff, the folks in the restaurants, the \nmaintenance guys, the painters, the carpenters, the tech people. The \nlist goes on and on. All of them contribute to make the Senate what it \nis. We work here together. We go through life and budget cuts and \nchanging political winds together. There is a bond we all feel because \nwe all have been in the Senate together.\n  Please give me just a few moments of your time to make this next \npoint. As great an institution as the Senate is, the Senate is broken. \nThe American people know it. In fact, this is an area where the \nAmerican people are way ahead of Washington. The people around our \nNation look at Washington and they shake their heads. We sometimes \ncannot see the forest for the trees because we get bogged down in \npersonalities or perceived wrongs or whatever the case may be.\n  This is not a Barack Obama problem, this is not a George Bush \nproblem. In fact, all recent Presidents have gone through periods of \ndeep unpopularity. This is an ``all of us'' problem. The political \nenvironment today grinds the trust and confidence out of our system. \nLet me tell you, that is not good for anybody.\n  The Republicans have a great opportunity in 2015 and 2016. They \nconvinced the voters they are the party that can govern. Now it is time \nfor them to turn off the rhetoric and turn on the governing. In the \nSenate, if the new Republican majority will run the Senate the way they \nhave said it should be run, then this is a very good start. If we can \nreplay the tape over the last 2 years, we will hear Republican Senators \ntime and again clamor for an open amendment process and for regular \norder. They were caustic when the Democratic majority changed the \nrules--a change, by the way which I did not support. So let's change \nthe rules back to what they were. Let's govern the way we know we ought \nto.\n  Democrats--this is an important message--Democrats should help the \nRepublicans govern. The rules are not the problem around here. We are \nthe problem, all 100 of us. Hyperpartisanship has gotten the best of \nus. When things get too partisan, good judgment and common sense go out \nthe window. The biggest and most serious problem facing our Nation \ntoday is the dysfunction in our political system within Washington. \nAmerica has incredible potential, but we cannot reach it unless \nWashington starts to work again for all of us. If we are to continue to \nbe the greatest Nation on Earth, we must work together. That is, after \nall, the American way. That is our history. This country was created, \nthis country was forged. The great melting pot is just that, a melting \npot. E pluribus unum actually means something: Out of many, one. We \nhave many differing viewpoints, many philosophies, many backgrounds, \nmany priorities. So we have the pluribus part down pat. That is not the \nproblem. No, the challenge comes with the unum.\n  From my perspective, I see the ultimate question as a question of \nloyalty. Who are we loyal to? I just mentioned that we have many \ndifferent viewpoints, philosophies, and agendas. But if we have \ndifferent loyalties, then we are a divided nation. That will only lead \nto bad things. When each of us takes our oath of office, we swear \nallegiance to the Constitution, not a party, nor a President, nor an \ninterest group. We do not swear allegiance to those who pay for our \ncampaigns or to a certain agenda. We need to hash out our differences \nin the Senate in committee and on the floor, then hash them out with \nthe House, but at the end of the day, produce legislation. That is the \nessence of the legislative branch. We also must exert our authority as \narticle I, the first branch of government.\n  We have checks and balances. We cannot provide the check or the \nbalance if we are not functioning. Making this place function is part \nof our oath of office. One thing we should all remember: The Senate is \nbigger than we are. We do not have to look farther than our own desks \nto see that. Look inside your desk and you see the names written in the \ndrawer. In my desk I see Senator Gronna, elected in 1911 from North \nDakota. Names such as Everett Dirksen and George Mitchell, David Pryor, \nJoe Lieberman and Carl Levin--these men molded history. These are \nSenators who shaped world events. These Senators were good stewards of \nwhat our Founding Fathers created for us. We should be too, each and \nevery one of us.\n\n  The Father of our Country had a lot to say about partisanship. In his \nFarewell Address, he warns us of the ``continual mischiefs'' and ``ill-\nfounded jealousies'' caused by parties. We should take heed. It is the \ngreatest mistake of our time to allow these prophesied mischiefs and \njealousies to divide us and damage the American political character.\n  Abraham Lincoln once famously said, ``A house divided against itself \ncannot stand.'' That is so true. His voice is echoing down through the \nhalls of history to us. If we are divided, we cannot stand. We will not \nstand a chance in the future. Let Lincoln's words be a clarion call to \nall Members of Congress. That includes all Senators.\n  Look at what is happening to us. The Congress is getting more liberal \nand more conservative. Look at the wild swings in regulations that have \noccurred from President Clinton to President Bush to President Obama. \nNo wonder we are seeing a sluggish economic recovery.\n  Washington is creating uncertainty and instability. The private \nsector cannot make investments or take risks with confidence. It should \nbe the opposite. The Federal Government should be fostering economic \ngrowth. This country needs Washington to function. That starts in this \nChamber.\n  One thing I like to say in meetings is this: ``Don't just bring me \nthe problem, bring me the solution.'' So I have identified a big \nproblem here this afternoon. It is fair for you to ask about the \nsolution. Regardless of your political philosophy, bipartisanship is \nthe answer. Let's take off the red jersey and take off the blue jersey \nand let us all put on the red, white, and blue jersey. Our Nation's \nchallenges, large and small, require us to get on the same team; that \nis team USA.\n  Remember, I mentioned Abraham Lincoln saying that, ``A house divided \nagainst itself cannot stand.'' Well, he was actually quoting an \nitinerant Jewish rabbi who said that about 2,000 years ago. Jesus was \nright then and He is right now. A house divided against itself cannot \nstand. Good government is good politics. Although there are short-term \ngains to be had by political division, the long-term consequences are \nbad for the country. It is time for the giants of the Senate to emerge. \nJesus has offered us some advice. Probably the best practical advice of \nwisdom He left us here in the Congress is called the Golden Rule: Do \nunto others as you would have them do unto you. If we applied that \naround here, about\n\n[[Page S6369]]\n\nthree-quarters of our problems would vanish. Poof.\n\n  Is that impossible? Not at all. Most of us claim to have a Judeo-\nChristian faith, so why not apply what we know to be true? The first \nstep in this process is another one of Jesus's admonitions--forgive one \nanother.\n  I know each Senator, from time to time, feels betrayed, let down, \nslighted, or somehow wronged. We need to forgive one another and let \nthe healing begin.\n  I am not trying to combine religion and politics, but I think most \neveryone in the world agrees that Jesus is one of the greatest moral \nteachers of all time. He has a lot to say about how we should treat one \nanother.\n  There are and there will be 100 Senators. Healing the Senate and \ngetting it to function as it did for two centuries is up to each \nindividual Senator. That means doing the right thing but also \npersuading others to do the right thing. It is not about us, it is \nabout our country, our children, and our grandchildren. It is about \nbeing good stewards.\n  In closing, let me say I loved my time with you. I will always \nremember you with fondness and I will always be cheering for you. I \nexpect great things from you because I know you are capable of doing \ngreat things. God bless the Senate and the work we do, and God bless \nthe United States of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  Mr. NELSON.

Mr. President, I rise to give a tribute to Senator \nPryor, whose remarks we have just heard.\n  Through nearly a quarter of a century of dedicated public service, \nSenator Mark Pryor has established a strong reputation as the voice of \nreason.\n  From an Arkansas legislator and attorney general to a U.S. Senator, \nSenator Pryor has always put the people first. To me, he has been an \nadmired colleague, a great collaborator, and a treasured friend. \nWorking with Senator Pryor during his service in the Senate, I know \nthat he acquired his voice of reason the old-fashioned way: He is such \na good listener.\n  All of us are pretty good talkers, or we wouldn't be here, but \nSenator Pryor has the distinction of being a good listener. Whether \ndebating colleagues on the Senate floor or interacting with his guests \non his Pryor-Side Chats back home, he has consistently demonstrated \nthat he is one of those special individuals who can disagree without \never being disagreeable. He always sticks to his principles, yet he \nrespects the principles of those with whom he disagrees. He is well \ninformed but always open to new information.\n  It has been a particular pleasure to work with Senator Pryor on the \nhomeland security committee for many years and on the Committee on \nAppropriations. His work ethic, his attention to detail, his \nwillingness, once again, to listen to alternative views have been great \nassets in addressing the challenges we face in our country.\n  He has been a diligent fiscal watchdog for the Nation's taxpayers. To \nme, Senator Pryor's approach to public service is best defined by the \ncrucial role he played in ending the government shutdown in the fall of \n2013 and as a member of the Gang of 14 in 2005. In each case he worked \nclosely with me and with other Members to end a crisis and to achieve a \nresponsible, commonsense solution. In each case he listened and he led.\n  As a charter member of our Common Sense Coalition last year, Senator \nPryor stepped forward to restore both government operations and help to \nrestore some modicum of citizen confidence in our Senate, in our \ngovernment.\n  These certainly were not the only times that Senator Pryor's \nbipartisan approach and concern for the well-being of Americans had \nbeen evident. In 2007, after a large number of recalls following \ninjuries and deaths that caused parents throughout America to be \nconcerned about the safety of their children's toys--especially those \nmanufactured overseas--he once again stepped forward to lead. After an \nextensive investigation in the Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Committee, Senator Pryor worked with those of us on the \nRepublican side on a bill to strengthen the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission so that we can now better detect and counter threats to our \nchildren's health before these threats even reach the store shelves, \nand eventually homes, schools, and daycare centers.\n  From restoring trust in government to protecting our children, \nSenator Pryor has proven over and over again that bipartisanship works. \nIt is so significant that his message to us today is that the \ndysfunction and hyperpartisanship that have characterized the Senate \ncannot stand.\n  That is a wonderful parting message, and it is typical of Senator \nPryor that rather than talking about all of his accomplishments, he \ninstead is beseeching the Senate to work together in the interests of \nall Americans--whether we are Democrats, Republicans, Independents, \nGreens, or not affiliated with any party at all.\n  The 2014 election did not produce the result Senator Pryor had hoped \nfor, but it did reveal another aspect of his extraordinary character. \nHis message to the people of Arkansas and to the new Senator-elect on \nelection night was genuine and it was gracious. To the people of \nArkansas, he simply expressed his sincere gratitude for the opportunity \nto serve. But may these words, spoken that evening to us in the \nChamber, which he echoed today, be his legacy. He said that night:\n\n       The biggest and most serious problem we are facing in this \n     Nation today is the dysfunction of our political system in \n     Washington. We have incredible potential, but we won't reach \n     it unless Washington starts to work again for all of us.\n\n  Mark Pryor has been an extraordinary individual who always did what \nhe believed was right. He has contributed enormously to our country and \nserved his State well.\n  I commend him for his service and I thank him for his commitment, his \nintegrity, and, most of us all, for his friendship.\n  Thank you, Mark.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the great Cesar Chavez once said: ``If you \nreally want to make a friend, go to someone's house and eat with him . \n. . the people who give you their food give you their heart.''\n  That is true. Sometimes they give you more than that. Sometimes they \ngive you an adventure in eating that you will never forget.\n  That is what happened to me when, in January, I was invited by Mark \nPryor to be his guest at a legendary Arkansas political event. I am \ntalking about the historic, well-known, annual Gillett, AR, coon \nsupper.\n  Never heard of the Gillet coon supper in Arkansas? It is to Arkansas \nwhat Tom Harkin's steak fry is to Iowa, only it is nonpartisan, it \ndraws about 1,200, and unfortunately they don't serve steak.\n  Coon is raccoon served in large buckets. Folks just reach inside and \npull out a chunk of coon, as they say in Gillett.\n  I was there that night with Mark Pryor. I wanted to make sure I had \nmy best manners as a visiting guest. I was certainly appreciative of \nthe invitation to a packed room with the Governor and every walking \npolitician in Arkansas. Bill Clinton had been there over and over again \nin his terms as Governor. He never missed that supper, and we weren't \nabout to miss it that evening.\n  I watched as they put these bowls of coon and other meats on the \ntable, and I noticed something interesting. All of the visitors like \nmyself had bowls of coon put in front of them. All the folks\n\n[[Page S6370]]\n\nfrom Arkansas were eating out of the beef platter. It struck me that \nperhaps this was a delicacy they were saving just for guests. We asked \nfor advice from Mark Pryor about the proper selection of the cooked \ncoon, and he said: Get one with a big bone because they have the least \namount of meat on them.\n  So we followed his advice, nibbled at the corners, smiled, and said \nwhat a great dinner it was. We looked around and saw that only a \nhandful of the local people from Arkansas were actually eating the \ndelicacy of the evening, including one old fellow whom I went up to \nafterwards to introduce myself to who was wearing a real coonskin cap. \nHe told me he shot the raccoon and this cap had been in his family for \na long time. He passed it on to his daughter first, of course, and then \nto his grandson.\n  Mark Twain, another Mark, it turns out, loved roasted raccoon as \nwell, but he always kept an open mind when it came to the issues of the \nday, including the issue of the afterlife.\n  Mark Twain once said: ``I don't like to commit myself about heaven \nand hell--you see, I have friends in both places.'' One reason Mark \nPryor has been such a good Senator is that he has friends on both sides \nof the aisle. We just heard this warm tribute to Mark Pryor from my \nfriend Susan Collins of Maine, and I am sure others will join the \nchorus on both sides.\n  Mark Pryor is a man of deep faith who takes seriously the admonition \nfrom the book of the prophet Isaiah: ``Come now, let us reason \ntogether.''\n  Like Kay Hagan and Mark Udall in our caucus, Mark Pryor has politics \nand public service in his bloodstream. Mark Lunsford Pryor is the fifth \ngeneration of Pryors to serve in politics in his State. The first three \ngenerations served as sheriffs.\n  Mark Pryor served 4 years in the Arkansas House of Representatives \nand 4 years as Arkansas attorney general. In 2002, the people of \nArkansas elected him to the Senate, the same seat his father David held \nin the Senate for 18 years. Mark Pryor placed on his desk the same \nmotto that his father placed on his. It read, simply: ``Arkansas Comes \nFirst.''\n  But he made his own decisions, and he left a considerable mark in the \nSenate. Halfway through his freshman term, a new Member himself, Mark \nPryor was called on to join forces with the lions of the Senate--John \nWarner, Robert C. Byrd, and Danny Inouye--to forge a compromise over \njudicial nominations that averted a threat to a bigger confrontation. \nThat compromise, Mark said, was the result of perspiration, not \ninspiration.\n  I disagree. It involved the inspiration of a young Senator from \nArkansas who realized that public service often meant trying to work \ntogether and to reason together and to try to break down in your own \nindividual fashion the dysfunction of Washington.\n\n  I worked with Mark on so many things over the years. As a whip I went \nto him many times, and we talked about difficult votes. I always found \nhim to be honest, straightforward, and highly principled. We didn't \nalways come to the same conclusion on the vote, but I respected him \nevery time because I knew he gave thoughtful consideration to both \nsides. When it came to his vote, he was going to do what was right in \nhis own heart and especially what was right for Arkansas. I knew that \nwould make the final decision when it came to the vote.\n  I also want to put in a word of thanks to Mark as a grandfather of \ntwo 3-year-olds who are anxiously awaiting for the arrival of Santa \nClaus in just a few weeks. You see, Mark had the responsibility of \nreforming the Consumer Product Safety Commission. It was an assignment \nlong overdue. That commission was grinding to a halt. It was not \nexercising its authority, and it wasn't keeping Americans safe, as it \nshould. Mark stepped up, in a bipartisan fashion. He stepped up, and he \nended up strengthening the Consumer Product Safety Commission through \nhis efforts on the Senate commerce committee. That will keep toxic toys \nand harmful products out of stores.\n  Many people recognize what Mark Pryor contributed in that effort. \nParents magazine applauded Mark Pryor as one of the three movers and \nshakers in Washington in the year 2005 for his work on the Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission--work that continues to this day to keep \nAmerica safer. Consumer protection has always been a hallmark of Mark's \nservice, dating back to his days in Arkansas as attorney general and \ncertainly as a Senator.\n  Fewer than 2,000 men and women have ever had the privilege of serving \nin the Senate. In our entire history, with hundreds of millions of \npeople in our population, fewer than 2,000 have been sworn in to \nrepresent their States in the Senate. In Mark Pryor we have a person \nwho did an extraordinary job as a Senator for Arkansas and for America. \nHe has been a great friend of mine--someone I am going to miss very, \nvery much, but I hope he will keep in touch. We say that somewhat \nloosely when people leave here, but I mean it, because Mark Pryor \nalways brought a smile to my day. I recognize that his work in public \nservice aspired to the highest levels and always will\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I came to the floor without any prepared \nremarks, but I want to say a few words, if I could, about our colleague \nMark Pryor.\n  I have affectionately called him ``Hey, man,'' because in Arkansas, \nwhen you see one of your friends, you don't just say ``hi, Tom'' or \n``hi, Mark,'' you say ``hey, man.'' For the last 12 years, we have been \nsaying a lot of ``hey, man's,'' and hopefully we will do so for a long \ntime to come.\n  Ten or twelve days ago I was down in Honduras--murder capital of the \nworld--and trying to figure out how to help save a nation that may be a \nfailing nation. They have a lot of gangs down there--gangs involved in \nextorting money from businesses, a lot of them kidnapping people, \ntrafficking people. Gangs have a bad connotation in Honduras, as they \nshould--here in Washington, DC, and in the Senate, not so much.\n  Senator Collins and Senator Durbin have talked about some of the \n``gangs'' this Senator from Arkansas has been involved in, which I \nthink most of us would say are doing the Lord's work, doing good work. \nMark is a man of deep faith, as we know, and he has been a great role \nmodel for the rest of us.\n  Mark has reminded me before--and maybe some others as well--that in \nthe Old Testament, in Proverbs, we are reminded we should always pray \nfor wisdom--always pray for wisdom. That is something I pray for every \nnight--not just for my colleagues, of course, but certainly for me. All \nI can say is the good Lord has answered his prayer.\n  One of the reasons he has ended up as a member of these gangs for \ngood is because he has so much wisdom. He is a good listener. He is \njust a very, very wise human being.\n  It has been a joy serving with him. He got here in 2003. He raised \nhis right hand here and took the oath of office in 2003. He came \nthrough orientation for new Senators, and I talked to him about it \nlater, and I said: How was orientation, Mark? He said: Well, it lasted \nabout that long. It was over. If you are a Democrat, we are going to \nput you over here, and if you are a Republican, we will put you over \nhere, and it was just like, have at it. He and I talked about it, and \nwe said: That doesn't make much sense.\n  As an attorney general and a member of the Attorneys General \nAssociation, and myself as a former Governor and a member of the \nNational Governors Association, we had a robust orientation program for \nnew attorneys general and for new Governors. The Presiding Officer is a \nformer Governor of Maine, and he recalls that well. I think one of the \nreasons why the Governors are less partisan and more likely to work \nacross the aisle to get things done together--and the same with the \nattorneys general--is because of that orientation that occurs a couple \nweeks after the election. We didn't have anything like that in the \nSenate. So Senator Pryor, along with former Governor and Senator \nVoinovich, former Governor Alexander and myself decided to see if we \ncould get some kind of orientation program here for Senators. Now when \npeople show up a couple weeks after getting elected new Senators, they \nno longer get put over in one corner as Democrats and one corner as \nRepublicans and are told to go at it. They spend some time together--\nmaybe the most concentrated time they will have together during the\n\n[[Page S6371]]\n\ntime they are here--with folks of the other party. Those of us who are \nSenators and spouses and chaplains and so forth go in and provide \ninformation and tell them to learn from our mistakes--those of us who \nhave made plenty of them--and you won't make those same mistakes.\n  One of the things Senator Pryor is especially good at doing is trying \nto connect each new Senator with a mentor--a Democratic Member and a \nRepublican Member--and he was dogged in that. Not that everybody needs \na mentor, but we all need friends. We need friends on both sides of the \naisle, and you will keep those friendships for a long, long time.\n  I was a naval officer for 23 years. When I was a 17-year-old graduate \nfrom high school, I went off to Ohio State to eventually become a Navy \nmidshipman. I did that for 4 years, 5 years as a naval flight officer \nin a hot war in Southeast Asia, and 18 in the Cold War until I retired \nin 1991. I started learning about leadership when I was pretty young--\nsomething I learned before I became a midshipman. But among the things \nI learned about leadership is that a leader should be humble, not \nhaughty. A leader should say do as I do, not do as I say. Leaders \nshould have the heart of a servant, and we should come here with the \nidea of serving. The Scriptures we read say: He who would be a leader \nmust be a servant to all; he who would be first should be a slave to \nall.\n  A leader should have the courage to stay out of step when everybody \nelse is marching to the wrong tune. A leader shouldn't ask what is the \neasy thing to do, the speedy thing to do; they should ask what is the \nright thing to do. And a leader, as has already been said, a leader \nshould ask the question asked of a rabbi some 2,000 years ago. A rabbi \nwas asked: What is the most important commandment of all? He mentioned \nwhat one was, and then he said the second one is love our neighbors as \nourselves. I think that is the most important one of all. Leaders are \nlike that. Leaders are like that.\n  I just wish to say that I think my friend, ``Hey, man,'' also known \nas Senator Mark Pryor, personifies that kind of leader. God knows we \nneed more of them. He has demonstrated by his own character and \nbehavior what he believes.\n  I am tempted to say we are going to miss him, but we are still going \nto see a lot of him. In the Navy, when somebody has done a great job, \nwe say two words: Bravo Zulu--Bravo Zulu. So I say that to my friend.\n  We also have this admonition. The Navy has the tradition of hailing \nfarewell on a ship or submarine or aircraft carrier, whatever squadron \nyou are on. When people come in, we have an event called a hail and \nfarewell party. When it is over, for those who are leaving, we say: \nFarewell and a following sea.\n  So I would say this: Farewell and a following sea, and we will see \nmuch more of you in the future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. King). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Carper for those good \nremarks, and I think they reflect the quality and the character Mark \nPryor has displayed as a Member of this Senate.\n  I have been asked: Who are some of your favorite people across the \naisle, Democratic people whom you respect and like? Mark Pryor has \nalways been at the top of that list.\n  We have both served as attorneys general of our States. We have a \nnumber of things to talk about. I have been able to commiserate with \nhim over Arkansas football in recent years. We kind of keep up with \nthose things a lot.\n  I just would wish to say something that I basically said at the \nNational Prayer Breakfast several years ago. Senator Pryor and I were \ncochairmen, and I was able to say, with great confidence, that Mark \nPryor is one of the best people I have ever served with in the Senate. \nHe is a man of faith and integrity, and his ego is under control--not \nalways so around this place, and it makes it run better. He is \ncollegial, willing to work with people across the aisle, work within \nhis own party, and not one who has had difficulty making decisions. He \nhas done what he thought was right year after year here in this great \nSenate.\n  We had the opportunity to lead the Senate Prayer Breakfast and then \nthe National Prayer Breakfast twice, and it was a special time. Mark \nreally did a great job and spent a great deal of time meeting with \npeople from all over the world. I think the depth of his faith is quite \nobvious.\n  To Mark I wish to say that you are special to me. Your service in the \nSenate has been very special. You have always done what you thought was \nright for your State and done so in a way that is so pleasant and \ncollegial to work with. I know you will have some great adventures \nahead. It looks even like the Razorbacks are coming back. They may give \nAlabama and Auburn a real hard time next year--who knows. Hope springs \neternal. They did pretty well at the end of this year, I have to say. A \nmonster may be arising in Arkansas--who knows.\n  We do have a great Senate, with less than 2,000 people having served \nin this body. We have people of talent and ability throughout, but \nthere are people over the period of years that touch you as the genuine \narticle, people whom you respect and admire, and, Mark, you are one of \nthose. God bless you and Godspeed.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I join my colleagues today in all the good words that \nare being said about my friend Senator Pryor. I got to know Senator \nPryor best in the commerce committee, where early on he scored a major \nvictory for the children of this country. That was at a time we learned \nthat toys and children's products that contained lead were being \nbrought in from all over the world. We actually had a young child in \nMinnesota whose mom went out and bought a pair of Reebok tennis shoes, \nand with the tennis shoes came a little charm. That little child \nswallowed that charm, and that little child died. He did not die from \nchoking on the charm; he died over a period of days when the lead went \ninto his system. That is just one example. Senator Pryor was heading up \nthe consumer subcommittee, and we took a major vote to change the \nstandards of lead in children's products, including jewelry and toys, \nand it was a huge bipartisan vote, a very important bill, what was \ncalled one of the most important pieces of consumer legislation in \ndecades. Senator Pryor got that done.\n  Later, while he was head of that subcommittee, we had a little girl \nin Minnesota named Abigail Taylor who died in a swimming pool. All she \nwas doing was playing in a kiddie pool, and she happened to be sitting \nin the middle of the pool. The pool drain malfunctioned and basically \nsucked her insides out. She survived for a year. When Mark Pryor came \nto Minnesota, he met with that little girl and her dad. She later died \nafter a surgery to try to save her life.\n  We worked after that to get the bill passed--named after Howard \nBaker's grandchild, who had also died in a similar circumstance--to \nmake sure that all these public pool drains--from apartments to YMCAs; \nyou name it--were checked. There has been a decrease in the number of \ndeaths. We do not hear about them on the news like we used to, and that \nis because of Mark Pryor's work in the Senate subcommittee.\n  So I know the Taylor family--that was my proudest moment, standing \nback in the cloakroom and calling them. They believed after they met \nMark Pryor that it would be easy to pass this bill, that we could get \nthis done. It wasn't quite that easy. It took a few months. We had to \nend up putting it in the Energy bill to get it done. But being able to \ncall Scott Taylor, who never gave up believing Congress could get \nsomething done--that is just one more example of the work Senator Pryor \nhas done. So I thank him for that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/08/senate-section/article/S6371-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6371-S6373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               STOP EXPLOITATION THROUGH TRAFFICKING ACT\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I am also here today to address something entirely\n\n[[Page S6372]]\n\ndifferent; that is, a bill we would like to get done before the end of \nthe year in the Senate. It is a bill I have with Senator Cornyn, and it \nis called the Stop Exploitation Through Trafficking Act of 2013. It has \n19 bipartisan cosponsors. I note the year is 2013. We have been waiting \nnearly 2 years to get this done. A version of the bill which is very \nsimilar to ours passed the House this summer.\n  Senator Cornyn and I initially wrote the bill. We worked with all the \nsex trafficking groups. It is a very important bill, and their No. 1 \npriority this year is to get it done. I thank Majority Leader Reid for \nhis work on this, as well as Senator Leahy for helping to get the bill \nto the floor. We have also been working with Senators Heitkamp and \nKirk, and Senator Wyden has been an incredible partner on these issues. \nSenator Portman has been supportive. In the House, Congressman Paulsen \ncalled me to sponsor this bill. He took it on and, with the help of \nRepresentative Cantor and Representative McCarthy and the Speaker, was \nable to get that bill passed through the House. So this is one of those \ninstances where people have come together and have been moving a very \nimportant bill.\n  We have support from the National Conference of State Legislatures, \nand Cindy McCain--the wife of Senator McCain--and I and have done a lot \nof work on this issue. We spoke to their national conference this year. \nThey have endorsed this bill. This bill is supported by the National \nCenter for Missing and Exploited Children, the Fraternal Order of \nPolice, Shared Hope International, National Alliance to End Sexual \nViolence, United Methodist Women, and the list goes on.\n  It is time to get this done. There is a minor error in the House bill \nthat we need to correct, and that is why we need to pass the Senate \nbill. We basically made the changes that are in the House bill. We also \nneed to pass it in the Senate because this one includes the national \nsex trafficking strategy.\n  We have Senator Cornyn working on his side of the aisle. There appear \nto be no objections. I will explain in a bit the amendments that passed \nout of Judiciary 18 to 0. That is his portion that is included in this \nbill. I was actually having trouble getting the bill through on its \nown, and so we have joined forces on this bill.\n  Now it appears we could have some objections on our side, which I \nhope will get cleared up, because people are disappointed that they \ncannot get other bills on. I can't help people get these other bills \nthrough. I don't have that in my power right now. The 27 million people \naround the world who are victims of sex trafficking cannot help get \nthat done, nor can all of the kids whom we see in Minnesota who get \ntaken into sex trafficking--13 years old is the average age. They \ncannot do anything. They cannot be pawns in a game.\n  It is my hope that we will be able to work this out and get this bill \npassed in the next day or two because then I have to get it over to the \nHouse. So I am under a major time constraint.\n  This is an important bill which makes clear that girls and boys who \nare victims of sex trafficking should not be treated as criminals. The \nstatistics, as I said, show that more than 27 million people around the \nworld, whether it is Boko Haram--taking those little girls from their \nbeds in the middle of the night in Nigeria, with their parents having \nnothing but bicycles to try to track down the people who stole them in \nthe middle of the woods; whether it is a young girl on the oil patch in \nNorth Dakota--a major case going on there from the U.S. attorney's \noffice; whether it is a young girl in Minnesota--this is happening in \nour country today.\n  Over 80 percent of the victims we have in the United States are from \nthe United States. So while we see this all over the world, we know we \nhave our own problems in our own backyard. In terms of the increase, \nsome of it has come because of the Internet. We love the Internet, but \nit has also provided ways for people to advertise for sex trafficking \nin ways that make it more difficult to track down. As I said, the \naverage age of a child who is a victim of sex trafficking is 13 years \nold--not old enough to get a driver's license, not even old enough to \ngo to a high school prom. We have seen problems in our own country. \nEighty-three percent of sex trafficking victims in America are U.S. \ncitizens.\n  Despite all those numbers, we are not here just to talk about this \nbill. The reason I am going to make an enormous push for it this week, \nto get this done, is because I don't believe young kids--mostly girls--\nshould be pawns in a political game. We are here because of Tamara \nVandermoon. She was only 12 years old--in Minnesota--when she was first \nsold for sex. She wasn't a teenager. She was just mad at her mom and \nran away. A pimp found her and made all kinds of promises--promises \nthat sounded pretty good to a scared kid away from home. She was taken \nadvantage of when she was most vulnerable, before she had a chance to \ngrow up and become an adult. That is why we are doing this bill.\n\n  This bill is actually based on a model we have in about a dozen \nStates right now, including Minnesota, that basically says to the \nStates: We would like to incentivize you to use this model which is to \nhelp the victims of these sex crimes, which is to help them with \nservices, and which is to not prosecute them as criminals because the \nonly way we are really going to be able to go after the johns, the way \nwe are going to be able to go after the people who lead these kinds of \nrings is if we are willing to give these victims the help they need to \nturn their lives around but also to get them to testify.\n  It has worked very well in our State. In Ramsey County alone, we have \nhad several prosecutions, including a 40-year sentence this last year \nagainst a guy who was running a major sex trafficking ring. If you \ndon't think this is going on in towns such as St. Paul, MN, then you \nneed to look in your own communities because it is going on.\n  One of the main goals in the bill is to make sure kids sold for sex \nare not treated as criminals. According to a report from Polaris, 15 \nStates across the country already have these State safe harbor laws and \nanother 12 States are starting to make progress in the right direction. \nSo we are not starting from scratch. It is not some crazy idea that \nsomeone tried in one State and it wasn't working. We know this works. \nThe Cornyn and Klobuchar bill will give incentives to States when they \napply for Federal grants, and they are going to be able to apply for \nFederal grants after they have a safe harbor bill in place.\n  Our bill would also create a national strategy to combat human \ntrafficking. Our national strategy will encourage cooperation and \ncoordination among all the agencies that work on this problem--Federal, \nState, tribal, and local. It is a nationwide problem. I can tell you \nthat these pimps and people running the rings do not care about local \nboundaries or county boundaries or State boundaries, and we need to be \nas sophisticated as they are when it comes to tackling this problem.\n  We also need to be giving sex trafficking victims the right support, \nsuch as job training and skills building. The bill allows victims of \nsex trafficking to participate in the Job Corps program to help them \nget back on their feet.\n  I am also pleased to include a provision Senators Whitehouse and \nSessions have been working on to clarify the authority of the U.S. \nMarshals Service to assist local law enforcement agencies in locating \nmissing children.\n  As I said, I have been working closely with Senator Cornyn on the \nJustice for Victims of Trafficking Act, and this is also a bill with \nSenator Wyden which is included in this package.\n  When you look at this bill, you have to think of the safe harbor \nprovision, the provisions I just mentioned that make it easier for \npeople who are victims of sex trafficking, for kids to be able to \nparticipate in job training; then you look at the provision from \nSenators Whitehouse and Sessions regarding the U.S. Marshals; and the \nlast part is the work with Senator Cornyn and Senator Wyden on the \nJustice for Victims of Trafficking Act, which is included in this bill. \nIt increases the fees and fines of perpetrators and should bring in \nnearly $30 million each year to pay for victim services. We know we \nhave a lot of need in the States right now because this is a relatively \nnew problem in terms of being on the increase. So shelters could apply \nfor these grants from this fund. We think this is a very good \nprovision, and I thank Senator Wyden and Senator Cornyn for working on \nit.\n  I would also add that this is a provision that went through on an 18-\nto-0\n\n[[Page S6373]]\n\nvote as an amendment, so we know there was support out of the Judiciary \nCommittee for this part of the bill.\n  As a former prosecutor, I know how important this victim-centered \napproach can be. Sex trafficking victims are often afraid to talk to \nlaw enforcement. It makes sense. They are not sure they are going to \nhelp them. Are they going to give them shelter? Are they going to help \nthem turn their lives around and give them a place to sleep? If they \ndon't have this kind of trust, they go back to the pimp and go back to \nthe guy who was giving them money and giving them a place to sleep and \nprobably giving them drugs. If we focus on identifying those victims \neven though they may not tell us they are being trafficked, then it \nwill help them to come forward, get help, and also to testify against \nthe trafficker, leading to more convictions.\n  We need to address the needs of the victim and make sure they have \nthe support they need--housing, education, legal issues--to help break \nthis cycle of violence and abuse. We have a great new shelter that \nopened up in St. Paul this year, and I was proud to be there with Cindy \nMcCain and 180 Degrees--that is what it is called--at Brittany's Place \nin St. Paul. It provides special services for victims of sex \ntrafficking to help them turn their lives around.\n  We also need to use the tools available to go after such traffickers. \nIf we cannot get them on the sex trafficking charges, we need to look \nat money laundering charges or enterprise corruption charges or other \ncharges. While they are not directly related to trafficking, they \ntarget traffickers nonetheless. That will be important for law \nenforcement, and it is the reason State prosecutors are now partnering \nmore with Federal prosecutors.\n\n  We need to go after trafficking facilitators. These are people who \nknow what is going on, but they are closing their eyes to it or \nactually letting it happen. There are some incredible businesses that \nhave gotten out front on this issue. For example, Marilyn Carlson \nNelson of Radisson Hotels in Minnesota has done training. There are a \nnumber of other hotel chains across our country that are working on \nthis issue. Airlines--Delta, American Airlines, and others--have been \ndoing work in this area, and it is actually exciting because we have \nbusinesses willing to say: We are on the frontline. We see when \nsomething is going on in our hotel or on our plane, and we are willing \nto train our employees so they know when to report an incident to law \nenforcement and stop things from happening on the frontline. This is \nhappening right now in our country.\n  We passed a similar bill in the House, and we all know we have to \nmake some minor corrections on the Senate side. This is the bill that \nSenator Cornyn and I originally introduced. We have added some good \nprovisions from Senators Whitehouse and Sessions, as well as Senator \nWyden and Senator Cornyn, and that is what this package is. It is the \nkind of legislation we should pass.\n  Again, the victims of these sex trafficking crimes are not the ones \nwho can figure out how we negotiate in the Senate. There are States \nthat have not yet done anything. They may open their eyes if they know \nthey may get a grant if they change their laws a bit and find the best \npractices and what is working across the country. We should be focused \non those victims and not what is going on here. I am supportive of a \nlot of these bills that people on our side of the aisle want out of the \nJudiciary Committee, but they are not in my control. What is in my \ncontrol is this bill.\n  I have garnered Republican support and passed a version of it in the \nHouse, and all I am asking from my colleagues is to be able to go \nforward with this bill. It would be sad indeed if we were not able to \nget this bill through because of Democratic objection.\n  I plan to ask unanimous consent on this bill. If we are not able to \nwork something out, I will keep at it until this session closes. This \nbill is named the Stop Exploitation Through Trafficking Act of 2013. I \nthink 2 years is enough time. Two years is enough. A young girl's life \nwas ruined at age 18. We can get this bill done.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this week I received several requests from \ninternational advocate groups to speak out against the injustice that \nis taking place in other countries with regard to their judicial \nsystem. It is not unusual to get a request in the United States to \nspeak out on those matters.\n  Journalists are in prison solely because they were doing \ninvestigative journalism, human rights activists are in prison just \nbecause they felt it was necessary to speak out about the injustice in \ntheir society, and there are people who have been arrested, harassed or \ntortured because they disagree with the government and the judicial \nsystem of that country is unable to deal with those types of issues.\n  They understand that one of America's core values is fairness, \ninclusion, and equal justice under the law; however, recent events have \nshown that in the United States we are not where we need to be in \nregard to our judicial system, and we must do more.\n  Shortly after the tragic death of Trayvon Martin--an unarmed youth \nkilled by an auxiliary police personnel--I convened a group of \nactivists in Baltimore to try and understand what is happening in our \ncommunity.\n  I must say that what I observed and learned during that discussion \nwas something that should be very informative to all of us. It was an \nAfrican-American audience, and they explained to me that if you have a \nteenaged son in the African-American community, you have to talk to \nthat son about what they need to do in regard to their potential \nconfrontation with police.\n  It was chilling for me to try to understand the fear that is in our \ncommunity as to how they have to deal with law enforcement. Law \nenforcement should be on your side. Yet it sort of ripped me apart to \nunderstand how widespread the concern is in minority communities and \nthe widespread number of victims of racial profiling in minority \ncommunities. So many families had an example.\n  There was one young woman who was there, and she told me when she was \na young girl she was going to the arena to see a basketball game with \nher father. Her father was pulled over for no reason other than the \ncolor of his skin. He was pulled aside and unable to proceed to the \nbasketball game. It had a huge impact on this young girl at the time \nand made her think: Is this America? Are these core values we believe \nin? Is this equal justice under the law?\n  One of the victims of racial profiling was a young lawyer who was \nreturning home from a funeral he attended. He was stopped by the \nMaryland State Police solely because of the color of his skin--no other \nreason. He decided to do something about it. He brought a legal suit \nagainst the Maryland State Police Department--Wilkins v. State of \nMaryland. As a result of that lawsuit, a consent order was entered into \nwhere the Maryland State Police committed to stop racial profiling. \nThere were certain practices that had to be established, certain checks \nthat had to be done, certain data that had to be provided, and I \nbelieve it became the model example of what law enforcement needs to do \nto ensure it is not using racial profiling.\n  I mentioned that case because Robert Wilkins, the young lawyer who \nbrought that case, has been confirmed by the Senate and now sits on the \nDC Court of Appeals--one of the confirmations we were able to complete \nin this term of Congress. He is an excellent member of the Court of \nAppeals for the District.\n  We get constant reminders of the problems we have in our criminal \njustice system; for example, the tragic death of Michael Brown in \nFerguson, MO. I am a strong supporter of the independence of our \njudicial branch of government and the grand jury system, but I think \nall of us understand the frustration when there were no criminal \nindictments brought in the Trayvon Martin case, the Michael Brown case, \nand in the most recent case with Eric Garner. He was the unarmed \nindividual who was choked to death in New York.\n  Unfortunately, there are many more examples where the criminal \njustice system does not appear to work for equal justice for all.\n  In Oakland, CA, the NAACP reported that out of the 45 officers \ninvolved in\n\n[[Page S6374]]\n\nshootings in the city between 2004 and 2008, 37 of those shot were \nBlack, none were White, one-third of the shootings resulted in \nfatalities, and although weapons were not found in 40 percent of the \ncases, no officers were charged. No wonder people are losing confidence \nthat we truly do have a system where all of our citizens are treated \nequally under the law.\n  I have to point out that the Department of Justice is investigating \nthe circumstances in the Ferguson and Michael Brown case. We will have \nto wait and see what happens with the Federal investigation, but the \ninitial suspicions in many of these cases were solely because of the \ncolor of a person's skin, and that is why the individuals were stopped. \nThey were not stopped because they were observed in criminal activities \nor because they had specific information about a crime that fit the \ndescription of the individual who was stopped. That is profiling and \nprofiling is wrong.\n  Profiling is when the police target an individual, start an \ninvestigation, and do something because of race, religion or national \norigin. That is wrong. It does not work. If you have specific \ninformation about a crime, obviously you can use identifiers to deal \nwith the investigation, and that is appropriate. But if you don't have \nspecific information, then it is profiling, and profiling is just plain \nwrong. It is un-American. It is not what we believe in. It is not in \nour core values. It is a waste of resources because it doesn't help \nsolve a problem. It turns communities against law enforcement, and we \nneed communities working with law enforcement if we are going to have \nthe most efficient law enforcement. As we have seen too frequently in \nrecent years in the United States, it can be deadly. Profiling must \nend.\n\n  The Attorney General issued some guidance on profiling today. There \nwere some things in there that I found helpful. For the first time the \nJustice Department guidelines will cover new categories, such as \nnational origin, gender, gender identity, religion, and sexual \norientation, while closing certain loopholes and narrowing some \nexemptions.\n  The guide mandates new data collection which makes it easier to track \nprofiling complaints. It is all positive. For the first time we have \nspecific guidelines against profiling, but it only applies to the \nFederal agencies. We need to act because only we can make it apply not \njust at the Federal level but at the State and local auxiliaries. We \ncan close all loopholes so we do not allow profiling to take place in \nAmerica, as we should, and we can give a private right of action so we \ncan have enforcement of the laws that we pass. That is what we should \ndo.\n  I have introduced legislation that does exactly that--The End Racial \nProfiling Act, S. 1038. I am proud to have as cosponsors Senators Reid, \nDurbin, Blumenthal, Coons, Harkin, Menendez, Stabenow, Levin, Mikulski, \nWarren, Boxer Gillibrand, Hirono, Wyden, Murphy, and Whitehouse.\n  I am proud to say that in the House of Representatives the lead \nsponsor is John Conyers, who has been an iconic figure in the fight for \ncivil rights, H.R. 2851. There are 59 cosponsors on the House bill.\n  The legislation we authored would provide training and mentoring for \npolice departments so they have what they need. It prohibits all forms \nof profiling. It provides for data collection. It provides grants to \ndevelop best practices. It has broad support, including the support of \nthe Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, ACLU, NAACP, and \nthe Rights Working Group.\n  America is a beacon of hope for people all around the world. They \nembrace our core values because they know what America stands for. It \nstands for every one of us being treated fairly under our laws. I am \nproud of our values, and I am proud of what we have been able to \naccomplish as a nation where we can enjoy religious freedom, where \npeople can speak out however they want to about their government.\n  Let us take care of business first at home and recognize that we are \nnot where we need to be. Recent events where people have lost their \nlives show how our system is not working and needs to be corrected. One \nthing we can do is pass the End Racial Profiling Act. As Senator \nKennedy said, civil rights is the great unfinished business of America. \nWe can end profiling by passing legislation.\n  I encourage my colleagues to work with me so we can end profiling and \nmove one step closer to equal justice under the law for all Americans.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/08/senate-section/article/S6374-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6374-S6375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 1352\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, as we hurry to finish things late in the \nyear, we are running out of time to reauthorize the Native American \nHousing Assistance and Self-Determination Act, referred to as NAHASDA. \nThis legislation was first passed in 1996 to consolidate Indian housing \nprograms at the Department of Housing and Urban Development. This block \ngrant replaced 14 different housing programs operating in Indian \nCountry. The law has been previously authorized twice in a bipartisan \nmanner.\n  The housing needs in Indian Country are staggering. A recent GAO \nreport stated that 5.3 percent of homes on Indian lands lacked complete \nplumbing. That compares to homes nationwide where less than 1 percent \nlack plumbing.\n  Tribal communities also face a serious housing shortage. In some \ncases, there are up to 20 people living in a single three-bedroom home. \nThat is not by choice, by the way. That is by necessity. These are \noften extended families with three or four generations under one roof. \nThis is unacceptable. We must do more to honor the trust responsibility \nthe government has to American Indians.\n  The best tool we have to address this housing shortage is the Indian \nHousing Block Grant Program authorized by NAHASDA. Not passing this \nreauthorization places this program in jeopardy, and we should \nreauthorize it today.\n  Last year, during Senator Cantwell's tenure as chair of the Committee \non Indian Affairs, she introduced a reauthorization bill. This bill \nmakes a number of positive changes to the law.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of Calendar No. 334, S. 1352; that the \ncommittee-reported substitute amendment be agreed to; that the bill, as \namended, be read a third time and passed; and that the motion to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I prepared an \namendment which is at the desk. The amendment I would like to offer \nwould strike just one provision of this bill which is the \nreauthorization of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act from this large \nreauthorization bill. The Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, in my view, is \nunconstitutional. It conditions benefits to certain residents of the \nState of Hawaii on their ancestry; that is, on what race they belong \nto, like the U.S. Supreme Court, which invalidated similar laws, making \nmembership of a racial group an explicit qualification for certain \nbenefits. I believe this act violates the constitutional guarantee of \nequal protection. I, therefore, cannot support the reauthorization \nwithout an amendment striking that same language. Accordingly, I \nrespectfully request that my distinguished colleague, the senior \nSenator from Montana, modify his request to adopt my amendment which is \nat the desk and which would strike section 503.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator so modify his request?\n  Mr. TESTER. I object to the modification because of this: Setting \naside the fact that Senator Inouye was a very good friend of mine, the \nNative Hawaiian Homelands Act was passed into law some time ago. As \nNative people, Native Hawaiians have sacrificed\n\n[[Page S6375]]\n\ntheir lands similar to Native people here and in Alaska. The Native \nHawaiians here have similar needs to those whom I just explained.\n  The cost of housing in Hawaii is a significant barrier for Native \nHawaiians. Reauthorizing the Native Hawaiian provisions will provide \nstability and assurances to keep housing programs for Native Hawaiians \nmoving forward. For these reasons, I object to that modification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is an objection to the modification.\n  Is there a further objection to the original request?\n  Mr. LEE. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. TESTER. I am disappointed that we cannot pass this legislation. \nThis bill would not only reauthorize Indian housing programs with HUD \nbut would streamline cumbersome environmental requirements and allow \nfor more flexibility to build more modern, sustainable housing. This \nlegislation would also reauthorize housing programs, as I said, for the \nNative Hawaiians, where the need exists in a big way.\n  I should also mention that the exact same provision was included in a \nbill that passed the Republican-controlled House of Representatives \nlast week on a voice vote.\n  Finally, this legislation will make the HUD-VASH Program available to \ntribally designated housing authorities through the Indian housing \nblock grant. These funds will be specifically used for housing \nassistance for homeless, Native veterans, as well as those who are at \nrisk of becoming homeless.\n\n  As many of my colleagues know, American Indians serve at higher rates \nper capita than any other population in the military and continue to be \none of the most underserved groups of veterans.\n  With all these good things in it, I am extremely disappointed that we \ncannot get this bill across the finish line. Housing Native people \nshould be a priority for Congress as we wrap up this session.\n  It is frustrating to see a bill get through the House only to have \npotentially a couple of Senators here hoping to get a better report \ncard from a group such as the Heritage Foundation.\n  I am sorry we cannot pass the bill today. This is disappointing for \nany country and the Senate. I am more than willing to talk about \ngermane changes, but the bottom line is this: Many folks here do not \nunderstand the trust responsibilities we have to our Native American \npeople. If we are going to start carving folks out such as the Native \nHawaiians, we are going to be making two classes of Native American \npeople in this country. I don't think that is fair to them, nor do I \nthink it is fair to this country.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/08/senate-section/article/S6375-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6375-S6377]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FOIA IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2014\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am about to propound a unanimous consent \nrequest, but I should explain why. It is on the Freedom of Information \nAct, one of our Nation's most important laws. For nearly 50 years, FOIA \nhas given Americans a way to access government information, ensuring \ntheir right to know what their government is doing. Today, the Senate \nis now poised to build on that important legacy with passage of the \nbipartisan Leahy-Cornyn FOIA Improvement Act.\n  The FOIA Improvement Act will codify what the President laid out in \nhis historic executive order in 2009. This legislation will require \nFederal agencies to adopt a ``Presumption of Openness'', and make it a \npriority of the people's interest in what their government is doing. \nOur bill will reduce the overuse of exemptions to withhold information \nwhere there is no foreseeable harm. It will make information available \nfor public inspection, and make frequently requested documents \navailable online. It will provide the Office of Government Information \nServices (OGIS), with additional independence and authority to carry \nout its work. I believe this legislation reaffirms the fundamental \npremise of FOIA, that government information belongs to all Americans.\n  Passage of FOIA will help open the government to more than 300 \nmillion Americans whom the government is supposed to serve. The bill is \nsupported by 70 public interest groups that advocate for government \ntransparency. The Sunshine in Government Initiative said the Leahy-\nCornyn bill ``strengthens government transparency by limiting the \nability of agencies to hide decades old documents from the public.''\n  We reported this legislation out of the Judiciary Committee to the \nfull Senate with unanimous support. Ranking Member Grassley said the \nFOIA Improvement Act ``opens wide the curtains and provides more \nsunlight on the Federal Government.'' Senator Cornyn has been my \npartner for many years on government transparency and noted our \nbipartisan efforts ``open up the government and make it more consumer \nand customer friendly.'' I thank them both for their work on this \nlegislation.\n  Today I ask that the Senate pass S. 2520, the bipartisan FOIA \nImprovement Act of 2014. We often talk about the need for government \ntransparency, and many also note how rare it is that Democrats and \nRepublicans can come together on any legislation. Today, we can \naccomplish both of those things but time is running out. We drafted \nthis bill in a bipartisan fashion after a long and thoughtful process \nof consultation.

Mr. President, I speak in support of the nomination of \nLauren McFerran to fill an approaching vacancy on the National Labor \nRelations Board. I was heartened by the recent cloture vote in support \nof the McFerran nomination and urge my colleagues in just a short while \nto vote in favor of her confirmation.\n  Ms. McFerran is well known to most of us as a senior staffer on the \nHELP Committee, where she has long served as chief labor counsel and \nmore recently as deputy staff director. She has been nominated to fill \na vacancy that will result from the departure later this month of a \ncurrent Board Member, Nancy Schiffer. I would like to take this \nopportunity to publicly thank Ms. Schiffer for her dedicated service to \nthe National Labor Relations Board. She has been a highly respected \nBoard Member and I wish her every success in her future endeavors.\n  I also want to say a word about the previous nominee to the Board, \nSharon Block, whose nomination was withdrawn at the insistence of \nSenate Republicans. Although I have no doubt that Ms. McFerran will \nserve with fairness and distinction, it is unfortunate that Sharon \nBlock, a dedicated public servant, will not have the opportunity to \nserve further on the National Labor Relations Board. Ms. Block was an \nextraordinarily qualified nominee who was widely respected by both \nDemocrats and Republicans alike. Ms. Block's nomination was withdrawn \nas a result of circumstances wholly beyond her control. But her \nqualifications and experience are undiminished and untarnished by the \ncircumstances that led to the withdrawal of her nomination.\n  The National Labor Relations Board is an agency that is absolutely \ncritical to our country, to our economy, and to our middle class. Over \n75 years ago, Congress enacted the National Labor Relations Act, \nguaranteeing American workers the right to form and join a union and to \nbargain for a better life. That act sets forth a national policy to \nencourage collective bargaining--to encourage collective bargaining. \nThat is the national policy of this government, and has been since \n1935.\n  Let me read what the act specifically states:\n\n       It is declared to be the policy of the United States to \n     eliminate the causes of certain substantial obstructions to \n     the free flow of commerce and to mitigate and eliminate these \n     obstructions when they have occurred by encouraging the \n     practice and procedure of collective bargaining and by \n     protecting the exercise by workers of full freedom of \n     association, self-organization, and designation of \n     representatives of their own choosing, for the purpose of \n     negotiating the terms and conditions of their employment or \n     other mutual aid or protection.\n\n\n[[Page S6378]]\n\n\n  That is the policy of the U.S. Government, to encourage collective \nbargaining, not to destroy it, not to tear it down, not to throw up \nroadblocks against collective bargaining, but to encourage it. Those \nwho continually attack the National Labor Relations Board, who try to \ninterfere in its procedures, many times are those who want to throw a \nmonkey wrench into collective bargaining. Well, they are going against \nthe policy of the United States.\n  I am proud to be a citizen of a country that promotes collective \nbargaining, to allow workers to negotiate for better wages, better \nconditions, safe working conditions, a country that protects \nfundamental rights such as the freedom of association.\n  The act provides these essential protections for union and nonunion \nworkers alike. It gives workers a voice in the workplace, allowing them \nto join together and speak up for the very essence of middle-class \njobs: fair wages, good benefits, safe working conditions. These rights \nensure that the people who do the real work in this country have a shot \nat joining the middle class and receiving a fair share of the benefits \nwhen our economy grows.\n  The NLRB, the National Labor Relations Board, is the guardian of \nthese fundamental rights. Workers themselves cannot enforce the \nNational Labor Relations Act, but they can turn to the Board if they \nhave been denied the basic protections provided under the law. In \nshort, the Board plays a vital role in vindicating workers' rights.\n  Get this. Understand this. In the past 10 years, the National Labor \nRelations Board, the NLRB, has secured opportunities for reinstatement \nof 22,544 employees who were unjustly fired. Over that same past 10 \nyears, the NLRB has recovered more than $1 billion on behalf of workers \nwhose rights and wages were violated.\n  The Board also provides relief and remedies to our Nation's \nemployers. A lot of people think the NLRB is just there for the \nworkers. Not so. It is there to help employers too. For example, \nemployers can turn to the Board for relief if a union commences a \nwildcat strike or refuses to bargain in good faith during negotiations. \nThe NLRB has a long history of helping businesses resolve disputes \nefficiently.\n  By preventing or resolving labor disputes that could disrupt our \neconomy, the work the Board does is vital to every worker and every \nbusiness across the Nation. That is why it is so important that we \nmaintain a fully functional five-member NLRB. I am proud of the fact \nthat just over a year ago, we were able to confirm Members to \ncompletely fill the first Board in over a decade. Now we need to fill a \nsoon-to-be-open seat so the Board can continue to function effectively. \nThat is what this vote coming up is all about.\n  It is unfortunate that some of my friends on the other side of the \naisle do not believe in the National Labor Relations Act--not all of \nthem, but a very vocal minority, I would say. They do not agree that it \nshould be the policy of the United States to promote collective \nbargaining and self-organization in order to prevent disruptions in \n``the free flow of commerce'' that can have a detrimental impact on our \nNation's economy.\n  They would like to change the existing law if they could, but they do \nnot have the votes. So, instead, they have attempted to pull every \npossible lever to slow down the work that goes on at the NLRB. \nRecently, Republicans in the House of Representatives have held hearing \nafter hearing specifically addressing the NLRB. They passed two bills \nto amend the NLRA, the National Labor Relations Act, to strip workers \nof their rights. Republican elected officials have tried to defund the \nagency, threatening the professional credentials and livelihoods of \nnonpartisan career employees, and even called on a Republican Board \nMember to resign in order to incapacitate the agency. You heard me \nright. Republicans called on a Republican Board Member of the National \nLabor Relations Board to leave it, and then they would not have enough \nMembers to function.\n  What most concerns me about this political game-playing is how it \naffects the everyday lives of workers across America. For workers who \nare disciplined, penalized, even fired unjustly by employers, it is the \nNLRB that ensures that workers who are illegally punished, as I \nmentioned, can get back their jobs and lost wages.\n  This is exactly why we need to confirm Ms. McFerran today. No one can \ncontest her qualifications. As I said, she currently serves as both \nchief labor counsel and deputy staff director of the Senate HELP \nCommittee. I am proud to have her as a member of my staff. She has \nserved this committee with excellence and great professionalism, first \nhired by my predecessor Senator Kennedy. She stayed on after his \npassing and my assumption of the chairmanship of the committee.\n  She has a deep knowledge of labor law. She is an incredibly talented \nlawyer. She is a person of sterling integrity and strong character. She \nwill be a great asset to the Board. It is my hope that by promptly \nconfirming Ms. McFerran's nomination to fill the upcoming vacancy, we \ncan continue the progress that has been made recently and begin a new \nera where orderly transitions on the NLRB are the norm, where we do not \ngo month after month, year after year, with vacancies, with a board \nthat cannot function.\n  Instead of letting every vacancy become a political football, with \nthreats to shutter the Board, and pressure for recess appointments, we \nshould set a new precedent of confirming nominees, Democratic and \nRepublican alike, in a timely manner, allowing the dedicated public \nservants at the Board to stop worrying about making headlines and \ninstead focus on the important work they do every day.\n  Again, that important work includes assuring that American workers \nare able to exercise their right to freedom of association. In the \nworkplace, this freedom means collectively bargaining for better wages, \nbenefits, and working conditions. It is enshrined in the National Labor \nRelations Act and upheld by the NLRB.\n  I have no doubt that Ms. McFerran will do an excellent job in this \nimportant position. I urge my colleagues to support her confirmation \nlater this afternoon.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/08/senate-section/article/S6378-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6378]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday at events all around Florida and \nacross the country, America marked the 73rd anniversary of the attack \non Pearl Harbor--a day known not only for its tragedy but also for its \nrole in shaping the destiny of what has come to be called the \n``greatest generation.'' It is a generation that faced challenges \nunlike any seen before or since. It saw a decade of widespread \nprosperity crumble into the deepest depression in American history, and \nit saw the deepest depression in American history give way to the \ndeadliest war in human history.\n  The scope of hardship, destruction, and wickedness they faced was \nexceeded only by the strength and valor with which they responded. \nTheirs is a generation that truly saved the world. I don't think any \nother generation at any time can have that said of them with the same \nbluntness.\n  Today that generation passes its stories on to us. They are our \nparents and grandparents, our ancestors and our heritage. Their stories \nare emblems of strength that inspire us as we meet our challenges in \nthis new century.\n  Yesterday we honored the almost 2,500 Americans who were killed on \nthat day of infamy 73 years ago--unsuspecting servicemembers, innocent \nmen and women, but today we have a chance to honor the sacrifices made \nin response to that attack.\n  It was on this very day 73 years ago that President Roosevelt \nfamously came before Congress to ask for a declaration of war. He \nexpressed his confidence that the American people would rally to defend \ntheir Nation, saying: ``The people of the United States have already \nformed their opinions and well understand the implications to the very \nlife and safety of our Nation.''\n  He was right. In the days that followed, 5 million Americans dropped \neverything to volunteer for the Armed Forces. No one asked them to do \nit; they just did it. Tens of millions more entered the draft or \nassisted the war effort at home, and the American people became the \narsenal of democracy almost overnight.\n  In the latter years of his life, I had the honor of meeting and \nworking with a man who was at Pearl Harbor. He was in Pearl Harbor that \nday and fought on foreign battlefields in the years that followed, even \nlosing a limb. I am\n\n[[Page S6380]]\n\nspeaking, of course, of the legendary leader with whom we are all \nfamiliar, Senator Daniel Inouye. He was born and raised in Hawaii and \nwas 17 years old on December 7, 1941. When the attack on Pearl Harbor \noccurred, he rushed to the scene to help treat the wounded. He enlisted \nin the Army the first chance he got and went on to receive the Medal of \nHonor for his valor.\n  When the smoke of World War II finally cleared, his legacy of service \nwas just beginning. He would go on to serve Hawaii in both the Senate \nand the House. By the time of his death, Senator Inouye was the second-\nlongest serving Senator in United States history. I was privileged to \ncount him as my colleague, though for too brief a time.\n  Like Senator Inouye, I also had the privilege of representing many \nveterans of World War II, including some who survived the attack on \nPearl Harbor. At last count, there are over 140 Pearl Harbor survivors \nliving in Florida, and I wish to tell you the stories of three of those \nmen.\n  One is SgtMajMC William Braddock of Pensacola. I recently had the \nprivilege of hearing his account of what happened that Sunday morning \nin Hawaii. Major Braddock had joined the Marine Corps the year prior to \nthe attack. That morning he was in the messhall preparing for duty when \nhe heard the first explosion. He ran outside and was met with \npandemonium.\n  Ships that had been stretched out peacefully in the sun moments \nbefore were now engulfed in flames, blanketing the harbor in black \nsmoke. He watched a torpedo drop in the water and seconds later explode \ninto the side of the USS Oklahoma. He described the stain of oil on the \nwater and the way flames shot up from it, and the horror of watching \nsailors trapped in the fire. Amidst the confusion and shouting of \norders, he recalled how little he could do to save lives and how \nhelpless he felt.\n\n  Following the attack, Major Braddock went on to fight bravely in some \nof the key battles in World War II. He fought in the Battle of Iwo Jima \nand remembers vividly the day the iconic flag was raised above the \nisland. He was in the occupational forces in Japan after the \ndevastation of the atomic bombs. But despite all the horrors he \nwitnessed, Major Braddock did not retire from the armed services the \nfirst chance he got. On the contrary, he went on to 27 years of \ndistinguished service in the Marine Corps.\n  I can't help but be humbled hearing such a story. Major Braddock is a \nman who fought out of duty and love of his country. He saw himself as a \ncitizen soldier--even recalling the way his experience hunting rabbits \nin the fields around his house as a boy actually prepared him for Iwo \nJima. He is humbled regarding his role. He says he tries not to give \ntoo much thought to it when he doesn't have to.\n  That same modesty is the hallmark of another story, the story of a \nPearl Harbor survivor who lives in Palm Beach County today. His name is \nWayne Myrick, and he was a chief machinist's mate on the USS Blue at \nthe time of the attack.\n  Within seconds of the first explosion, Chief Petty Officer Myrick had \nrushed to gather ammunition and help operate the guns aboard that \ndestroyer. But as a chief machinist, his attention soon turned to other \nmatters. The captain of the USS Blue was eager to get the ship out on \nopen water, but the boilers beneath deck were off line.\n  Under intense gunfire, Chief Petty Officer Myrick and his crew \nmembers scrambled to get the boilers working and eventually managed to \ngive the ship the maneuvering speed to move out. With his help, the USS \nBlue was one of the first vessels to make it to open water and was able \nto down five enemy aircraft and at least one submarine.\n  Chief Petty Officer Myrick recalled how important his oath was to him \nthat day. He and every one of his shipmates took an oath when they \nenlisted that commanded them to follow their orders and defend their \ncountry from all enemies, and he viewed that oath as a solemn and \nsacred one because it was a reminder that service to one's country is \nabout more than self. He had a simple but powerful message he wanted me \nto share today: Be very proud to serve your country.\n  Finally, I wish to share the story of CDR Hal Sullivan of \nJacksonville. Commander Sullivan joined the U.S. Navy when he was 23 \nyears old. He was on the bridge of a destroyer that Sunday morning, \ntasked with operating the sonar equipment and helping sweep for mines. \nWhen the first explosion rocked the harbor, he looked up to see a \nJapanese plane bank sharply overhead. In fact, it was so close to him, \nhe could see the expression on the face of the pilot. He even recalled \nwryly that he could have thrown a potato right into the cockpit if he \nhad had one handy.\n  Before he could process what was happening, gunfire swept over the \ndeck and struck the sailor next to him in the jaw. Commander Sullivan \nhoisted the man up and helped him to a medic. He spoke of looking up \nand seeing the USS Arizona rolling over with its belly up in flames as \nflames shot out its side. He saw sailors struggling in the water.\n  Commander Sullivan insists that his job isn't worthy of fame and that \nhis contribution that day was simply the execution of duty. But through \nthat humility I can't help but see a hero--a man as selfless as he is \nbrave, a man who put the lives of others above his own, not just that \nday but for decades to come. You see, Commander Hal Sullivan went on to \nserve in both the Atlantic and the Pacific. He didn't retire from the \nNavy until almost 30 years after the attack of Pearl Harbor, on the \nexact same week his son entered West Point.\n  Even now, at age 96, Hal says he would still be in the Navy if they \nwould let him. I am touched by that because the truth is Hal's country \nstill needs him, maybe not on the deck of a ship, maybe not risking his \nlife in the middle of the Pacific, but we need him all the same. It is \nthrough hearing stories such as his that our generation will find the \ncourage to face its challenges--a courage that is uniquely American.\n  Pearl Harbor was not just a day of infamy; it was also a day that \nrevealed the greatness of our ancestors. People such as Major Braddock, \nChief Petty Officer Myrick, and Commander Sullivan--it is their blood \nthat flows in the veins of this county that serves as our heritage and \nreveals our destiny.\n  I believe it is true, as Shakespeare famously wrote, that some are \nborn great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon \nthem. But for the ``greatest generation,'' it was all three.\n  Pearl Harbor was the day that greatness was thrust upon them, but it \nwas over the years that followed that their greatness was achieved the \nonly way greatness can be achieved--through blood, toil, tears, and \nsweat.\n  And their toil did not stop after the war was won. The world still \nlooked to America--to our industrial power, our political leadership, \nand our military might--to restore global balance and maintain order \nwhile the wounds of mankind healed.\n  As Pope Pius XII said following the war:\n\n       America has a genius for great and unselfish deeds. Into \n     the hands of America God has placed the destiny of an \n     afflicted mankind.\n\n  Well, I believe America still has that genius. I believe mankind \nremains afflicted and that its destiny remains largely in our hands. \nAll around the world, those who yearn for freedom still turn their eyes \ntowards our shores. They wonder if we see their suffering. They wonder \nif we hear their cries.\n  I am confident that our own generation will achieve greatness in this \ncentury. We will do so by remaining the world's beacon for freedom. \nThat means preserving and extending the promise of the American dream \nhere at home, and it means standing against evil and oppression where \nit rears its head around the world.\n  As did the ``greatest generation,'' our men and women in uniform \ntoday fight for a greater cause than themselves. Major Braddock said \nthat if he could tell today's troops one thing, it would be: Don't give \nup, do what is right and, above all else, be proud of the work you are \ntasked with carrying out.\n  I second that sentiment because our children and grandchildren will \nstand on the shoulders of our generation. They will live in the world \nwe leave behind, the same way we live in the world that was left for \nus.\n  So as we marked the 73rd anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor, I \nwas grateful for all the tributes that took place throughout Florida \nover the\n\n[[Page S6381]]\n\nweekend. It is my prayer that America will take a moment to reflect on \nthe meaning of that day.\n  Its meaning is not a relic of the past. It doesn't just belong to the \n``greatest generation.'' It belongs to all of us. It was America's \nsolemn call to action--not for a generation but for all time--a \npowerful reminder of our duty to our Nation, to each other, to our \nchildren, and to an afflicted mankind.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, are we in morning business now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in morning business.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I could not be a stronger supporter of \nefforts to prevent human trafficking. But we must offer comprehensive \nsolutions that provide meaningful and reliable resources to support \nthese survivors.\n  Just this Congress, I have led the reauthorization of the Trafficking \nVictims Protection Act--widely recognized as this country's most \nimportant tool in combatting human trafficking. The law reasserted the \nUnited States as a global leader in fighting trafficking by \nstrengthening tools available to prosecutors and providing services for \nvictims, including those victims here at home.\n  The Leahy-Crapo Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act also \npassed this Congress. That bill expanded the availability of grants to \nsupport victims of human trafficking, as well as sexual assault and \ndomestic violence.\n  And now I am working to enact the Runaway and Homeless Youth and \nTrafficking Prevention Act; S. 2646. This bill authorizes the critical \nresources needed to provide shelter and services for the 1.6 million \nyouth in this country who are homeless. Many of these young people are, \nor are at risk of becoming, victims of human trafficking.\n  It is time we put our money where our mouth is. We must reauthorize \nthese existing programs that work. These children, whether in Vermont, \nMinnesota, or Texas, need a place to stay and be safe. And I will not \nleave these priorities behind for political reasons.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/08/senate-section/article/S6381-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR. MICHAEL B. McCALL\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a good \nfriend of mine and a renowned educator in Kentucky, Dr. Michael B. \nMcCall. Dr. McCall has served as the president of the Kentucky \nCommunity and Technical College System, or KCTCS, since 1998, and he \nrecently announced his retirement from that position. It would be \ndifficult to overstate his success at the helm of Kentucky's statewide \ncommunity and technical college system or the growth by leaps and \nbounds that KCTCS has seen under his tenure.\n  KCTCS was created by the Kentucky Postsecondary Education Improvement \nAct of 1997, which united all of the Commonwealth's community and \ntechnical colleges under one system to serve as a gateway to \npostsecondary education for all Kentuckians. Dr. McCall was named as \nthe founding president in December 1998. Since then, he has overseen 16 \ncolleges located on more than 70 campuses across the Bluegrass State.\n  Under Dr. McCall's leadership, KCTCS has become the largest provider \nof postsecondary education in Kentucky, representing 47.1 percent of \nall undergraduate college students. KCTCS serves over 92,000 students, \nand since 1998 the KCTCS Board of Regents has ratified or approved more \nthan 700 programs that result in certificates, diplomas, or associate \ndegrees.\n  KCTCS is also the State's largest provider of workforce training, \nserving more than 5,300 businesses and 52,000 employees annually. It is \nworkforce training initiatives such as these that help develop \nKentucky's labor force and therefore its economy.\n  KCTCS has also become Kentucky's largest provider of online learning, \noffering more than 77 online credentials. Thanks to Dr. McCall's \nvirtual learning initiative known as KCTCS Online, online learners can \npursue higher education at any time that is convenient for them.\n  Other KCTCS accomplishments achieved under Dr. McCall's tenure \ninclude the establishment of the North American Racing Academy, which \nis the first college-affiliated horse racing academy in the United \nStates; the Kentucky Coal Academy; the Kentucky Fire Commission; and \nthe Kentucky Board of Emergency Medical Services. It is clear that Dr. \nMcCall has kept the interests and demands of Kentucky's students and \nbusinesses in mind while developing these programs.\n  Dr. McCall has been an educator and served in community and technical \ncolleges for more than 40 years. Throughout his career, he has been \nrecognized for his leadership and dedication to education. He was the \nrecipient of Phi Theta Kappa's prestigious State Community College \nDirector Award of Distinction.\n  Dr. McCall also received the National Council for Continuing \nEducation and Training's National Leadership Award in 2005. In the same \nyear the National Institute for Staff and Organizational Development \nhonored him with their International Leadership Award. In 2004 Kentucky \nMonthly Magazine named him the ``Kentuckian of the Year.'' Dr. McCall \nalso served as board chair of the American Association of Community \nColleges, completing his tenure in 2006.\n  When KCTCS was first established, it set ambitious goals for \nimproving the level of college attainment for Kentuckians. Thanks to \nDr. McCall, KCTCS has met those goals.\n  Under the leadership of Dr. Michael B. McCall, KCTCS has become a \nremarkable community and technical college system in the United States, \nand it will reach even higher in the future. I ask my Senate colleagues \nto join me in congratulating Dr. McCall and wishing him well upon his \nretirement. He has certainly proved to be a great educator and a great \nfriend to the Commonwealth of Kentucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/08/senate-section/article/S6381-2", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6381-S6382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   USDA PILOT PROJECT FOR THE PROCUREMENT OF UNPROCESSED FRUITS AND \n                               VEGETABLES\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, for several years I have envisioned a way \nto give schools affordable and sustainable access to locally grown \nfoods--a system that would benefit schools, children, and farmers \nalike. To make this a reality, I introduced the Pilot Project for the \nProcurement of Unprocessed Fruits and Vegetables as an amendment to the \n2014 farm bill. I was very encouraged that the final bill included this \npilot project and optimistic that my home State of Oregon could help \nlead the way--as it often does--by hosting one of the eight programs. \nThat is why I am so pleased to say today Oregon was chosen to \nparticipate in the pilot project. This is a win for communities and \nschool districts across Oregon who can now offer meals made with the \nlocally grown produce we are famous for, everything from apples to \nzucchini, blueberries to tomatoes and everything in between.\n  This is a win for the local farmers who will gain new customers to \nbuy their fruits and vegetables, and this is a win for the school \nchildren who will grow up knowing what fresh produce really tastes \nlike.\n  This innovative and exciting project establishes a competitive pilot \nprogram with up to eight demonstration projects, each representing a \ndifferent region of the country. These demonstration projects will help \nschools source healthy, local fruits and vegetables for the breakfasts, \nlunches, or snacks served to students. It is more important today than \never to ensure America's children have fresh, healthy eating options \nwhen they are increasingly exposed to unhealthy, processed foods. The \npartnerships that the pilot projects will surely grow will put money in \nthe pockets of local farmers while also ensuring that our school kids \nare eating healthily. I look forward to seeing these projects grow and \ncontribute to the healthy lives of our Nation's young men and women.\n\n[[Page S6382]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/08/senate-section/article/S6382-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n               RURAL HERITAGE CONSERVATION EXTENSION ACT\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I support efforts to provide permanent \nenhanced conservation tax incentives for family farmers, ranchers, and \nforest landowners who make charitable contributions of land for \nconservation purposes. As a cosponsor of the Rural Heritage \nConservation Extension Act, S. 526, I am a strong supporter of these \nvaluable tools for protecting significant natural and historic \nresources on privately owned lands.\n  These incentives expired at the end of 2013 and are among the so-\ncalled extenders--tax provisions that are routinely extended each time \nthey expire. Making these provisions permanent would benefit wildlife, \nenhance hunting, fishing and shooting access, and keep working lands \nfunctioning and intact.\n  Specifically, the Rural Heritage Conservation Extension Act would \npermanently increase the allowable deduction for charitable \ncontributions of property for conservation purposes. The maximum \ndeduction for individuals would increase from 30 percent to 50 percent \nof adjusted gross income, AGI. Farmers and ranchers would be allowed a \nmaximum deduction of up to 100 percent of AGI. The bill would also \nallow any unused deduction to be carried forward for up to 15 years to \nhelp donors receive the full benefit of their contribution.\n  When this incentive was in place, it supported donations of \nconservation easements in my home State of Maine. In 2012, a landowner \ndonated a conservation easement on a 20-acre property in Machiasport, \nwhich is home to centuries-old cultural artifacts, including \npetroglyphs. In addition to being a spiritual site for Maine's \nPassamaquoddy tribe, this property allows people to explore the State's \nprecolonial history and provides access for local fishermen to utilize \nvaluable clam flats.\n  Another success story is from 2013 in Harpswell, where a landowner \ndonated a conservation easement on a 44-acre island property in the \nheart of Casco Bay. The easement provides public access to a scenic \npeninsula where visitors can picnic, boat, and kayak. Due to this \ngenerous donation, Casco Bay is experiencing increased recreational use \nwhile also protecting critical habitats for many species of wildlife \nincluding shorebirds, herons, and bald eagles.\n  Continuing the enhanced conservation tax incentives would assist in \nthe conservation of thousands of additional acres and provide a whole \nhost of community benefits--protecting historical features, securing \neconomic opportunities, enhancing recreational access, and preserving \nvaluable wildlife habitat--in 2014 and beyond.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/08/senate-section/article/S6382-2", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      65TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE VOICE OF AMERICA'S UKRAINIAN SERVICE\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, for 65 years the Voice of America \nUkrainian Service has been a vital source of comprehensive and unbiased \ninformation for the Ukrainian people.\n  During the Cold War, VOA's uncensored, truthful reporting of the news \nwas a beacon of freedom for Ukrainians dominated by Soviet rule. \nThrough VOA and broadcasts by other media outlets such as Radio \nLiberty, information-starved Ukrainians not only learned about life in \nthe United States and the outside world but also about developments \nwithin Ukraine itself.\n  From VOA, Ukrainians discovered government-sponsored human rights \nviolations taking place throughout the Soviet Union. They became aware \nof the many courageous Ukrainian human rights activists, including \nmembers of the Ukrainian Helsinki Group, who languished in Soviet \nprisons for daring to call upon the Soviet Government to abide by its \nHelsinki Final Act commitments. And when disaster struck at Chernobyl, \nUkrainians looked to VOA to provide the objective information that the \nSoviet Government stubbornly refused to share.\n  Since Ukraine regained its independence in 1991, VOA's Ukrainian \nService has been able to reach more Ukrainian citizens than ever \nbefore. Its daily news program ``Chas-Time'' is seen nightly on \nUkraine's respected Channel 5, and its reporting is often featured on \nother major Ukrainian television channels.\n  VOA's audience has exploded in the year since the Maidan Revolution \nfor Dignity and Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and aggression in \nthe southeast.\n  Thanks to its focus on developments in the United States and U.S.-\nUkrainian relations, VOA's Ukrainian Service has been instrumental in \nbringing home to millions of Ukrainians U.S. policy, as well as the \nperspectives and activities of the Executive Branch, Congress, and NGOs \nwith respect to Ukraine.\n  Ukraine confronts profound external and internal challenges in its \nquest for an independent, democratic, European future. As Chairman of \nthe Helsinki Commission, I commend the ongoing and accelerating role of \nVOA's Ukrainian service, especially during this historic time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/08/senate-section/article/S6382-3", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6382-S6383]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TENNESSEE VALLEY AUTHORITY NOMINEES\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, the Tennessee Valley Authority, or TVA, is \na multibillion-a-year utility--one of the largest in the Nation. It \nplays a critical role in our economic development efforts in Tennessee \nby providing low-cost, reliable power that is essential to attracting, \nretaining, and growing jobs.\n  Strong, independent leadership at TVA is a priority for all \nTennesseans, and the Senate is scheduled to vote tomorrow morning on \ntwo nominees to serve on the TVA board.\n  TVA board members' sole focus should be ensuring ratepayers \nthroughout the Tennessee Valley have affordable, reliable power, and \nthey must be free to operate the entity without undue influence from \noutside individuals.\n  While I respect the two nominees currently being considered, I have \ngrown increasingly concerned by the nomination process and the \npotential influence--or perception of influence--that an outside \ninvestor who has proposed a multibillion-dollar project to TVA has had \non this process. I have shared those concerns with the White House and \nthe majority leader through several conversations.\n  I was particularly disappointed the majority leader announced he was \nmoving forward with votes despite being aware of these issues--making \nit the first time TVA nominations have been confirmed by a rollcall \nvote since 1987.\n  While I still believe the selection of TVA board members and their \nconfirmations deserve a closer look moving forward, today I received \ncopies of letters from Virginia T. Lodge and Ronald A. Walter that \naddress the concerns regarding the potential influence of an outside \nindividual who has business dealings with TVA.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of both letters be printed \nin the Record.\n  The nominees' forthright letters and their decision to recuse \nthemselves helps ensure that there is no appearance of a lack of \nimpartiality, and I plan to support both of their nominations.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                 December 8, 2014.\n     Mr. Ralph E.

Mr. President, in his Inaugural Address to the Nation \nin 2001, President George W. Bush said:\n\n       We are bound by ideals that move us beyond our backgrounds, \n     lift us above our interests, and teach us what it means to be \n     citizens. Every child must be taught these principles. Every \n     citizen must uphold them.\n\n  In Wyoming, we have a quality leader who has embraced these ideals \nand is committed to sharing them with future generations. It is a \ndistinct honor to recognize my friend, Secretary of State Max Maxfield, \nfor his lifetime of service as a dedicated public servant. I invite my \ncolleagues to celebrate his contributions as he steps down after \nsharing over 47 years of experience with the people of Wyoming.\n  In America, we demand a great deal from our leaders. We expect that \nthey will be wise, altruistic, and that they will carry the hearts of \nthe people with them in all they do. Max has done all of this--and \nmore. He has dedicated his career to helping others and furthering his \nvision for the success of Wyoming. In doing so, our State has thrived.\n  Max's career as a public servant is long and distinguished. Max \nworked for 23 years as the executive director of the YMCA in Casper. He \nalso served as the head of the Wyoming Make-A-Wish Foundation. He then \nled the Wyoming Recreation Commission and 2 years later the Wyoming \nDepartment of Commerce. In 1998 Max was elected as the State auditor \nfor the two terms and then in 2006 as the Wyoming secretary of state \nfor two additional terms. With his passion for excellence and his pride \nin Wyoming, Max took great responsibility in his commitment to \npromoting growth and prosperity for all.\n  It is sometimes thought that talented leaders must sacrifice their \nown private pursuits for the good of the cause. Max has successfully \ndemonstrated that it is possible to be a strong leader and still remain \ntrue to one's passions. Max and his wife Gayla have been lifelong \nadvocates of giving back. Max has served on the boards of numerous \ncharitable organizations. Among them, he is particularly passionate \nabout helping children and animals. He currently serves as a board \nmember of the Cheyenne Animal Shelter and in the past has worked with \nthe Wyoming Congressional Award Program, Special Olympics, the Wyoming \nChildren's Society, and Laramie County United Way. Max and Gayla have \ntouched the lives of and positively impacted every person they have \nmet.\n  Max Maxfield has long been a trustee for Wyoming, and his leadership \nhas shaped the direction of our State. Indeed, Max and Gayla's \ncontributions have benefited not only the governance of Wyoming but \nevery community they have visited, every nonprofit organization they \nhave supported, every friend and stranger they have met, and certainly \nevery pet for which they have found a home. I trust that in his \nretirement Max will continue to remain active in the public sphere. \nWhile continuing to support causes that are near and dear to their \nhearts, Max and Gayla will enjoy quality time with their children, \ngrandchildren, and beloved golden retrievers.\n  My wife, Bobbi, and I are honored to thank him for his service to the \ngreat State of Wyoming. Even more, we are blessed to call him our \nfriend. Please join me in thanking Max Maxfield for his decades of \nservice and wishing him the best as he embarks on the next chapter of \nhis life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/08/senate-section/article/S6383-2", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6383]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO REBECCA HASLAM\n\n Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I wish to recognize a remarkable \nVermonter, Rebecca Haslam, who is the recipient of Vermont's 2015 \nTeacher of the Year Award.\n  This award is a testament to Rebecca's dedication to her students' \nacademic success and her work to promote the ideals of tolerance and \ndiversity throughout the Burlington School District. Rebecca's \nleadership in education has helped encourage intellectual and personal \ngrowth in so many students. She has earned the respect of the community \nthrough her diligence in the classroom and for her innovative approach \nto learning.\n  Ms. Haslam's commitment to her students is unwavering, ``They have \nsuch a love of learning and they are joyful when they come to school,'' \nshe explained recently. Rebecca provides a welcoming environment for \nstudents to learn, fostering their social, academic, and emotional \ndevelopment.\n  Ms. Haslam sets high expectations and provides the guidance needed in \nthe classroom to ensure the success of all her students. Rebecca is \ncommitted to providing both a rigorous curriculum and a nurturing \nenvironment. Her academic expectations inspire students of all \nbackgrounds and learning abilities to thrive.\n  Over the last few decades, Burlington's schools have welcomed \nstudents from all over the world, and for such a small city, the \ndistrict's classrooms are among the most diverse in the country. \nRebecca has drawn from her own childhood experiences in an effort to \nbuild bridges of understanding between students, faculty, and community \nmembers from different backgrounds. Rebecca serves as the Burlington \nSchool District's social studies and equity coach and works with \nteachers from around the district to incorporate the values of cultural \ncompetency in their lesson plans.

Mr. President, the Beatles' song ``Penny Lane'' \nopens with lyrics about ``a barber showing photographs/Of every head \nhe's had the pleasure to know/And all the people that come and go/Stop \nand say hello.'' They could have been describing my barber for over 30 \nyears, Simon Vincent Avara, or ``Cy,'' as he was known to everyone. Cy \npassed away this Saturday at the age of 81. I would like to take this \nopportunity to pay tribute to a good friend and amazing man.\n  One might say that Cy Avara was born to be a barber. His parents \nVincent and Mary were working class Italian-Americans. His father was a \nbarber but was killed in a car accident when Cy was just 14. That did \nnot deter Cy from following in his father's footsteps, however. He \nfound an opportunity apprenticing for another West Baltimore barber and \nby the time he was just 16, he passed the examination to receive his \nmaster license. He was one of the youngest barbers in Maryland. While \nhe was still 16, with just one year of high school under his belt, he \nopened his own barbershop with used equipment in a former funeral \nparlor. He charged 60 cents for a man's haircut and 40 cents for \nchildren.\n  A short time later, in 1953, Cy was drafted into the U.S. Army and \nhonorably served our Nation in the Korean War. When he returned to \ncivilian life, he attended cosmetology school--the\n\n[[Page S6384]]\n\nBaltimore Studio of Hair--to improve his skills when it came to cutting \nwomen's hair. As much as he enjoyed cutting and styling hair, however, \nhis greatest satisfaction came from teaching others the same skill and \ngiving people the chance to have a career and support themselves and \ntheir families. So Cy opened his own school in 1960, the Avara \nInternational Academy of Hair Design and Technology, in his southwest \nBaltimore neighborhood. That same year--when he was just 26--he also \nbecame a member of the Maryland State Board of Barber Examiners. A few \nyears later, he became the youngest person ever elected to be national \npresident of the Barber Examiners. He also served as secretary-\ntreasurer of all union-affiliated barber schools in America and was \npresident and founder of the Maryland Hair Designer's Association. In \n1970, Cy opened his second barber school, Avara's Academy Of Hair \nDesign, in Dundalk, MD. The two schools have trained well over 2,000 \nbarber/stylists. In 2011, Cy was inducted into the National Barber \nMuseum and Hall of Fame.\n  These accolades alone indicate that Cy lived a very successful life. \nBut there was so much more to Cy. As a child, Cy was raised by his \nparents to appreciate his blessings and to help others who were less \nfortunate. For instance, his father gave haircuts to people who wanted \nto make a good impression so they could get a job; his mother provided \nfood to those in need in their neighborhood. Cy never forgot these \nlessons in generosity. Starting in the mid-1960s, he became involved \nwith St. Vincent's Center for Abused Children. Since then, once every \nmonth, he sent his barber students to St. Vincent's Center to cut the \nchildren's hair. He has also been a major contributor to the Ed Block \nCourage Award Foundation, which was started by one of his former barber \nstudents, Sam Lamantia, to honor professional football players who have \novercome adversity and contributed to the betterment of their \ncommunity. In the mid-1970s, Cy established a training program at the \nMaryland Correctional Institution in Hagerstown under the supervision \nof a master barber which helped students at the Institution receive \ncredit toward the 1,200 hours required to obtain a license so that once \nthey were released, they would have the opportunity to continue their \ntraining and obtain a job in the barber industry. Cy also travelled to \nAnnapolis frequently to lobby on behalf of the integrity of the barber \nand cosmetology industry.\n  Cy was such an effective advocate for the industry that some of his \nchildren have followed in his footsteps. He saw his profession as a \nrewarding career opportunity for individuals from all walks of life. \nThe important thing is to like people and to want to work hard. That is \na pretty good description of Cy: he worked hard and he liked people, \nand made us feel welcome in his shop. But it was not hard work to him; \nit was his passion. He was extraordinarily skilled at his job.\n  I may have a little bit less hair than I did when I first started \ngoing to Cy, but I am going to miss my friend who served his country, \ncommunity, and family with such devotion. I am going to miss the \nspecial banter that may only occur between a barber and his long-time \ncustomers. I will take solace in the fact that there are literally \nthousands of barbers and stylists who were trained at one of Cy's \nschools and are carrying on the tradition he inherited from his father. \nOn behalf of the entire Senate, I would like to extend my condolences \nto his wife, Rita T. Avara; his sons, Michael, Thomas, and Lawrence; \nhis daughter, Susan Avara Watson; his sister, Carmelita Silanskas; his \neight grandchildren, Lauren, Michele, Rachael, Joshua, Victoria, \nJaclyn, Christopher, and Elise; and all the other family and friends of \nCy Avara too numerous to mention.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/08/senate-section/article/S6384-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6384-S6385]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:02 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 5759.

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Michigan urging the United \n     States Congress to direct the Comptroller General to complete \n     a full audit of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve \n     System and the federal reserve banks; to the Committee on \n     Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 395\n\n       Whereas, Created more than a hundred years ago, the Federal \n     Reserve is an independent federal agency. As leaders of the \n     central bank of the United States, the Federal Reserve's \n     board of governors have enacted monetary policy that \n     influences our nation's money and credit conditions, \n     supervised and regulated banks and other financial \n     institutions, and provided financial services to the U.S. and \n     foreign governments. Through these powers, and with the help \n     of the federal reserve banks, this agency has considerable \n     influence on the well-being of our nation's economy, the \n     economy of the world, and the day-to-day lives of people \n     everywhere; and\n       Whereas, American citizens have entrusted the Congress of \n     the United States with overseeing all federal agencies, and \n     Congress must hold the Federal Reserve accountable. However, \n     under the current law, the Comptroller General may audit the \n     Federal Reserve only if written consent has been given,\n\n[[Page S6388]]\n\n     and even then, the purview of audits of the board of \n     governors and federal reserve banks is limited. Under the \n     direction of the Comptroller General, any General \n     Accountability Office audit is prohibited by law from \n     auditing the board or federal reserve banks' transaction \n     history with foreign nations or information related to \n     monetary policy decisions, including discount window \n     operations, open market operations, securities credit, and \n     interest on deposits; and\n       Whereas, The American public should receive the \n     accountability and transparency they deserve from their \n     government. Providing the Comptroller General the authority \n     and directive to thoroughly audit the Federal Reserve will \n     allow for better oversight and lift the cloak of secrecy off \n     this highly-profitable and influential government \n     institution. Congress must take the actions necessary to \n     fulfill its oversight responsibility: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we urge the \n     Congress of the United States to direct the Comptroller \n     General to complete a full audit of the Board of Governors of \n     the Federal Reserve System and the federal reserve banks; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/08/senate-section/article/S6388-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6388]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. MENENDEZ, from the Committee on Foreign Relations, \n     with an amendment in the nature of a substitute:\n       S. 2946.

Mr. REID (for Mr. Menendez) proposed an amendment to the \nbill S. 2142, to impose targeted sanctions on persons responsible for \nviolations of human rights of antigovernment protesters in Venezuela, \nto strengthen civil society in Venezuela, and for other purposes; as \nfollows:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Venezuela Defense of Human \n     Rights and Civil Society Act of 2014''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Central Bank of Venezuela and the National \n     Statistical Institute of Venezuela stated that the annual \n     inflation rate in Venezuela in 2013 was 56.30, the highest \n     level of inflation in the Western Hemisphere and the third \n     highest level of inflation in the world behind South Sudan \n     and Syria.\n       (2) The Central Bank of Venezuela and the Government of \n     Venezuela have imposed a series of currency controls that has \n     exacerbated economic problems and, according to the World \n     Economic Forum, has become the most problematic factor for \n     doing business in Venezuela.\n       (3) The Central Bank of Venezuela declared that the \n     scarcity index of Venezuela reached 29.4 percent in March \n     2014, which signifies that fewer than one in 4 basic goods is \n     unavailable at any given time. The Central Bank has not \n     released any information on the scarcity index since that \n     time.\n       (4) Since 1999, violent crime in Venezuela has risen \n     sharply and the Venezuelan Violence Observatory, an \n     independent nongovernmental organization, found the national \n     per capita murder rate to be 79 per 100,000 people in 2013.\n       (5) The international nongovernmental organization Human \n     Rights Watch recently stated, ``Under the leadership of \n     President Chaavez and now President Maduro, the accumulation \n     of power in the executive branch and the erosion of human \n     rights guarantees have enabled the government to intimidate, \n     censor, and prosecute its critics.''.\n       (6) The Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2013 \n     of the Department of State maintained that in Venezuela ``the \n     government did not respect judicial independence or permit \n     judges to act according to the law without fear of \n     retaliation'' and ``the government used the judiciary to \n     intimidate and selectively prosecute political, union, \n     business, and civil society leaders who were critical of \n     government policies or actions''.\n       (7) The Government of Venezuela has detained foreign \n     journalists and threatened and expelled international media \n     outlets operating in Venezuela, and the international \n     nongovernmental organization Freedom House declared that \n     Venezuela's ``media climate is permeated by intimidation, \n     sometimes including physical attacks, and strong antimedia \n     rhetoric by the government is common''.\n       (8) Since February 4, 2014, the Government of Venezuela has \n     responded to antigovernment protests with violence and \n     killings perpetrated by its public security forces.\n       (9) In May 2014, Human Rights Watch found that the unlawful \n     use of force perpetrated against antigovernment protesters \n     was ``part of a systematic practice by the Venezuelan \n     security forces''.\n       (10) As of September 1, 2014, 41 people had been killed, \n     approximately 3,000 had been arrested unjustly, and more than \n     150 remained in prison and faced criminal charges as a result \n     of antigovernment demonstrations throughout Venezuela.\n       (11) Opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez was arrested on \n     February 18, 2014, in relation to the protests and was \n     unjustly charged with criminal incitement, conspiracy, arson, \n     and property damage. Since his arrest, Lopez has been held in \n     solitary confinement and has been denied 58 out of 60 of his \n     proposed witnesses at his ongoing trial.\n       (12) As of September 1, 2014, not a single member of the \n     public security forces of the Government of Venezuela had \n     been held accountable for acts of violence perpetrated \n     against antigovernment protesters.\n\n     SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING ANTIGOVERNMENT PROTESTS \n                   IN VENEZUELA AND THE NEED TO PREVENT FURTHER \n                   VIOLENCE IN VENEZUELA.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the United States aspires to a mutually beneficial \n     relationship with Venezuela based on respect for human rights \n     and the rule of law and a functional and productive \n     relationship on issues of public security, including \n     counternarcotics and counterterrorism;\n       (2) the United States supports the people of Venezuela in \n     their efforts to realize their full economic potential and to \n     advance representative democracy, human rights, and the rule \n     of law within their country;\n       (3) the chronic mismanagement by the Government of \n     Venezuela of its economy has produced conditions of economic \n     hardship and scarcity of basic goods and foodstuffs for the \n     people of Venezuela;\n       (4) the failure of the Government of Venezuela to guarantee \n     minimal standards of public security for its citizens has led \n     the country to become one of the most violent and corrupt in \n     the world;\n       (5) the Government of Venezuela continues to take steps to \n     remove checks and balances on the executive, politicize the \n     judiciary, undermine the independence of the legislature \n     through use of executive decree powers, persecute and \n     prosecute its political opponents, curtail freedom of the \n     press, and limit the free expression of its citizens;\n       (6) Venezuelans, responding to ongoing economic hardship, \n     high levels of crime and violence, and the lack of basic \n     political rights and individual freedoms, have turned out in \n     demonstrations in Caracas and throughout the country to \n     protest the failure of the Government of Venezuela to protect \n     the political and economic well-being of its citizens; and\n       (7) the repeated use of violence perpetrated by the \n     National Guard and security personnel of Venezuela, as well \n     as persons acting on behalf of the Government of Venezuela, \n     against antigovernment protesters\n\n[[Page S6390]]\n\n     that began on February 4, 2014, is intolerable and the use of \n     unprovoked violence by protesters is also a matter of serious \n     concern.\n\n     SEC. 4.

The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2142) to impose targeted sanctions on persons \n     responsible for violations of human rights of antigovernment \n     protesters in Venezuela, to strengthen civil society in \n     Venezuela, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nbill, which had been reported from the Committee on Foreign Relations, \nwith amendments; as follows:\n\n  (The part of the bill intended to be stricken is shown in boldface \nbrackets and the parts of the bill intended to be inserted are shown in \nitalic.)\n\n                                S. 2142\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Venezuela Defense of Human \n     Rights and Civil Society Act of 2014''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Central Bank of Venezuela and the National \n     Statistical Institute of Venezuela have stated that the \n     inflation rate in Venezuela was 56.30 percent in 2013, the \n     highest level of inflation in the Western Hemisphere and the \n     third highest level of inflation in the world behind South \n     Sudan and Syria.\n       (2) The Central Bank of Venezuela and the Government of \n     Venezuela have imposed a series of currency controls that has \n     exacerbated economic problems and, according to the World \n     Economic Forum, has become the most problematic factor for \n     doing business in Venezuela.\n       (3) The Central Bank of Venezuela and the National \n     Statistical Institute of Venezuela have declared that the \n     scarcity index of Venezuela reached 28 percent in December \n     2013, which signifies that one in 4 basic goods is \n     unavailable at any given time.\n       (4) Since 1999, violent crime in Venezuela has risen \n     sharply and the Venezuelan Violence Observatory, an \n     independent nongovernmental organization, found the national \n     per capita murder rate to be 79 per 100,000 people in 2013.\n       (5) The international nongovernmental organization Human \n     Rights Watch recently stated, ``Under the leadership of \n     President Chaavez and now President Maduro, the accumulation \n     of power in the executive branch and the erosion of human \n     rights guarantees have enabled the government to intimidate, \n     censor, and prosecute its critics.''.\n       (6) The Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2013 \n     of the Department of State maintained that in Venezuela ``the \n     government did not respect judicial independence or permit \n     judges to act according to the law without fear of \n     retaliation'' and ``the government used the judiciary to \n     intimidate and selectively prosecute political, union, \n     business, and civil society leaders who were critical of \n     government policies or actions''.\n       (7) The Government of Venezuela has detained foreign \n     journalists and threatened and expelled international media \n     outlets operating in Venezuela, and the international \n     nongovernmental organization Freedom House declared that \n     Venezuela's ``media climate is permeated by intimidation, \n     sometimes including physical attacks, and strong antimedia \n     rhetoric by the government is common''.\n       (8) Since February 4, 2014, the Government of Venezuela has \n     responded to antigovernment protests with violence and \n     killings perpetrated by public security forces, and by \n     arresting and unjustly charging opposition leader Leopoldo \n     Lopes with criminal incitement, conspiracy, arson, and intent \n     to damage property.\n       (9) As of March 13, 2014, 23 people had been killed, more \n     than 100 people had been injured, and dozens had been \n     unjustly detained as a result of antigovernment \n     demonstrations throughout Venezuela.\n\n     SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING ANTIGOVERNMENT PROTESTS \n                   IN VENEZUELA AND THE NEED TO PREVENT FURTHER \n                   VIOLENCE IN VENEZUELA.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the United States aspires to a mutually beneficial \n     relationship with Venezuela based on respect for human rights \n     and the rule of law and a functional and productive \n     relationship on issues of public security, including \n     counternarcotics and counterterrorism;\n       (2) the United States supports the people of Venezuela in \n     their efforts to realize their full economic potential and to \n     advance representative democracy, human rights, and the rule \n     of law within their country;\n       (3) the chronic mismanagement by the Government of \n     Venezuela of its economy has produced conditions of economic \n     hardship and scarcity of basic goods and foodstuffs for the \n     people of Venezuela;\n       (4) the failure of the Government of Venezuela to guarantee \n     minimal standards of public security for its citizens has led \n     the country to become one of the most violent in the world;\n       (5) the Government of Venezuela continues to take steps to \n     remove checks and balances on the executive, politicize the \n     judiciary, undermine the independence of the legislature \n     through use of executive decree powers, persecute and \n     prosecute its political opponents, curtail freedom of the \n     press, and limit the free expression of its citizens;\n       (6) the people of Venezuela, responding to ongoing economic \n     hardship, high levels of\n\n[[Page S6397]]\n\n     crime and violence, and the lack of basic political rights \n     and individual freedoms, have turned out in demonstrations in \n     Caracas and throughout the country to protest the inability \n     of the Government of Venezuela to ensure the political and \n     economic well-being of its citizens; and\n       (7) the repeated use of violence perpetrated by the \n     National Guard and security personnel of Venezuela, as well \n     as persons acting on behalf of the Government of Venezuela, \n     in relation to the antigovernment protests that began on \n     February 4, 2014, is intolerable and the use of unprovoked \n     violence by protesters is also a matter of serious concern.\n\n     SEC. 4. UNITED STATES POLICY TOWARD VENEZUELA.\n\n       It is the policy of the United States--\n       (1) to support the people of Venezuela in their aspiration \n     to live under conditions of peace and representative \n     democracy as defined by the Inter-American Democratic Charter \n     of the Organization of American States;\n       (2) to work in concert with the other member states within \n     the Organization of American States, as well as the countries \n     of the European Union, to ensure the peaceful resolution of \n     the current situation in Venezuela and the immediate \n     cessation of violence against antigovernment protestors;\n       (3) to hold accountable government and security officials \n     in Venezuela responsible for or complicit in the use of force \n     in relation to the antigovernment protests that began on \n     February 4, 2014, and similar future acts of violence; and\n       (4) to continue to support the development of democratic \n     political processes and independent civil society in \n     Venezuela.\n\n     SEC. 5.
