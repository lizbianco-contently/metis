Mr. President, I returned from Nevada this Sunday. On \nSaturday I had a briefing by the head of the Forest Service in Nevada. \nWe thought things were going very well with the fires in Nevada, and \nthey were. Progress was being made--limited but progress was being \nmade. But since that time the fires have gotten much worse.\n  Not everyone can see this, but I have a picture--of course, I didn't \nget this until early this morning and didn't have a chance to enlarge \nit so we could put it on an easel--but this is the beginning of the Las \nVegas strip. This is downtown Las Vegas. It is called the Carpenter \nfire. You can see it burning.\n  It is only about 10 miles from Las Vegas, maybe 12 at the most. We \ncan see Mount Charleston, a 12,000-foot mountain. The flames are \nshooting above that. We don't get many clouds in southern Nevada, but \nthe smoke cloud here is intense. One of my staff indicated that where \nshe lives it is raining ash. This is a very devastating fire, and the \nfirefighters are doing the very best they can in a very difficult \nsituation.\n  My thoughts go out to the thousands who have been evacuated from \ntheir homes in southern Nevada's Mount Charleston area--I think \nhundreds would be a better way to say this. Out where the Carpenter 1 \nfire is, as it is called, it has burned more than 30 square miles of \nforest and desert.\n  My heart goes out to the first responders. They are working very hard \nin extremely rugged terrain. They are doing a lot in the air with \nhelicopters and large airplanes. A couple of areas have been saved \nbecause these firefighters have been able to cut waves so the flames \ndon't jump over into these houses. Yesterday the wind changed, and one \nof the roads going up to Mount Charleston, Kyle Canyon--it jumped that \nroad, burning there, getting closer to some of the homes we are so \nconcerned about.\n  Lives have been saved as a result of what the firefighters are doing. \nThey have been working around the clock to contain the blaze and \nprotect their communities. Unfortunately, this is southern Nevada where \nwe had heat last week virtually every day of 112 to 117 degrees. It is \nhot in Las Vegas without this fire; we don't get much rain. In the \nentire year we get 4 inches of rain. The summer heat, these dry \nconditions, and the winds are really working against the firefighters, \nbut they are working very hard.\n  The progress we were making was erased yesterday. The fire jumped \nKyle Canyon Road, as I said, and spread to new forest and new desert \nland. We thought everyone would be able to return to their homes in \nKyle Canyon yesterday, but with the fire having spread the way it did, \nwe hope they can get back in their homes soon. We have had a number of \nhotels in Las Vegas that allowed people who have been displaced to have \nfree lodging.\n  As I indicated, smoke can be seen everyplace. We have 2 million \npeople now in Las Vegas. Everybody can see the fire. These flames, one \ncan see them well over the 12,000-foot mountain.\n  The Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service are all working \nwith other Federal agencies and State agencies. They are assisting \nfirefighters in\n\n[[Page S5584]]\n\ncontaining the blaze and helping residents to move.\n  There is also a fire burning in Reno, south of Reno. It is called the \nBison fire. It is the largest fire ever recorded in western Nevada. \nPeople have been--especially in the Pipeline Canyon area--urged to \nevacuate. I am going to continue to monitor both of these fires because \nthey are disasters.\n  I appreciate all the work done at the State level. My office has \nextended support to Governor Sandoval to do everything we can to assist \nthe State in anything they need, and I will do everything I can to \nensure every Federal resource that is available will be made available \nto support local officials and fire crews.\n  There are currently more than 20 active fires in 11 States, including \nNevada's neighbors: California--and we all know about the fire in \nArizona, but there are others--Oregon, Idaho, and Utah. There are \nthousands of firefighters working around the clock to save lives and to \nsave property. I will do everything I can, I repeat, to help them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/10/senate-section/article/S5584-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             STUDENT LOANS\n\n  Mr. REID. In a couple of hours we will vote on whether to begin \ndebate on our plan to keep loan rates low for students for an \nadditional year. Last month Republican obstruction forced interest \nrates to double from 3.4 percent to 6 percent for about 7 million \ncollege students.\n  If we fail to roll back this increase, those students will each pile \non lots of new debt to get a college education. These rates will be \nparticularly harmful to low- and middle-income families that rely on \nthese Federal loans more than anyone else.\n  We have the Pell grants, which go to low-income people, but people \nwho are middle class have to do these loans; schools have become so \nexpensive. States have cut back on the support they give to colleges, \nso this is a very difficult situation.\n  Students shouldn't suffer because some Senators are standing in the \nway of that compromise. That is why we have proposed a 1-year extension \nof last year's 3.4 percent rate. We don't want it to double. The \nextension will allow us to craft a long-term solution to mounting \ncollege debt without harming students in the short term. However, a \nnumber of Senators met at my direction this morning at 9 o'clock, and \nthere is progress being made. Maybe we can come up with a compromise. \nIt will be imperfect, like a lot of things that happen legislatively, \nbut it will be a way for us to move forward. The meeting went very \nwell. It was done in Senator Durbin's office. Democrats and Republicans \nattended that meeting. I think we are making some progress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/10/senate-section/article/S5584-2", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5584-S5602]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      KEEP STUDENT LOANS AFFORDABLE ACT OF 2013--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  Mr. REID. I move to proceed to Calendar No. 124, S. 1238, Senator \nReed's student loan bill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the bill by \ntitle.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1238) to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 \n     to extend the current reduced interest rate for undergraduate \n     Federal Direct Stafford Loans for 1 year, to modify required \n     distribution rules for pension plans, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, following the remarks of Senator McConnell, \nthe time until noon will be equally divided and controlled between the \ntwo leaders, with each Senator permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes \neach.\n  At noon there will be a cloture vote on the motion to proceed on S. \n1238, the student loan bill.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. For more than a month, I have been coming to the floor \nto talk about student loan reform. I have said that to an outside \nobserver, this is an issue that should have been an easy bipartisan \nslam dunk. I have noted that the proposals put forward by both \nPresident Obama and congressional Republicans have been strikingly \nsimilar. We both agree on the need for a permanent reform, and we agree \non the need to help all students and not just some of them. Yet here we \nare after the July 1 deadline and Democrats are still blocking \nbipartisan student loan reform.\n  You have to ask yourself why. It is because they have prioritized \npolitics over helping students. There are basically two different \nDemocratic groups battling for supremacy: a more responsible reform-\npermanently faction and a more political campaign-permanently faction.\n  In the first group are the sensible Democratic Senators who agree \nwith both President Obama and Republicans that it is time to finally \nsolve this issue. Washington should actually help students and stop \nusing them as pawns in a political chess match. They support the \nbipartisan compromise plan put forward by Democratic, Republican, and \nIndependent Senators alike.\n  Unfortunately, this faction is opposed and outnumbered by the \ncampaign-permanently Democrats. They are the ones whom I suspect would \nactually prefer to see rates lapse so they can manufacture another \ncampaign issue. To hear the musings of some top Democrats, one would \nhave to conclude that the Democratic leadership is on the side of \ncampaigning permanently and against helping students.\n  As the majority leader put it a few weeks ago: ``[We're] not looking \nfor compromise.''\n  Another Democratic Senator in leadership boasted a goal in this \ndebate was to show ``the difference between the two parties on a key \nissue.''\n  I mean, this is just the kind of thing that makes people so cynical \nabout Washington. Washington Democrats yell and wave their arms about \nthe need for something, and then they appear to do everything possible \nbehind the scenes to sabotage it, apparently so they can manufacture a \npolitically convenient crisis. They are doing it on student loans, and \nthey have been doing it with nominations too.\n  All week it seems they have been breathlessly telling any reporter \nwho will listen that we have a nominations crisis around here; that \nRepublicans are holding up the President's nominees. It is really \nlaughable.\n  To hear some of the over-the-top rhetoric, one would think \nRepublicans have blocked all of the President's second-term Cabinet \nnominees. But then, of course, you would be entirely wrong.\n  The truth is, since the President swore his oath of office in \nJanuary, the Senate has confirmed every single Cabinet pick that has \nbeen brought up for a vote--every single one of them.\n  Let me repeat that. Every single one that has been brought up for a \nvote, all of them have been confirmed. Many of them have been confirmed \non unanimous or nearly unanimous votes. Yesterday, the ranking \nRepublican on the Environment and Public Works Committee announced his \nsupport for an up-or-down vote on Gina McCarthy's nomination to be EPA \nAdministrator. So there is no question she is going to be confirmed.\n\n  It is clear that facts are getting in the way of the Democrats' \narguments, which is why they are forced to gin up this fake--absolutely \nfake--nominations ``crisis.'' It is why we see them bringing out all \nthe nominees who have been appointed to office either illegally or who \nare exceedingly controversial. Democrats themselves have delayed \nconsideration of these nominees literally for months--because the \nmajority leader determines the timing--so they could pull them all out \nof the woodwork at the same time, in the hopes the Senate would reject \nthem.\n  Democrats are out there daring the Senate to do it. They want it so \nbadly it appears to be their goal. And there is a reason for this. It \nis because the far-left base seems to be getting fed up with the \ndemocratic process. The big labor bosses are sick of waiting for the \nspecial interest legislative kickbacks they must feel they are owed, \nand now they know that altering the rules of our democracy is the only \nway to get what they want.\n  This isn't going to work. The facts show the truth, and the truth is \nthat any crisis over nominations is a crisis of Washington Democrats' \nown making--one they have stirred up intentionally--an absolutely \nmanufactured crisis by any objective analysis.\n  As of last night, there were 140 nominees pending in various \ncommittees.\n\n[[Page S5585]]\n\nThese nominees are under the control of the majority, not us. And there \nare a little over two dozen or so eligible for expedited floor \nconsideration, many of whom Republicans have already said we would pass \nunanimously. Why hasn't the majority leader called for votes on any of \nthese folks? Clearly, if anyone is obstructing here, it is the majority \nleader, because this whole conversation isn't about making the Senate \nwork better, and he knows it. It is all about his power grab. Well, let \nme caution him again to think long and hard about what he is doing.\n  As one of the most senior members of the Democratic Party said \nyesterday, deploying the nuclear option would mean breaking the rules \nto change the rules--breaking the rules to change the rules. As the \nmajority leader himself once said, it would ``ruin our country.'' And \nwe all know why. Once the trigger is pulled, there would be no limit to \nthe consequences, not just for Republicans or for our country but for \nDemocrats too. They should think very carefully about the ramifications \nfor them when a future Republican President makes his own appointments \nto the Cabinet and to the Federal bench.\n  Look, we know Senate Democrats are not serious about implementing \nstudent loan reform. They have already demonstrated that by blocking \njust about every bipartisan effort to do so. But on the nuclear option, \nit is certainly my hope that cooler heads will prevail. I have to \nbelieve they will choose the long-term health of our democracy and of \ntheir party over what frankly amounts to the narrowest--the narrowest--\nof short-term political considerations. Pulling the nuclear trigger is \nnot something the history books will look favorably on, and they know \nit. And, of course, there will be consequences.\n  When the President was in the Senate back in 2005, and the then-\nRepublican majority was thinking about something akin to this, this is \nwhat the President had to say. ``If they choose to change the rules and \nput an end to the democratic debate, then the fighting, the bitterness, \nand the gridlock will only get worse.'' The President was entirely \ncorrect.\n  Senator Reid said in 2009, a couple of years ago, ``There is no way I \nwould employ the use of the nuclear option. No way.'' He said it would \n``ruin our country.'' He said, ``It would have destroyed the Senate as \nwe know it.''\n  Hopefully, that was not then and there is some different standard \nnow. And, of course, we know we had this debate at the beginning of the \nyear. Actually, we have had it at the beginning of the last two \nCongresses, and the Senate--the occupant of the Chair had newly arrived \nhere--voted on two rules changes and two standing orders, after which \nthe majority leader said, ``The rules issue for this Congress is \nover.''\n  He gave his word in January of this year. We are waiting to see if \nthat word will be kept.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nleadership time is reserved.\n\n\n                           Order of Business\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 12 p.m. will be equally divided and controlled between the two \nleaders or their designees, with Senators permitted to speak for up to \n10 minutes each.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about the \nfuture of student loans for America's students. When I say students, I \nhave to define who that is because, as we know, today we have students \nof all ages.\n  We have a category of students where a financial impact requirement \nis applied, such as for a 19-year-old who has entered their freshman \nyear, and depending upon where the income of their family is, under the \ncurrent system they may get a subsidized loan. The maximum they can \nreceive under that subsidized loan as an undergraduate is $3,500.\n  I would be willing to bet the President pro tempore and I both can't \npick an institution in any of our States where the tuition on an annual \nbasis is $3,500. It doesn't happen today, and that is the reality that \nhas been left out of the debate so far. This debate has been all about \npolitics and it has not been about students and how to apply \naffordability as broadly as we can in the marketplace.\n  Let me describe where we are today. Between 1965 and 1992 the cap on \nthe student loan program in this country was 10 percent--10 percent. In \nthe mid-2000s, Congress, very politically, said: You know what. We are \ngoing to adjust it, and subsidized loans are going to be at 3.4 percent \nand nonsubsidized loans are going to be at 6.8 percent, graduate loans \nare going to be at 7.9 percent, and if you are a parent borrowing, you \nare going to have an even higher rate, in the 8-plus percent range.\n  That strikes me as incredibly unfair. We are taking two \nundergraduates--two 19-year-old freshmen--entering the same institution \nwith the same financial obligation and we are saying to one: We are \ngoing to give you a rate on your student loan that is half of the \nperson who sits in the seat next to you--half. In this chair, the \nstudent will pay 3.4 percent, and the student sitting in the chair next \nto him will pay 6.8 percent. Understand, the parents of the person \nsitting in this chair, depending upon the cost of the institution, may \nhave an income over $100,000. Yet they may qualify for a Federal \nsubsidy.\n  Let me suggest to you that the marketplace is the thing that ought to \ndictate and decide what the rate is. That is the only thing that is \nfair to the taxpayers in this country--the predictability of knowing it \nis tied to something.\n  Let me suggest that the bill we are going to take up--and we are \ngoing to vote on a motion to proceed at 12 noon today--is a bill that \nwas created in the 2000s. Two years ago we kicked the can down the road \nand said we are going to extend this inequitable student loan program \nat 3.4 percent for some, 6.8 percent for others, 7.9 percent, and 8-\nplus percent for parents. Why? Because we are overcharging some to \nsubsidize others. Let me say that again. We are overcharging some--we \nare overcharging some 19-year-old undergraduate freshmen in college--at \n6.8 percent so they will subsidize the 3.4 percent we are charging on \nthe subsidized loans.\n  Let me point to a chart I have here which shows undergraduates under \nthe student loan program. This is a comparison. Actually, let me move \nto a different chart, because this one best displays what I am talking \nabout.\n  Twenty-six percent of our Nation's kids are undergraduates and are \nsubsidized, and 55 percent of the eligible students are either \nundergraduates or graduate students who fall under a 6.8-percent \ninterest rate. So when the Senate majority leader came to the floor and \nsaid some were upstairs trying to negotiate a deal, he was 100-percent \naccurate. But the reality is we are still only going to have a vote on \none plan at 12 o'clock. There is no option for Members of Congress.\n  What I would suggest is that this displays why, at best, there should \nbe two options and, at worst, we ought to vitiate the motion to proceed \nand see if we can come up with another bipartisan agreement.\n  You see, another option--the Manchin bill--is a bipartisan approach.\n  It is Democrats and Republicans coming together and saying we can \nagree on something that we think is fair and equitable and financially \nsustainable.\n  But this is the plan we are going to have a vote on at 12. Fifty-five \npercent of the population of students, quite frankly, are being \nscrewed. They are overpaying. They are paying 6.8 percent for interest, \nwhen a home mortgage for 15 years is 3.8 percent. Yet we are charging \nstudents 6.8 percent, and we are saying that to go to this is an \ninjustice to our students, where all of a sudden we take 64 percent of \nthe kids and we treat them all alike and we charge them 3.66 percent. \nSomething is inherently wrong in the debate we are having.\n  If this is about kids and about affordability, this is the plan on \nwhich we\n\n[[Page S5586]]\n\nshould be having the motion to proceed, not this one. This plan merely \nkicks the can down the road for 12 more months.\n  Let me say this plan wasn't created by Joe Manchin or Richard Burr or \nTom Coburn or Senator King or Senator Alexander. This plan was created \nby the Congressional Budget Office. The Congressional Budget Office in \ntheir March 2011 report to Congress came up with the idea of tying the \ninterest rate to the 10-year Treasury bond, except the CBO says it \nshould be the 10-year Treasury bond plus 3 percent. That is what \nSenator Coburn and I introduced. When Senator Manchin, Senator King, \nSenator Alexander, Senator Carper, and others got involved, we decided \nwhat we needed to do was continue to have a blended rate. We all agreed \nthat an undergraduate student shouldn't face an interest rate schedule \nthat is not equitable to all undergraduates.\n  So instead of applying it to 26 percent, we applied it to 100 percent \nof the undergraduates. We said: If you are an undergraduate in college, \nwe are going to give you the best rate, which is the 10-year bond plus \n1.85. It is fair. It is understandable. It is predictable. It is \nconsistent. One year in advance you know exactly what your rate is \ngoing to be because it is determined on the 10-year bond every May.\n  My good friend Senator Harkin, whom I have great affection for, came \nto the floor and said we were balancing the budget on the back of the \nstudent loan program. The student loan program is a $1.3 trillion \nprogram. Based upon the CBO score on this bill, it had a 0.7-percent \nsurplus. By Washington standards, in a $1 billion program, 0.7 would be \na rounding error. This is a $1.3 trillion program. Let me assure the \nPresident and my colleagues, this is a rounding error. I can't look \neverybody in the face and say it might not cost us $100 billion. It \nmight save us $100 billion. But we are certainly not balancing a $17 \ntrillion deficit debt on the back of the student loan program. Let me \nassure you of that, and for any who suggest we are, that is, in fact, \ndisingenuous.\n  This is the first time I have been accused of balancing the budget on \nthe backs of our kids. But in 2010, as part of the health care reform \nact, Democrats ended the Federal Family Education Loan Program, FFEL, \nat a savings of $61 billion. Of that, the Democrats directed $19 \nbillion to deficit reduction and the rest to help pay for ObamaCare, \nthe Affordable Care Act.\n  If I am being accused of balancing the budget on 0.7 percent, \ndetermined by CBO, and in 2010 the Democrats voted to eliminate the \nFFEL Program and save $61 billion and applied $19 billion to deficit \nreduction and the rest to help the Affordable Care Act, then they \nplowed this ground long before I did.\n  As a matter of fact, in 2007, as part of the College Cost Reduction \nand Access Act, the Democrats found $21 billion in savings and spent a \ngood amount of it on new programs--and then directed $1 billion to \ndeficit reduction.\n  I said earlier, I have great affection for Senator Harkin. Senator \nHarkin said this should be part of the Higher Education Reauthorization \nAct--that may or may not happen next year.\n  We made changes to the interest rate on student loans outside of the \nhigher education reauthorization in 2012 with a 1-year extension of the \n3.4 percent. We did it in 2010 with the elimination of the FFEL \nProgram. We did it in 2005 under the CCRAA, the Deficit Reduction Act. \nSenator Harkin's Appropriations Committee has made changes to the \neligibility rules for Pell grants each of the past several years \noutside of the higher education authorization, including the \nelimination of summer eligibility, ability to benefit, and lowering of \nthe automatic enrollment for low-income students.\n  It is not fair to come and say to me that I am doing it outside of \nhigher education reauthorization when there is continually a track \nrecord of the person who accused us of doing it of doing it himself.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BURR. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I thank the good Senator for working in such a \nbipartisan manner. I think this truly is a bipartisan bill.\n  This bill has been described as belonging to one party or the other, \nand that is wrong. Senator Burr, Senator Alexander, Senator Coburn, \nSenator King, Senator Carper, and I sat down and looked at how we could \nfix something. We looked at it from the standpoint that this deadline \nhas hit. One year ago we extended it. They said it was the political \natmosphere and we had to extend it. We knew that year would come and, \nsimilar to everything else that has happened here for the last 2 or 3 \nyears, nothing gets done. We just said: Enough is enough. It has to be \nfixed, and if we want to fix it, to understand the program, we have to \nlook at the whole program.\n  I think now they are making accusations that students are paying \nprofits so we can pay down the debt. Whether there is profit built in \ndepends on the accounting procedures used by our Federal Government. It \nwas built in. You can blame whomever you want to blame, but it is built \ninto it. We have to deal with the facts in front of us.\n  What I would ask the Senator, all of us have agreed in a bipartisan \nmanner that no profit will be made on the backs of students, what we \ncan determine through the bill we are working on, right?\n  Mr. BURR. That is 100 percent correct.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. So we have all come to that agreement--Democrats and \nRepublicans--no profit in debt reduction. It should go to lowering the \nrate.\n  Mr. BURR. That is correct.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. We agreed on that. We have agreed on a long-term fix, 10 \nyears, rather than kicking it down the road another year, knowing \nanother year will come and go and we are probably going to be standing \nhere debating. That is the conclusion we have come to, which is \ndifferent than what the House sent us. I applaud the Senator for \nworking with us to put in a fixed rate.\n  So if it is at 3.66 this year and I am able to qualify and I am \nsubsidized at $3,500 of a subsidized loan the taxpayer will be paying, \nthat 3.66 is fixed for the full life of the loan. We agreed on that, \ncorrect?\n  Mr. BURR. That is correct.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. So when they say it is a Republican bill or a Democratic \nbill, that is erroneous. That is not fair. This is truly a bipartisan \neffort, and we are working with all of our colleagues in my caucus--and \nI know the Senator is in his caucus--to understand that if I have a \nsubsidized Stafford loan, that means the Federal Government--the \ntaxpayers of this country--will pay my interest while I am in school, \ncorrect?\n  Mr. BURR. That is correct.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. At the end of that, then I pick up whatever interest \nrate has accumulated while I was in school, and I take it from that day \nforward.\n  What I think a lot of our colleagues don't understand, I can't make \nit just on that $3,500. I have to borrow more money. So now, if I go \nwith my colleagues on the Democratic side, if I borrow more money, I \nhave to borrow that at 6.8 percent.\n  We were able, in a bipartisan way, to bring that to 3.66 percent for \nall undergraduates, correct?\n  Mr. BURR. The Senator is correct. I might add to my good friend, this \nchart shows exactly what we talked about. Under the plan on which we \nwill vote at 12, because of the need for students in the subsidized \ncategory to borrow additional money at 6.8 percent, at the end of their \nprocess, they owe $78 a month, where under the bipartisan bill, where \nevery undergraduate is treated the same, they owe $75. It is actually \ncheaper, even for the undergrads who are subsidized.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. So the money I would have to borrow, even though I \nqualify because of my income for a subsidized loan, I don't have to pay \nthe interest on an annual basis. So by bringing it down to one low \nrate, I am making much lower payments. So that is less obligation and \nless hardship on me as a college student to make that lower payment \nthan it would be to make that higher payment.\n  We want to help the subsidized, very poor kids. I might be poor, but \nI can't make it on just what you give me because I am poor. I have to \nhave a little more help. Then, on top of that, I want to go to graduate \nschool after I get my college degree. So then I am at 6.8 again. Ours \nbrings it down to 5.21, which is more savings, which I know the Senator \nagrees to.\n  If I may ask my colleague from Tennessee, right now we know we have a\n\n[[Page S5587]]\n\nconsolidated cap at 8.25 percent. Let's say I graduate and I went to \nschool during the high recession times. At the end, I have an 8.75-\npercent accumulative interest I owe. I can cap that and consolidate at \n8.25, correct?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, if I may respond to the Senator from \nWest Virginia.\n  First, I wish to congratulate Senators Manchin and Burr for helping \nthe full Senate understand this issue. This is similar to a lot of \nissues we have to face. They are not simple. I used to be a college \npresident and the U.S. Secretary of Education. I had to re-educate \nmyself on this legislation. I still made some mistakes.\n  I was saying last night, for example, that there were only 2 million \nsubsidized loans. What I was forgetting was the point that the Senator \nfrom West Virginia makes, which is that 80 percent of the students who \nhave subsidized loans, the low-income students, also have unsubsidized \nloans. So when we only take care of these subsidized loans, we are \nleaving 7 million students with unsubsidized loans out here hanging \nhigh and dry, and nobody is taking care of them. So we are hurting both \nthe middle-class families and the low-income families when we have an \nincomplete solution.\n  The Senator from West Virginia posed a question. Let's say I \ngraduated from the University of Tennessee and I had two loans; I had a \nsubsidized loan, which means the government paid my interest while I \nwas in college. Typically, if I am similar to four out of five \nstudents, I also had an unsubsidized loan, so I accrued that interest. \nSuddenly the interest rates have gone up for me because the country's \ninterest rates have gone up to 10 percent. What I can do is take all my \ngovernment loans at once and turn them into an 8.25-percent loan. So \nthat is, in effect, a cap on my loan, and then I would have the choice.\n  I would say this to the Senators from West Virginia and North \nCarolina. I have heard some Senators say that when I consolidate my \nloan at 8.25 percent, that means the student is going to have to pay a \nlot of interest because it spreads the loan out over a long period of \ntime.\n  But does not the student have that choice? Isn't it similar to a 15-\nyear mortgage, where you have higher monthly payments, but you pay less \ninterest because you pay it off quicker?\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I think what they are referring to--and I might have \nmisunderstood, but I think I am accurate on this. Everyone will take \nthe loans for the longest period of time, and I just got out of school \nso I want the smallest payment. Four or five years out I have a better \njob. Instead of paying $150 a month, I can afford to pay $300 or $400.\n  There is no penalty for me to shorten that, as it would be in a \nconventional market. Is that how the Senator understands it?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask consent that the Senators from \nNorth Carolina and West Virginia and I be permitted to engage in a \ncolloquy for a few minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. That is how I understand it. I would say to the \nSenator from North Carolina,--I would presume a graduate of the \nUniversity of North Carolina would be smart enough to make that \ndecision for herself or himself?\n  Mr. BURR. I think they would. I think one of the agreements we came \nto was that students ought to be in control of their decision about \ntheir loan rate based upon what is available to them. If students go \nthrough the next 4 years and they have a combined interest rate of \nabout 4.5 percent for the life of the loan, why in the world would they \nbe excited at 8.25? If for some reason 10 years from now somebody got \nout of school and their combined interest rate was 9 percent, we give \nthem the option of going back to 8.25.\n  I think the Senator from West Virginia made an extremely good point. \nFor the most subsidized students, they can only borrow $3,500. Think of \nthe institutions that are out there--none of them have an annual \ntuition of $3,500. We know they are going to borrow out of the 6.8-\npercent pot. What we are offering is that the pots are the same and \nthat the subsidy is that--for students who qualify for the subsidy--\nthey are not responsible for the interest rate while they are in \nschool. That subsidy still exists. It is just that we are not \novercharging one group and we are certainly not overcharging the ones \nwe just subsidized because they have to borrow more money to complete \ntheir college education.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. To both of my friends, let me say that I graduate from \ncollege--no matter what the interest rates are, no matter what they \nmight have been--I graduate and economic times are tough. I find a job \nthat is not what I think my value is, but I find a job at $40,000--\n$40,000. I am married now, and I have a child or two. Don't we have in \nour bill a protection which has been in place for a long time--both \nDemocrats and Republicans have supported this protection--which is \ncalled income-based repayment? By law, I can only pay 15 percent of my \ndisposable income. I think that breaks down to my payment can only be \n$142. Isn't that a subsidy too? Wouldn't we be subsidizing that to an \nextent? I am also understanding that if my economic condition does not \nimprove and that is all I pay, by the end of 25 years it is exonerated. \nI pay nothing. I am done.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. If I could respond to the Senator who suggested \nthat,--the answer is yes. I think it is fair to say that the \nconsolidation option that a student has in case the rates go up, at \n8.25 percent can be called a cap. It is not a hard cap, but it is a \ncap. And the second cap is the income repayment provision of which the \nSenator speaks. If you are making $40,000 a year, after they apply the \nformula you probably are not spending more than about 10 percent of \nyour income--it is something called disposable income--to pay for your \nstudent loan. Loan repayment then continues for about 20 years. If at \nthe end of 20 years you have not paid your loan off, the loan is \nforgiven.\n  Any student who has a loan has that opportunity. They can consolidate \nat 8.25 percent, and income repayment limits the amount they have to \npay each year. So they have that.\n  One of the things I noticed about the Manchin-Burr bill that I would \nlike to ask the Senators to talk about is that you have come up with--\nwhat I am beginning to understand, as I study this more and more--a \nvery significant contribution: the idea that all of the undergraduate \nstudent loans--which, as I understand it, are about two out of three of \nthe loans--should have the same interest rate. First, it is confusing \nthe way undergraduate loan interest rates are now, but the other reason \nis that about 80 percent of the people who have subsidized loans, the \nlow-income students, also have unsubsidized loans. So your contribution \nis to say: Let's simplify it, provide certainty over a long period of \ntime, and treat all undergraduates the same. Otherwise, it seems to me, \nyou are leaving 7 million middle-income students who have unsubsidized \nloans high and dry, and the 80 percent of the low-income students who \nalso have these unsubsidized loans, you are not helping them either.\n  I wonder if the Senator could comment on this idea? I notice, without \na cap, you are able to get the interest rate for all undergraduate \nloans down to about 3.66 percent, which is a pretty low rate.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Let me say very quickly--and I will use $10 million \nhypothetically that is borrowed every year--$10 billion, $10 million, \nwhatever you want to use--25 percent of that money goes to the \nsubsidized, just 25 percent. I understand that it is close to about 40 \npercent of the students who participate in borrowing money, but the \nvolume of money is about 25 percent, one-fourth of the money that is \nloaned out. So if we are keeping the rates low on one-fourth of the \nmoney, that means we artificially have much higher rates on three-\nfourths of the money students need to get an education.\n  What we are saying is that we are going to bring a larger majority of \nthat down to the lowest rate. We think it is a good policy that we \nshould be discussing and talking about. That is where we are. That is \nwhy we came up with the plan we did, but we reduced all the rates. The \nPLUS loans I think went from 7.9 to 6.21, yes, and then the graduate \nloans went from 6.8 to 5.21.\n\n[[Page S5588]]\n\nBut if you do all of the undergraduate, it would go from 3.4 to 3.66, a \nquarter and a point--.26.\n  Mr. BURR. The most significant part is for the undergraduates who \nwere not subsidized, they would go from 6.8 to 3.6.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Right. Right.\n  Mr. BURR. This goes to the heart of what the Senator from Tennessee \nsaid. Today the subsidy goes to 26 percent of our students; 55 percent \npay the 6.8 rate. Under the bipartisan bill, 64 percent--all \nundergraduates--get 3.66.\n  If this is about affordability, if this is about what provides the \ngreatest flexibility for students to afford it, then the answer is \nclear. It is on the chart. But it also computes in the monthly payments \nto which students are obligated. The fact is that for a typical student \nin their first year, taking $5,000 out, $3,500 comes from the subsidy--\n$5,500 out, $3,500 comes from the subsidy, $2,000 comes from the 6.8 \nrate.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield for a question.\n  Mr. BURR. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I just want to ask--I am sorry, I couldn't see the chart \nfrom the other side, so I came here. On the undergraduate student, \n3.66, 64 percent, for how many years does that hold, that 3.66 percent? \nFor how many years?\n  Mr. BURR. It holds for 1 year until the readjustment of the 10-year \nbond, which could by higher, it could be lower.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Just 1 year.\n  Mr. BURR. Higher than it was in May----\n  Mr. HARKIN. And what does the CBO project the rates will do in the \nnext 10 years?\n  Mr. BURR. I am sure the Senator came with a chart. But let me say \nthat we have an 8.25-percent consolidation cap. The reality is that if \nyou are going to move to a market-based system, the question we have as \nSenators is, How do we drive interest rates the lowest for our Nation's \nstudents? If you put a hard cap of 8.25, then all of a sudden this \ninterest rate goes up, if we are getting to a zero surplus. It is not \ngoing to cost us anything, not going to make anything; 3.66 goes up, it \ndoesn't go down. So by having the flexible cap at 8.25, where anybody \ncan consolidate at any time, we are able to do it at the 10-year bond \nplus 1.85. And this is all CBO numbers. We are using the same source \nfor this.\n  But I think at the heart of this, and I say to my good friend from \nWest Virginia, the real question is, Are we going to let 26 percent \nparticipate in an attractive interest rate or are we going to extend it \nto 64 percent, which is the entire class of undergraduates?\n  Mr. MANCHIN. That was the bipartisan agreement we had. I appreciate \nthat very much. Let me say, here is the last 10 years. If we would use \nthe last 10 years, with the bipartisan bill kicked in, this is what the \nstudents who basically are paying the higher rate now--6.8 percent \nfrozen--would have been able to take advantage of, the lower rates. \nThey never got a chance to take advantage of the lower rates. All we \nare assuming is that if rates go up in 3 or 4 years, they are going to \nbe paying higher rates. We never assume the market--that is the reason \nwhy you fluctuate with the market on the 10-year T-bill. This would \nhave happened with the 10-year T-bill. Look how much lower they would \nhave been paying in the last 10 years.\n  I know we can all use figures any way we want to use them, but the \nbottom line is that it is either going to be market--it has always been \nthat before. There have been caps that have been much higher, and we \nare trying to find something that is affordable, but the bottom line \nis, do we try to protect the lowest rate?\n  Most undergraduates have the hardest times. Once you get your \nundergraduate degree, you have a much higher percentage of making it. \nIf you want to get a graduate degree and a higher Ph.D. degree, you \nhave a much better chance.\n  The bottom line is that we want to keep the rates low so that when \nstudents go out they are not burdened with the highest payments. We \nhave a lot of protections built in that a lot of times are \nmisunderstood and are not explained properly, and I am glad we are \nhaving this colloquy.\n  Mr. BURR. Would the Senator from Iowa like another question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I have a statement to make but not a question.\n  Mr. BURR. I will wrap up and move on.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If we are going to get into a colloquy, that is fine.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Yes.\n  Mr. BURR. I would rather make the points that I need to because at 12 \nwe are going to vote on one bill. We are going to vote on a 3.4-percent \nextension, kicking the can down the road for 12 months, not fixing the \nproblem, not finding the solution, and continuing to overcharge some \nstudents and subsidize another pool and go to bed at night and feel \ngood about this.\n  I think the reason we have a bipartisan agreement is there are some \nwho do not feel good about that. We look at it and we say the Senate \nhas not done what people sent us here to do, and that is to get it as \nclose to right as we can.\n  Again, I say to my colleagues--and I can go to the CBO again--the CBO \nscored the bill, and CBO says the bipartisan bill is within .7 percent \nof having no cost and no surplus. I am not sure you can get any closer \nthan that. They have also told us verbally and showed us in scoring: \nput the cap in and you raise the interest rate on all students, all \npostgraduates, all parents. And our objective, when Senator Manchin and \nSenator King and Senator Coburn and Senator Alexander got into the \ndiscussion, was, How can we get rates as low as we can? Our focus was \non the affordability for the students; secondarily, the sustainability \nof the program, which was long-term, something we do not visit every 1 \nor 2 or 3 years.\n  Let me get into specifics because there are four proposals out there. \nOne of them has already passed the House of Representatives. The House \nof Representatives has a 10-year variable rate that fluctuates \nannually. For unsubsidized loans, the rate is 4.31; for subsidized \nloans, the rate is 4.31, which is 10-year plus 2.5 percent; for PLUS \nloans, 5.74. It removes the consolidation cap--removes it--and it \ncreates caps of 8.5 and 10.5 percent.\n  The vote that we will have at noon, I think everybody knows it is a \n6.8-percent rate for most students. Twenty-six percent get a subsidized \nrate of 3.4 percent. The PLUS loans are at 7.9 percent, and that is 18 \npercent of the loans at 7.9 percent.\n  Under the President's proposal, the unsubsidized is--I think this is \nbackward. I think it is the subsidized at 10-year and .93; the \nunsubsidized at 10 year, 2.93; the PLUS at 10 year plus 3.93; and it is \nuncapped and fixed for life.\n  So it brings us to the bipartisan bill. The Senator from West \nVirginia said it well. What were the agreements we made? We are not \ngoing to make money and we are not going to lose money We are at .7 \npercent, according to CBO.\n  An undergraduate is an undergraduate. We should not cheat one to \nsubsidize another. But there should be a subsidy for low-income at-risk \nstudents. The assumption is that they are not responsible for the \ninterest payment while they are in school. The reality is that we \nextend the same 10-year bond plus 1.85 percent to all undergraduates.\n  For the graduate students, we would bring the rate down to 10-year \nplus 3.4, and for PLUS loans, 10-year plus 4.4, and we keep in place \nthe consolidation cap that has been in law. Let me remind my colleagues \nwhat I said earlier before they came to the floor. From 1965 to 1992, \nthe cap on student loans was 10 percent. If we put that in today, it \nwill raise the percentage each individual is going to pay.\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BURR. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I am not sure how the Senator voted on the extension a \nyear ago. I voted for the extension a year ago.\n  Mr. BURR. As did I.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I don't intend to vote on the extension again because we \nhave not fixed it. By voting on this extension, what we are voting on \nis 3.4 percent just for the subsidized, and everybody will be at 6.8 \npercent, and 7.9 percent for PLUS loans.\n  When my colleague is talking about that, the difference of savings \nbetween our bill--if we got a vote on our bill, which is a compromised, \nbipartisan bill, we would save close to $9 billion in\n\n[[Page S5589]]\n\ninterest that students wouldn't have to pay. I believe we agree on \nthat.\n  Mr. BURR. That is correct.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I think we are going to have a chance to vote on one \nbill, and that is about $2 billion. In West Virginia that is a lot of \nmoney in savings of $7 billion that students don't have to pay in \ninterest, which is across the board for students who have subsidized \nand unsubsidized loans. That is the point we are trying to make, and we \nhope we get that through.\n  I know the Senator hopes, as I do, that we get a vote on this today.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I believe Senator Burr has the floor.\n  Mr. BURR. I am happy to yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. My friend from West Virginia made a statement a few \nminutes ago that resonated with me. He said we are trying to get the \nmarket rates because we always had the rates.\n  When I first went to college in 1958, 1959, 1960, and 1961, I \nborrowed money under this program. It came into being in 1958, so 1959 \nwas the first year I borrowed money. It was called the National Defense \nEducation Act or the Eisenhower bill. I went back and looked to see \nwhat the 10-year Treasury note was at that time for those 3 years that \nI borrowed. The 10-year Treasury note at that time ranged between 4.2 \npercent and about 4.8 percent. I borrowed money at 2 percent.\n  I say to my friend, that is not a market rate. Not only did I borrow \nthe money, but all the time I was in college I paid no interest \ncharges. I spent 5 years in the military with no interest charges. I \nthen went to law school--3 years in law school--with no interest \ncharges. Then I had a 1-year grace period after I graduated from law \nschool with no interest charges. For all those years the interest rate \nclock never started ticking.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Was that for every student who was in college at that \ntime no matter what their ranking or what service they had performed in \nthe military or whether they had the GI bill?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Everybody.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Everybody in college during that period of time could \nborrow at the low rate of 2 percent with no interest at all?\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is right. The reason I raise that is, Why were we so \nspecial? Why was my generation so special that this country was willing \nto subsidize my education, but for these young people here we are \nsaying: No, no, you have to pay interest rates?\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Maybe Congress did a better job of getting its financial \nhouse in order than we have.\n  Mr. HARKIN. We made a commitment at that time to invest in a \ngeneration of young Americans so they wouldn't have a huge amount of \ndebt hanging over their heads.\n  Mr. BURR. What didn't exist when my colleague went to college and \ngraduate school was that we didn't have an income test for repayment. \nWe don't charge anybody over 15 percent on an annual basis.\n  When the Senator went through the system, he was responsible to pay \nback 100 percent of it. Today, after a certain period of time on the \nsubsidized loans, we forgive it. We have a lot of programs that didn't \nexist when he went through school. We have Pell grants that extend a \ntremendous amount of money that is not obligated to be paid back--\n$4,000. We have student loan higher education tax credits that did not \nexist when he went through college.\n  We have a basket of products. What we are looking at is, How can we \ntake one program, which is the rate-based program, and make it as \nattractive and affordable for students as we possibly can? Under this \nscenario, we are able to accomplish that for 64 percent. Under what we \nwill vote on, we only do it for 26 percent. We can't help but make the \nargument: You are overcharging here to subsidize here.\n  I agree with my good friend from Iowa, for whom I have great \naffection, that I want to make sure every student has an opportunity to \ngo to college and that it is affordable for all. We have a system right \nnow where the Federal Government controls 100 percent. When my good \nfriend went through college, there were private lenders that competed \nwith the Federal Government. At this time we have no private lenders. \nWe legislatively eliminated the private sector from competing for \nstudent loans. It is all dominated by the Federal Government. At least \nwe can try to get those loans as inexpensively as we can for the \nlargest group of college students.\n  I have a unanimous consent request. I hope we will entertain this \nbecause not only is the debate worthy, but a vote is worthy.\n  I ask unanimous consent that if cloture is not invoked on the pending \nmotion to proceed to S. 1238, the Jack Reed bill on student loans, it \nthen be in order to move to proceed to S. 1241, the Manchin bill on \nstudent loans; further, that the cloture motion, which will be at the \ndesk, be considered filed on the motion to proceed; and further, \nnotwithstanding rule XXII, the Senate then immediately proceed to a \nvote on the motion to invoke cloture on the pending motion to proceed \nto the Manchin bill, S. 1241.\n  Before the Chair rules, let me just say this agreement would allow us \nto have two votes on two versions of student loan rates that start at \nnoon today.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, this is an important issue, and I want to \nthank my colleagues who came together this morning to try to find an \nadditional solution.\n  I thank Senator Manchin, Senator King, and Senator Carper because \nthey were willing to try to fix this problem. I am convinced that my \ngood friend from Iowa is doing this in good faith, but now is the time \nto find a solution. It is not a year from now, it is not a month from \nnow, it is not a week from now, it is today.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I have one question that I would like to ask in the \nspirit of a colloquy to my dear friend from Iowa. They are saying 1 \nyear, and they are looking at the compromised, bipartisan bill we have \nworked on. In 3 or 4 years the rates may go up because market rates \nwill change. If we are only looking at 1 year, is there anything \nprohibitive in our bill that we couldn't go back a year from now if we \nsee a better solution? If we get an education bill, we can say: Hey, \nhere is the grand bargain, which is better than what we thought we had.\n  Still yet, our bill saves $9 billion, and the bill my dear friends in \nmy caucus support only saves $2 billion. If we only do it for 1 year, \nwe help more people save more money, and then we can still rewrite \nanother bill in 1 year. Are we able to do that?\n  Mr. BURR. I have learned in my 20 years in Washington that \n``permanent'' is defined as a 2-year session of Congress, and the next \ncould easily change it.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. If we look at it from year to year, we have 3.4 percent \nfor the smallest group, 6.8 percent for everybody above that, and 7.9 \npercent for PLUS.\n  Under our bill, it is 3.66 percent for all undergraduates, and every \nrate comes down; correct?\n  Mr. BURR. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. So that is $9 billion versus $2 billion, and that is \nabout as simple as I can make it.\n  Mr. BURR. As I said earlier, how does that compute to the average \nstudent? It means a lower monthly payment. Under the bill that we will \nvote on, which is the current extension--the kick-the-can-down-the-road \nplan--they will pay $78 a month, and that number is based on a student \nborrowing $5,000. Under the bipartisan bill, it is $75 a month.\n  On the graduate Stafford comparison by month, the person who borrows \nunder the graduate program--under the kick-the-can-down-the-road plan--\nis going to pay $251. Under the bipartisan solution, they are going to \nhave a monthly obligation of $230.\n  For the highest group, the PLUS loans--and in a lot of cases those \nare parents--the monthly obligation is going to be $197 on the kick-\nthe-can-down-the-road plan, and under the bipartisan solution, the \nmonthly obligation is going to be $180 in payments. Again, this is \nfigured with $5,000 borrowed over a 10-year amortization of the loan.\n  It makes the good point my friend from West Virginia made: Why would \nwe not take the opportunity to make\n\n[[Page S5590]]\n\nthis cheaper for everybody for the next 12 months? If we find a better \nway to do it, let's change it 12 months from now.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I think what we are talking about also is that they are \nsaying if it consolidates, it strings the payment out for the maximum \nof 30 years, which means they are paying a lot more back in interest; \ncorrect? That is the argument I have heard from different people. So \nthat means, why would you have an automatic consolidation?\n  With that being said, I understand that with the government-run loan \nright now, there are no penalties for me. If I string it out to get the \nlowest payment for 30 years, and then I said I want to have 10 years, I \ncan do that; correct? That is able to be done. So I can reduce that \namount of time and amount of interest with my affordability to pay \nmore.\n  Mr. BURR. The Senator is exactly right.\n  There are others on the other side who would like to speak.\n  Madam Chair, at this time I reserve the remainder of the time on our \nside and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I know Senator Stabenow has an important meeting to get \nto, and I will yield to her in just second.\n  I just want to respond to my friend from North Carolina as to why I \nobjected since I don't believe in all of these reservations for \nobjections. Either you object or you don't, and there is a time to \nexplain that later on.\n  I wanted to explain why I objected. If we vote for cloture at noon on \nthis underlying bill, then what the Senator from North Carolina wants, \nthey can add as an amendment. They can offer that as an amendment to \nthe bill. The bill will be open to any amendments anybody has.\n  So the reason I object is because we have a bill, and it is under \nregular order. We have cloture and the bill is open for amendments. So \nthe Senator from North Carolina or Tennessee or West Virginia or \nanybody else can offer any amendments they want, and that is the way \nthe regular order ought to proceed.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I think what we are witnessing today \nare people who have differences in philosophies and want to solve \nproblems with different approaches.\n  I believe the issue before us at noon is a vote on doing no harm. \nThere is not an agreement on both sides of the aisle as to whether we \nkeep the student interest rates as low as possible for an ongoing basis \nor whether we tie it to market rates going up so that they go up over \ntime. There is not agreement on that. I hope we have an agreement to do \nno harm.\n  The vote at noon is, let's keep it at 3.4 percent, where it has been, \nwhich is, by the way, the market rate. Right now you can go out and get \na car--and I encourage people to purchase a new American-made \nautomobile--with a 4-percent interest rate. You can get a mortgage for \nabout 4 percent.\n  Doubling the rates makes no sense, and putting in place something \nthat students are asking us not to do, which starts where we are and \ngoes up over time, does not make sense either. So let's do no harm. \nLet's vote yes to give us a year.\n  We have people who care about this issue. We can sit down and spend \nthat time working under Chairman Harkin, who is committed to addressing \nthis in a comprehensive way. He is interested in addressing not just \nthe interest rates on subsidized Stafford loans but on all of the \nissues. There is a range of issues, not the least of which is the $1 \ntrillion that students and families are carrying in this country, which \nis more than the credit card debt that we have.\n  Let's start with do no harm. If we do that, then 7 million students \nare not going to be hit with the interest rate hike that is going to be \nin place. If we do that, we are going to be saying to students: We are \nnot going to see the government making billions of dollars in profits \non the backs of students because the loan rates have gone up.\n  So I would encourage everyone--people of different philosophies--to \nvote yes to give us the time to work out what is clearly a broad \ncomprehensive issue to make sure young people and people going back to \ncollege have the opportunity to dream big dreams, to have the same \nopportunities many of us have had.\n  I went to school on student loans. I went to school on a tuition-and-\nfees scholarship because of my own family situation growing up. The \nreality is we have the opportunity to do no harm, and then work \ntogether on something comprehensive that does not down the road see \nstudents paying 7, 8, 9 or, in the case of what the House did, top out \nrates at 10.5 percent. I reject that. Colleagues on this side of the \naisle reject that.\n  Let's vote yes and do no harm and then get to work in a bipartisan \nway on the larger problem and solve it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, let me commend Senator Stabenow, Senator \nHarkin, Senator Warren, Senator Franken, and Senator Hagan, \nparticularly, who is the cosponsor of the legislation I have proposed.\n  My proposal would keep the student loan interest rate for subsidized \nStafford loans at 3.4 percent while we deal with a very complicated and \ncomplex set of issues. It is not just the rate structure; it is the \nissue of providing appropriate incentives to control the costs of \nhigher education. It is also the issue of refinancing existing debt and \nprospective debt so that this huge wall of debt, the avalanche of debt \naffecting college graduates and professional school graduates today, \ncan be addressed. I don't think we can do that--because these are \ncomplicated programs--off the cuff, as we are attempting to do today or \nas we have been over the last several days.\n  It turns out that if we do not extend this rate for at least a year, \nbut instead take up the so-called bipartisan proposal eventually rates \nwill rise on students across the board. That is because the law now \ncalls for a 6.8-percent rate for the Stafford subsidized and \nunsubsidized loans and 7.9 percent for PLUS loans--fixed rates--and in \norder to score this as a zero in terms of the Congressional Budget \nOffice and deficit effects, we have to over that time make up all of \nthat interest.\n  The proponents of the alternate approach are suggesting we will go \nwith a lower rate now, but that simply means mathematically we will \nhave to have higher rates in the future. The question of when that \nfuture arrives is a function of the way interest rates will be moving \nin the overall economy, and every indication is those interest rates \nwill start rising, and perhaps quickly. The Federal Reserve has already \nindicated they are beginning to pull back on their quantitative easing, \nwhich means rates are likely to go up. We have seen a significant rise \nin the 10-year T-bill rate. Since May, it has gone up almost a full \npercentage point. So we are in a rising rate environment, and the other \nside proposes moving from a fixed rate to a floating rate, without an \neffective cap.\n  What we know is that--it might not be next year or the following year \nbut relatively quickly--we could likely see and will likely see \nstudents paying higher than the 6.8-percent rate and, without a cap, it \ncould be significantly higher.\n  If we adopt the proposal suggested by my colleagues--and they have \nbeen working with great energy and great sincerity to try to come to a \nsolution--I am afraid we are going to ultimately end up seeing students \npaying much more, and that is not what we should be about.\n  We have a situation right now, even with the 3.4-percent rate that \ndoubled to 6.8 percent on July 1, where the Federal Government is \nmaking about $50 billion this year, between the cost of funds and the \nrepayments being made by students, so students have become profit \ncenters for the Federal Government rather than, as I think the \nintention of the program was, that the Federal program was going to \nhelp students get through college so they can help us as productive \nworkers in our economy.\n  It is projected that these Federal student loan programs between now \nand 2023, over a 10-year period, will make $184 billion for the Federal \nGovernment, in terms of the difference between what students are paying \nback\n\n[[Page S5591]]\n\nand the cost of borrowing from the government. So there is a lot we \ncould do--but not in 24 hours--to redesign our program so students are \nnot essentially being hammered with huge debts as we are benefiting \nprofitably from those students.\n  The CBO estimates that under this Bipartisan Student Loan Certainty \nAct, between 2017 and 2023, students would pay an additional $37.8 \nbillion more on their loans than they would under the current rate of \n6.8 percent. This goes to my initial point. The first few years have \nbeen designed so interest rates will be lower than 6.8 percent. \nHowever, according to the CBO, between 2017 and 2023 they will be much \nhigher--so if a person is a high school student right now, they are \nlooking at paying a lot of money if they intend to go to college--about \n$37.8 billion more--because it all has to balance out to effectively \ngenerate as much revenue as a 6.8-percent interest rate, which is the \ncurrent rate.\n  Students know that. That is why they have come to us and said, \nListen, thanks, but no thanks. This short-run discount of a few years \nin terms of the interest rate, we know we might get the benefit if we \nhave already started or are just finishing college. We definitely know \nthat our younger brothers and sisters in high school and another \ngeneration of Americans will be paying for it.\n  So I don't think we should take that approach. I think what we have \nsaid is let's wait. We have a lot of work to do. We want to look at \nproposals that might actually align the real cost of Federal lending \nfor a college education and the real charges we impose on students. \nRight now, my sense is what our colleagues have done in their \nbipartisan approach has been essentially to make sure the first few \nyears look good--they are certainly less than 6.8 percent, close to 3.4 \npercent--but then they have to put in a rather arbitrary delta--an \nincrease in costs--because at the end of the 10-year period they are \ngoing to have to make up all of the interest that would have been \ncharged at 6.8 percent. I don't think that is the way to approach \nfundamental reform of college loans in this country.\n\n  There is another point I think is important to make as well, which is \nwe have always either had a fixed rate or an adjustable rate with a cap \non each loan program--a cap on subsidized Stafford loans, unsubsidized \nStafford loans, and on PLUS loans for families. Now, in the bipartisan \nproposal, they don't have a cap. There is some discussion that if \nstudents consolidate loans, they will get an 8.25-percent cap. But \nconsolidation can only take place after a student is in repayment. And \nbefore a student is in repayment, all of that interest on the \nunsubsidized Stafford loans and the PLUS loans is accumulating and \nbeing capitalized into what the student owes. So when the student \nconsolidates, they have a much bigger principal to pay off. There might \nbe a cap of 8.25 percent, but it is a much bigger principal. By the \nway, the loan is extended over a longer period of time, so they also \nhave to pay for that longer extension of time.\n  That is not the cap we have had before in the context of these \nprograms. It has been a cap on the individual loan, a cap on the \nsubsidized loan and unsubsidized loan, and a cap on the PLUS loans. I \nthink that is a major fault within the proposal we are seeing today.\n  The other issue, which goes to the index, is that a 10-year T-bill \ninterest rate has been chosen. Typically, we have chosen a 91-day T-\nbill, and the 91-day T-bill is cheaper, frankly. We start off with a \nmuch lower index, which lowers what the student has to pay, and then we \nadd other costs to it, including the discount estimate of default, and \nall of those things come up with the final rate. But we are going to a \n10-year T-bill rate, which means students will be paying more relative \nto a 91-day T-bill rate. Again, I don't think that is what we want to \ndo.\n  We want to take the time to try to address this whole set of issues, \nto do it in a thoughtful way, to understand that one of the big \nchallenges we have is not just the issue of what rate but also how do \nwe keep college costs in check. How do we provide the kind of education \nstudents need to be competitive in the workplace? How do we deal with \nthe interaction between all of these different types of loans? How do \nwe go ahead and--again, this might be one of the biggest challenges we \nface going forward--how do we somehow allow these students who are \ndrowning in debt to effectively refinance these loans so they can buy \nhomes, they can buy cars, they can participate in the economy? That is \nnot included in this proposal.\n  Indeed, one of my concerns is with these rates locked in--and this is \nlong-term legislation--we won't have the proper incentive to \neffectively deal with these issues; we will just let them slide along. \nI think that would be to our great detriment and, more importantly, to \nthe detriment of families throughout the country.\n  There have been--and appropriately so--comments and criticism of this \nshort-term approach. We should have fixed it last year. Well, we \nhaven't fixed it, and I think we have to give ourselves the time to fix \nit.\n  There is the suggestion that we are dealing with a portion of the \nloans--the subsidized Stafford loans--and everybody else won't get a \nbenefit. From the numbers we have seen from CBO, one thing is certain: \nIn the last years of the other side's proposal, from at least 2017 to \n2023, everyone--subsidized, unsubsidized, and PLUS loans--will be \npaying more. So the one conclusion we can draw, if we go to the \nalternative approach, is that eventually every borrower will be paying \nmore.\n  Therefore, I very strongly urge that we move forward with this \ncloture vote to get on to the legislation. As Senator Harkin rightly \npointed out, once we are on the legislation, it is open to amendment. \nAt least we can debate the proposals from all of my colleagues that \ncould improve or change or modify the underlying bill. But if we don't \nget to cloture, then we are not moving forward, and I think we should \nat least move forward.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I know we are still on our time; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I understand Senator Hoeven wanted to take 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I wish to clarify for the esteemed \nSenator from Iowa that I intend to speak in support of the student loan \ncertainty act which he may not be in favor of, so I wish to be clear.\n  I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 5 minutes, while \npreserving the 2 minutes remaining for the distinguished Senator from \nNorth Carolina prior to the vote at noon. I wish to be clear so the \ngood Senator from Iowa understands as far as whether he wishes to \nobject.\n  Mr. BURR. If it influences the Senator from Iowa at all, I will allow \nmy 2 minutes to go to him, if the Senator wouldn't object to him having \n3 additional minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That would be fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. My understanding is to preserve the 2 minutes for the \nSenator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Go ahead.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I rise to speak to the permanent \nsolution that is being put forward on a bipartisan basis today, which \nis the Student Loan Certainty Act. Again, I wish to emphasize that this \nis a bipartisan solution. Senator Joe Manchin, a Democrat from West \nVirginia; Senator Lamar Alexander, a Republican from Tennessee; Senator \nRichard Burr, a Republican from North Carolina; and Senator Angus King, \nan Independent from Maine--I guess tripartisan, right? This is truly a \nbipartisan effort, including the support of Senator Tom Carper, a \nDemocrat from Delaware, myself, and others. This is a bipartisan effort \nto come up with a permanent solution.\n  I have been listening to the floor debate and what everybody says \nover and over is we need a permanent solution, and that is exactly \nright.\n  A year ago I served on the conference committee for MAP 21 which is \nthe authorization for the highway program. We included in that \nconference report an extension, a 1-year reauthorization, of the \nFederal student loan program. So we could do what? Put a permanent \nsolution in place--not come here a year later and extend it again for a \nyear.\n\n  So that is what the vote at noon is all about. It is yet another 1-\nyear extension. We need to put a permanent\n\n[[Page S5592]]\n\nsolution in place. Our bipartisan plan is simple and straightforward. \nIt provides students with dependable low-cost financing on a long-term \nbasis. We call it the Student Loan Certainty Act because it provides \njust that: certainty for our students and for our families, not another \n1-year extension.\n  There has been a lot of discussion here, and it is easy to get \nconfused. But let's go through it for a minute. How does it work? This \nis a simple straightforward plan. The plan would tie all student loan \nrates to the 10-year Treasury note to reflect current market and \nemployment conditions.\n  Right now, that index rate--the 10-year Treasury note rate--is 1.8 \npercent. Then both subsidized and unsubsidized Stafford loans would be \n1.85 percent over that rate. Graduate Stafford loans: 3.4 percent over \nthat rate. PLUS loans--loans parents take out--4.4 percent over the 10-\nyear Treasury note rate. Those rates are then fixed, locked for the \nlife of the loan. The student knows that is a fixed rate then for the \nlife of the loan, until it is paid off.\n  So let's compare the programs, compare the existing student loan \nprogram to what we are proposing. That is easy enough to do.\n  Subsidized Stafford loans. Right now they are actually at 6.8 percent \nbecause the existing program expired, didn't it. But under the old \nprogram they were at 3.4 percent for the subsidized Stafford loans. \nUnder our proposal: 3.66 percent--3.4 percent; 3.66 percent--so it is \nabout the same, isn't it.\n  Actually, those rates have gone to 6.8 percent because, again, we go \nyear to year. This program expires so we are really bringing them down. \nBut even if you assume it has not expired, it is about the same rate--\n3.66 percent versus 3.4 percent.\n  For unsubsidized Stafford rates, again, under our proposal, you get \nthe same rate as for the subsidized student loan program--3.66 percent. \nThat compares to 6.8 percent under the existing program. That is a big-\ntime savings for 60 percent of college borrowers, big-time savings: \n3.66 percent versus 6.8 percent. Which would you rather have? Big-time \nsavings for 60 percent of the undergraduate borrowers.\n  Graduate student loan rates under our proposal: 5.21 percent versus \n7.9 percent under the existing program; parent PLUS loans: 6.21 percent \nversus 7.9 percent under the existing program--in both cases, again, \nlower rates.\n  The consolidated loan rate remains at 8.25 percent. That is a cap. We \nkeep that in place--8.25 percent--in essence, providing students and \nfamilies with a cap, another safety feature.\n  There is also another protection measure in the bill. The good \nSenator from North Carolina just referred to it a minute ago. Under the \nincome-based repayment level provision, student loan payments are \nlimited to 15 percent of income. So your repayment, your payment amount \nis limited to 15 percent of your income, and after 25 years, if the \nloan is not paid off, the balance is forgiven. So you have both a cap \nand a repayment limit provision to protect borrowers.\n  Furthermore, this program is designed solely for students and their \nfamilies. What do I mean by that? This program is solely for students \nand their families. Unlike the existing student loan program, it does \nnot subsidize health care. The current program, in essence, provides a \nsubsidy for Federal health care--the Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare. It \nprovides a subsidy, and the students pay for it. Why would we do that? \nWhy would we continue that?\n  What we are talking about is a vote at noon to extend the current \nplan. It is a 1-year extension, meaning we are going to be right back \nhere 1 year from now doing the same thing. Furthermore, it is paid for \nwith a tax increase on withdrawals from retirement accounts--a \npermanent tax increase to pay for a 1-year extension. That does not \nmake any sense. What are we going to do a year from now to come up with \nthe revenue to once again extend it? A permanent tax increase for a 1-\nyear extension.\n  The third point is, why in the world are we using a student loan \nprogram to subsidize the Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare? That does not \nmake any sense. Why would we do that?\n  Again, I come back to the point I started with, the point I made \nearlier that I think reflects on the debate and the discussion we have \nall had here: There is a desire to come together. I do not think we are \nvery far away. I think this bipartisan measure is very close to \nsomething we can agree on. The good Senator from Iowa said himself he \nwants a permanent plan in place that takes care of students. I think we \nare close to doing that. I think the Student Loan Certainty Act \nprovides that bipartisan framework we can now gather around. It may \nneed some modification, but we can gather around it and get a permanent \nsolution in place. I know that is what all of the Members of this body \nwant. I ask my colleagues to join with us so we can get that done, and \nwe can get it now--not extend it for a year and hope to get it done. \nLet's get it done for the benefit of our students across this great \ncountry and their families.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I am proud to rise today to support \nthe Keep Student Loans Affordable Act. This bill would extend the \ncurrent interest rate of 3.4 percent for subsidized Stafford loans for \nthe next school year. This interest rate reflects a record low for \ninterest rates on Federal student loans, and these loans can only go to \nstudents and families that demonstrate a need for them; 60 percent of \ndependent subsidized loan borrowers come from families with incomes of \nless than $60,000. Subsidized Stafford loans help more than 7 million \ncollege students without worrying that the interest on their loans will \nbegin accruing while they're in school. It helps more than 105,000 \nstudents in Maryland. Middle class families are feeling stretched and \nstressed and if we fail to act, students could be facing an additional \n$1,000 in debt over the life of their loans.\n  I would also like to announce my support for the Bank on Student \nLoans Fairness Act, introduced by Senator Elizabeth Warren. This \nlegislation would lower the current interest rate of 3.4 percent to \n0.75 percent for subsidized Stafford loans for the next school year, \nwhich is the same interest rate that banks pay. Banks have arbitrarily \nraised interest rates on consumers, and applied higher interest rates \nretroactively. They charged fees without any legitimate purpose--and \nthen charged interest on top those unfair fees. And they marketed their \nproducts to college students who they knew could not afford the credit \nthey were providing.\n  The banks are not looking out for the best interest of students; they \nare looking after themselves to make a profit. The Federal Government \nhas worked hard to keep student loan interest rates as low as possible \nto ensure that access to higher education remains a viable option for \nstudents and their families. That is why it is important that we work \ntogether to keep the interest of students at heart and not create \nadditional burdens on them. So why not let students pay the same \ninterest rates as banks?\n  I have said this often, but we in this country enjoy many freedoms--\nthe freedom of speech, the freedom of the press, the freedom of \nreligion. But there is an implicit freedom our Constitution does not \nlay out in writing, but its promise has excited the passions, hopes, \nand dreams of people in this country since its founding. The freedom to \ntake whatever talents God has given you, to fulfill whatever passion is \nin your heart, to learn so you can earn and make a contribution--the \nfreedom to achieve.\n  When I was a young girl at a Catholic all-girls school, my mom and \ndad made it clear they wanted me to go to college. But, right around \ngraduation, my family was going through a rough time because my dad's \ngrocery store had suffered a terrible fire. I offered to put off \ncollege and work at the grocery store until the business got back on \nits feet. My dad said:\n\n       Barb, you have to go. Your mother and I will find a way, \n     because no matter what happens to you, no one can ever take \n     that degree away from you. The best way I can protect you is \n     to make sure you can earn a living all of your life.\n\n  My father gave me the freedom to achieve. And this legislation will \ngive millions of Americans that same freedom without adding a dime to \nthe deficit.\n  Students will bless us if we are successful in keeping their student \nloan interest rates as low as possible. Getting a college education is \nthe core of\n\n[[Page S5593]]\n\nthe American dream and I am going to be sure that every student has \naccess to that dream and make sure that when they graduate their first \nmortgage is not their student debt. Senator Reed's legislation should \nbe passed in a swift, expeditious, uncluttered way. It gives our \nstudents access to the American dream. It gives our young people access \nto the freedom to achieve, to be able to follow their talents, and to \nbe able to achieve higher education in whatever field they will be able \nto serve this country.\n  While our work is not done when it comes to ensuring access to \naffordable higher education, this bill helps us get there. While these \nbills will fix the problem today, I will continue to work with my \ncolleagues to figure out a longer-term solution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Well, Madam President, I think we have had a good debate \nand colloquies on this bill. At noon we are going to be voting, as I \nunderstand it, on a cloture motion on whether we are going to have a \nbill on the floor. That is all we are saying: Will we have a bill on \nthe floor to which amendments can be offered by anybody?\n  I say to my friends on the Republican side, if they have an idea--and \nsome of them do--that has some Democratic support--and there is some of \nthat--the best way to flush this out and to see whether the Senate as a \nwhole agrees is to vote for cloture on the motion to proceed to the \nbill at noon. That means the bill is on the floor. That means it is \nopen for amendment. That means if Senator Burr wants to offer an \namendment that incorporates his whole bill, he can do that and we can \nhave a debate on that. And I would say to my friends on the other side, \nit only takes 51 votes, not 60. It only takes 51 votes to adopt an \namendment.\n  It seems to me the proper way, if you want to proceed on this, is to \nvote for cloture. That brings the student loan bill to the floor. If my \nfriends from North Dakota or Tennessee or North Carolina or wherever--\nor my friend from West Virginia on this side--if they want to offer \namendments, do so. We can debate it. And then it only takes 51 votes. I \ndo not know why they would be opposed to voting for cloture on the \nunderlying bill because that moves us to a point where 51 votes is \ncontrolling. So I hope we will get the 60 votes necessary to move ahead \nwith this very important bill and this issue.\n  A lot has been said here this morning, and my friend, I think, from \nWest Virginia said there are a lot of numbers floating around and there \nare a lot of charts floating around. Everybody has a chart on this and \nnumbers on that. No one is trying to befuddle anyone, and no one is \ndeliberately trying to mislead anyone. It is just that when you get \ninvolved in an issue such as this, it is complicated, it is very \ncomplicated, because if you do a little bit on this one thing--let's \nsay on a cap--then it does something on other interest rates. If you do \nsomething on consolidation, all these things bounce around. You can \nlook at what an interest rate would be today, but you do not know what \nit is going to be tomorrow or what it is going to be next year or the \nyear after. All we have to go on is CBO estimates, Congressional Budget \nOffice estimates.\n  I will be forthright. I will say honestly, I can love CBO one day and \nhate them the next because of the way they figure things, and sometimes \nit is almost inscrutable how they figure things. But, nonetheless, \nthose are the rules we have to sort of play under here. So we have to \nlook at what the CBO scores are and how they score all of the various \nproposals.\n  My friend from North Carolina had all of his charts out there and \ndifferent things about interest rates and all that. I asked the \nquestion: How long does that 3.66 percent interest rate last? He was \nforthright. He said 1 year. But then he went on to talk about what \nwould happen in the future.\n  Well, here is yet another chart that I present for the Senate. Their \nbill is S. 1241. That is the Burr-Manchin-Alexander et al. bill. So \nwhat we did was we plotted it out as to what would happen in the \noutyears. As you can see, if you look at this line about right here on \nthe chart: 6.8 percent. That is where the student loan interest rate is \ntoday because on July 1 it doubled from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent. And \n6.8 percent is permanent law. Madam President, 6.8 percent is permanent \nlaw, so that is where it is today.\n  If you look at S. 1241, the Burr-Manchin et al. bill, they are quite \ncorrect that in the first 2 or 3 years the interest rates are lower \nthan 6.8 percent. That is why I asked the question. He mentioned 3.66 \npercent down here on the chart. That is good for next year. But we can \nonly go by CBO estimates, so we asked CBO: What are your projections of \nthe 10-year Treasury notes? That is what we have to go by. If you use \nthat, and you look at what their bill proposes, you will see almost \nlike a classic bait and switch. For the first couple, 3 years, interest \nrates are lower than 6.8 percent. But beginning in 2016--2\\1/2\\ years \nfrom now--both the graduate Stafford loans and the PLUS loans go way \nabove 6.8 percent--up to 8.6 percent and 9.6 percent.\n  If someone looked at that, they would say: Well, for the first \ncouple, 3 years that might be OK, but what about these students out \nhere? How about these young students getting ready to go to college? \nThey and their families are paying these high interest rates. That is \nwhy we heard from so many student groups saying: That is not a good \ndeal. We do not want just a good deal for us for a couple of years and \nthen stick the students in the future with higher interest rates.\n  Then for the undergraduate Stafford loans--which right now are at 6.8 \npercent--the Burr-Manchin and others bill goes up to 7.1 percent. You \nmight say that is not much of a difference, but it is more.\n  So in every single case, by 2018, the interest rates under the \nRepublican bill are higher--higher--than if we stuck with current law, \nwhich is 6.8 percent. That is a fact. They cannot dispute that unless \nthey want to say they do not want to use CBO figures. But that is what \nwe have to apply. I have asked--I make the request again--any of the \nsupporters of S. 1241, if you disagree with this chart, please come to \nthe floor and tell us why this is not right. I challenge anyone to come \nhere and tell me why this is wrong, if they think it is wrong, and why \nthey think it is wrong. But that is exactly what will happen under \ntheir bill.\n  It seems we have a couple of courses here. As I said, the first thing \nis to do what we can to keep interest rates low, and then to address \nthis in a comprehensive fashion.\n  The bill before us, the bill we are going to vote cloture on, is just \na 1-year extension at 3.4 percent. Again, that has a cost. CBO told us \nwhat the cost was. So we had a pay-for, as we say around here a pay-\nfor--how do you pay for it--by closing a loophole in the IRAs, the \nindividual retirement accounts. As we developed those, those were to be \nused for retirement. But a current loophole in the law allows very \nwealthy people to build up a retirement account in an IRA and use it as \nan estate planning gimmick.\n  So millionaires, billionaires can pass on millions in than IRAs to \ntheir heirs without paying taxes for years, if not decades. That was \nnever what IRAs were for. That is a loophole. It has to be closed. I \nthink in anything coming before this body in the way of a tax reform, I \ncan assure you that loophole will be closed. So we are saying, for 1 \nyear, we will close it and use the savings from that to keep student \nloans at 3.4 percent for 1 year.\n  Am I saying we have to keep student loans at 3.4 percent forever? No, \nI am not. What I am saying is that this whole area of student loans and \ninterest rates is one piece of a jigsaw puzzle, the jigsaw puzzle being \nhow are we going to do two things; one, make college more affordable in \nthe future and how are we going to address the $1 trillion-plus that is \nin student loans out there right now. This is just one part of that.\n  When we take one part out of that jigsaw puzzle, it affects \neverything else. That is why I have argued for a long time that our \ncommittee, the HELP Committee, needs to address this in the Higher \nEducation Act reauthorization. The Higher Education Act expires this \nyear. So we have to reauthorize it. My good friend Senator Alexander is \nthe ranking member on the committee. We have already had discussions \nabout the Higher Education Act. I believe this is the proper way to \nproceed, so we can have experts come\n\n[[Page S5594]]\n\nin and tell us: OK. If you jiggle this number a little bit, if you do \nthis on student loans, how does that affect Pell grants. If you do \nsomething on Pell grants, how does that affect college work study.\n  All of these things fit together. We need to address a comprehensive \nmeasure on college affordability, on making sure college costs are \ntransparent for our students and their families. Comparisons. Why does \none course of study at one college cost $200 a credit hour and another \ncollege the same course costs $400 a credit hour? Why is that? Should \nparents not have a good comparison chart? What can we do to encourage \ncolleges to have a better graduation rate in 4 years or 5 years? \nSecretary Duncan has talked a lot about promoting an idea of having \nhigh schools graduate kids that after 4 years they can get an \nassociate's degree. If they study hard and do advanced placement \ncourses, they might even graduate from high school or shortly \nthereafter with an associate's degree.\n  These are interesting ideas. We need to pursue them. But if we take \nthis out, if we take out the student loans, it sort of messes up the \nrest of the formulas. That is why I think we should extend the 3.4 \npercent for 1 year, pay for it with the closing that loophole for 1 \nyear, and let our committee do its job. We have good people on the \ncommittee. Senator Alexander, Senator Burr are on the committee. We \nhave thoughtful, smart people who understand this.\n  I think generally we work pretty good together on the committee. This \nissue now of the student loans, it reminds me of all my time in the \nSenate, now marking 39 years. It seems that every time we rush to \njudgment, we have a deadline, that is when mistakes are made. Need I go \nany further than to talk about the sequester?\n  It is a horrible mistake. But faced with a deadline, we have to do \nall of this, then we rush to judgment on something such as this. I \nthink we made a terrible mistake on that.\n  So I plead with my fellow Senators to put this over for 1 year. Let \nour committee do its work, so we can address the whole issue of college \naffordability, college completion rates, and how we address also the \nissue of the $1 trillion that is hanging out there. That may be more of \nan issue for the Finance Committee, but there may be partial \njurisdiction for both the Finance Committee and the HELP Committee.\n  Again, last year, we extended the 3.4 percent for 1 year, to July 1 \nof this year. I know I have heard some say we did that for 1 year and \nwe did not address the issue. But, again, I remind my fellow Senators \nthat last year was an election year, campaigning, we were not here that \nmuch, had a big election in November, then we had all of these budget \nthings facing us at the end of the year.\n  With the budget problems we had earlier this year, there just was not \ntime to do anything, plus the fact that the Higher Education Act does \nexpire this year. So it is incumbent upon us to address the issue of \nhigher education. That is where this belongs. I would again hope we \nwould extend the 3.4 percent for 1 year and let our committee do its \nwork.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the 1-year extension. My friends on \nthe other side, they say they want a long-term solution. I have no \nproblems with that. But let's do a long-term solution based upon a \nrational approach, one that comprehensively looks at all of the issues \nsurrounding college affordability. The way to do that, as I said, is \nthrough the committee's work.\n  There was one other point that was made this morning that I wish to \naddress myself; that is, consolidation. Everybody thinks consolidation \nis such a hot deal. I have pointed this out before. For example, we \ntook a $41,000 Stafford loan borrowed in school--$41,000--and used that \nas the baseline. Then we said, under current law, the student would pay \n$21,716 in interest over 10 years. Under the Republican bill, S. 1241, \nthey would pay $28,607. Under consolidation, they pay $69,000.\n  So consolidation is not the big deal people think it is. Now here is \none that is even more drastic. Again, the $41,000 in Stafford loans and \n$30,000 in PLUS loans borrowed by a graduate student, under current \nlaw, $43,760 is what they would pay back. Under S. 1241, they would pay \n$52,498. But if they consolidated it, they would pay $148,000--$43,000 \nto $148,000. That is under consolidation. So you wonder why students do \nnot consolidate? Because they realize they are going to be paying back \nthree and four times as much in interest charges than if they never \nconsolidated.\n  The other point I wish to make on consolidation is you only get to do \nit one time--one time. So let's say that you graduate from college. You \ndecide I want lower monthly payments. I want to stretch it out for a \nlonger period of time. You do that. You consolidate. Then let's say you \nwant to go to graduate school. You cannot consolidate after that. That \nis it. You are through.\n  So if you have to borrow money at higher rates and stuff, you cannot \nconsolidate those later on. I think that is what some of my friends \nforget. You can only use consolidation one time--one time. So \nconsolidation and having a cap or whatever it is on consolidation is \ncertainly not any kind of an answer to these high interest rate \npayments students are making.\n  Again, what we are looking for--I know people want to have a long-\nterm solution. They want to get to something that is revenue neutral. I \nunderstand that. I hope if we get cloture and we can move to the bill, \nRepublicans can offer their amendments. As I said, it only takes 51 \nvotes to adopt an amendment. But if not, then let's just extend this \nfor 1 year. I do not think that is too much to ask, to extend it for 1 \nyear and let us do this in a comprehensive fashion.\n  I would hope that would be what we would do and not double these \ninterest rates on students right now. I think both sides agree on that, \neven under S. 1241, next year interest rates will be 3.66 percent. I am \nall for that. On 1241, they want to keep interest rates at 3.66 percent \nnext year. That is fine. That is pretty close to 3.4 percent. The \nproblem is what happens in the outyears, as I have pointed out.\n\n  If both sides agree that in the next year interest rates should be \ndown around here at 3.6 percent for the undergraduate loans, 3.4 \npercent, 3.6 percent, not a heck of a lot of difference. Why do we not \njust extend the 3.4 percent for that year and then fix this in the \nHigher Education Act? I would agree. They want to keep it at 3.66 \npercent for 1 year, fine. But there is not that much difference between \n3.4 and 3.66 percent.\n  I think what we all agree on is in the next year, interest rates \nshould not go up--should not go up. Where we are not agreeing is on a \nlong-term fix. Again, if we cannot agree on a long-term fix, then at \nleast let's do no harm. Let's extend the 3.4 percent for 1 year and \ntake care of the long-term solution in the Higher Education Act \nreauthorization, which we can have on the floor sometime next spring.\n  With that, I again ask my colleagues to vote for cloture on the bill. \nLet's extend 3.4 percent for 1 year and let our committee do its work.\n  I yield the floor and reserve whatever time we may have remaining.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, we are about to take this vote. It is \nvitally important. The proposal is very straightforward, to extend the \ninterest rate for subsidized Stafford loans at 3.4 percent. It is fully \npaid for. It will allow us to work through a very complicated set of \nissues. It will allow us to avoid raising rates this year and work \ntoward a proposal we hope will avoid rising rates in the future.\n  The alternative proposal eventually raises rates on every student, \nnot immediately, but CBO indicates by at least 2017 the rates will be \nup.\n  This is on top of a huge cascade of student debt we have to deal \nwith. In fact, one of the major issues we should deal with is how do we \nrefinance the existing loans that are at high rates. Refinancing will \nbe even more important if we were to enact the rising rates coming from \nthe proposals on the other side.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support cloture and move forward to \ndebate this bill.\n\n[[Page S5595]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, pursuant to rule \nXXII, the clerk will report the motion to invoke cloture.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close the debate on the motion to \n     proceed to calendar No. 124, S. 1238, a bill to amend the \n     Higher Education Act of 1965 to extend the current reduced \n     interest rate for undergraduate Federal Direct Stafford Loans \n     for 1 year, to modify required distribution rules for pension \n     plans, and for other purposes.\n         Harry Reid, Tom Harkin, Jack Reed, Kirsten E.

Mr. President, last week 40,000 students in \nmy State got some very bad news: The rates on new Stafford student \nloans doubled. Today, these students got bad news again. Today, our \nNation's students once again wait in vain for relief.\n  These students work hard; they are ambitious. They know how important \na college education is. They know what it means to their future and to \nour Nation's future. They expected more of us, and I share their \ndisappointment.\n  We saw this coming. This bus has been approaching the cliff for a \nyear. That ought to be time enough to turn it around, and turn it \naround without throwing students underneath it. I know many of my \ncolleagues here are trying--trying to find a long-term solution, but \ntoday we failed. Our Nation's students pay the cost of that failure.\n  For so many in my State, grants and loans make the difference. \nFederal subsidized Stafford loans are absolutely crucial, opening a \ndoor to college, to opportunity, to investing in the future. We all \nknow these students. Most have lower incomes and fewer advantages. We \nask them to work harder, and now we ask them to pay more.\n  They are folks such as Lori Cole. Lori was quoted in the Las Cruces \nSun News. She said:\n\n       I'm almost 50 years old and returned to school last year. \n     I've had to take out loans on top of my grants. I don't like \n     the rates going up but what can I do? I have a teen in \n     college and a mortgage. I have no choice but to continue with \n     my student loans if I ever want to make more than $10 an \n     hour.\n\n  They are folks such as Josh Dunne. Josh wrote the following on his \nFacebook page:\n\n       As a disabled combat vet, my wife and I who are both \n     students do not have a choice but to eat the increase . . . I \n     don't understand how they can continue to raise the rates on \n     us not only for tuition but now also the loan rate and expect \n     the amount of students to continue to go to school. Hope they \n     can figure it out for our future.\n\n  I say to Josh and to so many other students like him, I hope we can \nfigure it out too.\n  These students are struggling. Our economy is slowly recovering. Now \nis not the time to set up more barriers. Now is not the time for \ninterest rates to double, weighing down students, weighing down hard-\nworking families, weighing down the middle class.\n  The Keep Student Loans Affordable Act of 2013 would have helped, \nkeeping the interest rate at 3.4 percent for new Stafford loans for 1 \nyear and giving Congress time for a broader solution. But the problem \nis not just interest rates, it is the growing burden of student debt.\n  Higher education is at a tipping point, and we need a long-term \nplan--a plan that is sustainable, that is comprehensive. These are \ncomplicated questions that require careful answers. But one principle \nshould be clear. For fairness, for investing in our Nation's future, \ncollege should be within the reach of all American families, not just \nthe privileged few.\n  Students know how to set goals, they know how to set priorities. They \nexpect the same of us. And priorities come down to choices. The Keep \nStudent Loans Affordable Act offered a choice--to help students to work \ntoward real solutions, and we could do it by simply closing a tax \nloophole. No new tax, no new debt, just closing a tax loophole--not \nexactly a radical notion.\n  I will do all I can to ensure the Senate will find its way to long-\nterm answers. We will not give up on this issue. Seven million students \nand their families are waiting, waiting for predictability, waiting for \nmore affordable education, and control of spiraling costs. They and \ntheir families do the heavy lifting. Every day we should lend them a \nhand.\n  The average college senior has over $26,000 in debt at graduation. \nSome have much more. The burden is heavy enough. We should not be \nadding to it now.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, this issue is very important to millions of \nAmericans, and one with which I am too familiar. I think I have shared \nthis in the past, but I will share it again.\n  Obviously, my parents didn't make a lot of money. So I would not have \ngone to college, I would not have gone to law school had it not been \nfor Federal financial aid, both in the form of Pell grants, loans, and \nwork-study. All of these programs opened that door for me. In fact, I \ndon't think any of my siblings could have gone to college without some \nassistance.\n  The point is that I know how important these programs are to \nAmericans. In fact, when I was elected to the Senate in 2010, I still \nhad a student loan that was over $100,000. I was fortunate to write a \nbook--which is now available in paperback, if anyone is interested--and \nwith the proceeds that I made from that, I was able to pay off that \nloan. Had it not been for that, I am not sure when I would have been \nable to pay off my student loan for law school.\n\n[[Page S5596]]\n\n  Early on, when I had multiple student loans from both undergrad and \nlaw school and the private loans I had to take out for the bar study, \nthere were months where my student loan payments were higher than \nanything else I was paying. At its peak, it was about $1,400 a month. \nThat is with a graduate and a law degree, and making what most people \nwould consider a pretty good living. Even with that, it was a real \nload.\n  Obviously, that is at the high end of the spectrum, but even if you \ntalk about the average loan debt in America today being around $25,000 \nor $26,000, the evidence is clear this is having an impact on \ngraduates.\n  So you graduate from college, you have the student loan debt around \nyour neck, and it actually prevents you from doing things like starting \nyour life, buying a home. In some instances, if you fall behind on your \npayments, it starts to hurt your credit rating. The evidence continues \nto grow that a significant percentage of young Americans are facing a \nchallenge that no Americans before us have faced with regard to this \nsort of student loan debt that hangs over their heads.\n  So, clearly, we have to figure out a permanent solution--not a 1-year \nsolution but a long-term solution--on the issue of student loan rates. \nThat is an important part of this debate, but here is what I think is \nmissing from this debate; that is, an open acknowledgement that what we \nhave today in higher education as it is currently structured is \nbecoming increasingly and inexplicably unaffordable. And that is the \npart that isn't being discussed.\n  The fundamental problem isn't the loans. The fundamental problem is \nthe tuition rates that continue to climb across this country. In fact, \naccording to the Wall Street Journal today, institutions of higher \neducation grew their revenue faster than inflation from 2005 to 2011. \nOf course, the spending also grew. How many other parts of our economy \ngrew their revenue and their spending at a pace faster than inflation \nover the last decade?\n  The evidence is that every time we increase the amount of student aid \nthat is available in both Pell grants and in loan programs, that is \njust eaten up by higher tuition rates.\n  Now, as a former State legislator in Florida, that was a battle we \nhad every year because the universities said they needed higher tuition \nin order to retain quality faculty, et cetera. To some extent, I \nimagine some of that is true. But at the end of the day, there comes a \npoint--especially in our public institutions--where quality but also \naffordability have to meet. We cannot continue to price people out of \nhigher education in this country because it is inextricably linked to \nour future well-being.\n  There are two fundamental problems that face our economy. No. 1 is we \ndon't have an economy that is growing fast enough, producing the kind \nof middle-class jobs that allow people to have the kind of lifestyle \nall Americans want. The other problem is we have a skills gap in \nAmerica where a growing number of people simply have not acquired the \nskills they need for 21st-century middle-class jobs. The only way to \nclose that skills gap is through education--and particularly higher \neducation.\n  What I would argue today is that the model of higher education we \nhave in place today, largely based on 19th- and 20th-century models, is \nbroken. It no longer lives up to the reality of the 21st century.\n  For example, many of the higher paying jobs in the middle class today \ndon't require a 4-year degree from a liberal arts college. They require \nless than 2 years or a 2-year degree program that you could get at a \ncommunity college.\n  There are other things available to us in terms of how we can \nincentivize or reform our higher education programs. We should look at \naccreditation reform.\n  Right now, in order to get student loans or aid from the Federal \nGovernment, you have to go to an institution that is accredited. \nTraditionally, these are the 4-year or 2-year institutions. But there \nare now alternatives available to us, things that we weren't doing a \nfew years ago.\n  No. 1, we should rely on community colleges, which, by the way, are a \ntreasure in this country. The services that community colleges provide \nstudents to get 2-year degrees--in fact, some community colleges are in \nthe 4-year degree program, and they have tailored programs that allow \npeople to go to school while they continue to work. That is an \nimportant part of the backbone.\n  It is also an extraordinary part of retraining people. You might have \na job, and all of a sudden that job doesn't exist anymore, and you have \nto get retrained in a new skill or a new trade. Community colleges are \nan important part of that component.\n  It goes beyond that though. Career and technical education, for the \nlife of me, I do not understand why we have stigmatized that in this \ncountry; why we have created this idea that unless you get a 4-year \ndegree or more that you are somehow not successful when we know we have \na shortage of people we need to be trained in the skills and trades we \nonce used to do in this country. We should get back to some of that. We \nshould encourage that, quite frankly, even before the college level.\n  Why can't we graduate kids from high school with an industry \ncertification and a career in a trade, so when they graduate high \nschool they get a diploma and they are industry certified to go to \nwork?\n  We have an example of that on a smaller scale in south Florida, where \na friend of mine actually takes high school kids and begins to train \nthem as BMW technicians. They go to school in the morning for a couple \nof hours. Then they go to the shop and get trained. When they graduate \nfrom high school, they are BMW-certified technicians. Within a year \nafter that, they can get even higher levels of accreditation, and some \nof them start making $35,000, $40,000 a year out of high school.\n  Why aren't we doing more of that? Instead, we leave kids trapped. \nThey feel as though they are studying things they don't like and don't \nspeak to them. They drop out of high school. They languish in the \neconomy for 10 or 15 years, and then sometimes they will find \nthemselves in a for-profit college or some other program to try to get \ntrained.\n  Let's avoid all of that. Let's allow these high school students and \nothers across this country with an opportunity to study something they \nenjoy and they love and to get the needed skills so they can avoid all \nof that.\n  We also have this new revolution in massive online coursework. Now, \nnot every course can be taken that way, but we now have the ability to \nallow people to actually have self-directed learning, to use the \nInternet platforms that are available so they can take a course in \npolitical science from Harvard and economics from Yale. You can sit \nthere and actually put your own course work together. This is still \nbeing developed, but this is an important part of our future \ninnovation--the ability to bring the in-classroom learning to the \nstudent, not just require them to sit there for lectures for an hour \nand a half in a classroom when they can easily get it online and it can \nbe tailored to their work schedule, to their workload, to their needs.\n\n  Beyond that, innovations, in terms of giving people credit for work \nexperience or life experience--we see that colleges are doing that now \nwhere you can go in and say: This is what I have done for the last 20 \nyears of my life, and you get credit for that work because you have \nlife experience and work experience in a field. They don't make you sit \nthere and spend a bunch of money on electives you are never going to \nuse and don't really need because they want you to be ``well rounded'' \nbut all it does, in fact, is drive up the cost of your education.\n  I don't know about you, but in the last 4 years of my degree I was \nsearching for electives to take because I had to have electives. I \ndon't remember what some of those electives were, but I paid for them \nwith student loans and Pell grants. I would much rather have gotten my \ndegree in the things I needed to know so I could have moved on to law \nschool and done that there.\n  These are some of the ideas we have in terms of how we should \nrevolutionize our higher education system to reflect the needs and the \nrealities of the 21st century. The fact is that we now have a challenge \nbefore us unlike anything we have ever had. Industries are now evolving \non a yearly basis. Most Americans are going to have to\n\n[[Page S5597]]\n\nbe retrained at some point in their lives on a new skill because that \nis the pace of change, and we need to have infrastructure in place to \nprovide that for people in a way that is affordable.\n  It reminds me of a story of a friend I had who was one of the parents \non one of my son's teams, and the mom was always struggling. She was \nalways the first one to get laid off at her office. She worked \nprimarily as a receptionist at a dental clinic or medical clinic, got a \nlittle bit into billing. What she really needs to become and would like \nto become is an ultrasound technician so she can make a little bit more \nmoney, have a little job security, and provide her kids with the \nopportunities she wants them to have. The problem she has is that she \nhas to work 8 hours a day. How is she going to do that and go to school \nand get that training?\n  In many parts of this country we do not have the infrastructure in \nplace for that to happen and the financial aid programs both on the \nloan side and Pell grant side do not provide the flexibility to allow \nthem to do it in the most cost-effective way. To that end I have \nproposed a number of pieces of legislation. Most of them are \nbipartisan. I have worked with Senator Wyden and others on the Student \nRight to Know Before You Go Act. That basically means that before you \ntake out these loans, you are going to be provided meaningful \ninformation: This is how much it is going to cost to go to school here, \nthis is how much people who graduate with this degree from this college \nmake when they graduate, and this is how much you are going to owe. You \ncan still take the course, you can still major in that, but you deserve \nto know. You deserve to know that if you are going to owe $20,000 and \nyou are only going to make $20,000 a year when you graduate with this \ndegree, it will take you a long time to pay it, if ever.\n  Students have a right to know before they go. That is the Student \nRight to Know Before You Go Act.\n  I also offered the Higher Education and Skills Obtainment Act, which \nwill create one universal tax credit for higher education, and it will \nproduce measurable savings, some of which can be redirected to the \nshortfalls in the Pell Grant Program that are coming up. The bill \noffers one tax credit for students who are most in need, giving \nstudents the ability to avoid navigating a confusing maze of temporary \ntax provisions worth different amounts for different income thresholds.\n  By the way, people involved in job skill training would also have \naccess to this universal credit as opposed to all these different \ncredits floating out there now that people do not fully understand how \nto use.\n  There are other ideas I have proposed. I have introduced legislation \nwith Senator Coons that provides an innovative partnership that will \ncreate an interactive source of information for students to be able to \ncreate college savings accounts. Studies have shown that American \nchildren with college savings accounts in their name are seven times \nmore likely to go to college than students without one. This bill will \ncombine innovative student support tools with savings accounts to \npromote access for low-income students in our country so they put some \nmoney aside to be able to do this.\n  The fact is that today's 21st-century student requires a higher \neducation system that best suits their needs, whether it is in the form \nof a traditional university, a community college, a career or technical \neducation, workforce retraining programs, or a combination of all of \nthese.\n  I am not saying this is not an important debate to have because it \nis. It is facing people right now. But I hope at some point we will \nlook at our student aid programs and what we can do to tailor them to \nthe 21st century, to all of the innovations that are now available to \nus to allow people to gain the knowledge they need to become \ncompetitive in a 21st-century economy. That is going to require, in my \nopinion, a significant restructuring on how our higher education is \ndeveloped.\n  This is not a threat to liberal arts colleges or a transitional 4-\nyear college education. That will always be a part of our system. It is \nan important part of our system. But that does not work for everybody, \nnot because they are not smart enough but because they have a job \nduring the day, because they are raising three kids. If you are a \nsingle mom with three kids and a full-time job, you cannot just leave \nall that behind and go to Gainesville, FL, to the University of Florida \nfor 4 years. You need the ability to get that degree that allows you to \ndo that. I lived that. My sister had to do that. She went back to \nschool in her thirties and finished her college degree and then got her \nmaster's to become a teacher, and today she is an assistant principal, \nall the while raising two boys on her own. She would not have been able \nto do that if the only choice she had available to her was the \nUniversity of Florida, Florida State, because she couldn't just move. \nThat doesn't work for someone in that part of their lives.\n  We need to have answers. So I hope we will spend some time focusing \non what we can do and reforming the way we accredit colleges, \nparticularly when it comes to student financial aid, and in the way we \nstructure our financial aid programs so that the education system meets \nthe needs of our 21st-century students and not the other way around.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from New \nHampshire is going to go next. I ask unanimous consent that the time \nuntil 5 p.m. be equally divided and controlled between the two leaders \nor their designees, that Senators be permitted to speak therein for up \nto 10 minutes each, and that any time in a quorum be equally divided \nbetween Democrats and Republicans.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  MS. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about an issue we are \nall very concerned about, particularly in my home State of New \nHampshire; that is, the rising student loan rates. In fact, one study \nthat looked at it for the class of 2011 found that for New Hampshire, \nthe average load of debt for the class of 2011 was $32,000--over \n$32,000.\n  Like the Senator from Florida, I have experienced it personally as \nwell. I would not have been able to get a law degree or to have the \neducation that I have without the ability to take out student loans--\nand only paid them off, fortunately, right as we had our first child. \nSo this was something that--basically, I used to call it ``I had a \nmortgage to pay'' to pay off my student loans. But I was grateful for \nthe opportunity to get those loans and get the education that I was \nable to receive. We want to make sure all students are able to pursue \nhigher education in the most affordable way possible.\n  Here is where we are today. This is such a complete, typical \nWashington deal. We just voted on a proposal on the floor, and that \nproposal is a 1-year fix. It only applies to 40 percent of student \nloans. We would be back again next year--like Groundhog Day--trying to \nfix this problem again. It is a complete Washington deal in this way.\n  There actually has been a bipartisan proposal that has Members of \nboth parties coming together. What happened is we saw that the \nPresident put forward a proposal as to how to deal with the increase in \nrates on July 1. The House Republicans had a proposal on how to deal \nwith those rates. I was with Secretary Duncan at a hearing, and I asked \nhim about that, and he said: They are not too far apart. Can't we come \ntogether? There was an opportunity for compromise.\n  As a result, a group of Senators got together here. I commend Senator \nManchin, Senator Alexander, Senator Burr, Senator Carper, Senator \nCoburn, and Senator King. They sat down and came up with a permanent \nsolution to try to make sure student loan rates would not rise from \nwhere they are right now. This solution, of course, would decrease the \nrates for almost every student and put a cap on consolidated loans and \nalso, most importantly, is not a 1-year fix so that we are back here \nagain like Groundhog Day putting students and parents in a very \ndifficult situation, not knowing how to plan, and educational \ninstitutions--everyone in the tough situation of not knowing what is \ngoing to happen and thinking that they are facing a dramatic increase \nin student loan rates.\n  I think the American people are very tired of what happens here and \nthe\n\n[[Page S5598]]\n\ngamesmanship played in Washington. Here is the unfortunate thing. We \nhad the vote on the 1-year fix.\n  By the way, I thought the Washington Post addressed that 1-year fix \nvery well this morning in its editorial in which it said that lawmakers \nshould ``reject this pathetic non-solution and put their efforts \ninstead into finalizing a compromise plan.''\n  There was a compromise plan that Senators from both sides of the \naisle have worked on. I am a proud cosponsor of that plan. Yet we are \nnot being offered a vote on that plan. That is why I say this is a \ntypical Washington deal.\n  I can understand why the American people would be so frustrated that \na bipartisan proposal that would prevent the loan rates from doubling \nwould not receive a vote on the floor of the Senate. It is a proposal \nwhere Senators from both sides of the aisle have tried to take what the \nPresident wanted and to take what was done by the House Republicans and \ncome up with a very reasonable agreement that is a solution that does \nnot just leave us here in the same position next year. It doesn't just \naddress 40 percent of student loans. It addresses all student loans and \nputs us in a situation where we would have a solution that would be \nbipartisan and would give students certainty. It would make sure their \nrates do not double as they did on July 1. Yet it does not even receive \na vote on the floor of the Senate. That is what is wrong with \nWashington.\n  I hope the majority leader will reconsider. He may not like the \nproposal. I understand. But to not give it a vote on the floor of the \nSenate, where it has bipartisan support, is absolutely wrong. It \ndeserves a vote. It deserves a thoughtful vote given that it has \nbipartisan support and it is very close to the proposal that was put \nforward by the President of the United States.\n  I hope that we will end the gamesmanship on this important issue, \nthat we can address it, that bipartisan proposals like the one I just \ntalked about will get a vote on the floor of the Senate, and that we \nwill resolve this issue on behalf of students and parents as well, for \nwhom I know this is causing a lot of unnecessary consternation. To not \ngive a proposal that has bipartisan support a vote, at a minimum, seems \nto me just wrong. It is what is wrong with Washington. I hope the \nmajority leader will at least give it the vote it deserves. I hope we \ncan come to an agreement on this important issue.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n                           SH Energy Security\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I take this time to speak on the floor of \nthe Senate to express my disappointment in last week's district court \ndecision on the Cardin-Lugar provision of the SEC rule. An amendment \noffered by Senator Lugar and me on the Dodd-Frank legislation imposed \ncertain transparencies on extractive industries. It was a pretty simple \nposition. It said that those companies that are registered on the SEC \nthat are involved in extraction of minerals would be required to \ndisclose on a project-by-project basis the details of those contracts.\n  We did that for many reasons. We did it because we thought \ntransparency is right. We did it in order to deal with energy security \nso that we know the types of contracts that are being entered into. We \ndid it so investors would have information in order to decide whether \nthey wanted to invest in the stock.\n  The United States has been in the forefront of transparency, and this \ndecision will delay implementation of a vital transparency rule that \nwill shine much needed sunlight on information designed to protect \ninvestors and to promote U.S. energy security.\n  The Cardin-Lugar amendment and the SEC rule are critical to achieving \nimportant U.S. policy objectives. These objectives include protecting \nU.S. interests in both national and energy security. Why do I say that? \nHaving transparency in what the extractive industries are doing makes \nit more likely we will have stable energy sources globally. Stable \nenergy sources are critically important to our national security \ninterests. These provisions are important for our national security. It \nalso ensures investors awareness and protection. If you are going to \ninvest in a stock of an oil company or a mineral company, you have the \nright to know where they are doing business. You have the right to know \nwhat countries they are doing business in and the specific contracts \nthey enter into so you can make the right decision as an investor. That \nis why the SEC rules make sense.\n\n  Lastly, it promotes America's core principles of transparency, \nintegrity, and good governance worldwide. It is interesting that we \nsometimes talk about the mineral wealth of a country as being a \nresource curse. Although they have wealth, that wealth is taken by the \nelite of the country and used to finance corruption, which just adds to \nthe misery of the people.\n  Some of the wealthiest nations that exist as far as minerals are \nconcerned have some of the greatest poverty in the world. Well, the \nprovision Senator Lugar and I coauthored was an attempt to deal with \nthat and an attempt to deal with good governance. If we can trace the \nmoney, we have a better chance to end corruption, develop good \ngovernance, and stable regimes.\n  The district court's ruling of API v. SEC, which sends the rule back \nto the SEC, is disappointing. The rule is flawed because the court \ncompletely misread not only the statute but the clear congressional \ndesire of the statute. The statute provision was for transparency, and \nyet the court's ruling strikes down the SEC rule which implements that \ntransparency. The court spent a tremendous amount of time addressing \nthe issue of public disclosure of company reports. The whole purpose of \nsection 1504 was to provide transparency to investors and citizens \nabout payments made to the government.\n  Why would Congress write a law to increase transparency for investors \nand then allow the SEC to keep the reports secret? Congress was clear \nin the letter and the spirit of the law that this information should be \nin the public domain.\n  On the issue of the host country exception, over the very lengthy \ncomment period for the rule, the SEC was not presented with one \nconcrete example from industry about a specific law or contract that \nwould prohibit these types of disclosures. In fact, examples are to the \ncontrary, including the fact that companies such as Norwegian oil giant \nStatoil regularly report their payments to countries such as Angola and \nChina--where industry says prohibitions exist--yet that company had no \nnegative repercussions. The API is trying to muddy the waters by having \nthe SEC address problems that the industry has failed to prove exists.\n  The United States has been a leader on transparency in the extractive \nindustries. It is the district court that has now put a hurdle on that \ntransparency. The district court's decision is not only contrary to the \nlaw, it is contrary to what is happening globally today.\n  The EU has already enacted a law requiring the same payment \ndisclosure that section 1504 requires on a project and company level \nwithout exceptions.\n  In a summit last month, the G8 issued a communique unequivocally \nbacking mandatory disclosure. Canada said it will develop mandatory \ndisclosures in 2 years. The Canadian mining industry endorsed that \nprovision. Despite the oil industry's continued fight in the U.S. \ncourt, the overwhelming momentum is on the side of mandatory \ndisclosure. Why? Because of national security. Why? Because investors \nhave a right to know. Why? Because it is the right thing for good \ngovernance.\n  Despite this setback, let me make it clear: We will not give up. This \nlaw still stands, and the SEC has many options to appeal the decision \nor revise the rule. The SEC must make sure it finishes the job.\n  As Senator Levin, Senator Lugar, and I stated in our amicus brief in \nthis case:\n\n       Resource companies can believe whatever they wish and make \n     any communication they wish about their payments to foreign \n     governments. ``The resource curse,'' or the benefit or costs \n     of transparency; they have done so throughout this process. \n     What resource companies may not do is impede the power of the \n     legislative branch to require disclosure of objective \n     information to fulfill compelling public policy objectives, \n     including the strengthening of American national and energy \n     security and investor protections.\n\n  That is exactly what that provision did. Congress exercised its \nright, as the\n\n[[Page S5599]]\n\nlegislative branch, to require transparency for good public reasons. \nMembers of Congress and the administration on a bipartisan basis have \nlong supported transparency through comprehensive disclosure of \npayments made by resource companies. That support will continue as we \nwork with the SEC to implement this important law.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        American Jobs Matter Act\n\n  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, I rise today to speak on the American \nJobs Matter Act. This legislation was introduced by myself, Senator \nBlumenthal, Senator Brown, and Senator Merkley.\n  No one is going to disagree that this country has the greatest, most \npowerful military in the world. Although the Defense Department has not \nbeen spared from the draconian cuts included in the sequester, we still \nhave a robust defense budget. Annual defense spending has grown from \n$287 billion in 2001 to over $700 billion today. Today it is hovering \nat around 6 percent of GDP.\n  A significant portion of these Federal defense dollars are used to \npurchase manufactured goods that make our military the preeminent \nfighting force in the world. In order to have the best military, you \nneed the best people--we certainly have that--and the best stuff, which \nwe have as well.\n  It is not debatable that our industrial base--going all the way back \nto the iconic assembly lines that churned out the machinery which was \nused to defeat fascism during World War II to today's shipyards that \nare producing our nuclear-powered submarines--is not still the best in \nthe world. But 20, 30, or 50 years from now are we still going to be \nthe best? That is the question before us today and the question this \nlegislation seeks to answer.\n  Over the past 5 years the Department of Defense has cumulatively \nspent about $700 billion on manufactured goods. Over that same period \nof time, the United States has lost 1.7 million manufacturing jobs.\n  Why is this? Obviously, there is no single answer to this question, \nbut it is telling that during this period of time DOD has spent $124 \nbillion purchasing goods from foreign manufacturers. Some of these \nforeign manufacturers are in countries that are our allies today and \nwill always be our allies, but some of these foreign manufacturers come \nfrom countries that are not our allies today and will never be our \nallies.\n  The bottom line is that when we outsource defense-manufacturing \ncapabilities--either to our allies or to our adversaries--manufacturers \nshut down in this country and our capability to create and make \ncritical defense items for our soldiers vanishes. The erosion of our \nindustrial base kills jobs, and it jeopardizes our national security.\n  There are countless examples of how these spending decisions harm our \nindustrial base, but I will give two examples that affect my home State \nof Connecticut.\n  In Waterbury, CT, there is a company that makes the metal tubing \nwhich goes into every ship the Navy builds. It holds the wires and the \nconduits. It is an incredibly complicated product, such that there are \nonly two or three companies in the world that make this. For over 150 \nyears this company in Waterbury, CT, has employed people in my State \nand kept our Navy equipped with the tubing it needs.\n  Over the years, the Navy has started to favor a foreign competitor \nwho, frankly, has a history of engaging in unfair trade practices in \norder to undermine its competitors. They are offering the Navy a \nslightly more discounted price than the American company. So from the \nNavy's perspective, it is tempting to award that bid to an overseas \ncontractor, but the monetary costs to the Navy cannot be the only thing \nwe look at.\n  First of all, if this company in Waterbury goes under, then we will \nforever lose the ability to make this critical defense item in the \nUnited States. The country from which we are buying this equipment \nmight be our ally today, but who knows what the case will be 10 or 20 \nyears down the line. The fact is, you cannot just recreate the \nexpertise, personnel, and machinery that makes this specific type of \nmetal tubing.\n  Second, even if the Navy gets a 5- or 10- or 15-percent discount on \nthis particular item, that benefit to the Navy essentially disappears \nwhen you look at the overall cost to the U.S. taxpayer because when \nthose jobs are lost in Waterbury, CT, those men and women start \nqualifying for Federal benefits such as unemployment and Medicaid. We \nlose the tax revenue that comes to the local government, the State \ngovernment, and the Federal Government. And, all of a sudden, that \nsmall discount they get by going to a foreign manufacturer vanishes \nbefore their eyes.\n\n  Here is a second example and one that to a lot of Americans will be \nabsolutely maddening. We have a machine that makes dog tags. \nEssentially, we have a machine that goes out into the field and makes \nthem for soldiers. There is nothing more iconic and emblematic of the \ndanger soldiers put themselves in, the sacrifice they sometimes make, \nthan the dog tag. It has historically been made by an American-built \nmachine. But, recently, bids have been going to an Italian company that \nmakes a similar machine simply because the Italian company's machine \ncosts 3 percent less than the American machine.\n  First of all, it is not acceptable that our dog tags are not American \nmade. Second of all, that 3-percent difference is negligible when we \ncompare it to all of the money lost when those jobs disappear in the \nUnited States. How can this happen?\n  There was overwhelming bipartisan consensus when Congress passed \nsomething called the Buy American Act 75 years ago, which said we \nshould give preference to companies in the United States when we are \nbuying things for the U.S. military. I don't think anybody today \nquestions the wisdom of that act. But over the years we have built \nloophole after loophole, exception after exception, into the Buy \nAmerican Act such that sometimes a minority of the parts of a \nparticular thing we are buying for the Department of Defense comes from \nAmerican firms.\n  The real world examples I mentioned and many others have prompted me, \nalong with Senators Merkley and Brown and Blumenthal, to introduce the \nAmerican Jobs Matter Act. Here is what this legislation will do; it is \npretty simple: It will require that the Department of Defense, for the \nfirst time, has to measure domestic employment as a factor in awarding \na contract. It is a simple premise. In the same way that DOD considers \nprice and past performance when awarding work, they should also \nconsider the impact on domestic employment in the award of a contract.\n  Under this bill, our largest contractors would also have to account \nfor the expected job creation of their subcontractors, because that is \nwhere a lot of the problem is. We are not buying a lot of big goods \nthat are assembled in other countries, but the hundreds of thousands of \nparts that sometimes go into a submarine or a jet engine or a tank or a \nhumvee are often made outside of the United States. This would require \nthe contractor to present an estimate of how many jobs throughout the \nsupply chain are created here in the United States. Under this bill, \nwhen DOD gets two similar bids and one would create more American jobs \nthan the other bid would, DOD can take that into account when awarding \nthe contract.\n  Frankly, most people I talk to back in my home State of Connecticut \nthink this already happens. People assume that if past performance and \nprice are about equal, the home team should win. But, today, there is \nno law that allows military contractors to make that distinction. This \nbill would allow them, for the first time, to do that.\n  Retired U.S. Army BG John Adams recently published a study about the \nvulnerabilities in our defense supply chain. His report, which \nmentioned actually some of the specific examples I referenced, said \nthis:\n\n       The health of our manufacturing sector is inextricably \n     intertwined with our national\n\n[[Page S5600]]\n\n     security, and that the United States' national security is \n     threatened by our military's growing and dangerous reliance \n     on foreign nations for the raw materials, parts, and finished \n     products needed to defend the American people.\n\n  It is time we changed that. The American Jobs Matter Act will put our \ndefense industrial base on a stronger footing for the future.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I wish to make some comments about the \nvote we had on the floor awhile ago. I think it is time to stop holding \nthe students of this country hostage 1 year at a time. That is what the \nbill did that just got turned down for cloture. It kicked the can down \nthe road for a year. There were several Democrats who voted with the \nRepublicans on that one, because they thought it is time to stop \nkicking the can down the road.\n  How do we stop kicking the can down the road? Take a look at the \nRepublican alternative that was offered. The Democratic bill was going \nto save 40 percent of the students half of the interest rate for 1 year \nso that 3.44 percent would be their interest rate. The Republican plan \nsolves it for all students getting a loan and it solves it in \nperpetuity. It does it by making it 3 percent greater than what the \nFederal Government borrows its money at, which at the present time is \n3.66 percent. I submit 3.66 percent is not much higher than 3.44 \npercent and it is a lot less than 6.88 percent.\n  Why do we have a rise in the interest rate to 6.88 percent? The \nFederal Government, this body and the other body, and the President, \ndecided a way we could fund health care in this country would be to \ntake over the student loan business and then raise the rates to 6.88 \npercent. It provides money for the Affordable Care Act.\n  So we had a vote without having a side-by-side. Nobody got to vote on \nthe 3.66-percent interest rate for everybody in perpetuity, but we got \nto vote for the 3.44-percent interest rate, which means kicking the can \ndown the road for a year for 40 percent of the students. That is wrong.\n  Why didn't we get to vote on both of them? Well, the Republican plan \nwould have had more votes than the Democratic plan. There are people on \nthe other side who don't want to kick the can down the road and who \nunderstand the alternative is a reasonable solution to the problem. It \nwould take care of all the students and take care of them from now on, \nand it provides a solution to the problem.\n  I have to say it is pretty clever, that by bringing up this bill by \nitself and having it defeated on cloture, it solves two problems: No. \n1, they get to blame the Republicans. No. 2, the money will still be \nthere for the Affordable Care Act. That means keeping the money and \nblaming the Republicans. How can it get better than that? It can get \nbetter than that if we solve the problem for all of the kids applying \nfor loans this year, not just 40 percent of them, and solve it so they \nknow exactly where the interest rate is going to be at the time they \napply and it stays that way on their loan for the whole time they have \nthe loan.\n  In future years, as others apply, the interest rate may be higher. \nThe rate will be the same as whatever rate the Federal Government pays \nto borrow money. We are not going to be able to borrow at the low rates \nwe are borrowing at now, but students will get the same break everybody \nelse does, at just the 3-percent higher interest rate.\n  I notice the majority leader changed his vote to no, and that is so \nhe can bring up this bill again. Why would we bring up this bill again \nwithout having the alternative bill so people can vote for it, which I \nthink might pass? It is so we can be blamed one more time.\n  This isn't supposed to be a blame game around here. This is supposed \nto be about finding common ground and getting things done. I think \nthere is some common ground; otherwise, there wouldn't be some \nDemocrats joining with Republicans on a bill Republicans proposed, but \nthat is not the way we need to do bills anyway. We need to have the \nchairman and the ranking member of the appropriate committee sit down \nand work out a basic bill that can then be amended on the floor--first \namended in committee. We are not going through a regular process on a \nlot of these bills and yet we should be. I assume it would go to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. Maybe, since it \ndeals with the health care act, it would go to the Committee on \nFinance. At any rate, there would be an appropriate committee for it to \ngo to, perhaps both the Finance Committee and the HELP Committee, but \nit didn't come to either. Neither proposal came to that committee.\n  It is time to quit making deals around here and start legislating. \nThat is the way things have been done in America for a couple of \nhundred years and it is time we did that again. We can get solutions if \nwe go through the regular process.\n  It is time to stop kicking the can down the road. I hope we can reach \na solution. I hope we get to vote on both proposals and we can see \nwhere a majority of the votes go. Slowly, people are coming to realize \nthat a solution for 100 percent of the students taking out loans is \nbetter than a solution for 40 percent of the students taking out loans, \nand one that goes on in perpetuity is better than one that goes on for \n1 year.\n  Every year in July we say to the students, Your interest rate is \ngoing to go up unless we take action, and then we show how one side or \nthe other doesn't want to take the action.\n  We have to get this problem solved. There are a lot of other aspects \nof higher education that need to be solved as well. It is time for that \nbill to be reauthorized, and it should go through the regular process \nas well.\n  I hope we quit blaming each other and get something done. I \npersonally like the long-term solution for 100 percent of the students \ninstead of half of a solution for 40 percent of the students.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 15 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Employment Agenda\n\n  Mr. COONS. I rise today to talk about something we do not hear enough \nabout on the Senate floor these days: Jobs, jobs, jobs. During the 2012 \nelection, the monthly jobs numbers were even more closely watched and \nanalyzed than the daily polls, but ever since it is as if Congress has \nforgotten there are still 12 million Americans looking for work, and \nfrom my home State of Delaware alone, 32,000 Delawareans are out of a \njob.\n  Sure, we are eager to hear if the unemployed numbers nudged up or \ndown a tenth of a percent. But maybe Washington is all too willing to \nput the unemployed on the back burner. We are adding nearly 200,000 \njobs a month now, according to the most recent jobs report. That is \ncertainly progress. But one of the things I found most chilling was an \nanalysis that said at this pace, it will be 2017 before our Nation gets \nclose to full employment again.\n  Is that acceptable to the Presiding Officer? That is certainly not \nacceptable to me. When is Washington, when is Congress, going to get \nback to working on behalf of those still looking for work?\n  The jobs numbers that are typically reported mask an even deeper and \nmore concerning structural problem in our economy as well. Almost 40 \npercent of those currently unemployed, about 4.3 million Americans, are \ndescribed as the long-term unemployed. These are folks who have been \nout of work 6 months or more. Short-term unemployment has dropped, but \nlong-term unemployment remains persistently high and troubling. The \nlonger a worker is unemployed, the more difficult it becomes to\n\n[[Page S5601]]\n\nfind a job, whether it is because there is a stigma attached to being \nunemployed or because their skills need to be updated or because we \nneed something to help lift their spirits and make them successful in \njob interviews.\n  Across all of these different reasons, in my view we need stronger, \nmore engaged, more agile interventions by the Federal Government, by \nState and local governments, in our economy and in support for those \nseeking work to help them find employment.\n  I think we need to act swiftly on measures to improve skills \ntraining, job placement, and collaboration with State and local labor \nagencies. The fact is the longer we wait to deal with long-term \nemployment, the tougher it will be to help these folks get back to \nwork. Yet many of us here in Congress apparently cannot or will not \nfocus on unemployment, long term or short term, much less on other \nmeasures to stimulate our economy. Is it any wonder the American people \nthink Congress is not even trying anymore?\n  Here in the Senate, we know that while deeply challenged by \nfilibusters and ideological fights and caucus politics, we are still \nmanaging to get big things done. It would be an overstatement to say we \nare making it all work, that it is easy. But thanks to a contingent of \nRepublicans and Democrats here who are working in good faith together, \nwe have been able to make some meaningful bipartisan progress. The \nSenate passed a bipartisan farm bill that would have taken steps to \nmodernize our Nation's agricultural system, which supports 16 million \njobs, and actually reduce the deficit by $24 billion.\n  What a remarkable trifecta of accomplishments: supporting one of the \nworld's most cutting-edge agricultural economies, supporting \nsignificant job creation, and significantly cutting our deficit. What \nis not to love in that farm bill? Well, the House passed a series of \namendments that eliminated our hard-fought bipartisan compromises and \nhas effectively doomed the bill.\n  Similarly, the Senate here passed a bipartisan Water Resources \nDevelopment Act to modernize America's water infrastructure all over \nthe country, including drinking water, wastewater treatment, shipping \nchannels. It got 83 votes here out of 100 in the Senate. It is being \nslow-walked in the House over ideological objections about the \nempowerment of the government on environmental authority.\n  After a historic committee markup, after the Congressional Budget \nOffice said it would reduce the deficit by $150 billion in the first \ndecade and $700 billion the second, this Senate passed an \noverwhelmingly bipartisan immigration reform bill--I think one of the \nbiggest accomplishments of this Congress. This Senate passed an \noverwhelmingly bipartisan immigration reform bill, only for it to \nlanguish stubbornly in the partisan hunger games that are today's House \nof Representatives. The headline in Politico from today reads \n``Immigration Reform Heads For Slow Death.''\n  Americans are frustrated with this, and so am I.\n  The House of Representatives has sadly become wholly dysfunctional, \nparalyzed by partisan civil war over the fundamental question of \nwhether government should be an instrument of good in people's lives. \nThat is the key here. Sadly, the fighting within the Republican Party \nis dividing that caucus internally. On the one hand you have genuinely \nprincipled Republican lawmakers who believe in this legislative \nprocess, who are committed to working collaboratively on the challenges \nour Nation faces. These folks have worked with me and others and \ncosponsored many bills I have introduced and others to try to make a \ndifference here. On the other hand you have an antigovernment, frankly \nanti-Obama faction that took over the House in 2010. Their numbers are \nsmall but their voices are loud. It is their core belief that Congress \nand the Federal Government cannot and should not legislate, that \ngovernment has no meaningful or constructive role to play in our \nsociety.\n  I worry that that belief informs their tactics of stall and delay, \ninvestigate and repeal. The Huffington Post reported this week that \nthis Congress, in particular this House, has had only 15 bills signed \ninto law so far--15. You have to go back a long time to find a Congress \nthat has passed fewer pieces of legislation, between House and Senate, \nthan this one, the 113th Congress.\n  Democrats and many Republican lawmakers look at this as an \nembarrassment in a time of enormous challenges overseas and at home for \nus to take so few actions together. But the tea party and some \nconservative ideologues look at it as an accomplishment and say that \nany compromise is a four-letter word, especially if the alternative is \nbroad or progressive legislation. So what we have is a fight between \nfolks who would, for example, trim the scope of funding for the Federal \nDepartment of Education, and folks who would fundamentally think there \nshould not be a Department of Education. That is a fight in which I \nthink the American people do not win.\n\n  An opposition party is a great thing, a necessary thing for our \ndemocracy. But this opposition party within the opposition party is \ncrippling this Senate, this House, this Congress. By my count it has \nbeen 90 weeks since a Republican filibuster blocked a jobs bill that \nwas designed to keep teachers, police officers, and first responders on \nthe job. It has been 87 weeks since a filibuster blocked a bill to put \nAmericans to work through investments in infrastructure, and 51 weeks \nsince a Republican filibuster blocked a bill to give tax breaks that \nbring jobs home and end a tax deduction for companies that move jobs \noverseas. Frankly, just 42 weeks ago, a Republican filibuster in this \nChamber blocked a bill to help 20,000 veterans find new jobs.\n  In the other Chamber, it is no better. The House of Representatives \nhas now voted 37 times to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The New York \nTimes did the math. The House has spent 15 percent of its time voting \nto repeal the so-called ObamaCare. In May, the Congressional Budget \nOffice, which is the arbiter of what is or what is not necessary, the \nscorekeeper, actually said the House has voted to repeal the Affordable \nCare Act so many times it will no longer issue new scores as it \nattempts over and over to achieve what seems to be its most basic \npurpose: repeal. That is how much time and energy this House has wasted \non this particular project, that could be better invested in finding \nways to implement this bill more responsibly.\n  How much time do we waste here in this Chamber, running out the \nclock, waiting for 30 hours for cloture to ripen, because we cannot get \nsimple agreements to move forward? I know this is not what our side or \nour leadership wants. I suspect it is not what most Senators of either \nparty want. It is certainly not what our constituents want. What should \nbe taking days is taking weeks. What should take weeks is taking months \nor even years.\n  We are not here to run out the clock. We are here to make a \ndifference, or at least that is why our constituents sent us here. \nIdeological obstruction has rendered this Washington, this Congress, so \nineffective, so inert, that when it comes to helping people get back to \nwork in Delaware, my colleagues Senator Carper and Congressman Carney \nand I have taken an unusual action for Members of Congress. We have \nstarted hosting job fairs. We have used the power of the office to \nconvene when we cannot use the power of the office to legislate. We \nhave had actually 13 job fairs up and down our State in all three of \nour counties in Delaware. We have watched as hundreds of folks have \ncome and had the opportunity to apply for and pursue new employment.\n  Congress should be taking a clue from that effort. We should recommit \nourselves to helping our innovative small businesses grow, to helping \nopen new markets for American goods, to helping Americans find good \njobs, and to supporting those who have not been quite so lucky yet.\n  I think we need an agenda, an agenda that focuses on five areas where \ninvestment now will lead to new jobs, not just for today or tomorrow \nbut long into the future. First should be education. We have to do \nmore, as I said before, to help the long-term unemployed get \nprofessional skills to thrive in this job market. We have to do more to \nprepare young people for the challenges of the modern economy.\n  I have a bill, the American Dream Accounts Act, cosponsored by \nSenator\n\n[[Page S5602]]\n\nRubio and others, that would help get our at-risk kids through school \nand into college.\n  We should also support innovative cutting-edge research. I have a \nbill that would make the R tax credit permanent and open it to \nstartups. It is called the Startup Innovation Credit Act, which has \nbeen cosponsored by a wide range of Senators: Enzi and Rubio, Blunt and \nMoran, Stabenow, Kaine and Schumer, a truly bipartisan bill.\n  I am proud to be working with Senator Alexander of Tennessee on, \nhopefully, strengthening and reauthorizing the America COMPETES Act.\n  The third area we should be focusing on is tied to us doing more to \nharness the resurgence of American manufacturing. There are a dozen \nsmart bills--many with bipartisan support--that have been introduced, \ntaken up, and passed in the Senate that are currently languishing in \nthe House. We should work to make a real difference for America's \nmanufacturers.\n  Fourth, we have to help grow our economy by growing our markets, by \ngrowing our opportunities around the world. As chairman of the African \nAffairs Subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I have \nworked across the aisle to push forward bills that would create new \nmarket opportunities for American businesses.\n  With Senators Durbin and Boozman, I have reintroduced a bill which \naims to triple the amount of U.S. exports to Africa over the next 10 \nyears.\n  Fifth and last, an area on which I thought all of us would be able to \ncome together, is investing in infrastructure. The BUILD Act, \nintroduced and taken up in the last Congress--which I hope we will soon \nmove to--would create a national infrastructure financing vehicle, an \ninfrastructure bank, if you would, to help bring private funds into \nvital infrastructure projects. It has had bipartisan support in the \npast from the Chamber of Commerce to the AFL-CIO.\n  It is my wish we can take it and use it as a vehicle to help the 12 \nmillion people who are looking for work find the jobs they need.\n  I have a simple question: When is Washington, when is Congress going \nto get back to work on behalf of those still looking for jobs? How much \nlonger will we wait? How much more clock will we run out? How much more \ntime will we waste?\n  It is my prayer that this Chamber, this country, finds a way to work \ntogether to get over this partisanship that has paralyzed our political \nprocess.\n  In closing, I wish to say a word of thanks to colleagues I have seen \nwho have come to join me in the Chamber, Senator McCain and Senator \nFlake of Arizona. They are exemplars of the folks who have worked \ntogether across the aisle to find solutions to some of the big problems \nfacing us.\n  They worked tirelessly with Democratic colleagues to put together the \narchitecture of the bipartisan immigration bill that was passed through \nthis Chamber in recent weeks. It is my hope that others in the other \nChamber will see that spirit and take this opportunity to take up and \npass legislation to put America on a track toward growth. There are 12 \nmillion reasons for us to do that, 12 million Americans looking for \nhelp getting back to work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I rise today with a heavy heart to remember 19 brave men, \n19 grieving families, 19 empty places in the Prescott community that \nwill never be filled. Arizona and the entire Nation, shares in their \nsorrow.\n  The loss of the members of the Granite Mountain Hotshots and the loss \nto the community was both terrible and swift. We are right to ask why.\n  Why were they taken from us? Why were these seemingly fearless men, \nthese exemplars of all that is brave, good, and decent in men, choose a \njob that causes them to run into an inferno just as everyone else is \nrunning away from it?\n  In answering that, we get an essence of who these men are, these 19 \nlives of achievement and purpose, courage and discipline.\n  From all corners of America, they came together in Prescott with a \nsingle goal in mind: protecting people and property. To do this, they \ntrained relentlessly, willingly took the worst that Mother Nature could \nthrow at them, all to save lives and homes for their friends and their \nneighbors.\n  They did so accepting the risks, embracing them even, in the words of \nthe old hymn, ``calm in distress, in danger bold.''\n  They did so in the name of community.\n  Americans are characterized by the world, by our sense of communal \nspirit, civic duty, and service to others. This is what makes us who we \nare.\n  Those characteristics describe perfectly the 19 members of the \nGranite Mountain Hotshots. They were not merely given the gratitude and \nrespect of the citizens of Prescott, they earned it. They earned all of \nour admiration and respect, as well.\n  Now in that same communal spirit, we must help the families who carry \nthe weary load.\n  Grief is a lonely thing, but those who are grieving for a husband or \nfor a son, know that millions of us are thinking of you and praying \nthat your hearts find solace and comfort.\n  To the children of these men, carry deep inside of you the knowledge \nthat they were as proud of you as you are of them.\n  This band of 19 embodied what is best about our country. I am honored \nthat they were, in the end, Arizonans. We should all be proud to live \nin a community, State, and nation built on the kinds of guts and \nselflessness that these men personified.\n  Today we are all, in the words of A.E. Housman, ``townsmen of a \nstiller town.''\n  May God bless the souls of these 19 brave men.\n  Senator McCain and I had the privilege yesterday to travel out with \nthe Vice President, two Cabinet Secretaries, and other Members of \nCongress to a memorial service for these brave 19. It was an incredible \nexperience to see a community come together as it did. The townspeople, \npeople from across the State, across the country, and people across the \nworld were sending their condolences for the actions of these men.\n  We are so fortunate to live in a country like this. Senator McCain \nand I are so fortunate to be Arizonans. We are fortunate to witness \nwhat we have witnessed in the past couple of weeks.\n  I am pleased to submit this resolution to honor these men.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. First, I thank the Senator from Delaware for his kind \nwords about me and my friend and colleague from Arizona, who I believe \nis carrying on in the fine tradition of his predecessor Senator Kyl in \na spirit of bipartisanship and dedication to the people of Arizona.\n  I come to the floor with my colleague from Arizona to offer a \nresolution honoring the fallen heroes of the Granite Mountain \nInteragency Hotshot Crew.\n  Yesterday, Senator Flake and I were privileged to attend a memorial \nceremony in Prescott, AZ, honoring the life and sacrifice of the 19 \nbrave men of the Granite Mountain Hotshots who lost their lives last \nweek battling the Yarnell Hill Fire in Yavapai County, AZ.\n  I know I speak for all of my fellow citizens in expressing our \ngratitude to the Vice President of the United States, who came all the \nway to Arizona and gave a moving, stirring, and wonderful testimony to \nthese brave Arizonans. I believe it is typical of my friend for so many \nyears, the Vice President of the United States, that he and his \nwonderful wife would come to Arizona to join us to honor the efforts of \nthese brave men.\n  These were not men merely worth knowing, they were men to admire. \nThey were men to emulate if you have the courage and character to live \nas decently and honorably as they lived. Not many of us can. But we can \nbecome better people by trying to be half as true, half as brave, half \nas good as they were and to make our lives count for something more \nthan the sum of our days.\n  The news accounts of their lives and the testimonials to their \nvirtues that have appeared in the days since we lost\n\n[[Page S5603]]\n\nthem give the rest of us a glimpse of what a blessed memory they are to \nthose who knew and loved them. Some of them were the sons of \nfirefighters who grew up wanting to be like dad, their hero. Some leave \nbehind wives and children. Some were expecting the birth of their first \nchild. Some married their high school sweethearts. Some were engaged \nand looking forward to being husbands and fathers.\n  Two were cousins and best friends. One rescued horses. One aspired to \npreach the word of God. One was a standout ball player. One dressed in \na yellow raincoat when he was 6 and pretended to put out fires. Some \nwere born in Arizona. Some came from other places and fell right in \nlove with the beauty and people of Arizona.\n  Some were shy. Others were practical jokers. They were all respected \nand admired, the kind of men you just like being around.\n  They all loved the outdoors. They were athletic and adventurous. They \nloved their jobs. They wanted to serve others. They wanted to make a \ndifference. They all had a purpose greater than themselves. They were \nall young, so young. They were all brave, so brave. They were all loved \nand were loved, so loved. They will all be missed, so terribly missed.\n  I will forever be touched by what their families and friends have \ntold me about them and how much they meant to them and their \ncommunities. Their stories teach us how to be better people. Their loss \nreminds us to hold each other a little tighter, to love each other a \nlittle harder. I will always consider myself disadvantaged for not \nhaving known them. From the little I know about hope in the face of \ndaunting challenge and the indomitability of the human spirit, it is so \nvital to helping us keep our faith and to endure. I hope I can offer \nsome solace when I say the courage of those we honor today is immortal. \nIt does not perish with them. How they lived and what they did will \ninspire others to live courageously, purposefully, selflessly.\n  Of these qualities, we tend to see merely flashes throughout our \nlives. In these men of the Granite Mountain Hotshots, we see grand \nexamples--sublime, shining, and unforgettable examples--that will \nsummon good men and women today and long after our time has passed to \nlive bravely, compassionately, and honorably.\n  In a fierce and terrifying encounter with extreme danger, they stood \ntheir ground like the heroes they were and fought for their community. \nWhile they did not come home to the people who loved them so much and \nwill miss them always, I firmly believe we will see them again in the \nbetter world that is to come.\n  Until then, we fondly remember the humanity and the heroism of these \nbrave men, their wonderfully unassuming down-to-Earth nature, all of \ntheir marvelous imperfections known only to their closest family and \nfriends, and how, in the face of dire peril, they rose beyond all that \nmakes us merely ordinary and let God cradle them in his arms and carry \nthem away.\n  The lost men of the Granite Mountain Hotshots died having taught us \nall to live. For that, as we honor them and pay our respects to their \nloved ones today, I submit we should all find great solace.\n  I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to the consideration of S. \nRes. 193, submitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 193) honoring the fallen heroes of \n     the Granite Mountain Interagency Hotshot Crew.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent the resolution be agreed to, the \npreamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.

Mr. President, 23 years ago I stood here on the Senate \nfloor as we voted 91 to 6 for the conference report on the Americans \nWith Disabilities Act. I predicted this landmark piece of legislation \nwould literally unlock the resources of individuals with disabilities \nthat had previously been wasted. I worked long and hard to get it \nenacted into law. It is one of the bills of which I feel most \nappreciative.\n  In 2008, I again stood here on the Senate floor as we passed the ADA \nAmendments Act by unanimous consent. I said it was part of our ongoing \neffort to expand opportunities for individuals with disabilities and to \nhelp them participate in the American dream. I remain committed to that \neffort.\n  Both of these legislative achievements were the result of negotiation \nand compromise, and they directly addressed and provided concrete \nsolutions to problems faced by American citizens. We should address \nsuch public policy issues through the legislative process so elected \nrepresentatives make the decisions that affect Americans and are \nconsequently accountable to them.\n  There is underway an effort to promote the rights and opportunities \nof persons with disabilities through a treaty rather than through \nlegislation. Advocates of the U.N. Convention on the Rights of Persons \nWith Disabilities--or CRPD--appear to believe that statutes and \ntreaties are simply alternative means to accomplish the same end. \nAlthough I have labored with these advocates on disability legislation, \nI must respectfully but firmly disagree.\n  My record on disability legislation speaks for itself, but I cannot \nsupport the CRPD because the cost to American sovereignty and self-\ngovernment clearly outweighs any concrete benefit to Americans.\n  When Alexander Hamilton explained the American system of \nrepresentative self-government, he famously said that in America, ``The \npeople govern; here, they act by their immediate representatives.'' \nThose words today are inscribed above an entrance to the House of \nRepresentatives in the Capitol, a building that Thomas Jefferson \ndescribed as ``dedicated to the sovereignty of the people.''\n  That sovereignty certainly includes the authority to elect \nrepresentatives and the authority of those representatives to enact \nlaws. But it is much more than that. The American people also have \nauthority to define our culture, express our values, set our \npriorities, and balance the many competing interests that exist in a \nfree society. To put it simply, the American people must have the last \nword. The CRPD would undermine that sovereignty, compromise self-\ngovernment, and give the last word to the United Nations. Let me \nexplain how.\n  The CRPD is not a treaty with other nations but a treaty with the \nUnited Nations itself. Ratifying it would create a wide range of \nobligations for the United States and authorize the United Nations to \ndetermine whether we are meeting those obligations.\n  The U.N. Web site says the CRPD legally binds any nation ratifying it \nto adhere to its principles. The treaty applies those principles in \nmore than two dozen areas of national life including education, health, \nemployment, accessibility, and independent living, as well as \nparticipation in political, public, and cultural life. Article 8 even \nrequires ratifying nations to ``raise awareness throughout society, \nincluding at the family level, regarding persons with disabilities.''\n  The treaty also spells out what adherence to its principles in these \nmany areas will require. Ratifying nations must enact, modify, or \nabolish not only laws and regulations at all levels of government--\nFederal, state, and local--but also social customs and cultural \npractices. Ratifying nations must\n\n[[Page S5604]]\n\nrefrain from engaging in any acts or practices that are inconsistent \nwith the treaty as well as ensure that all public authorities and \ninstitutions act in conformity with it.\n  The heart of the CRPD is a committee of 18 experts elected by the \nnations ratifying the treaty that has authority to determine if those \nnations are in compliance. Each nation must submit to this committee \nperiodic comprehensive reports on measures taken to meet the \nobligations imposed by the treaty. The U.N. committee dictates the \ncontent of these reports, evaluates whether a nation is in compliance, \nand makes whatever recommendations it so chooses.\n  I commend to Senators an article coauthored by our former colleague \nfrom Arizona Jon Kyl and published in the current issue of the journal \nForeign Affairs. He explains well how international law can undermine \ndemocratic sovereignty. Of this particular treaty, the CRPD, he writes,\n\n       If the treaty has a practical effect, it would be due in \n     large part to interpretations made by foreign government \n     officials and judges and by nongovernmental organizations, \n     none answerable to American voters.\n\n  Under the U.S. Constitution, ratified treaties are the supreme law of \nthe land. Since the United States has long had the most progressive \ndisability laws and policies in the world, we likely are already doing \nmuch that the CRPD requires. But that is not the point, and instead \nhighlights the real problem. Ratifying the CRPD would endorse an \nofficial ongoing role for the United Nations in evaluating virtually \nevery aspect of American life. Ratifying the CRPD would say the United \nNations, not the American people, has the final say about whether the \nUnited States is meeting its obligations in these many areas. It would \nimpose this cost to American sovereignty and self-government with no \nreal concrete benefit to Americans.\n  Ratifying the CRPD will not establish a single right for a single \nAmerican. It will not provide for Americans with disabilities anything \nthat American law has not or could not provide. It would not even help \nAmericans with disabilities who travel overseas because their treatment \ndepends on the laws and policies of other countries, not ours.\n  The CRPD's combination of obligations and U.N. oversight can help \nmove nations that have not done so on their own toward protecting the \nrights and promoting the opportunities of persons with disabilities. \nThat, I take it, is a strategic purpose of the treaty. But the United \nStates is not only far down that road, we literally blazed the trail, \nand I was a significant part of blazing that trail.\n\n  Treaty advocates argue that the CRPD's impact on American sovereignty \nand self-government can be minimized by the many caveats that would \naccompany ratification. These are commonly referred to as reservations, \nunderstandings, and declarations. The legal status of these caveats, \nhowever, is unclear. The CRPD itself states that ``[r]eservations \nincompatible with the object and purpose of the [CRPD] shall not be \npermitted,'' a judgment reserved to the U.N. committee. No less an \nauthority than Harold Koh, former State Department legal adviser and \nnow Sterling Professor of International Law at Yale, has questioned \nwhether such declarations have ``either domestic or international legal \neffect.''\n  Treaty advocates also emphasize that the U.N. committee will have no \nformal authority to interfere domestically in the United States. But as \nI explained, American sovereignty and self-government are not so narrow \nthat they could be undermined only if we literally let the United \nNations run our country. The United Nations and its components hardly \nneed a treaty to opine on aspects of American life and public policy; \nthey already do so--and we have seen it many times. It is, however, \nsomething else entirely for the United States formally to endorse the \nright of the United Nations to do so and subject ourselves to their \nevaluation.\n  Treaty advocates say that ratifying the CRPD would give the United \nStates a ``seat at the table'' to promote the rights and opportunities \nof persons with disabilities around the world. Ratifying the CRPD will \nneither create, nor is necessary to maintain, America's global \nleadership on behalf of persons with disabilities. We had the most \nprogressive laws in the world decades before the CRPD existed. \nIndividual nations, as well as the European Union, are today modeling \ntheir laws after ours even without ratifying the treaty.\n  The only table in this arena at which the United States doesn't \nalready have a seat is the U.N. disability committee. But do the math. \nThe committee has 18 members who are elected by the CRPD's state \nparties, currently 132 nations. The chances of the United States having \na seat at that table at any particular time are remote and will get \neven smaller as even more nations ratify the treaty. Besides, as I \nnoted, advocates acknowledge that the U.N. committee has no formal \nauthority anyway.\n  Finally, treaty advocates say the ratification by the United States \nwill encourage other nations to do so. But at least 19 nations on four \ncontinents--from Norway and the Russian Federation to Barbados, Israel, \nand Liberia--have ratified the CRPD since it was received here in the \nSenate a little more than a year ago.\n  I have not addressed substantive issues with the CRPD as currently \ndrafted, but I will mention one. For more than four decades, American \ndisability law and policy have used an objective, functional definition \nof disability. A disability is an impairment that substantially limits \na major life activity. The CRPD, however, states that ``disability is \nan evolving concept'' involving barriers that hinder ``full and \neffective participation on an equal basis with others.'' The threat to \nAmerican sovereignty and self-government I have described would exist \neven if the CRPD utilized a similar concept of disability. But at least \nby the CRPD's terms, it appears the U.N. committee will use an evolving \nconcept of disability to evaluate how the United States has implemented \nits objective concept of disability.\n  There exists virtually nothing that the United States could do after \nratification that it could not or does not already do today. The truth \nis that every argument for ratifying the CRPD applies properly to other \ncountries, not to the United States. The only real benefit of \nratification that I can see would be to endorse the principles and \npolicy statements in the treaty. The United States, however, either \nalready does so by law or can do so in ways that do not undermine our \nsovereignty and self-government.\n  In the end, the most potent kind of leadership is the kind that \nAmerica has exercised for decades--decades already, taking real action \nto protect the rights and promote the opportunities of persons with \ndisabilities. I remain as committed as ever to that ongoing \nresponsibility.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, what do you get when Congress passes a \n2,700-page piece of legislation on a purely partisan basis that \nradically transforms one-fifth of our economy and impacts the lives of \n319 million Americans? What do you get when you oppose the huge costs \nof this legislation, and this new bureaucracy that goes along with it, \non an economy that is trying to recover from one of the biggest \nrecessions our country ever experienced back in 2008? Well, two of the \nthings you get for sure are higher unemployment and fewer jobs, and \nanemic economic growth. We have seen both of those in the daily news. I \nam afraid we now have a new normal when it comes to unemployment in \nAmerica, which is at 7.6 percent, and that does not count the people \nwho have quit looking for work.\n  The Bureau of Labor Statistics has a ranking of how they rate the \nnumber of people actually looking for work, and it is called the labor \nparticipation rate. It is on their Web site. We have the fewest number \nof Americans in the workforce than we have had in the last 30 years.\n\n[[Page S5605]]\n\n  We didn't get many of the benefits that were promised when ObamaCare \nwas passed at a time when we were essentially told: We are from the \ngovernment. Trust us. It will all turn out OK.\n  One of the most important numbers in the recent job report is the \nnumber 8.2 million. That is the number of Americans who are now working \npart time instead of full time because the full-time jobs are simply \nnot available. In other words, there are 8.2 million workers who are \nworking part time even though they want a full-time job, but they \ncannot find one.\n  To give some perspective, the number was 7.6 million in March. So \nbetween May and June we have seen that number increase by 300,000. \nThere are 300,000 Americans who were unable to find full-time work, so \nthey had to accept part-time work. When we talk about numbers such as \nthese, I know it is tempting to think of those numbers as just \nabstractions, but these are the American people. These are moms, dads, \nbrothers, and sisters. These are young adults who are looking for work \nbut simply can't find work on a full-time basis.\n  I would suggest--and I think the evidence is compelling--that one of \nthe reasons for that is ObamaCare. The law requires all businesses with \n50 or more full-time workers to provide their employees with \ngovernment-approved health care coverage, and if they don't, then they \nhave to pay a financial penalty. This requirement was originally \nscheduled to kick in next year, but last week the Obama administration \nannounced that this so-called employer mandate would be delayed until \n2015. In other words, the administration has implicitly acknowledged \nthat the mandate is discouraging the creation of full-time jobs and is \nactually reducing working hours, which is relegating many American \nworkers--300,000 more between May and June--to part-time work even \nthough they want to work full time. The irony is that the ObamaCare \nbill passed in the Senate--and I still remember this--on Christmas Eve \nof 2009 at 7 a.m. in the morning. It was later reconciled with the \nHouse legislation in 2010. But we have had two elections occur before \nthe full implementation of this bill. What we are going to see now is \nmoving the implementation off again until after the 2014 election. In \nmy view, that is dangerous because it means there is no electoral \naccountability for the true impact of this legislation even though we \nare beginning to see some of it.\n  Of course, the basic problem is that the mandate won't magically \ndisappear in 2015, even after it has been delayed by unilateral action \nof the administration. But what strikes me as pretty simple is that \nwhen you penalize full-time work, what you are going to get is part-\ntime work in order to avoid the penalty.\n  Of course, the employer mandate isn't the only part of ObamaCare that \nis hampering job creation. The law also contains $1 trillion in tax \nincreases--including a new medical device tax that has already prompted \nseveral large manufacturers to close existing facilities or cancel \nplans for new ones. I remember a few months ago I had a medical device \ncompany located in Texas tell me that they were going to be expanding \ntheir operations in Costa Rica instead of Texas in order to avoid this \ntax.\n  The medical device tax has also discouraged health-care savings and \nlifesaving innovations. One of the great things about our country and \nour free enterprise system is that if somebody has a better way to do \nsomething, they can design it, build it, and consumers can benefit from \nit. In this case, this medical device tax has been destructive of each \nof those.\n  Indeed, this tax has been so counterproductive that 79 Members of \nthis Senate--a supermajority on a bipartisan basis--rejected it during \nthe vote on the budget resolution recently and effectively said that it \nshould be repealed. A number of colleagues from across the aisle who \nsupported this legislation initially have now seen that the way this is \nbeing implemented can be damaging and destructive not only to job \ncreation but access to quality health care. The same thing can be said \nof the 81 Members who voted to abolish ObamaCare's IRS 1099 reporting \nrequirement back in 2011. The more we have learned about the \nimplementation of ObamaCare, the less popular it has become.\n\n  For that matter, the administration itself has had second thoughts \nabout key provisions of ObamaCare. In 2010, the Department of Health \nand Human Services began granting a series of waivers from ObamaCare's \nannual limit requirements. It eventually granted more than 1,000. In \nother words, the administration unilaterally said to some people: You \ndon't have to comply with the law, while the rest of us were stuck with \nit.\n  In 2011, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius \nsuspended all work on the so-called CLASS Act, a portion of ObamaCare \nthat was formally repealed earlier this year. And, a few months ago, \nHealth and Human Services announced that ObamaCare's basic health \nprogram would be delayed until 2015--again, after the next midterm \ncongressional election. Just last week, in addition to delaying the \nemployer mandate, the administration also delayed another important \nprovision in the ObamaCare oversight. In other words, it said, You \ndon't even have to prove that you are financially eligible for taxpayer \nsubsidies to get insurance in the health exchanges.\n  This is an invitation to fraud and abuse. We saw in 2008 when the \nbubble burst after the financial crisis came to a head, one of the root \ncauses of that was companies writing loans to people who couldn't \nqualify for those loans, but they didn't require any financial \ndisclosure or verification. Those came to be known as liar loans.\n  We are essentially now refusing to learn from that experience in the \nhealth care field, on the part of the administration, to see as many \npeople as possible signed up for the health care exchanges, but based \nonly on their unilateral declaration that they are eligible, not any \nreal verification or proof. That is an invitation to fraud.\n  To add it all up, notwithstanding its aspirations and notwithstanding \nthe hopes and perhaps dreams of those who thought we were going to \nsomehow transform health care with this legislation, it has now become \nclear to me, and I daresay millions of Americans, that ObamaCare has \nsimply not lived up to its promises. It is not working as advertised. I \nthink there is a growing bipartisan consensus to that effect. I have \nmentioned some examples and some reasons why, including as well that \nfor the past 3 years we have witnessed a nonstop parade of fix-ups, \nfumbles, delays, and broken promises.\n  For example, during the 2008 campaign, President Obama pledged his \nhealth care law would transform health care; it would make health care \ncosts for a family of four go down by $2,500. What has actually \nhappened is the cost of family premiums has actually gone up by nearly \n$2,400 between 2009 and 2012. According to the Wall Street Journal, \nhealthy consumers could see insurance rates double or even triple when \nthey look for individual coverage under ObamaCare, and that will happen \nthis fall. Some of it is so-called age-banding where young people, such \nas my two daughters who are 30 and 31 years old, are going to be forced \nto pay higher premiums to subsidize health care coverage for older \npeople.\n  There are also other provisions such as mandatory issue. For example, \nif a person finds out that unfortunately they have a disease and are \nnot covered, under ObamaCare they can go out and buy insurance which is \nnot actually insurance anymore. Someone said it is akin to waiting \nuntil your house is on fire to buy fire insurance. That drives up the \ncost and it distorts the insurance market. What we are going to see, \nand what consumers are going to see, is their health care premiums go \nup as a result of the implementation of ObamaCare.\n  What about the promise that ObamaCare wouldn't raise taxes on anyone \nmaking under $200,000 a year? In fact, the law raised taxes on \neveryone, from young people with health savings accounts, to middle-\nclass workers with families, to senior citizens living on a fixed wage.\n  President Obama also promised that anyone who liked their existing \nhealth coverage would be able to keep it. Do my colleagues remember \nthat? He said: ``If you like what you have, you can keep it.'' I know \npeople like hearing that because most Americans--up to 80 percent and \nmaybe higher--are satisfied with the health insurance they have now. So \nwhen the President said, ``If you like what you have, you can\n\n[[Page S5606]]\n\nkeep it,'' most Americans nodded and said that's good. The reality is, \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office, at least 7 million \nAmericans will lose their current health insurance because of \nObamaCare.\n  A few months ago one of my constituents in Texas sent me a letter she \nreceived from her health care provider. The letter informed her that \nbecause of the new health care law--the so-called Affordable Care Act \nwhich is turning out to be more unaffordable than affordable--her \ncurrent health policy would be terminated by the end of the year. The \nletter also said: ``Never have we experienced the uncertainty and \nimmense challenges that confront the insurance industry during this \ntime of health care reform.''\n  I don't think it is sufficient for people such as myself or anyone \nelse to criticize this flawed legislation and to say: I voted against \nit; it is too bad it didn't work out; tough luck. That is not \nsufficient, and that is not doing our duty. There has to be a better \nway to reform our health care system, and indeed there is a better way, \nif we commit ourselves to five overarching principles.\n  No. 1: We must make health care more affordable. That was the promise \nof ObamaCare, but that is not the reality. It has made health care less \naffordable, not more affordable. But we must commit ourselves to \npolicies that will make health care more affordable by reining in \ncosts, and I have some ideas on how to do that which I will mention \nmomentarily.\n  No. 2, the second principle: Individuals must have more choices in \nthe health care market and they must be allowed to make their own \nchoices and select whatever options fit their individual needs. \nThe idea of ObamaCare was one-size-fits-all, but we know that one size \ndoes not fit all. Different families, different individuals have \ndifferent needs. We need to restore the choices to individuals and not \nto the government dictating what those choices should be.\n\n  No. 3: We must ensure that all individuals, including people with \npreexisting conditions, have access to high-quality health insurance \nand to high-quality care. This was a problem in the preexisting system, \nwhere people with preexisting conditions found it hard to buy \ninsurance, and this was one of the noble promises of ObamaCare. But we \ndon't have to buy the whole package in order to fix this problem. \nIndeed, there are many high-risk pools at the State level that if the \nFederal Government would help support those high-risk pools, people \nwould be able to find health care coverage even if they had preexisting \nconditions, which otherwise would make that difficult to find.\n  Principle No. 4: We have to protect the doctor-patient relationship. \nNo one wants to have the bureaucracy telling them what health care they \ncan have and whether they can have it. So we have to protect the \ndoctor-patient relationship. This is a bond of trust that most of us \nhave with the individuals we entrust our health care to--our own \ndoctor. We have to make sure people are able to make health care \ndecisions in consultation with their doctor and their family that suit \ntheir needs.\n  No. 5: This is the fifth principle for reform that I think we now \nneed to begin the discussion about undertaking. We need to save \nMedicare.\n  What kinds of policy reforms might these principles generate? Well, \nfor starters, I would suggest we need to equalize the tax treatment of \nhealth insurance for employers and individuals. This is something we \nhave discussed time and time again. But why do we favor, through \nsubsidies under the Tax Code, certain types of health coverage and \ndiscriminate against people who buy insurance in the individual market?\n  Secondly, from a policy perspective consistent with the principles I \nmentioned, we need to expand access to tax-free health care savings. \nThere is a company in Texas--actually, it has franchises here in the \nNortheast--Whole Foods. It is a great grocery store. I had an occasion \na couple of years ago to meet with a number of the employees. They vote \nevery year on what their health plan should look like. Year after year \nafter year, they choose a high-deductible health insurance plan along \nwith a health care savings plan so that if they get sick they are \nprotected by the catastrophic coverage, but otherwise they can save and \nbudget for their ordinary health care needs using a health savings \naccount. One of the most amazing things about that is people then begin \nto take some ownership--have some skin in the game--in terms of their \nhealth care choices, and they tend to do what we do generally as \nconsumers, which is they shop around. They say, OK, I have my money. I \nneed procedure X, I need this or that. Where can I get that for the \nbest price and the best quality service? These tax-free health savings \naccounts transform the health care relationship so people don't only \njust have some third party paying the bills--like getting a credit card \nand never getting the bill under much of our current health care \nsystem--so expanding tax-free health savings accounts like the \nemployees have at Whole Foods in Austin, TX, is one great policy that \nwould improve our health care delivery system.\n  Third, we need to let people and businesses form risk pools in the \nindividual market.\n  Fourth, we need to improve price and quality transparency. There has \nactually been some good work done by Health and Human Services recently \nto release health care expenditures for some of the most common \nprocedures and reasons people are hospitalized. I think it is kind of \neye-opening, because some people have found out that for the same \nprocedure--in one instance a person might see $1,000 being charged and \nin another, a person might see $5,000 being charged for essentially the \nsame practice or procedure. Providing transparency indeed helps to \ncreate an opportunity for a market, so market discipline can help \nnormalize and bring down those costs. Improving price and cost and \nquality transparency are very important to creating a true health care \nmarketplace.\n  Fifth, in Texas we have found ways to curb frivolous medical \nmalpractice lawsuits which don't shut the front door to the courthouse \nfor truly legitimate claims but which have made medical malpractice \ninsurance more affordable because our civil justice system is more \npredictable.\n  Sixth, we need to eliminate all the unnecessary government mandates \nthat drive up insurance costs. What happens in Austin, TX, and in State \ncapitals across the country is legislators come together and say \ncompanies can't sell insurance in our State unless they cover X, Y, and \nZ. Well, the fact is not every consumer, not every patient needs X, Y, \nand Z coverage, but by those mandates they end up driving up the cost \nof that health insurance. What we need to do is eliminate the \nunnecessary mandates that many people don't use anyway, because those \ndrive up costs. By eliminating those mandates, we can help bring down \nthe costs and make health care more affordable.\n  Seventh, this is an old suggestion, but one that I think is still \nvery important. Why is it that a person can only buy health insurance \nin their own State? If I want to buy car insurance I can buy it \nanywhere in the country and I can--if the company is in Oklahoma or New \nMexico or Indiana, they can compete for my business. That gives the \nmarket an ability to hold down costs and that gives consumers access to \nlower costs and better quality by allowing that competition to occur \nacross State lines.\n  We don't need another government takeover of our health care system. \nWhen the wheels fall off of ObamaCare or, in the language of the \ndistinguished chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance, if that \ntrain wreck of implementation that he predicted occurs, we don't need \nanother big 2,700-page government program to substitute. We need to \nimplement the types of reforms I talked about to give us lower costs, \nmore accessibility, and greater fairness throughout our entire health \ncare system.\n  Speaking of fairness and accessibility, we know the current Medicaid \nProgram is broken when our most vulnerable citizens have a hard time \nfinding a physician who will actually take a new Medicaid patient. This \nis one of the problems many of us had with the ObamaCare expansion of \npushing a lot of people onto Medicaid which, in my State, is a broken \nprogram, where more than 60 percent of primary care physicians won't \ntake a new Medicaid patient because the reimbursement\n\n[[Page S5607]]\n\nlevels are about 50 percent of what private insurance would pay a \ndoctor to treat a patient. So many physicians say, I can't afford to \nwork for 50 cents on the dollar, so I am not going to see a new \nMedicaid patient.\n  So what you have is this strange dichotomy where people actually have \ncoverage under Medicaid, but they do not have access to health care \nbecause they cannot find a doctor to take it at that price, and that \nactually, I believe, is sort of the dirty little secret about Medicaid. \nAll of us support a safety net program of health care for our most \nvulnerable citizens--all of us--but Medicaid, as currently constituted, \nis not the answer for the reasons I mentioned.\n  Each State must have the flexibility to design a program that will \nactually meet the needs of its residents. What works best in New York, \nI guarantee, does not work the same way in Texas and vice versa. States \nshould be appropriated a certain amount of money, and I am not \nsuggesting it be drastically cut--which would deny the States an \nopportunity to provide health care in their own way--but we need to \nblock grant these Federal funds, not micromanage them. We certainly \nneed to eliminate as many Federal strings as we possibly can and \nprovide the States the flexibility to use the same amount of money to \nprovide access to more health care for low-income people.\n  Speaking of access to physicians, this is a big problem in Medicare \ntoo. Of course, Medicaid is for the economically disadvantaged. \nMedicare is for people 65 and older. But in my State, only 58 percent \nof physicians will see a new Medicare patient. That means 42 percent \nwill not. In other words, if you live in a rural area or you live \nsomeplace where physicians will not take a new Medicare patient, you \nare pretty much out of luck. This is a problem again about the way the \nFederal Government tries to save money in health care, not by using the \ndiscipline of the market--transparency and competition and some of the \nother reforms I mentioned--but rather by whacking reimbursements to \nhealth care providers. The truth is, if you whack reimbursement rates \nto Medicaid providers and Medicare providers, as we currently do, then \nfewer and fewer people are actually going to be able to find a doctor \nwho will see them, even though they have the promise of coverage under \nMedicaid or Medicare.\n  We know, of course, the financial problem Medicare is currently \nsuffering. The fact is--and this is something I wish we would talk more \nabout from the President to the Halls of Congress--for every $1 that an \naverage person puts into Medicare, they take out $3. That is why \nMedicare, in the long run, is unsustainable. If we are going to keep \nthe promise of Medicare--and we should--to future generations, we need \nto fix it.\n  But when it comes to treating patients, physicians, I believe, know \nbetter than Washington bureaucrats. This is another reason why I \nsupport repeal of another provision of ObamaCare which is called the \nIndependent Payment Advisory Board, so-called IPAB. There is actually \nbipartisan support for repealing this provision in the House because \nwhat it would do is appoint a group of 15 bureaucrats who would decide \nwhat sort of health care was going to be reimbursed under Medicare and \nwhat would not. There would be no real recourse to Congress or anybody \nelse because these people would be the so-called Independent Payment \nAdvisory Board.\n  It is not hard to predict what would happen if IPAB, as it is called, \nwere implemented. When doctors are forced to accept lower rates, they \nwill reduce the number of patients they see or else they will drop out \nof the Medicare Program altogether or the types of treatment people \nwill be able to get from their doctor will be determined by the Federal \nGovernment's willingness to pay for it rather than their true medical \nneeds.\n  I think we have learned the lesson in Medicaid and Medicare, as \nelsewhere, that price controls simply do not work, and they will not \nsave Medicare either. It is time to try a new approach that will \nprotect the doctor-patient relationship and expand individual choice.\n  Under the current model, seniors are forced into a one-size-fits-all \nplan developed in Washington. Under an alternative supported by \nRepublicans and Democrats in different contexts--the so-called premium \nsupport model--the Federal Government would pay a designated amount, \nand then people could use that money to buy their own private coverage. \nThey could supplement it if they wanted to, if they wanted more \ngenerous coverage, but that would have to come out of their pocket.\n  But under the premium support model alternative, private plans would \nbe allowed to compete against traditional Medicare, much as Medicare \nAdvantage does now, and seniors could simply pick the plan they want \nthat suits their needs the most. If someone picks a private plan that \nis cheaper than traditional Medicare, they can keep the savings. Then \nagain, if they want more generous coverage, they can pay the \ndifference.\n  How do we know this sort of approach will work? You do not have to \ntake my word for it. All we have to do is look at what is working now. \nOne of the most successful government health care programs I have seen \nsince I have been in the Senate, and that I know about, is the Medicare \nprescription drug coverage program. A national survey released in \nOctober 2012 found that 9 out of 10 seniors are satisfied with their \nMedicare prescription drug plan.\n  Similar reforms could be made to other parts of Medicare to help save \nthe program. If these reforms are not made, Medicare will go bankrupt. \nThe great thing about Medicare Part D, the prescription drug program, \nis it has actually come in 40 percent under projected costs. It is not \nhard to figure out why. Because when different companies compete in the \nmarketplace for the business of seniors who qualify for Medicare, they \nare going to compete--you guessed it--on price, so they are going to \ntry to provide it at a less expensive cost, and they are going to \ncompete based on quality of service. That is the great genius of our \nfree enterprise system and of competition. But if we do not make these \nreforms, Medicare will go bankrupt. That is something none of us should \nlook forward to.\n  So the reforms I have just outlined will give us a health care system \nwith lower costs, a system with greater choice and greater access to \nhigh-quality care, a system that upholds fundamental values, such as \nfairness and consumer choice, and a system that will provide affordable \nhealth care for everyone. That is the kind of health care system we all \nwant for our families, for our children, and grandchildren.\n  Three years ago, Congress took a swing at the health care issue but \nended up striking out and missed an opportunity to enact necessary \nreforms. We are still learning that as the implementation of ObamaCare \ncontinues to unfold. But the health care debate is not over by any \nmeans. It is just beginning in a way. By replacing ObamaCare with \npatient-centered reforms that reduce costs, improve transparency, and \nexpand access, we can make it easier for all Americans to get the \naffordable quality health care they deserve.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Government Overreach\n\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to address an issue that is \ntroubling to me and to my constituents back in the State of Nevada and \nto a growing number of Americans across the country. I am referring to \nthe tendency of those who lead government agencies to abuse their power \nand deprive Americans of their constitutional rights.\n  We have seen examples of this alarming trend over the last several \nweeks: The NSA is reportedly confiscating private e-mails and phone \nrecords. The IRS is specifically targeting conservative groups seeking \ntax exempt status.\n\n[[Page S5608]]\n\n  Constituents have flooded my office with phone calls, e-mails, and \nletters demanding to know why their government continues to encroach on \ntheir liberty. They have had enough and so have I.\n  Recently, the Federal court of Nevada ruled that the Federal \nGovernment has abused its power in my home State. The court ruled in \nfavor of private cattle owners in Nevada, ranchers who came to the \ncourt because they felt the Federal Government was intentionally \ninterfering with their grazing permits and their private property \nrights.\n  The court found that for more than two decades, Federal officials \nentrusted with the responsibility of managing public lands actively \nconspired to deprive Wayne Hage and his father's estate of their \ngrazing permits and their water rights. In its decision, the court \nruled:\n\n       The government had abused its discretion through a series \n     of actions designed to strip the Estate of its grazing \n     permits and of the ability to use water rights.\n\n  The court described the actions of the government officials as an \n``abuse of executive power'' and said it ``shocked the conscience of \nthe court, and provided a basis for finding of irreparable harm.''\n  There seems to be a pattern emerging. The Federal Government is \nsupposed to be entrusted with protecting fundamental rights, such as \nproperty rights and the right to privacy. Yet, sadly, the American \npeople are left wondering if their own government is living up to that \npublic trust.\n  The Framers of the Constitution believed that private property rights \nwere sacred. The 5th and 14th Amendments specifically prohibit the \ngovernment from depriving citizens of ``life, liberty or property \nwithout due process of law.'' Those amendments are there for a reason.\n  As the Nevada District Court wrote:\n\n       Substantive due process protects individuals from arbitrary \n     depravation of their liberty by government.\n\n  No question. The Federal Government has an obligation to help manage \nthe Nation's resources, just like it has the duty to keep Americans \nsafe and to enforce fairly the Tax Code. But these responsibilities \nrequire integrity, accountability, and impartiality. These powers \ncannot be used to push political or partisan agendas.\n  In a State such as Nevada, which is made up of land that is 87 \npercent federally controlled, and where resources such as water and \nvegetation are scarce, the role of the government in protecting private \nproperty rights is especially important and cannot be abused by overly \nzealous government officials.\n  The rights of cattle owners and ranchers to have their grazing \npermits honored is no less important than any other form of property \nright secured by law through permits and licensing. The government \ncannot be allowed to arbitrarily target certain groups for punishment \nand selectively enforce the law. That kind of behavior is precisely \nwhat the Framers wanted to guard against.\n  Whether it is the IRS targeting groups for their political views, the \nNSA confiscating mass amounts of private data, or the Federal \nGovernment interfering with property rights, the American people are \nfed up with this laundry list of examples of the Federal Government \nblatantly disrespecting their constitutional liberties.\n  Fortunately, the Federal courts remain open for Americans to defend \nthemselves against government abuse. But I think it is a tragedy for \nAmerican citizens to be subjected to costly, drawn-out litigation in \norder to make sure their liberties are secured against the very \ngovernment they have entrusted to protect them.\n  The American people will not stand for an all-powerful government \nthat ignores their constitutional rights. It is long past time that we \nend this culture of government bullying and harassment. The government \nderives its power from the consent of the governed. The consent depends \non a fair, transparent, and reasonable enforcement of the law.\n  If we are to remain the greatest country on Earth and live up to the \npowerful ideals that inspired our Founders, then we must restore the \ntrust of the American people in their government, and we must begin \nthat process right away.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago the President gave a beautiful \nspeech on global warming. He said that the world is coming to an end if \nwe don't act; that it is our moral obligation to make sure our planet \nis safe for future generations; that it is all up to us. And to be \nsuccessful we must regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.\n  For more than a decade environmentalists have been pressuring \nDemocrats to do this--pressuring all of us to do this--and we all know \nwhy.\n  I can remember years ago--and this would have been back when I was in \nthe House--that my first observation when I looked at liberals in the \nHouse was that there were four flawed premises on which they based \ntheir decisions. One was--and I am going from memory now because this \nwas many years ago--that the Cold War is over, we no longer need a \ndefense; another one was that deficit spending is not bad public \npolicy; the third one was that punishment is not a deterrent to crime; \nand the fourth one--and this is the big one--was that government can \nrun our lives better than the people can. That is exactly what we are \ntalking about here.\n  The reason they have been wanting to regulate carbon is better \narticulated by a guy I don't think anyone will argue could be the most \nknowledgeable scientist in America. His name is Richard Lindzen, and he \nis with MIT. His quote was that regulating carbon is a ``bureaucrat's \ndream.'' He said, ``If you control carbon, you control life.'' You \ncontrol life. And that is what bureaucrats want to do. That is what the \nenvironmentalists want to do. In controlling our lives, they want to \ndetermine what cars we drive, what kinds of houses we live in, how our \ncities are built, and all of that, and they can do all of this by \nregulating carbon dioxide.\n  Democrats--particularly in the Senate--have been unsuccessful in \npassing legislation to accomplish this. And this is the key. Way back \nduring the Clinton administration, when Al Gore came back from the \nKyoto Convention, he said we need to pass and ratify the Kyoto \nConvention. The Kyoto Convention would do exactly that--it would allow \nus in this country and others around the world to regulate carbon \nemissions. In doing this, they would be able to control lives. It was \nway back 13 years ago that this took place.\n  Anyway, they tried to pass legislation. The first bill actually was \nnot necessarily a Democratic bill; it was the McCain-Lieberman bill, \nand it was one that was a cap-and-trade bill, quite frankly. At that \ntime the Republicans were in the majority, and I chaired the committee \ncalled the Environment and Public Works Committee, so I was on the \nfloor managing the opposition to that particular cap-and-trade bill. \nThat was a carbon control bill. We won the debate, and as the years \nwent by we continued to win over and over.\n  I guess what I am saying is that the reason the President is doing \nthis right now is because he can't get this done through legislation, \nby those who are held accountable to the people. He can't get it done \nthrough legislation so he is trying to do it through regulation. The \nmost recent attempt, in 2009, was the Waxman-Markey cap-and-trade bill.\n  By the way, I congratulate Senator Markey for winning his election. \nIt is going to be fun for us because we have debated each other on this \nissue now for years and years, but now we are in the same Chamber.\n  The bottom line is that in 2009 they did pass that bill in the then-\nDemocratic-controlled House, but when it came over to the Senate, of \ncourse it\n\n[[Page S5609]]\n\nwas not even considered here. But that particular piece of legislation \nwould have regulated only the largest emitters, and this is the hardest \nthing to get across to people. Everyone understands, after 12 years of \nrepetition and listening to me at this podium saying it over and over \nagain, that if we were to pass any kind of a cap-and-trade bill, the \ncost to the American people would be somewhere between $300 billion and \n$400 billion a year. The reason I say that is the Wharton School came \nup with the figure of around $350 billion, MIT came out with the figure \nof about the same, and so no one for 10 years has debated that the cost \nof regulating through cap and trade would have been somewhere around \n$300 billion to $400 billion.\n  Now, as onerous as I think all these bills were in trying to do this \nthrough legislation, it wouldn't have been nearly as bad as what is \nhappening today, for this reason. This gets into the weeds here, but it \nis important that we in this body understand what this is all about. \nThe bills we killed, which would have cost $400 billion a year, would \nhave regulated only the largest emitters--those emitters that emitted \n25,000 tons of CO2 a year. That would have cost the economy \n$400 billion. We rejected that, and we all know that is what the cost \nwas, but because the President owes this environmental base and he \ncan't pass his legislation, he is now taking unilateral regulatory \naction to regulate greenhouse gases and carbon dioxide.\n  Keep in mind that this is not the same as one of the bills we \ndefeated. That would have only caused the emission control on those \nentities that emitted 25,000 tons of CO2 or more in a period \nof a year. If it is done through regulation, then it has to be done \nunder the Clean Air Act, and the significance of that is this would not \njust go after the big emitters, it wouldn't go after just those big \nemitters of 25,000 tons a year, it would catch people and individuals \nand organizations that emit 250 tons as opposed to 25,000 tons. That \nmeans it would apply not just to large emitters, such as powerplants, \nbut every refinery, oil and gas well, every manufacturing facility, \nevery plastics plant, the iron smelters and steel mills, every \napartment building, churches, and every school. So that is everybody. \nSo one thing that has never been calculated is what the cost of that \nwould be. If the cost of just those emitting 25,000 tons would be $400 \nbillion a year, then how much would it be if we applied this to \neveryone, all the way down to 250 tons?\n\n  I do something in Oklahoma each year. I get the total number of \npeople who file Federal tax returns, and I kind of do the math. So I \nwill take the amount of a tax increase--in this case, let's use $400 \nbillion a year--and I will say: How much will this cost the average \nfamily in my State of Oklahoma who files a tax return? It works out to \n$3,000 a year. So we are talking about a major--by far the largest tax \nincrease this country has ever seen.\n  So don't let the President fool you into believing he will stop at \nthe powerplants. He is in an all-out war against fossil fuels and \naffordable energy. And legally, if he goes down this path, he will not \nbe able to stop just at the large ones. This will apply to everybody \nout there under the Clean Air Act, and that would be those emitting 250 \ntons.\n  He is also doing this unilaterally just for the United States. If you \nbelieve man is causing global warming--I don't, but if you do--then you \nshould be concerned about worldwide emissions because who cares if it \nis just the United States of America? It is not just what is happening \nin the United States of America, it is all over the world. That is \nreally where the problem--if there is a problem--would be. If all we do \nis lower our emissions without convincing China, India, Mexico, and \nother countries to do the same, then U.S. manufacturers, out seeking \nthe energy to run their operations, would have to leave the United \nStates and go to those other countries where they do not have \nregulations. So this would have the effect actually of increasing, not \ndecreasing, emissions.\n  I remember when Lisa Jackson was the Director of the EPA. She was my \nfavorite liberal. I used to say I had three favorite liberals, and she \nwas one of the three of them. And I liked her because even though I \ndisagreed with her philosophically, she was always honest with me. I \nwould ask her a question and she would answer it.\n  I remember when I asked her live on TV, in a hearing, this question. \nI said: You know, if we were to pass this legislation that would \nregulate CO2 levels, would this reduce emissions worldwide? \nShe said: No. Because this only affects the United States and it would \nnot affect the other countries.\n  So you won't hear the President talking about this. You won't hear \nhim talking about the cost, even though they will shrink from our \neconomy by more than $400 billion a year. We know that, and no one \nrefutes that. It requires the EPA to hire an additional 230,000 \nemployees and spend an additional $21 billion to implement the \nregulatory regime. And these are not my figures, these are the EPA's \nfigures. You won't hear him talking about it because he knows it is a \nlosing argument. In fact, the day before the President gave this \nspeech, he had his campaign send out talking points to all of the \nactivists he had working on his behalf. They told--``they'' meaning the \nWhite House--these people exactly what to talk about, what to say and \nexactly what not to say.\n  We recovered this. We found these talking points the President sent \nout to people so this is what Americans would be listening to. I think \nit is worthwhile for us to go over this now.\n  On this first chart, we have his overarching three-point strategy. \nPoint No. 1 is, we have an obligation to act. The memo continues: We \nhave a moral obligation to future generations to leave them a planet \nthat is not polluted and damaged by carbon pollution.\n  Notice that they are not talking about climate change anymore. They \nare not talking about global warming. The new words they are using now \nare ``carbon pollution.''\n  It is all the same thing. Global warming didn't work, so they \ndiscontinued that. They tried climate change. That didn't work. Now the \nnew word is called carbon pollution.\n  These are the President's talking points. I think this kind of \nwordsmithing is actually smart, and I compliment them on going to \nprofessionals and seeing what kind of words they can use to make the \npublic believe something that isn't true.\n  The second thing they have charged would be that communities all over \nAmerica are already being harmed. The memo continues:\n\n       Climate change is already harming Americans all over the \n     country. Cleaning up after climate-driven disasters last year \n     cost the taxpayer over $1,100. (Or cost taxpayers nearly $100 \n     billion, one of the largest non-defense discretionary budget \n     items in 2012.)\n\n  These are the words coming from the White House for people to use in \ntheir talking points. These figures come from the total cost of all \nnatural disasters. I am from Oklahoma. I think we all know we have \ntornadoes in Oklahoma. We have had tornadoes as long as I have been \nliving in Oklahoma--all my life.\n  So he is talking about that figure on all natural disasters that has \nnothing to do to with carbon whatsoever. He is attributing the cost of \nall natural disasters and its total costs to global warming or carbon \npollution, as the President now says, even if you believe global \nwarming is true.\n  The President's third talking point was to his climate plan. This is \nwhat he is telling his followers, in this body and elsewhere, to use:\n\n       That's why we applaud President Obama's climate plan, which \n     is full of common-sense solutions, starting with his call for \n     the EPA to limit the carbon pollution.\n       While we set limits for arsenic, mercury, and lead, we let \n     power plants release as much carbon pollution as they want. \n     It's time to set a limit on pollution that affects public \n     health, and that's why it's so important that the President \n     is rising to this challenge.\n\n  Those are his talking points that he wants people to say about his \nspeech and about his program. What this demonstrates to me is that the \nPresident is no longer fighting greenhouse gases--which he says caused \nglobal warming--but is instead fighting against carbon pollution.\n  But if carbon pollution is simply carbon dioxide--or CO2--\nand is dangerous to our health, what are we going to do about the air \nwe breathe? Don't we emit CO2 every time we exhale? Is this \nthe pollution they are talking about?\n  Also in the memo the President's alarmists are given a concrete list \nof\n\n[[Page S5610]]\n\nthings to talk about and things not to talk about.\n  This is something we received just a few hours ago, and we are very \npleased to be able to get a copy of it. This was only supposed to go to \nalarmists. Alarmists, for the benefit of my colleagues, are people who \nbelieve the world is coming to an end and it is all man's fault. It \nsays what to do and what not to do. Look at this. It is amazing, what \nyou can say and what you can't say. We will highlight just a few items.\n  The first point is the instruction to not talk about the cost of \nregulations. The memo from the White House says, ``Don't lead with \nstraight economic arguments.'' Why? Because global warming legislation \nwill cost between $300 billion and $400 billion a year, and the \nregulations will cost much more than that.\n  Charles River Associates is a credible group that to my knowledge no \none has challenged. Their study of the Waxman-Markey bill reported that \nthe policies would cost the economy $350 billion a year in 2030 and \n$730 billion a year in 2050. Again, go back to the figures consistent \nwith what the Wharton School, 10 years before, and MIT came out with.\n  The Heritage Foundation said the average family would see its direct \nenergy costs rise by over $24,000 in the first 20 years following the \nbill's enactment. This is the Heritage Foundation said it is going to \naffect every family in America. The costs will be far higher under the \nPresident's unilateral regulatory action, thereby bypassing Congress, \nbecause they are talking about regulating down to much lower levels.\n  This memo also instructs the President's alarmists to talk about his \nactions being ``the latest in a series of steady and responsible steps \nthe administration has taken'' to combat global warming. In that vein, \nhowever, the memo instructs them to not overstate the magnitude of the \naction being taken.\n  In other words, the President does not want his people talking about \nthis as being the first of many steps in regulating every refinery, \nmanufacturer, oil and gas wells, steel mills, plastics, and all the \nrest.\n  The next memo instructs alarmists to ``discuss the impacts--carbon \npollution is bad for the health of our kids and our planet'' but to not \n``debate the validity or consensus of the science that is already \nsettled.''\n  In other words, don't debate the science. Just say it has been \nsettled. Because we have more and more people now questioning the \nscience, and it is far from being settled. They don't want to bring \nthat up. They don't want people talking about it. The science is far \nfrom settled, and since when does carbon dioxide--which we all breathe \nout every day--hurt our kids?\n  The memo also instructs the alarmists to ``inform audiences about the \nnature of the problem, who is at fault, and what can be done,'' but to \nnot ``debate the increase in electricity prices. Instead pivot to \nhealth and clean air messages.''\n  In other words, don't admit the truth; that is, overactive, \nunilateral regulation will do nothing more than increase electricity \nprices and unilaterally shut down our economy by imposing EPA \nregulations on every single industry and dramatically expand the \nFederal Government's role in our lives without doing anything to reduce \nglobal emissions. This is all instruction coming from the White House.\n\n  I have to repeat this. If it were done by legislation or by \nregulation, we have already shown clearly it would not reduce \nCO2 emissions, even if that were your goal, because that is \nwhat Obama's Administrator of the EPA said. In answering the question, \n``Is this going to reduce CO2 emission,'' the answer, ``No, \nit won't.''\n  Richard Lindzen and other scientists have talked about:\n\n       Controlling carbon is kind of a bureaucrat's dream. If you \n     control carbon, you control life.\n\n  So keep that in mind. All this effort is being made, and we have made \nit very clear that it is not going to accomplish anything they want to \naccomplish in terms of reducing CO2 emissions worldwide.\n  The last thing I will mention from the memo is that it says to \n``discuss modernizing and retooling power plants and innovation that \nwill create green jobs'' but to not ``try to suggest net job \nincreases.''\n  In other words, don't mention this is going to shut down every coal, \noil, and eventually natural gas powerplant we have in this country and \nkill thousands of jobs at manufacturers around the Nation. We don't \nwant to talk about the job loss. The President only wants to talk about \nthe benefits of his regulatory actions and not about the costs.\n  But what we have to remember is that even the benefits are overstated \nbecause they do not rely on the true costs of the regulations. But we \nshould not be surprised, this coming from an administration that thinks \nmore regulations means more jobs. These are talking points, but the \nmechanics of these new and future EPA greenhouse gas rules will be done \nby the EPA.\n  The reason I am here today is to first demonstrate in the speech he \nmade how that relates now to the current EPA and perhaps the \nconfirmation hearing vote that will be coming up.\n  Gina McCarthy is currently being considered to take the top job at \nthe agency. Remember, I said Lisa Jackson had that job before and how \nmuch I thought of her. I like Gina. I like her very much. I have worked \nwith her. She has had a different job for several years. She was the \nAssistant Administrator of the EPA for air issues.\n  It is very important people understand what we are looking at. We \nhave a good personal relationship, but she is the one who is \nresponsible for all of the worst regulations that have come from the \nEPA in the last 4 years under Lisa Jackson's leadership. Lisa Jackson \nwas the director, but Gina McCarthy was the air director. It is from \nthe air office, the Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, \nwhere she has the most expertise and where all of the worst regulations \nwill come from in the future.\n  After President Obama's speech on global warming, it became clear \nthat Gina McCarthy would be used as the tool of the administration for \nall these regulations that will destroy the American economy. I have \nlisted these up here, and it is worth looking at.\n  In the last 4 years, we have had Utility MACT. MACT means the maximum \nachievable control technology. That means what technology is out there \nto control emissions. She was able to get that through, and $100 \nbillion and 1.5 million jobs were lost. The next is Boiler MACT, $63.3 \nbillion and 800,000 jobs lost. Regional haze--another regulation \nregulating the air--will increase the cost of Oklahoma's electricity \nbills by over $1.8 billion. These are all figures that are \nincontrovertible, so people don't disagree with.\n  In the next few years, even worse regulations are likely to come out. \nGreenhouse gas regulations may be the worst, but there are also the \nothers listed. Greenhouse gas is the one we have been talking about, \nbut you also have the ozone NAAQS regulations. Adjustments to that rule \nwill put 2,800 counties out of attainment, including all of them in \nOklahoma.\n  We have 77 counties in the State of Oklahoma. I can remember when I \nwas the mayor of Tulsa, they came out with new regulations that put \nTulsa County out of attainment. When you are out of attainment, that \nmeans you can kiss any energy development, new manufacturing \nopportunity, any other business expansion goodbye. They will not be \nable to get a permit from the EPA.\n  Gina McCarthy is the face of President Obama's overregulatory agenda \nthat is threatening our energy independence and putting our economic \nfuture in peril. We can't allow these regulations to move forward. I \nthink the key to that is the person who is responsible for all the \nregulations, all the costs, all the jobs I just enumerated, both during \nher tenure as the air boss of EPA and then these that would come in the \nfuture, that would be in her goal. She would be the tool that is being \nused by the administration.\n  Yesterday was kind of interesting because Heather Zichal is President \nObama's climate czar and she was on the Hill huddling in a secret \nmeeting with some of the chief alarmists such as Barbara Boxer and the \nrest. In the meeting, they talked about the President's plan and \npresumably this memo--with wordsmithing talking points from the memo we \ntalked about before. So the one we had up before is\n\n[[Page S5611]]\n\nthe same thing they talked about yesterday: This is how you are going \nto have to word all this stuff.\n  Their goal is not to protect the American people; it is to control \nthem. They want top-down control, and carbon dioxide regulations will \ngive them this tool. Their talking points memo proves they are doing \nall they can to craft their message in a way that convinces Americans \nthey are not trying to crush our economy but instead trying to help. \nBut the truth is, their regulatory agenda will only cause more \nunemployment, lower economic growth, and lower take-home pay for the \nAmerican people.\n  President Obama delivered a beautiful speech on global warming. That \nis how I started this. It was well thought out, and he is very gifted. \nHe had a beautiful speech, and he is embarking on the most devastating \nsurge in regulation that will cost hard-working Americans millions of \njobs and tax increases to accomplish this.\n  Keep in mind, if you do all these things it is not going to lower \nCO2 emissions. That is proven. No one has denied it. That \neven came from the Administrator of the EPA. It is going to be \ndevastating to the American people.\n  This is big. It has a lot to do with the confirmation hearing of the \nvery fine lady who has been a good friend of mine for a long time, but \nthe one who is responsible for these air regulations that are killing \njobs in America, and we cannot let that happen.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ncontrolled time be extended until 7 p.m., and that all the provisions \nof the previous order remain in effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor from time to \ntime to share thoughts from people in my State. All of us are hearing \ncomments from college students, people who have finished college, and \noften from the parents of those who face a massive debt from going to \n2-year and 4-year private-public schools. This situation can sometimes \nbe even more tragic at for-profit schools where they haven't gotten \nmuch help in their job search. It can be even more tragic if they have \nnot finished school and still face this debt.\n  My wife Connie Schultz graduated from Kent State University some \nnumber of years ago. Her father was a utility worker and carried a \nunion card for more than 30 years. Her mother was a home care worker. \nShe was the oldest of four and the first in her family to go to \ncollege. Her two younger brothers and sister also went to college.\n  Connie graduated from Kent State University 30-some years ago with a \ndebt of only $1,200. That so starkly illustrates the difference from \ntoday and then. She had little privilege, little money, and parents who \ncouldn't really put much money out, but with lower tuition, Pell \ngrants, a few scholarships, Stafford loans, and working, she was able \nto get through school with little debt.\n  The stories we hear today are so different from that. I plead with my \ncolleagues that we freeze interest rates at 3.4 percent. I know that \nwill not solve anything close to all the problems of college tuition \nand costs of room and board, but it will help. We need to do much more \nthan that.\n  Every year I convene 50 or 60 college presidents from Ohio's 2- and \n4-year private and public schools, community colleges, and 4-year State \nuniversities. I invite all of them to come and discuss these issues. We \nhave done it for 6 years in a row. It is helpful to try to find ways to \nkeep higher education costs in check, but, again, it is not nearly \nenough.\n  I am hopeful that in the next 24 hours or so we can freeze interest \nrates at 3.4 percent and then get serious about what we are going to do \nabout the $1 trillion aggregate debt that students, or former students, \nhave in this country. We need to focus in part on the $150 billion of \nthe $1 trillion which 2.9 million students are burdened with. That is \ndebt from the private market for the $150 billion of the $1 trillion. \nFifteen percent is in the private market where interest rates sometimes \nare as high as 12 or 15 or 16 percent. Few private banks are willing to \nrenegotiate and refinance those loans.\n  My legislation with Senator Heitkamp will help with a carrot-and-\nstick approach to encourage the private institutions--banks and private \nlenders--to refinance these loans.\n  Let me share a couple of letters from students and families because I \nthink that speaks volumes better than I can.\n  This is a letter from Daniel from Centerville, OH. Daniel has been at \nthe University of Dayton.\n  He said:\n\n       I currently have $100,000 in outstanding loans. Last summer \n     (2012) I graduated with a Masters Degree in Middle Child \n     Education and the previous summer I graduated with a \n     Bachelors in Middle Child Education as well from Wright State \n     University in Dayton, Ohio.\n       Starting in July of 2013, because of the high interest \n     rates, my average monthly payment for all my student loans \n     will be $600 a month.\n       I recently got one of my payments lowered; otherwise that \n     total would be over $800 a month.\n       I have consolidated all I can, and even deferred (and still \n     made payments while in deferment) other loans which will be \n     due in February 2014; adding to the $600 a month payment.\n       I teach in a school in Cincinnati and LOVE THE WORK THAT I \n     DO.\n       It was impossible to find a job in Dayton, so now I spend \n     $200 a month in gas traveling over 40 miles (one way) to \n     work.\n       Even though I have a part time job in the summer, while \n     school is out, I still find myself struggling to pay bills.\n\n  Further down in the letter he says:\n\n       Afterall, I will be well over 65 years old before I am able \n     to pay all of my college loans off.\n       This country needs to rethink its priorities.\n\n  That was Daniel from Centerville, OH.\n  Melinda, from Canton, OH, in northeast Ohio, writes:\n\n       After graduating from college, I had roughly $23,000 in \n     student loan debt. My payments are $276 a month until I'm in \n     my 30s, and I am very tightly budgeted.\n       While I am able to make this payment, which is my largest \n     and most important bill each month (aside from rent), it puts \n     me in a vulnerable situation when it comes to emergencies.\n       I recently had to have surgery for a chronic medical \n     problem. I was in an auto accident and had to visit the ER.\n       Making that loan payment every month leaves very little \n     extra to be saved for unexpected expenses.\n       I understand it's my responsibility to pay it, and I loved \n     every minute of my education so it was well worth it, but at \n     the end of the day a hike in my interest rates may be the \n     difference between me saving a little money each month or \n     saving no money each month.\n       Also, I fall asleep each night knowing that I am 24 years \n     old and have yet to begin saving for retirement which will be \n     a very important issue for my generation.\n\n  We are not getting into the issues of retirement, Social Security, \nand the effort by some of our colleagues to privatize that system--I \nwill not even go into more detail there.\n  Christie from Ashtabula, the community where my wife grew up, writes:\n\n       As a low-income individual, I was forced to decide on going \n     to college by a measure of a few things--who could give the \n     best education, and the most financial aid.\n       But there was a catch--I couldn't leave Ohio, and I \n     couldn't live far away from home because I didn't have access \n     to a car and my single parent mother (who works two jobs), \n     would have no way to get me if there were any emergencies.\n       I chose Case Western Reserve University, a renowned \n     university [ranked] at 37th in the country.\n       My financial aid package was hefty.\n       If I paid full tuition ($52,000) each year, I would be at \n     an insane $200,000 by graduation.\n       Luckily, by the end I will only owe a quarter of that. Yes, \n     that's still around $60,000--$60,000 in student loan debt. \n     That's pretty much a house and a car.\n\n  The last letter I will read is from Linda, who is from my hometown of \nMansfield, OH.\n\n\n[[Page S5612]]\n\n\n       I have two children who are currently attending state \n     colleges (Cleveland and Akron). We are a middle-class family \n     working hard to make ends meet, and help our children to the \n     best of our ability. Even after saving for them, and thinking \n     we had plenty for them to get through without much debt, the \n     market crashed in '08, and more than HALF of our hard-earned \n     college savings for them disappeared. They have had to take \n     out loans in order to be able to attend.\n       We do not have the money for them to ``borrow'' from us, or \n     to pay the thousands that their college savings doesn't \n     cover. Both of them are on the Dean's list every semester.\n       My son is an environmental science major, and my daughter \n     minored in Spanish, and her major is exercise physiology and \n     physical therapy. They are bright and intelligent and have \n     worked extremely hard to get where they are. I implore you \n     not to leave them with ridiculous amounts of debt by \n     doubling the interest rate.\n\n  These stories are pretty consistent. These students are struggling. \nThey already are thinking about buying a house, starting a business, \nand saving for retirement even though they are in their twenties. They \nknow the challenges are greater in this generation than in previous \ngenerations.\n  Also, what is obvious from these letters is the impact this has on \nfamilies and not just the student who is 25 or 22 or 19 or 28, facing \nyears of paying off student loans. It has an impact on the family who \nmaybe takes a second mortgage on their house to help their son or \ndaughter, the family who faces foreclosure because of financial \nproblems, the family who simply can't help their student--as broken-\nhearted as that makes a parent, they can't help their son or daughter \nbecause of their financial situation, to help them with their college \neducation.\n  Again, I am hopeful we can freeze interest rates at 3.4 percent for 1 \nyear and get serious about what we need to do about access to college \nand affordable higher education for our young people.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Tennessee and I be allowed to engage in a colloquy and speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Housing Finance Reform\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it is a pleasure to be here today with my \nfriend the Senator from Tennessee to talk about legislation that we and \neight--actually now nine of our colleagues--bipartisan legislation that \nhas been recently introduced to reform our housing finance system.\n  I came into office a couple of years later than the Senator from \nTennessee, but I got here in January of 2009 when the entire future of \nour financial system was uncertain. We members of the Banking Committee \nrolled up our sleeves and tried to work together to prevent future \ncrises. Well, history will determine whether we accomplished that goal.\n  The Senator from Tennessee and I worked strongly together on a couple \nof titles of what has subsequently become known as the Dodd-Frank \nlegislation. While there are problems in that legislation, while there \nare problems still within our financial system, I think no independent \nobserver would not say that our financial system today, in 2013, is \nstronger than it was after the crisis.\n  But one area that did not receive very much attention was the \nquestion of housing finance. We also know that in many ways our housing \nfinance system, both from lack of underwriting, the process that then \nended up allowing a lot of mortgages to get packaged off, securitized, \nwith the assumption that there would never be a decline in housing \nprices or a significant decline in housing prices and that these \nsecurities would never be in jeopardy, in many ways led to part of that \nfinancial crisis. At the end of the day, those institutions--Fannie and \nFreddie--that had been the core of our housing finance system ended up \nacquiring $188 billion of taxpayer support to shore up those \ninstitutions so that the whole housing system would not collapse.\n  Well, it is now 5 years later, and we believe it is time to transform \nthe failed model of Fannie and Freddie into a smarter, sustainable \nsystem with more private capital. We believe we can better protect the \ntaxpayer and maintain broad access to affordable mortgage credit. But \nwe need to act soon to prevent this issue from falling victim to \nelection-year politics. And everyone--from the administration, to many \nof us here on the floor of this Senate, to many housing experts--knows \nthe status quo is not sustainable.\n  So we have two important questions before we get into some of these \nprinciples about which I will engage my colleague the Senator from \nTennessee: 1. Why do we need to take action now, and the second \nquestion is, why does Congress need to act?\n  I will take the first question. Why is the time now? Well, over the \nlast 5 years since the housing and the overall financial crisis, we \nhave seen--slowly, albeit--the housing market come back to life. \nObviously this has been supported by a low interest rate environment \nthat has permitted more refinancing and loan modifications. Rising home \nvalues have brought many home owners out from underwater mortgages. \nHousing prices have been a significant factor in Fannie's and Freddie's \nrecent record profits. But now those very profits have somehow been \nwrapped into at least some of our colleagues' discussions about our \ndebt ceiling debate.\n  I speak for this Senator and I think the Senator from Tennessee and, \ncandidly, I think many Senators are not even engaged with us on this \ndebate right now. The last thing we want is for Fannie and Freddie to \nvirtually serve as a piggy bank for the pet projects of either side of \nthe aisle. If we are not careful, that could happen.\n  Fannie and Freddie have been in conservatorship for 5 years. Before \nwe become even more dependent upon this broken system, it is time for \nus to move forward. So I would like to ask my colleague the Senator \nfrom Tennessee, if now is the time, if he might share with us some of \nthe ideas he feels and we feel about why it is important that Congress \nbe involved in this process and not simply allow this conservatorship \nto go on ad infinitum into the future.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from Virginia. \nI have thoroughly enjoyed working with him on this issue. We have been \nworking on it since last fall. We spent a lot of time talking to \nvarious groups to try to get this right. We know that every bill can be \nimproved, but we have done our best to present something to the Senate \nthat we hope will be marked up in the Banking Committee, something \nthat, as the great Senator from Virginia mentioned, has attracted \nnumbers of people on both sides of the aisle. I again thank Senators \nTester, Johanns, Heitkamp, Heller, Moran, Hagan, and now Kirk for \njoining us in this effort. This is a diverse group of folks from \ndiverse places around the country who have come together to solve this \nmajor problem.\n  All during the Dodd-Frank debate--and we were certainly in the middle \nof that--all people talked about it seemed was the fact that Fannie and \nFreddie were not included. Yet Fannie and Freddie were two of the \nbiggest failures that occurred during that time. As the Senator from \nVirginia rightly mentioned, $188 billion of taxpayer money had to go \ninto these entities.\n  We have dealt with most of the issues around the crisis. I know there \nare still some rules that are being promulgated. We had some that came \nout yesterday. But this is the last piece.\n  As the Senator mentioned, the housing sector has been growing and \ncoming back. We understand the importance of the housing sector; \ntherefore, we have designed a bill that transitions over time and moves \nus to a model that we hope and believe strongly is far more \nsustainable.\n  First of all, let me mention the five things we have worked on \ntogether. I know each of us is going to stress a lot of different \nthings as we move through. I know we plan to come down here at multiple \nintervals as we move ahead. But No. 1, what does this bill do? First \nand importantly, it breaks up the GSEs and liquidates them. It does it \nover time, but our bill does that.\n\n[[Page S5613]]\n\n  Secondly and very importantly--this is something we have talked about \na great deal with industry and certainly people from all sides of the \naisle--this bill puts 10 percent private capital in advance of any kind \nof government reinsurance. I want to say to the Senator that one of the \nreasons we looked at it this way is that if Fannie and Freddie just had \n5 percent capital, there would have been no taxpayer losses. But \nputting this much capital in advance really is a buffer against the \ntaxpayer needing to be involved in it. It fully privatizes a number of \nfunctions that are currently performed by Fannie and Freddie. It gets \nthe U.S. Government out of the business of pricing credit, which is \nsomething we both have thought needed to occur.\n\n  It modernizes our system of mortgage-backed securities. But I think \nthe thing we began with--and I so appreciate the Senator's involvement. \nWe realized that one of the major flaws in our housing finance system \nin the past and even--well, it is not today because the government owns \nthese two entities, but in the past has been private sector gains, \npublic losses. I mean, when you have a situation where you have \nshareholders, you have the private sector doing well when times are \ngood; they had an implicit guarantee; people figured that the \ngovernment would come in and backstop these entities if they failed. \nObviously their underwriting standards got really terrible. The \norganizations failed. What happened? The taxpayers came to the rescue, \nunfortunately, with $188 billion, which has not been paid back. We \nstill have these entities in conservatorship. One of the flaws both of \nus, coming from the private sector, saw was that this is not right; \nthere is no way we should have entities where there is private sector \ngains when things are going well and public sector losses.\n  I wish to thank the Senator for joining in, for all of the hours he \nand his staff have put into this to try to make this bill as good as we \ncan possibly make it to bring it to the floor.\n  I look forward to the input of the entire Senate. I hope we have an \nopportunity for a markup and a presentation later this fall. But I \ncould not be more grateful to the Senator for his efforts and his \nwillingness to do this and obviously his willingness to work hard to \nsee this go across the finish line.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to return the same compliments to \nthe Senator from Tennessee. He brought a greater breadth of background \nin housing finance and the public finance sector than I did. But \ntogether, working with our other colleagues, I think we have all built \na series of critical points.\n  Again, echoing what the Senator from Tennessee said, there are always \nways to improve on legislation, but the first and foremost point was \nthat we need to make sure there is taxpayer protection. We need to make \nsure the taxpayers are fully repaid that $188 billion. We need to make \nsure as well--and we spend a great deal of time working with industry \nand others--that there continues to be broad access to market credit.\n  I think one of the challenges we both felt with Fannie and Freddie \nwas there was not only a combination of a private sector gain, public \nsector loss with this kind of hybrid model, but layered on top of that \nwas a social purpose. I, for one, believe very strongly that we have to \nmake sure there is affordable housing, that there is good access to \nmarket credit. But when you layer that on a quasi-private entity, as we \ndid for years with Fannie and Freddie, you end up where you are not \nsure whether those entities are performing that necessary \nsecuritization and financing purpose to maintain the overall housing \nfinancing sector or whether they are allowing certain loans that maybe \nshouldn't have gone into this process because of the social purpose.\n  So we have said: Well, we have to make sure there is the appropriate \nprivate sector taxpayer protection: 10 percent capital--very important. \nWe also said: Let's go ahead and split off that public sector role, \nclearly identify it, make sure that for those loans that get \nsecuritized, a small transaction fee--not a tax, a small transaction \nfee--is charged. Those funds are then set aside to promote rental \nhousing, access to credit, low-income housing. Have that audited, stand \nalone, perform that important function.\n  As we said as well, doing this, as the Senator from Tennessee has \nmentioned--he has been quite strong on this--we are going to make sure \nthe government role is clearly defined but much more limited. There are \nsome who say we can do this totally on the private sector side. Well, \nwe hope there can still continue to be the 30-year fixed-mortgage \nproduct that I think the American public has come to expect. We can \nprivatize more, but not having the ability to have the government \nbackstop would remove that very essential component of our current \nhousing financing system. So a more limited government role but still \nthe ability for our American consumer to have the kind of access to the \nfinancial products they have come to expect. Again, it has been \nmentioned--making sure that we expand private sector capital and make \nsure that they take care of that underwriting and credit assessment \nthat, quite honestly, the old model did not really provide.\n  I would like to ask the Senator from Tennessee this because this is \none on which we went around and around. I again thank him and his staff \nand my staff and the staff of our now nine cosponsors of this \nlegislation. One thing that was quite important to us was that if you \nare going to create this new model, how do we make sure that--while we \nwant more competition, private sector competition, while we want \ninstitutions to be able to go ahead and provide this important issuance \nand securitization function, how do we make sure that those small \nbanks--that community-based bank or that credit union, that small bank \nin Knoxville or that small bank in Martinsville, VA--still gets access \nto the same kind of ability to issue mortgages, have those mortgages \nsecuritized, and not be at a disadvantage of some of the mega-\ninstitutions?\n  So I would ask my colleague, the Senator from Tennessee Mr. Corker, \nwhy doesn't the Senator speak to that issue because it did take us a \nlot of work to try to get this right, and there may be even further \nrefinement. But I think this is an area--again, with the reaction we \nhave seen from the credit unions, the community-based banks--where I \nthink we have made a great first step.\n  Mr. CORKER. One of the things, no question, that many banks and \ncredit unions around our country have been concerned about, even though \nFreddie and Fannie are 90 percent of all home mortgages today--and very \ndominant, obviously, because of what has happened but also because of \nthe tremendous market share they have had--is if we are going to wind \nthese down, are they going to be assured access into this market. So we \nhave created mechanisms for them to be able to come in through issuers \nto do this.\n  One of the things so many of the community banks and credit unions \nhave complained about as a tremendous disadvantage with our system was \nthat there was volume pricing. In other words, if you were a big user \nof Fannie and Freddie, they gave you a big volume discount--Wells \nFargo, Bank of America, JPMorgan. As they tried to process loans \nthrough Fannie and Freddie and this whole system, they got big volume \ndiscounts, so they were more competitive.\n  These organizations I mentioned are, obviously, important, but the \ncommunity bankers who mean so much are the ones who drive things back \nhome. The community bankers are members of the Rotary Club, the Lions \nClub, and are involved in our communities, and they were constantly at \na disadvantage as it relates to housing finance. So one of the \ncomponents of this bill is not only to ensure they get equal access to \nthe system--and we do that very eloquently in this bill--but in \naddition to that we ensure there is no mechanism that allows for volume \npricing.\n  Everybody is treated the same, as it should be, because in this \nparticular case we end up with an explicit government guarantee that is \nvery different. We don't have a situation where we have private \nshareholders doing well when things are doing good and the public doing \nbad. But one of the reasons we felt confident in moving in this \ndirection was the tremendous amount of upfront capital.\n  So we dealt with the smaller institutions. As a matter of fact, we \nsat down and worked through the many issues they have brought up. We \nknow how\n\n[[Page S5614]]\n\nimportant they are to everyone here and everyone in the country. We \ndealt with that, but we also created enough upfront capital, as the \nSenator has mentioned, to protect the public.\n  I know, again, that every bill can be improved. We saw that most \nrecently with the immigration debate. As a matter of fact, I think that \nis a good model. We have introduced something that I hope the Banking \nCommittee will take up soon. It is almost unprecedented to have nine \nmembers of the Banking Committee cosponsoring a piece of legislation. \nHopefully it will have the opportunity for a markup, for improvements, \nand we know the chairman and ranking member, obviously, are going to \nwant to put their stamp, as will many members on the committee, on \nanything that occurs. But I think we have done some of the work that is \nimportant to establish a very good beginning place.\n  We tried to address, as the Senator mentioned, the many community \nbanks around our country that are in here constantly and that are so \nimportant to the States we represent. We have done that. Again, I know \nto the Senator and his staff, and many of the cosponsors, that was \nsomething that was an ultimate threshold for them, was to ensure the \ncommunity bankers and credit unions around our country had the \nappropriate access, and I think we have hit that good place in this \nbill.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I know our time is about up, but I want to \nclose and then I will turn it back over to the final comments of my \ncolleague, the Senator from Tennessee.\n  I want to say to my colleagues and their staff and those interested \nin this issue that this was the one piece of unfinished business in our \nfinancial system reform. While there are some today who say: Well, \nthings have gotten better, we should allow the status quo to continue--\nwell, I don't think, from the administration on down, there is anyone \nwho thinks the status quo simply continuing--with private sector gain \nand public sector losses--is the right model.\n  We ought to take the lessons we have learned over the last 5 years--\nsome of the very good work in terms of the standardization that is \nbeing done at the FHA right now--and set up a new model. As the Senator \nfrom Tennessee said, make sure we get that taxpayer protection.\n  I would simply add that housing is a critically important part of our \noverall economy, and on any piece of legislation--and let me not say \nall these groups have endorsed this legislation but they have all been \ngenerally supportive, they all have had areas they wanted to see \nimprovement in--when you have realtors and homebuilders and mortgage \nbankers and large and small banks and community organizations and \ngroups who are concerned about low-income housing and rental housing \nall saying we are in the ballpark in an area that is so important to \nour economy and so complex, I think we have taken a great first step. \nSo I would urge colleagues to join with us.\n  The Senator and I will be happy to come and make presentations. We \nhave found, as we have sat down with many Members and walked them \nthrough all the processes and all of the kinds of protections we have \nbuilt into this legislation, that the presentations have been one of \nthe reasons we have had such success with nine members of the Banking \nCommittee--almost half of the Banking Committee, without all of them \neven having had a full presentation--pledging their support.\n  I again thank my colleague, the Senator from Tennessee, for his great \nwork and leadership. He has been the lead sponsor. I am proud to be his \nwing man on this as we continue to work through it.\n  My sense, though, is this is the time. It is my hope the Banking \nCommittee will take up this piece of legislation and make their \nimprovements on it. It would be a huge mistake, with interest rates at \nthis kind of record low, with this housing market coming back, and with \nus putting in place a 5-year appropriate transition time, not to act \nnow. If not now, then when would be the right time to do the kind of \nmeaningful housing finance reform that I think so many experts across \nthe ideological spectrum have all called for?\n\n  I look forward to working with my colleague, the Senator from \nTennessee, and I thank him for his good work, and I am happy for him to \nclose out our comments today.\n  Mr. CORKER. I thank the Senator again for all the hours that have \nbeen spent. I think we have both realized this is a beginning point, \nmeaning this is a piece of legislation that has a lot of bipartisan \nsupport among talented and wise Members--excluding the two of us--and I \nthank him for joining in and helping make this bill better. Obviously, \nthis is something we think may be taken up sometime this fall, and I do \nhope we will have the opportunity to make presentations to people \nthroughout the Senate very soon.\n  I want to make two points. The Senator from Virginia, because of his \nbackground, was probably more involved in the banking issues than most \npeople here because he brought a lot of background and expertise. I \nfelt fortunate to be involved in some way during that time, and he and \nI both remember--and I hope Members of this body will remember--back to \nthe big issue that people felt during that time was not addressed were \nthe two GSEs, Fannie and Freddie. Candidly, it was a pretty complex \nundertaking. There were a lot of other things happening. It was a fair \ncriticism, but at the same time, there was a lot being dealt with. Time \nhas gone by now, the housing market has improved, but we still haven't \nfinished our work.\n  I think most people here understand that this last crisis brought \nsuch hardship to so many people across this country, with trillions and \ntrillions of dollars of household wealth going down the tube because we \nhad a system that wasn't stable, a system that was making bets on \nthings it shouldn't have been making. It was excessive. As the Senator \nhas mentioned, between the regulators and some of the rules that have \nbeen passed, the system is stronger now, but we still have not dealt \nwith this.\n  I would ask my colleagues to consider later this year looking at \nsomething to finish that work so we can shore up the housing market and \ndo everything we can to keep that from happening again. Because again, \nwe know how important the housing industry is to us.\n  Secondly, I think the window is closing. For what it is worth, there \nare a lot of people throughout our country who have a personal stake in \ntrying to keep the status quo in place, to keep the situation where we \nhave, again, private shareholders the public believes have the \ngovernment standing behind it and no matter what they do they are going \nto be bailed out or whatever, placed in conservatorship. People are \nbeginning to see that maybe even though these entities haven't paid \nback a single dime yet, they haven't reduced the $188 billion--not one \npenny of capital for the indebtedness has been returned. Certainly, \nthere have been dividend payments. But people are coming out of the \nwoodwork now to try to reinforce the old system.\n  Next year we are going to be moving into an election cycle again. It \nhappens every 2 years around here. We have had a pretty productive year \nthis year so far. I am proud of a lot of work the Senate has done. This \nis a big and important piece of work, as we have mentioned, that is \nundone. The timing is right because of a lot of forces out there that, \nagain, would like to keep the status quo. So I want to again thank the \nSenator from Virginia for his thoughtfulness, the other Members who \nhave cosponsored this and gone through a complex issue and come up with \na very elegant solution to this problem, and I hope we will have the \nopportunity to work together to actually do something that makes our \ncountry stronger and causes our housing finance system, which is so \nimportant to our economy, to be more sustainable.\n  I thank the Senator. I look forward to coming to the floor with him \nagain and continuing the many meetings we are having with Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle and, hopefully, with a lot of input from \nothers, coming up with a solution the entire body addresses.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S5615]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a colleague, a \nleader, a statesman, and a humanitarian, but most of all I rise to pay \ntribute to my friend, Bill Gray, who passed away last week.\n  Bill Gray and I served together in the House of Representatives \nduring a time that was much different than the world we see today. From \nhis early days in Congress, Bill Gray sought to aid and unify an \nextremely diverse caucus. This collaborative work ethic, along with a \ncomprehensive understanding of the congressional budget process, helped \nhim earn the respect of his colleagues. Bill Gray rose through the \nranks to become the first African American to chair the House Budget \nCommittee. Later, he would serve as chair of the House Democratic \nCaucus and go on to become the House majority whip, the first African \nAmerican to do so in each position, and at that time, the highest \nranking African American in congressional history.\n  From his first day in Congress, through his rise to leadership, Bill \nGray fought for the people of Philadelphia as a tremendous advocate for \nfairness, equity, and democracy. Bill was willing to compromise to get \nto a balanced budget because he knew it was good for the entire \ncountry, both the rich and the poor. He once said, ``A balanced budget \nis good for the country, the affluent and poor alike. I seek a budget \nthat doesn't sacrifice programs for the poor and minorities, one that \nis fair and equitable.'' Gray's advocacy for fairness was also evident \nat the international level, as he was an early leader in the drive to \nend U.S. investment in the apartheid government of South Africa.\n  Bill Gray's commitment to humanity and public service did not begin \nor end with his time in Congress. Prior to serving in the House of \nRepresentatives, Bill was pastor of Bright Hope Baptist Church in North \nPhiladelphia and still ministered to his congregation while serving in \nWashington. After retiring from Congress, he served as president of the \nUnited Negro College Fund, and was later appointed by President Bill \nClinton to serve as Special Envoy to Haiti.\n  Despite all of Bill Gray's historic achievements, he still managed to \nremember his friends. A few years ago, Bill and his son, Justin, \nvisited my home State of Nevada. The people he met in Las Vegas knew \nall too well of his service to this Nation and, even more, they just \nappreciated him for coming to visit our town. I appreciated him, too.\n  I will always remember Bill Gray, not only as a trailblazer or public \nservant, but as my friend. My thoughts are with his family and I hope \nfond memories offer comfort during this time of grief.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/10/senate-section/article/S5615-3", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5615-S5616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                         california casualties\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

HAYES\n\n  Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize David J. \nHayes, who stepped down on June 28, 2013, from his position as Deputy \nSecretary of the Department of the Interior, and I ask consent that the \nfollowing remarks about him and his service be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Selected Remarks on the Work of Deputy Secretary David J. Hayes\n\n\n               elected officials and cabinet secretaries\n\n       President of the United States Barack Obama: ``David's \n     leadership at the Department of the Interior has played an \n     important role in my Administration's efforts to expand \n     domestic energy production, including renewable energy as \n     well as America's oil and natural gas resources. His \n     expertise has helped shape our approach to conservation and \n     our efforts to combat climate change, and as the Chair of the \n     interagency working group on energy development in Alaska he \n     has ensured that decisions we make regarding the Arctic are \n     based on the best science. I am also grateful for David's \n     work to help usher in important water rights and legal \n     settlements that will help restore trust and strengthen our \n     relationship with Indian Country.''\n       Sally Jewell, Secretary of Interior: ``David has been a key \n     architect for nearly every significant initiative undertaken \n     at Interior over the last four years,'' said Secretary of the \n     Interior Sally Jewell. ``From his work on expanding renewable \n     energy production on public lands and waters, to coordinating \n     federal family energy activities in Alaska, to developing a \n     landscape-scale approach to conservation and climate change, \n     David has left an indelible mark.''\n       Ken Salazar, Former Secretary of Interior: ``Over the last \n     4 years, you have distinguished yourself as a key leader in \n     implementing the President's agenda at the Department of the \n     Interior. Your historic work on energy and climate change, \n     conservation, Native Americans and water challenges have been \n     at the heart of an Obama legacy and will last forever.''\n       ``On the energy front, you have been one of the key players \n     in the Administration, implementing the President's all-of-\n     the-above energy strategy . . . You have played a key role in \n     helping create a conservation legacy for the President. Your \n     work has included helping define the future for the Atlantic \n     and Arctic Circle, new urban parks, Gulf Coast Restoration, \n     and the creation of a National Blueway System for America's \n     rivers. The conservation community holds you in the highest \n     regard.''\n       ``As the Chief Operating Officer of the Department, you \n     have led historic reforms in the organization of Interior \n     including overhauling the agencies that oversee oil and gas \n     production on public lands and implementing the numerous \n     efficiency measures necessary for these tough fiscal times . \n     . . ''\n       ``Your results oriented approach to solving problems makes \n     me very proud of you. In contributing to a lasting \n     Presidential legacy, you have helped create a better world \n     for humanity through your dedication, loyalty, and \n     indefatigable energy.''\n       Congressman Tom Cole (R-OK): ``I note with deep regret the \n     decision of Deputy Secretary of the Interior David Hayes to \n     retire from public life,'' said Cole. ``David Hayes has been \n     one of the most gifted and accomplished public servants of \n     his generation. He served the Administration and, more \n     importantly, the country with skill, integrity, vision and \n     leadership.\n       ``Among his many accomplishments, the most noteworthy is \n     surely his settlement of the so-called Cobell lawsuit on \n     terms that were not only beneficial to the government but \n     fair to hundreds of thousands of Native Americans and to \n     tribal governments. It was David who recognized a problem and \n     turned it into a solution, not only in terms of just \n     compensation to Indians for years of mismanagement of their \n     trust accounts but for tribal governments as well. His \n     proposal to use part of the settlement to purchase \n     fractionated lands and return them to productive use will \n     benefit individual Indians and tribal governments in \n     perpetuity. Moreover, the addition of a scholarship fund for \n     needy American Indian students, as a component of the \n     settlement, will benefit generations to come.\n       ``On countless issues, including the complex Oklahoma water \n     issue, efforts to partner with Indian tribes for the \n     management of federal properties and initiatives to foster \n     and speed up the development of resources in Indian Country, \n     David led with skill, finesse and innovation. Moreover, he \n     did so in ways that were inclusive, bipartisan and \n     transparent.\n       ``I wish David every success in private life. However, I \n     certainly hope at some time in the future, he returns to \n     public service. He is simply too gifted and capable to remain \n     on the sidelines as the great public issues of the day are \n     discussed, debated and solved.''\n       U.S. Sen. Mark Begich (D-Alaska): ``David Hayes has been a \n     good partner to Alaska. Together, we made significant \n     progress on streamlining OCS permitting, and Alaska saw the \n     first offshore wells drilled in decades. I know that without \n     his commitment to the Alaska Interagency Working Group, we \n     would not have seen that progress.''\n       Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.): ``I have long known \n     David to be an ingenious problem solver who has demonstrated \n     time and again that he can close the deal on solutions for \n     the West's great battles over natural resources.''\n       ``I will never forget David Hayes and Secretary Ken Salazar \n     coming to my home in Washington on a Sunday morning to work \n     on a solution that would dramatically improve the [water] \n     allocation. David rolled up his sleeves and worked diligently \n     until we had a workable solution.''\n       U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska): ``I appreciate David's \n     willingness to engage on difficult issues important to \n     Alaskans, including contentious land management policies and \n     offshore oil and gas development. The Alaska Interagency \n     Working Group, which he headed, was central to improving the \n     permitting process for offshore exploration. We did not \n     always see eye to eye on what was best for Alaska, but David \n     was effective and fair, and always brought honesty and \n     integrity to what were sometimes tough discussions. I am \n     sorry to see him leave.''\n       President Ben Shelly, Navajo Nation: ``Mr. Hayes has . . . \n     tackled difficult topics with aplomb, including water rights \n     settlements, energy development negotiations, and the non-\n     renewable energy dependence of the Navajo Nation. He's \n     demonstrated so with the utmost professionalism and \n     understanding of the difficulty of the Navajo Nation . . .''\n\n\n                      Stakeholders and colleagues\n\n       Laura Crane, The Nature Conservancy: ``The Nature \n     Conservancy commends David Hayes for his commitment to find \n     workable solutions that support renewable energy goals and \n     protect the needs of people and nature. The approach \n     developed for solar development on federal land under Mr. \n     Hayes' leadership represents an important step forward in how \n     energy can be smartly developed on our public lands and \n     should serve as a model for how the Bureau of Land Management \n     addresses all forms of energy development.''\n       Helen O'Shea, NRDC: ``David Hayes has been a major leader \n     of the Interior Department during the Obama Administration \n     just as he was during the Clinton Administration. He has left \n     a tremendous legacy, particularly in connection with the \n     development of the Department's new program for managing \n     solar resources of the public lands.''\n       Chris Wood, Trout Unlimited: ``David Hayes defines all that \n     is good about public service . . . He understands the \n     imperative of protecting special places such as Bristol Bay, \n     Alaska--the world's most important salmon fishery--from \n     industrial mining. Yet, in a demonstration of his balance, he \n     also led Interior's push to expand renewable energy \n     development on public lands while protecting fish, wildlife \n     and water resources.''\n       ``David is smart, hard-working and very responsive to \n     constituents, regardless of what side of the aisle they sit. \n     He is a strong advocate of using collaboration to resolve \n     vexing natural resource problems such as on the Klamath and \n     Penobscot rivers where dam removal will open hundreds of \n     miles for migrating salmon and other ocean-going fish. He \n     will be missed.''\n\n[[Page S5617]]\n\n       John Podesta, Center for American Progress: ``Serving two \n     presidents with honor and distinction, David Hayes has helped \n     solve some of the nation's most complicated natural-resources \n     challenges over the past two decades. He has brokered \n     everything from water deals in California to the settlements \n     of longstanding injustices in Indian country. He has been a \n     leader in helping us prepare for the impacts of climate \n     change on America's lands while ushering in a new era of \n     smartly planned renewable-energy development in the Southwest \n     and off our coasts. He has rightly earned a reputation as an \n     honest broker, a tireless worker, a dedicated public servant, \n     and an MVP when it comes to preserving America's great \n     spaces.''\n       Greg Pensabene, America's Natural Gas Alliance: ``During a \n     time when technological advances associated with natural gas \n     production have created new opportunities for our country, \n     David has emphasized the need for safe and responsible \n     development, while recognizing the important role that this \n     abundant, American fuel plays in improving national security, \n     cleaning the air, and jumpstarting our economy.''\n       Jim Lanard, Offshore Wind Development Coalition: ``Since \n     May 2009, when he was confirmed Deputy Secretary by a \n     unanimous vote of the U.S. Senate, David Hayes has been a \n     leader for offshore wind in the United States. While the \n     industry is more than 20 years old in Europe, it is brand new \n     here. Deputy Secretary Hayes understood this and impressively \n     led his team to bring U.S. regulations into the 21st century. \n     Under `Smart from the Start,' he prepared federal and state \n     governments to build a future for offshore wind energy.''\n       National Congress of American Indians: ``Deputy Secretary \n     David Hayes will depart the Department of Interior having \n     left an indelible mark on the federal trust relationship \n     between the federal government and tribal nations. He has \n     been a consistent presence in Indian Country working \n     tirelessly to uphold our nation-to-nation relationship. As a \n     key member of Secretary Salazar's team during the first term \n     of the Obama Administration, David will be part of a legacy \n     that has launched a new era in federal-tribal relations and \n     set a new baseline for the Department of the Interior's \n     engagement with tribal nations.''\n       Jamie Williams, The Wilderness Society: ``David leaves \n     behind a tremendous conservation legacy at the Department of \n     Interior, and we are deeply grateful for his work over the \n     last four years.''\n       McKie Campbell, Senate Energy and Natural Resources \n     Committee: ``I think whether you're agreeing with him or \n     disagreeing with him on issues, David has established a good \n     reputation as a square shooter . . . He listens, he \n     communicates with people well, he's fair.''\n       Randall Luthi, National Ocean Industries Association: \n     ``David Hayes was an experienced and often calm head through \n     some very trying times both at the Department of the Interior \n     and for the offshore oil and gas industry. He also made the \n     effort to meet with industry officials, from large to small \n     companies, to understand their concerns. Certainly decisions \n     were made that may not have been industry's first choice, but \n     he listened.''\n       Dean Elizabeth Magill, Stanford Law School: ``David has \n     proven himself to be a visionary, effective, and wise policy \n     maker.''\n       Paul Bledsoe, former Clinton Administration official: \n     ``(A)mong the top three or four most important Democrats on \n     natural resources issues in the last 20 years . . . Hayes has \n     ridden point with Secretary Salazar on many critical issues, \n     including offshore Alaska leases, siting of renewable energy \n     on public lands and fracking regulations that allow for \n     responsible shale development . . . It's hard to imagine \n     anyone more expert in balancing the demands of resource \n     protection, energy development and public uses of our \n     national lands.''\n       Marilyn Heiman, Pew Center for the Environment: ``Few \n     policymakers have the knowledge and the strategic capacity to \n     navigate complex and challenging natural resource issues and \n     reach successful outcomes as David.''\n       ``I don't agree with all the decisions that have been made \n     by the Department of Interior on offshore drilling, but I \n     think they have been really well vetted and really thoroughly \n     reviewed, and I have to say that I hadn't seen that kind of \n     work in the past.''\n       ``This is a complicated area with a lot of different \n     constituencies. He has immersed himself in the nuts and \n     bolts.''\n       Phil Taylor, E reporter: ``Hayes' work as a diplomat on \n     Capitol Hill has been seen as an asset for the Obama \n     administration as it tackles controversial land management \n     challenges ranging from hydraulic fracturing to the \n     management of sage grouse, wolves, wind power and national \n     monuments on public lands.''\n       ``Hayes, who also served as counselor and deputy secretary \n     during the Clinton administration, had a hand in nearly every \n     significant Interior policy over the past four . . . years He \n     is credited with leading efforts to respond to and prepare \n     for climate change at a landscape scale.''\n       ``Under President Clinton, Hayes is credited with \n     conserving old-growth redwoods in Northern California, \n     pushing for the restoration of California's bay-delta \n     ecosystem, and settling long-standing American Indian water \n     rights disputes.''\n       ``Hayes drew praise among conservation leaders and \n     sportsmen's groups, which credited him with expanding \n     renewable energy production on public lands while protecting \n     valued habitats.''\n       ``Described by some as a policy wonk, Hayes is known for \n     his attention to detail and has been seen poring over stacks \n     of binders in the Interior library. Sources say he reads many \n     of the department's environmental impact statements, fat \n     books that weigh the potential environmental outcomes of \n     agency decisions.''\n\n\n             Excerpts from emails to Deputy Secretary Hayes\n\n                 From current and former DOI employees\n\n       ``Please know that your work never went unnoticed in the \n     field, and we are very grateful to you for your support \n     throughout the years.''\n       ``I am simply writing to say thank you. Thank you from the \n     bottom of my heart, and with the utmost sincerity, for \n     placing the arctic on the national agenda. We are an arctic \n     nation, and thank you so much for all of the tireless hours \n     you have dedicated to the north, its people, and associated \n     issues and concerns . . . I have developed a deep respect for \n     you from a considerable lateral and vertical distance, and I \n     want you to know that all of your hard work has meant a lot \n     to at least one person in this wonderful state of Alaska.''\n       ``I have appreciated your intelligence, your wit, and your \n     thoughtful approach to managing the myriad of complicated \n     issues here at the Department, and your work ethic has been \n     nothing short of inspiring.''\n       ``Your keen interest in Alaska and our multi-faceted (i.e. \n     gnarly) issues has been particularly helpful to our work \n     here. Your knowledge of all things big and small never ceased \n     to amaze me. I hope that the many things that you started and \n     shepherded will continue to their good end that you \n     envisioned.''\n       ``David, you've been such a mentor to me, and I credit a \n     lot of my personal successes to your guidance and support. As \n     for your time at the Interior Department, you always were the \n     smartest person in the room, and an inspiring leader. And of \n     course, and you've helped make history in overseeing DOI's \n     incredible conservation and renewable energy work.''\n       ``I know I speak for everyone who's had the chance to work \n     closely with you over the past four years when I say that you \n     will be very dearly missed here. I find it hard to imagine \n     the Deputy Secretary's office, the Department and countless \n     individual initiatives without your leadership and vision.''\n       ``I learned much in my time at DOI and from you. One \n     particular lesson was the importance of having a Deputy \n     Secretary that understands DC and is willing to take the hits \n     for the Secretary again and again. I know this was invaluable \n     for the Secretary's agenda and for Interior.''\n       I want you to know that from my perspective as a career \n     employee of almost 25 years, I can say honestly, and without \n     any ulterior motives, that your legacy in Indian Country is \n     one to be proud of and I think pretty darned unsurpassed. \n     There are few thank yous in this business and I know that is \n     not what motivates you. But I for one think you have done a \n     great job and everyone is going to see how good it was once \n     you are gone. I know that there are many others, tribal \n     leaders included, who share my opinion.\n\n\n                           From stakeholders\n\n       ``Selfishly, we are sad you are leaving the Department. It \n     has been great working with you. As all the press reports \n     say--you brought a very high standard to the Department and \n     this will not be easy for the Secretary to replace . . . It \n     has been a full term of work and so many challenges. We have \n     appreciated your strong interest in Alaska and the Arctic, \n     your dedication and hard work, your trust very much.''\n       ``As you know, I'd feared this decision was coming for some \n     time . . . Wanted you to know that I feel indebted to you for \n     the continuing time, attention, expertise and consistent \n     commitment that you've always made to elevate and address \n     California-related conservation issues. You have made a real \n     difference in your work at the Department--and beyond--over \n     now two different Administrations.''\n       ``I can't begin to fathom all the pressures and demands \n     that have been placed upon you. Nevertheless, you were always \n     willing to engage on issues of conservation concern, you were \n     unfailingly gracious, you led the effort to bring appropriate \n     attention to Arctic issues, and I am confident that you had a \n     central role in securing the gains that have been made, in \n     particular the balanced approach to management of the NPR-A, \n     for which I am especially grateful.''\n       ``I can't always agree with where we end up but the fact is \n     you've been the highest ranking US official in 30 years to \n     constantly give this Arctic part of the world attention, and \n     that's worthy of recognition and gratitude.''\n       ``No one has contributed more to the spirit of conservation \n     and the wise use of our nation's resources than you have over \n     the past 20 years.''\n       ``I had the pleasure of working for over 30 years as a \n     Federal employee and worked with many outstanding leaders. In \n     my estimation your contributions elevate you to the top tier \n     of leadership. I have always been impressed with your \n     outstanding ability to listen, to remain positive, to be \n     accessible and maybe most of all in these challenging times \n     to be honest in your assessment and discussions about your \n     views.''\n\n\n                               Colleagues\n\n       ``We could not have made it without your support, your \n     intervention at all the right\n\n[[Page S5618]]\n\n     times, and your full participation . . . We owe you a debt of \n     gratitude; and for me, personally, it has helped remind me \n     yet again of what true public service looks like.''\n       ``You are going to be sorely missed in the Department. Your \n     record over the years is incredibly impressive. I hope that \n     you will be able to look back in the years ahead and see how \n     your work lives on in so many ways and for so many millions \n     of people. I am proud to know you and to call you a friend \n     and colleague.''\n       ``This is a huge loss for our community . . . From the \n     fiery speech you delivered at the Great Outdoors America \n     reception in 2011 to your focus on regional energy issues in \n     Alaska, it was refreshing to have such a strong friend of \n     conservation at DOI.''\n       ``I am sad for the public lands and great places in America \n     that you are leaving the Department of the Interior . . . You \n     have been the best possible advocate for everything that is \n     most important to me.''\n       ``It is a big loss for us today in the Obama \n     Administration. We are all so sad to see you go . . . You \n     have a big fan club and will be so sorely missed!''\n       ``You have been a steady, smart, and fun ally and friend \n     throughout. I appreciate you and will miss you during the \n     rest of my time in the Obama Administration.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/10/senate-section/article/S5618-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5618]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     REMEMBERING DR. CLINTON PATTEA\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to acknowledge the \npassing of longtime tribal leader Dr. Clinton Pattea, the president of \nthe Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation in Arizona.\n  Dr. Pattea was one of the longest serving Native American public \nofficials in the Nation. Last year--coinciding with the State of \nArizona's centennial celebration--we marked Dr. Pattea entering his \n50th year of service to the Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation's tribal \ncouncil. While he held a variety of elected posts, including tribal \ncouncilman and vice president, most of his time in office was spent \nserving as the tribe's president.\n  President Pattea was a true visionary in his community and throughout \nIndian Country. He was a strong advocate for the principles of tribal \nself-governance and Indian self-determination, which over the years \nhelped bring about positive change in the relationship between the \nFederal Government and all Native Americans.\n  He was among the first tribal leaders in Arizona to acknowledge the \ntremendous economic potential that Indian gaming offered his people. \nDr. Pattea was a fierce advocate for developing a government-to-\ngovernment relationship with the State of Arizona and worked tirelessly \nto spearhead a voter-approved tribal gaming compact that has made \nArizona the pinnacle of regulated Indian gaming that we know today.\n  Over the past 30 years, I have personally witnessed the Fort McDowell \nYavapai make tremendous strides as a community, and I attribute much of \nthat success to Dr. Pattea's leadership. He directed his tribal \ngovernment to develop business ventures to help take his community out \nof poverty; he successfully fought for the Nation's Federal water \nrights settlement; and he assembled a tribal government that is among \nthe best examples of a sovereign governing body in the country. Today, \nthe Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation stands as a leader in the Valley of \nthe Sun as well as the United States.\n  We were fortunate to have been enriched by Dr. Pattea's passion for \npublic service. His work with the tribal council brought him immense \nsatisfaction. It is fitting that his legacy will continue on through \nthe recently established Dr. Clinton M. and Rosiebelle Pattea \nFoundation, which will fund tribal scholarships for education, culture, \nhealth and wellness programs in his name.\n  I offer my deepest condolences to the Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation on \nDr. Clinton Pattea's passing. My thoughts and prayers are with his \ntribal members and his loved ones.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/10/senate-section/article/S5618-2", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5618-S5619]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO COLONEL KEVIN J. WILSON\n\n Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and pay \ntribute to COL Kevin J. Wilson for his exceptional contributions to the \nNation as he concludes 30 years of service in the U.S. Army, \nculminating as commander of the U.S. Army Engineer Research and \nDevelopment Center. Throughout his Army career, Colonel Wilson has \ndisplayed superior leadership, outstanding professional competence and \ninitiative, dedication, and commitment to the welfare of soldiers, \ncivilians, and their families. He has made significant and lasting \ncontributions to the development, training, and leadership of the Army.\n  Colonel Wilson has performed with distinction in all of his \nassignments including as the group operations officer for the 555th \nCombat Engineer Group, the military assistant to the Assistant \nSecretary of the Army for Civil Works while stationed at the Pentagon, \nthe battalion commander of the 249th Engineer Battalion (Prime Power) \nat Fort Belvoir, VA, the U.S. Northern Command/J-4 Army engineer \nofficer at Peterson Air Force Base, CO, the Commander of the Alaska \nDistrict, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and, most recently, as the \ncommander of the Engineer Research and Development Center.\n  As commander of the Engineer Research and Development Center, the \nDepartment of Defense's largest multi-disciplined engineering and \nresearch center, Colonel Wilson has taken the organization to the \nhighest performance levels with a focus on human capital and \npositioning the center for dramatic increases in performance and \neffectiveness. His support of research and development is second to \nnone, and he provides innovative pathways for technology transfer that \nspeeds the integration of new ideas. Colonel Wilson has also supported \nthe warfighter by equipping both deploying tactical units and the U.S. \nArmy Engineer School with new combat systems and training on the \nEngineer Research and Development Center's capabilities.\n  Colonel Wilson was an extremely effective brigade-level commander in \nAfghanistan, responsible for all corps operations for Regional Command-\nSouth and Regional Command-West. His efforts focused on military \nconstruction in support of the buildup of U.S. forces, facilities for \nthe Afghanistan National Security Forces, and water resources and \ninfrastructure projects. While deployed, he coordinated with regional \nand battlespace commanders, North Atlantic Treaty Organization and \ncoalition partners, Provincial Reconstruction Teams, U.S. Forces-\nAfghanistan, the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Agency for \nInternational Development, and U.S. and Afghan government agencies and \norganizations at all levels. During this deployment, he focused on big \npicture projects such as electricity for Kandahar and critical road \ninfrastructure for Regional Command-S, proving he could successfully \nintegrate the operations of U.S. and coalition partners.\n  Colonel Wilson was commander of the Alaska District, U.S. Army Corps \nof Engineers, where he led 500 personnel, executing military \nconstruction, civil works, and environmental programs throughout the \nState. Due to his drive and foresight, Colonel Wilson's command was \nable to execute end-of-year funding to protect Alaska Native villages \nfrom coastal erosion. This tremendous feat was recognized by the Alaska \nCongressional delegation and the Alaska Native community. As commander \nof the largest geographic and perhaps most complex U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers district, Colonel Wilson deftly weaved disparate units into a \ncohesive team driven to deliver excellent products to its customers, \nwinning four Pacific Air Force Engineer awards and being named the U.S. \nArmy Corps of Engineers Project Delivery Team of the Year. Under his \nleadership, the Alaska District consistently improved its delivery of \nmilitary construction, civil works, and environmental projects, \nensuring they were on time and under budget, routinely winning \naccolades from customers.\n  As the U.S. Northern Command/J-4 engineer officer stationed at \nPeterson Air Force Base, Colonel Wilson was the subject matter expert \non Army military construction capabilities, prime power, electrical \npower systems, and emergency support functions. He served as a trusted \nmember of the Federal Emergency Management Agency disaster response \nteam during several hurricanes, later leading a hurricane conference, \nfrom which a pre-scripted request for assistance was developed, to help \nlocal officials better understand the assets available during a \ndisaster. As a part of the Joint Planning\n\n[[Page S5619]]\n\nGroup, he was an integral part of long range homeland defense planning. \nHe was also a member of the Current Operations Group and played a key \nrole as the J-4 representative during crisis operations and exercises.\n  Colonel Wilson had the distinct honor of leading the 249th Engineer \nBattalion, the only Prime Power Engineer Battalion in the Army. He was \nresponsible for contingency deployment of power production personnel, \nas well as power generation and distribution of equipment in support of \nCombat Commanders, Joint Task Forces, and Installation Commanders \nworldwide. His soldiers kept up an unbelievable operations tempo during \nOperation Iraqi Freedom and deployments to Afghanistan, Kuwait, \nPhilippines, Kyrgyzstan, Guam, and Turkey. Support operations included \nmajor deployments in disaster relief. Colonel Wilson was also \nresponsible for the Prime Power School, for its training program and \nfor recruitment and retention. As a battalion commander, he was a \nproven professional who always accomplished the mission, took care of \nhis soldiers, and planned, thought, and communicated as a leader.\n  I would like to extend my deepest thanks to Colonel Wilson for his \nmany years of service to our Nation. I wish the absolute best to him \nand his family as they begin this next stage in their lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/10/senate-section/article/S5619-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5619]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/10/senate-section/article/S5619-2", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5619]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/10/senate-section/article/S5619-3", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5619]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 1:06 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the following concurrent resolution, in which it requests the \nconcurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.

Res. 194\n\n       Whereas, in 1963, Coach George Ireland led the men's \n     basketball team of Loyola University Chicago (referred to in \n     this preamble as the ``Ramblers'') to the Division I National \n     Collegiate Athletic Association (referred to in this preamble \n     as the ``NCAA'') men's basketball championship;\n       Whereas the Ramblers lost only 2 games during the 1962-1963 \n     season and led the Nation in scoring with an average of 91.8 \n     points per game;\n       Whereas Coach Ireland and the Loyola University men's \n     basketball teams of the early 1960s are considered by many to \n     be responsible for ushering in a new era of racial equality \n     in the sport by shattering major racial barriers in NCAA \n     men's basketball;\n       Whereas, in 1963, the Ramblers shocked the Nation and \n     changed college basketball forever by starting 4 African-\n     American players in the NCAA tournament, as well as the \n     championship game;\n       Whereas it is difficult to appreciate what Coach Ireland \n     and his team went through, starting in 1961, in breaking what \n     had been a longstanding ``gentleman's agreement'' to play not \n     more than 3 African-American players;\n       Whereas, during the 1962-1963 season, Coach Ireland started \n     4 African-American players in every game, and, in December \n     1962, the Ramblers became the first team in NCAA Division I \n     history to have an all-African-American lineup in a game \n     against the University of Wyoming;\n       Whereas, despite their success during the 1962-1963 season, \n     the players and Coach Ireland endured terrible bigotry, \n     including racial taunts and abuse, and received countless \n     pieces of hate mail from the Ku Klux Klan and other racist \n     individuals, and all the while Coach Ireland tried to shield \n     his team in every way possible;\n       Whereas the men's basketball team of Mississippi State \n     University (referred to in this preamble as the ``Maroons'' \n     and now called the ``Bulldogs'') won its second consecutive \n     southeastern conference championship in 1963, but had been \n     forced by the Governor of Mississippi not to accept NCAA \n     tournament bids in the 3 previous seasons because of the \n     inclusion of African-American players in the tournament;\n       Whereas, before advancing to the championship round, the \n     Ramblers participated in the NCAA Midwest regional semifinal \n     against the Maroons, a landmark game often referred to half a \n     century later as the ``Game of Change'';\n       Whereas Mississippi State University president Dean Colvard \n     and athletic director and men's basketball coach James \n     Harrison ``Babe'' McCarthy bravely accepted the Maroons' 1963 \n     NCAA tournament invitation against the wishes of the Governor \n     of Mississippi;\n       Whereas, determined to play in the regional semifinal, the \n     Maroons snuck out of Mississippi in the middle of the night \n     to avoid an injunction, and the integrated Ramblers and the \n     all-white Maroons met on the basketball court at Michigan \n     State University on March 15, 1963;\n       Whereas, with police surrounding the sports complex in East \n     Lansing, Michigan, the Ramblers went on to defeat the Maroons \n     in a competitive game by a score of 61 to 51 in the regional \n     semifinal, a game that changed race relations on the \n     basketball court forever and was selected by the NCAA in 2006 \n     as one of the 25 defining moments in the first 100 years of \n     the organization;\n       Whereas the Ramblers went on to win games against the \n     University of Illinois and Duke University before defeating \n     the 2-time defending NCAA champion University of Cincinnati \n     in overtime by a score of 60 to 58, the crowning achievement \n     in Loyola University Chicago's nearly decade-long struggle \n     with racial inequality in men's college basketball, \n     highlighted by the tumultuous events of the 1963 NCAA \n     tournament;\n       Whereas the Ramblers' 1963 NCAA title was historic not only \n     for the racial makeup of the Ramblers, but also because the \n     University of Cincinnati had started 3 African-American \n     players, making 7 of the 10 starters in the 1963 NCAA \n     championship game African American;\n       Whereas the city of Chicago has many storied sports teams, \n     but the Ramblers basketball team of 1963 and Coach Ireland \n     hold an exalted place because they are the only NCAA Division \n     I Illinois basketball team to win a national championship and \n     because they paved the way for the long overdue integration \n     of races in college basketball before the enactment of the \n     Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Public Law 88-352; 78 Stat. 241);\n       Whereas all 5 starting players from the national \n     championship game graduated from Loyola University with a \n     degree, and several went on to earn advanced degrees in law \n     and business;\n       Whereas the journey of the Ramblers is not just the story \n     of an underdog team overcoming great odds to beat the favored \n     team from the University of Cincinnati, a much larger \n     basketball program that held the number 1 ranking and had won \n     the previous 2 national championships;\n       Whereas the real significance of Coach Ireland and the \n     Ramblers is the lasting impact of their bravery in breaking \n     the racial barrier in college basketball that had been \n     allowed to prevail for decades; and\n       Whereas the 2013 Hall of Fame induction season will mark \n     the 50th anniversary of the 1963 Ramblers' basketball \n     championship, making the 1963 Ramblers the first whole team \n     ever to be honored in the Hall of Fame: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) congratulates Coach George Ireland and the 1963 Loyola \n     University Chicago men's basketball championship team on \n     their induction into the National Collegiate Basketball Hall \n     of Fame;\n       (2) honors the 50th anniversary of the historic Division I \n     National Collegiate Athletic Association championship of the \n     Loyola University Chicago men's basketball team and the \n     profound athletic and civil rights achievements of the 1963 \n     team; and\n       (3) honors the 1963 Mississippi State University men's \n     basketball team for their bravery and sportsmanship in \n     rejecting racism and aiding in the civil rights movement in \n     the State of Mississippi and the southeastern United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/10/senate-section/article/S5622-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5622]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARING\n\n\n            COMMITTEE ON SMALL BUSINESS AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU.
