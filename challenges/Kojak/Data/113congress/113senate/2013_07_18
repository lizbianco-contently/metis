We hope to confirm both the Perez and McCarthy nominations \ntoday.\n  We are ready to move on this whenever my Republican colleagues say \nthey want to. What would be the right thing to do would be to vote on \nPerez this morning and vote on the cloture motion I filed regarding \nMcCarthy.

Mr. President, I object to all three of these matters \nproceeding further at this time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard. The bills will \nbe placed on the Calendar.\n\n\n                              Nominations\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today, as part of this week's agreement to \nprocess nominations, the Senate will vote on confirmation of the Perez \nnomination to lead the Department of Labor, and we will vote on the \ncloture motion on the nomination of Gina McCarthy to lead the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency.\n  I hope we can move forward on these matters as quickly as possible.\n  Gina McCarthy is an accomplished environmental official who has \nserved under several Republican Governors, including Governor Romney. \nShe has worked in Democratic administrations\n\n[[Page S5760]]\n\nalso. As a top environmental official in Massachusetts and Connecticut, \nshe has expanded energy efficiency and renewable energy programs.\n  We had a wonderful event yesterday morning where the EPA building was \nnamed after President Clinton. He stood and talked about what he and \nVice President Gore had done to help the environment, and he stressed \ntime and time again it is important to have a growing, strong economy \nand to make sure we take care of the environment in the process because \nthose two things are not in conflict.\n  Gina McCarthy is now Assistant EPA Administrator, and it has been her \njob to come up with creative new ways to keep our air clean and our \nwater safe while growing the economy, as President Clinton said.\n  She was nominated several months ago. I spoke to her yesterday \nmorning, as she was with President Clinton, and she was anxious to have \na vote today. She has a proven track record of public service, there is \nno question about that.\n  Tom Perez, the nominee to lead the Department of Labor, is also an \nexperienced public servant. He is from Buffalo, NY, the son of \nDominican immigrants. As we have heard, he put himself through college \nworking at a warehouse and as a garbage collector. He graduated from \nBrown University, one of the most prestigious universities in America, \nand in fact the world, as is Harvard Law School. He went to both of \nthose fine universities.\n  He served as Deputy Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights under \nJanet Reno, who was Attorney General for our country. He was appointed \nby Governor O'Malley in 2007 to serve as secretary of the Maryland \nDepartment of Labor where he helped implement the country's first \nstatewide living wage law.\n  Four years ago he was confirmed by the Senate with 72 votes to lead \nthe Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice in Washington. \nThere he has helped resolve cases on behalf of families targeted by \nunfair mortgage lending.\n  He is very qualified, with his education and background, and he will \nbe an excellent Secretary of Labor. So I look forward to our confirming \nhim as soon as we can.\n\n\n                      Student Loan Interest Rates\n\n  Mr. President, I am very hopeful we can wind up the discussions we \nhave had for several weeks now on student loans. There has been \nwonderful bipartisan discussions in this regard. Again, the legislation \nthat has been presented to me isn't everything I want, but it is the \nwork of a number of Democratic and Republican Senators working very \nlong hours--in fact, those Senators had a meeting the night before last \nwith the President that lasted about an hour and a half.\n  So we have to get this done as soon as possible. Of course, we have \nmade it retroactive because we know the student loan rate went up from \n3.4 percent to 6.8 percent the first of this month, and we need to make \nsure that legislation gets done before we leave. With people processing \ntheir applications to go to school this fall, we should get it done as \nquickly as possible. It is possible we could do it today.\n  I appreciate--and I hope I don't miss mentioning anyone, though I am \nconfident I will--the Senators who have worked so hard on this issue. \nBut those who have worked together on this compromise have been \nSenators Harkin, Durbin, King, and Manchin on our side; and on the \nRepublican side, Senators Alexander, Coburn, and Burr. There have been \nothers. In the process, we also have a number of Senators who may not \nbe totally pleased with this agreement that is contemplated, but they \nhave all worked so hard--Jack Reed and Elizabeth Warren.\n  What I would like to do, and I hope we can do it as soon as possible, \nwith the compromise that has been worked out with the Senators I \nmentioned--and whatever Senator Reed and others want to do--we would \nhave a couple of votes to make sure everyone has the ability to vote on \ntheir legislation. I hope we can do it this way. It would be the right \nway to go in solving this issue.\n  If we do this, we would not be back next year to do it. It will be \ndone. We would not be back in 2 years. It will be done. So I hope very \nmuch we can get this done. I applaud all these Senators who have worked \nso hard for so long to come up with an agreement.\n  Again, I repeat for the third time even this morning, this isn't \ngoing to be everything the Presiding Officer wants, the Republican \nleader or I want, but, hopefully, it will be a step forward.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                              Nominations\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today the Senate will consider the \nnominations of Thomas Perez and Gina McCarthy to head the Department of \nLabor and the EPA. I will be voting against both of these nominees, and \nI would like to explain why.\n  Tom Perez is someone who has devoted much of his career to causes he \nbelieves in. That is certainly admirable, but the duty of advice and \nconsent is about more than just ascertaining whether a nominee has good \nintentions. Far more important is considering the way a nominee has \ngone about pursuing them. It is about what he or she would do on the \njob. And that--that--is where the Perez nomination begins to break down \nbecause based on the evidence, Tom Perez is more than just some \nleftwing ideolog, he is a leftwing ideolog who appears perfectly \nwilling to bend the rules to achieve his ends. It is this ``ends \njustify the means'' approach to his work, not simply his ideological \npassion, that is so worrying to me about Mr. Perez.\n  A few examples from his past paint the picture. Media reports \nindicate that as a member of a county council in Maryland, Mr. Perez \ntried to get the county to break Federal law by unlawfully importing \nforeign drugs even after a top FDA official said Federal law was ``very \nclear,'' and that there was ``no question'' that doing so would be \n``undeniably illegal.''\n  When the County Executive, a fellow Democrat, ultimately decided not \nto instruct county employees to break the law, as Mr. Perez advocated--\nwhich could have subjected those workers to criminal prosecution--he \nlambasted the County Executive as ``so timid.''\n  ``Federal law is muddled,'' Mr. Perez argued, adding, ``sometimes you \nhave to push the envelope.'' Sometimes you have to push the envelope.\n  Throughout his career, however, Perez has done more than just push \nthe envelope. He once pushed through a county policy that encouraged \nthe circumvention of Federal immigration law. As the head of the \nFederal Government's top voting rights watchdog, he refused to protect \nthe right to vote for Americans of all races in violation of the very \nlaw he was charged with enforcing. He also directed the Federal \nGovernment to sue a law-abiding woman who was protesting outside an \nabortion clinic in Florida.\n  The Federal judge who threw out this lawsuit said he was ``at a loss \nas to why the government chose to prosecute this particular case in the \nfirst place.''\n  Just as troubling, when Mr. Perez has been called to account for his \nfailures to follow the law, he has been less than forthright. When he \ntestified that politics played no role in his office's decision not to \npursue charges against members of a far-left group that may have \nprevented others from voting, the Department's own watchdog--their own \nwatchdog--said ``Perez's testimony did not reflect the entire story,'' \nand a Federal judge said the evidence before him ``appear[ed] to \ncontradict . . . Perez's testimony.'' Appeared to contradict Perez's \ntestimony.\n  In short, Mr. Perez made misleading statements in this case, under \noath, to both Congress and the U.S. Civil Rights Commission. Taken \ntogether, this is reflective not of some passionate leftwinger who \nviews himself as patiently advocating policies within the bounds of a \ndemocratic system, but as a crusading ideologue whose convictions lead \nhim to believe the law simply doesn't apply to him.\n  As Secretary of Labor, Mr. Perez would be handling numerous \ncontentious issues and implementing many politically sensitive laws. \nAmericans of all political persuasions have a right to expect the head \nof such an important Federal department, whether appointed by a \nRepublican or a Democrat, would implement and follow the law in a fair \nand reasonable way. I do not believe they could expect as much from Mr.\n\n[[Page S5761]]\n\nPerez, and that is why I will be voting against him today.\n  As for Gina McCarthy, I have no doubt she is a well-meaning public \nservant. We had some good conversations when she came to visit my \noffice earlier this year. But as the head of EPA's air division, she is \noverseeing the implementation of numerous job-killing regulations. \nThese regulations, along with others promulgated by the EPA, have had a \ndevastating effect in States such as mine.\n  They have helped bring about a depression--depression with a ``d'' in \nparts of Eastern Kentucky.\n  And there is no reason to expect a course correction from Ms. \nMcCarthy if she were to be confirmed as Administrator.\n  In fact, one assumes she would be expected to carry forward the \nPresident's plan to impose, essentially by executive fiat, even more \ndestructive policies--policies similar to those already rejected by a \nDemocrat-controlled Congress.\n  As someone sent here to stand up for the people who elected me, I \ncannot in good conscience support a nominee who would advance more of \nthe same, someone who is not willing to stand up to this \nadministration's war on coal.\n  And remember, this ``war'' talk that is not me saying that. ``A war \non coal is exactly what's needed.'' That is what one of the White \nHouse's own climate advisors said just the other week.\n  All of us--Republicans especially--believe in being good stewards of \nthe environment. But Washington officials have to be rational and \nholistic in their approach. They cannot, as this administration seems \nto think, simply do whatever they want, regardless of the consequences \nfor people who do not live or act or think the same way they do.\n  I do not blame Ms. McCarthy personally for all of the \nadministration's policies. But I believe the EPA needs an Administrator \nwho is ready to step up and challenge the idea that the livelihoods of \nparticular groups of Americans can simply be sacrificed in pursuit of \nsome ivory tower fantasy. That kind of nominee--the kind of nominee I \ncan support--is one who is willing to question the status quo and to \nmake Kentuckians part of the solution.\n\n\n                               Obamacare\n\n  Later today, the President is scheduled to deliver a speech on \nObamacare.\n  He is expected to say that, because of Obamacare, Americans can \nexpect checks in the mail.\n  Sounds great, doesn't it? Free money.\n  But, as they say, most things in life that sound too good to be true \nvery often are.\n  And, in this case, it is not so much that people will be getting free \nmoney, as that most people will be paying many dollars more for their \nhealthcare and maybe--just maybe--getting a few bucks back.\n  In other words, if you are a family in Covington facing a $2,100 \npremium increase under Obamacare, then, really, what would you rather \nhave: a check for $100 or so or a way to avoid the $2,100 premium \nincrease in the first place?\n  I think the answer is pretty obvious.\n  I think most Kentuckians would agree that this is just another sad \nattempt by the administration to spin them into wanting a law they do \nnot want.\n  And there is this to consider: Even though we expect the President \ntoday to tout about $500 million worth of these types of refunds, what \nhe will not say is that next year Obamacare will impose a new sales tax \non the purchase of health insurance that will cost Americans about $8 \nbillion. That is a 16 to 1 ratio.\n  So if the administration is concerned with saving people money on \ntheir health care, I have some advice for them.\n  Work with us to repeal Obamacare and start over--work with us to \nimplement common-sense, step-by-step reforms that can actually lower \ncosts for Kentuckians. Because jacking up our constituents' health care \ncosts is bad enough, but to try to then convince them the opposite is \nhappening--that they have actually won some Publishers Clearinghouse \nsweepstakes, well, it is just as absurd as it sounds. It is really an \ninsult and I know Kentuckians aren't going to buy it.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to mark a somber \nmilestone. Nearly 1 year ago, Colorado and the Nation were shocked by \nthe horrific scene at an Aurora movie theater. Even before the sun rose \nthat Friday, July 20, 2012, we began hearing of a senseless mass \nshooting that took the lives of 12 people and injured 70 more.\n  Today I want to mark the anniversary of this tragedy and to honor the \nstrength that so many Coloradans have shown--both on that day and in \nthe weeks and months since.\n  The Aurora theater shooting shook us, it shocked us, it outraged us, \nbut, as I said one year ago, it did not break us. Even today we are \nseeing that the legacy of this terrible tragedy is not the horror of \nthat day but, rather, the courage and resilience of the people who have \nrefused to let this event define their lives.\n  Take, for example, 18-year-old Zack Golditch, who endured surgery and \nweeks of recovery so he could continue with his football career and \nbecome a repeat state discus champion. The Denver Post recently named \nhim the winner of their Adversity Conquered through Excellence award \nand this fall he will begin his freshman year as an offensive lineman \nat CSU.\n  Or Marcus Weaver, who was shot twice but now hosts a weekly radio \nshow in Denver that spotlights great Americans who are making a \ndifference in the community. Marcus also works with his church to help \npeople who have struggled through addiction or incarceration and now \ntravels the country inspiring others with his story and pushing them to \ntake charge of their lives.\n  These are just two of the countless examples of the perseverance of \npeople who were affected by the Aurora shooting. Zack and Marcus's \nstrength defines us as Americans. That is something in which we can \ntake great pride.\n  It is the kind of strength we honor in remembering this tragedy now a \nyear later. In particular, we look back and honor young men like 26-\nyear-old Jon Blunk and 24-year-old Alexander Teves who sacrificed their \nlives to protect their friends. And then there were the countless \npolice and other first responders who rushed to the scene to care for \nthe wounded and to stop the shooter before he could injure others.\n  Colorado has known too many tragedies these past several years. From \nthe Aurora theater shooting to wildfires in Colorado Springs, Fort \nCollins and elsewhere that have threatened and destroyed entire \ncommunities and left hundreds of our friends and neighbors without \nhomes.\n  We have seen the same spirit of sacrifice and resilience, as \nfirefighters and community members have banded together to fight the \nBlack Forest Fire, the West Fork Complex Fire and the other blazes that \nhave threatened entire communities across Colorado this year.\n  This Saturday, on the 1-year anniversary of the Aurora theater \nshooting, let's take time to remember those we have lost and to honor \nthe resilience of our neighbors who press on with their lives, \nundaunted by this terrible act.\n  In that spirit, I want to read into the Record the names of the \ntwelve people who lost their lives one year ago. We must never forget \nthese names: Matt McQuinn, Micayla Medek, Jessica Ghawi, Gordon Cowden, \nJesse Childress, John Larimer, Jonathan Blunk, Veronica Moser-Sullivan, \nAlex Sullivan, Alexander Teves, Rebecca Wingo, and Alexander Boik.\n  I hope that we can draw strength from the tragic loss of those 12 \nwonderful, beautiful people and that it leads\n\n[[Page S5762]]\n\nus to redouble our efforts to be better people--to be more \nunderstanding to our friends and more loving to our families and to \naspire to live our lives with the courage that the people of Aurora and \nColorado have shown over the course of this last year.\n  I think that the leaders here in Washington could learn from their \ncourage. The victims of Aurora have not let setbacks stop them from \nachieving great things and making their community a better place to \nlive. They, in fact, have refused to allow the word ``victim'' to \ndefine them.\n  Of course, we still have work to do to prevent future mass shootings. \nThere are many commonsense steps that we can and must take to reduce \nsenseless gun violence. But today is not a time for a policy debate. \nToday is a day to remember the victims, to honor the heroes from that \nterrible day last year, and to commit ourselves to never forgetting \ntheir memory.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, let me commend the Senator from Colorado \nfor his critical reminder to all of us about how you can get up each \nday and never know what life brings to you, but to remember not that \nthe people so senselessly lost their lives, but the courage and passion \nthey have left for all of us. I thank him for that important reminder.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. I thank the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/18/senate-section/article/S5762-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5762]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            PEREZ NOMINATION\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I want to speak briefly about our vote \ntoday to confirm Thomas Perez as our next Secretary of Labor, and I \nwant to touch on a couple of reasons, of separate reasons, this \nparticular confirmation is so important for this body and for our \ncountry.\n  First, something we have talked about for several days here is \nproviding the President and his administration with the team he needs \nto help our country grow, for our economy, our families, and \ncommunities in every one of our home States. Filling the position of \nLabor Secretary could not be more important. We all rely on the \nDepartment of Labor to do a lot of important work for American workers \nand American businesses--providing critical workforce development and \njob training services to help get people back to work or into better \njobs, making sure we have high workplace safety standards, improving \nconditions and opportunities for women, and helping our service men and \nwomen find good jobs when they come home. Our country and our economy \nare stronger when the Department of Labor has a talented, qualified \nleader at the reins.\n  That brings me to the second reason why this vote is so important, \nand that is the tremendous nominee we have before us today. In Thomas \nPerez, the President has nominated someone who will bring passion and \nintegrity and a lifetime of experience to this very important position. \nLike so many Americans, Mr. Perez comes from very humble beginnings. He \nis a second-generation American who put himself through college by \ncollecting trash and working in the university dining hall. Since that \ntime, he has spent his career fighting for working families, protecting \nour important civil rights laws, and turning around troubled agencies.\n  There is no shortage of examples to demonstrate what an effective \nleader Mr. Perez has been throughout his career. He took an Office of \nCivil Rights at HHS that had been ignored and lifeless and breathed new \nlife into it. He reformed and rebuilt the Department of Labor in \nMaryland, and he walked into a very troubled Civil Rights Division at \nDOJ and, by all credible accounts, he returned high performance, \nprofessionalism, and integrity to that agency.\n  In a time when we need to do everything we can to protect and grow \nour shrinking middle class, Mr. Perez is exactly the right person for \nthis job because in tough times, while we are still recovering from \nrecession, we need strong, experienced leadership at the Department of \nLabor.\n  My colleagues here today who support his confirmation from both sides \nof the aisle are not alone. From his time working at the local and \nState and Federal level, organizations from Maryland and throughout our \ncountry have come out to strongly support him as well. That includes \norganizations that represent women, the LGBT community, the Hispanic \ncommunity, and many more.\n  Finally, throughout his confirmation process, which at times has been \nvery difficult, Mr. Perez has shown nothing but openness, transparency, \nrespect, and the ability to work together and solve problems. That is \nwhy I will vote to confirm him today, and I urge all my colleagues to \nsupport his confirmation as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/18/senate-section/article/S5762-2", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5762-S5763]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          McCARTHY NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise today to explain my vote against \nGina McCarthy, which I will cast later today or the first of next week, \nto be Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. My fight is \nnot with her. My fight is truly with the agency itself, the EPA, and \nthe President who nominated her to head the regulatory agency. That \nfight is not going to end with the Senate's vote on Ms. McCarthy's \nnomination. It will not stop there. The fight will continue until the \nEPA stops its overregulatory rampage and until the President comes up \nwith feasible policies that achieve real energy independence, which is \nwhat I think we all wish for.\n  I don't want anyone to misunderstand me. I have serious disagreements \nwith many of Ms. McCarthy's views on energy and the environment, but I \nwill say I met her a couple of weeks ago for the first time when she \ncame to my office, and I found her to be earnest, friendly, pragmatic, \nincredibly intelligent. She is a talented scientist who has dedicated \nher life to public service. As a matter of fact, she served under \nDemocrats and Republicans alike. I certainly appreciate her pragmatism, \nher willingness to serve her country, and her stellar bipartisan \ncredentials, an extremely rare quality in Washington these days, as \neveryone knows.\n\n  In fact, it is not hard to imagine this same lady could have been \nnominated to be the EPA Administrator--if Mitt Romney would have won--\nby another President from another party. After all, she advised him on \nclimate change when he was Governor of Massachusetts.\n  My vote goes much deeper than her nomination, her views on energy and \nthe environment or even her job performance for the last 4 years as \nhead of air policy at the EPA. My vote against Gina McCarthy is a vote \nagainst the administration's lack of any serious attempt to develop an \nenergy strategy for America's future, which we call an all-of-the-above \npolicy.\n  We need to develop every source of American-made energy, such as \ncoal, natural gas, nuclear, renewables, wind, solar, biomass, and \nbiofuels. We need it all, and we are responsible to make sure we find a \nbalance between the economy and the environment. Everyone knows it is \ncommon sense to use what we have in this country.\n  We need an all-of-the-above policy that includes nuclear, \nhydroelectric, biomass, renewables, such as wind and solar, fossil \nfuels, including oil, natural gas, and coal. I truly believe if we work \ntogether and focus on a commonsense approach, we can develop a strong \nbipartisan energy plan. Such a plan will not only break the power of \nforeign oil countries and speculators, it will also chart a new and \npromising energy future for this great Nation and increase our national \nsecurity and prosperity. Think about that. It will increase our \nnational security and the prosperity of our country.\n  The President often speaks about an all-of-the-above energy policy, \nbut I have to say that his new global climate proposal amounts to a \ntrue declaration of war on one of the above. It is a true declaration \nof war on coal. In fact, the President plans to use the EPA to regulate \nthe coal industry out of existence.\n  The coal industry in the United States of America burns 1 billion \ntons of coal. Eight billion tons of coal is burned in the world today. \nI don't believe the wind currents or the ocean currents start and stop \nin North America. If we stop burning every ton of coal and declare war \non the economy, it will effectively destroy people's lives and jobs as \nwell as their ability to take care of themselves. There is more coal\n\n[[Page S5763]]\n\nburned in the world now than ever before, and it is unregulated. We do \nburn coal better than anyone else, and we can even do it better if the \ngovernment will work with us. All we are asking for is a partnership.\n  It doesn't matter who is elected as the Administrator of the EPA. If \nthe President plans to use the EPA to regulate the coal industry out of \nexistence, it doesn't matter who it is. It could be Ms. McCarthy or \nsomeone else because it is the President and the administration that \nwill be calling all the shots. That is my fight, and it is a fight \nwhere I wish we could sit down and work together. It is a fight we \ncannot lose as the United States of America. There is too much at \nstake.\n  Coal is America's most abundant, most reliable, and most affordable \nsource of energy. In fact, coal keeps the lights on and provides nearly \n40 percent of the electricity in this country--40 percent. Almost half \nof the population of the United States of America depends on coal for \ntheir energy. It is the source of energy that built America. It made \nthe steel that built the factories and defends our country with guns \nand ships. It has done it all. All we are asking for is a partnership \nso we can continue to keep the lights on.\n  With all the clean coal technologies we have--and will continue to \nhave for decades--we can use it in a way that strikes a balance between \nthe environment and the economy. There should always be a balance. It \ncan't be all or nothing. It seems as if we have these extremes today \nwhere a person is either on the right or on the left, absolutely for an \nissue or absolutely against an issue. If there is never a compromise, \nhow can we make it work?\n  There is nobody in West Virginia who wants to breathe dirty air or \ndrink dirty water. Nobody in America wants to do that. We have a \nresponsibility to do it better. In fact, in the last two to three \ndecades, we have cleaned up the environment more than ever in the \nhistory of this country.\n  For the last 40 years, every President has talked about how to end \nour country's addiction to foreign oil in order to achieve energy \nindependence. We know our dependence on oil has taken us to places in \nthe world to fight wars that have sacrificed American men and women as \nwell as the precious resources of this great country. We have been \nfighting wars we shouldn't be in because of our dependence on foreign \noil.\n  We need to stop demonizing one energy resource--and I do mean \ndemonizing it. When people say, I hate this or I hate that or I can't \nstand this--turn the lights off. Turn the air-conditioning off. Turn it \nall off and see how well you like it or don't like it.\n  If we start using all of our resources, we can, once and for all, end \nour dependence on foreign oil. If we end our dependence on foreign oil, \nwe will be a stronger and more secure Nation. We can do that within \nthis generation and keep our economy more secure and our economy \nproducing jobs for generations to come.\n  All I ask is for a level playing field. I ask that our government--in \nthis beautiful country of ours--partner with me and West Virginia so we \ncan work together.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, later today we will vote in the Senate \non the question concerning whether the President's nomination of Thomas \nPerez to be the Secretary of Labor should be confirmed. I will vote no. \nI will vote against the confirmation of Mr. Perez. I do not believe he \nis the right man for this job.\n  The Secretary of Labor has immense influence over the lives of \nworkers and the conduct of business in today's economy. Employees, \nemployers, and unions must be able to trust the Secretary to faithfully \nand impartially execute our Nation's labor laws.\n  At a time when the official unemployment rate stands at 7.6 percent--\nmeaning millions of Americans are looking for work and can't find it--\nand at a time when there is a growing gap between our workers' skills \nand our employers' needs, we need serious leadership on labor policy. \nWe need someone who understands how to create an environment in which \nthe largest number of Americans can find good new jobs. We need \nleadership that is committed to working in the best interests of the \ncountry. Unfortunately, I don't believe Mr. Perez meets that standard.\n  Mr. Perez's life story is one with many worthy accomplishments in \npublic service, a devotion to representing disadvantaged individuals, \nand I commend him for that. But he has demonstrated throughout his \ncareer that he is willing to, in his words, push the envelope to \nadvance his ideology.\n  I believe there are three significant problems with the nomination of \nMr. Perez:\n  No. 1, in my view, his record raises troubling questions about his \nactions while at the Department of Justice and his candor in discussing \nhis actions with this committee.\n  The Department of Justice inspector general recently published a \ndetailed report that discussed problems in the voting rights section. \nIt talked about a politically charged atmosphere of polarization. Mr. \nPerez has administered that section since 2009. The report talked about \nthe unauthorized disclosure of sensitive and confidential information \nand about blatantly partisan political commentary. It specifically \ncriticized the management of the Department and Mr. Perez's actions \nwhile at the Department. When questioned by members of our Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor and Pensions, Mr. Perez's answers were vague \nand nonresponsive.\n  No. 2, to preserve a favorite legal theory, Mr. Perez orchestrated a \nquid pro quo arrangement between the Department of Justice and the City \nof St. Paul in which the Department agreed to drop two cases in \nexchange for the city withdrawing a case, the Manger case, before the \nSupreme Court.\n  Mr. Perez's involvement in this whole deal seems to me to be an \nextraordinary amount of wheeling and dealing outside what should be the \nnormal responsibilities of the Assistant Attorney General for Civil \nRights. To obtain his desired results, Mr. Perez reached outside of the \nCivil Rights Division at the Department of Justice into the Minnesota \nU.S. Attorney's Office and into the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment. This exchange cost American taxpayers the opportunity to \npotentially recover millions of dollars and, more importantly, violated \nthe trust whistleblowers place in the Federal Government. His testimony \nhas been contradicted by the testimony of other witnesses in \ncontemporaneous documents.\n  In short, it seems to me that Mr. Perez did not discharge the duty he \nowed to the government to try to collect money owed to taxpayers. He \ndid not discharge the duty to protect the whistleblowers, who were left \nhanging in the wind. At the same time, he was manipulating the legal \nprocess to remove a case from the Supreme Court in a way that is \ninappropriate for the Assistant Attorney General of the United States.\n  No. 3, Mr. Perez's use of private e-mail accounts to leak nonpublic \ninformation is troubling to me.\n  Federal officials in this administration seem to have a penchant for \nusing private e-mails to conduct official business. The Federal Records \nAct is designed to ensure that the government is held accountable to \nthe American people to prevent the opportunity for a shadow government \nto operate outside of the normal channels of oversight. Using personal \ne-mails robs the Nation of the ability to know if the government is \nbehaving appropriately.\n  Since Mr. Perez apparently is going to be confirmed despite my vote, \nI hope he will pledge to stop using personal e-mails to conduct \nofficial business.\n  For these three reasons, I cannot support the Perez confirmation. I \nwill support and have supported the President's right to have an up-or-\ndown vote on his Cabinet members. I always have. So I voted for \ncloture.\n\n[[Page S5764]]\n\n  But what we have seen over the last several weeks--and I believe the \nreason the Senate did not come to a screeching halt this week--is that \nthere is a widespread misunderstanding about what Senate Republicans \nhave done with respect to President Obama's nominees for his Cabinet. \nThe reality is that Republicans have respected the right of the \nPresident to staff his Cabinet. In fact, never in our Nation's history \nhas the Senate blocked a Cabinet official from confirmation by a \nfilibuster. Let me say that again. The number of Presidential nominees \nfor Cabinet in our Nation's history who have been denied his or her \nseat by a filibuster, by a failed cloture vote, is zero.\n  The Washington Post and the Congressional Research Service have said \nthat President Obama's Cabinet appointees in his second term are moving \nthrough the Senate at about the same rate as President George W. Bush's \nand President Clinton's.\n  Senators on both sides of the aisle have a long history of using the \nconstitutional authority for advice and consent to ask questions. We \nhave done that in the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions concerning Mr. Perez for the last 122 days. We have a \nhistorical right--and we have exercised it in a bipartisan way--to use \nour right to ask for 60 votes in order to advance our views. That is a \npart of the character of the Senate. But it is important to know that \nthese fairy tales that have been suggested about Republicans somehow \nblocking President Obama's nominees are just that.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at the end of \nmy remarks an op-ed I wrote for the Washington Times yesterday \nsupporting my remarks. The op-ed points out that most of this week's \nnuclear option debate about whether Senators should be permitted to \nfilibuster Presidential nominees was not about filibusters, it was \ninstead about whether a majority of Senators should be able to change \nthe rules of the Senate at any time for any purpose.\n  Former Senator Arthur Vandenberg of Michigan once offered the precise \ntrouble with this idea. He said:\n\n       If a majority of the Senate can change the rules at any \n     time, the Senate has no rules.\n\n  In other words, all of this fuss was a power grab.\n  In fact, most of the filibustering that has been done to deny \nPresidents confirmation of their nominees has been done by our friends \non the other side. As I mentioned earlier, the number of Cabinet \nmembers who have been denied their seats by a filibuster is zero. The \nnumber of district judges in the history of the country who have been \ndenied their seats by a filibuster is zero. The number of Supreme Court \nJustices who have been denied their seats by a filibuster is zero. \nThere was the incident in 1968 when President Johnson engineered an \nopportunity for Abe Fortas to get a 45-to-43 vote so he could feel \nbetter about staying on the Court after a majority of the Senate \nclearly wasn't going to confirm him for the Supreme Court. But \nthroughout our history, the right to advise and consent has been \nexercised by a majority vote even in the most controversial cases. The \nvote on Clarence Thomas for the Supreme Court was a majority vote. The \nvote denying Robert Bork an opportunity to go to the Supreme Court was \na majority vote. While there never has been a Supreme Court nominee \nblocked by a filibuster, about a quarter of all of the Supreme Court \nnominees have been withdrawn or blocked by majority vote.\n  So elections have consequences, and I respect that whether it is a \nRepublican or a Democratic President. Our tradition was that nominees \nwere not denied their seat by a failed cloture vote. Other than Fortas, \nthe only exception is that in 2003, about the time I came to the \nSenate, the Democrats, for the first time in history--the first time in \nhistory--filibustered 10 of President George W. Bush's nominees. That \nproduced Republicans who wanted to change the rules of the Senate, and \nfortunately cooler heads prevailed. But five Republican judges--very \nmeritorious people, such as Miguel Estrada; a real tragedy--were denied \ntheir seats by a filibuster.\n  So the usual and expected happened. Republicans have since denied two \nDemocratic seats by a filibuster.\n  So my preference is much that Presidents have the opportunity to \nappoint their Cabinet members, to appoint their Supreme Court Justices, \nand if we don't like them, we can vote against them. There have been \noccasions where sub-Cabinet members have been denied their seats. The \ntotal number is seven, all since 1994, and there may be more again.\n  A simple objection by Republicans to the motion of the majority \nleader to cut off debate may simply mean we want more information. In \nthe case of Senator Hagel, the majority leader sought to cut off debate \n2 days after his nomination came to the floor, and we voted no. We were \nnot ready to cut off debate. Then, 10 days later, we voted to confirm \nSenator Hagel.\n  I am glad that this week the Senate regained its equilibrium, so to \nspeak, and stopped this talk of creating the Senate as a body where a \nmajority of the Senate can change the rules at any time, which would \nmake this a Senate without any rules.\n\n  I hope we do not hear any more about it because that is not \nappropriate. It is not appropriate in this body. John Adams, Thomas \nJefferson, George Washington, Senator Reid himself, and others have \nsaid that this body is different. It is a place where you have to come \nto a consensus. We are coming to one, for example, on student loans \ntoday. The President made a good recommendation to solve the student \nloan problem on a permanent basis. The House of Representatives passed \nsomething much like the President's, and hopefully we can do that later \ntoday.\n  So I believe the President deserves an up-or-down vote on his \nnomination for the Secretary of Labor and his nominee for any other \nCabinet member. But in this case, for the reasons I stated, I am voting \nno on confirmation.\n  I see the Senator from Georgia is here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, July 17, 2013]\n\n               The Power Grab Behind the Crocodile Tears\n\n\n    Democrats try to change the rules when they can't get their way\n\n                          (By Lamar Alexander)\n\n       This week's ``nuclear option'' debate about whether U.S. \n     senators should be permitted to filibuster presidential \n     nominations was not about filibusters.\n       It was instead about whether a majority of senators should \n     be able to change the rules of the Senate anytime for any \n     purpose. Former Sen. Arthur Vandenberg of Michigan once \n     offered the precise trouble with this idea: ``If a majority \n     of the Senate can change its rules at any time, there are no \n     rules.''\n       In other words, this was a power grab.\n       Despite Democrats' crocodile tears, filibusters--the \n     requirement of securing 60 senators' votes to allow a vote on \n     a nomination--have done little to frustrate presidential \n     nominations.\n       According to The Washington Post, President Obama's Cabinet \n     nominees during his second term are moving through the Senate \n     about as rapidly as those of Presidents Clinton and George W. \n     Bush.\n       According to the Congressional Research Service, in the \n     history of the Senate, the number of times filibusters have \n     denied a seat to a nominee for the Supreme Court, the \n     president's Cabinet or federal district judge is zero. (The \n     only arguable exception is President Lyndon Johnson's \n     engineering of a 45-43 cloture vote in favor of the \n     nomination of sitting Supreme Court Justice Abe Fortas to be \n     chief justice in order to lessen the embarrassment of Fortas' \n     failure to attract the support of a majority of senators for \n     confirmation.)\n       Ironically, most of the frustrating of presidential \n     nominations by filibusters has been done by the Democrats \n     themselves. The number of federal court of appeals nominees \n     who have been denied their seats by filibusters would also be \n     zero were it not for the decision by Democratic senators in \n     2003 to filibuster 10 of President George W. Bush's appellate \n     court nominees. This led to the ``Gang of 14'' compromise \n     that allowed five of those to be confirmed, but discarded the \n     other five. Since then, Republicans have retaliated by \n     denying two of Mr. Obama's appellate nominees.\n       Over the years, there have been seven sub-Cabinet nominees \n     blocked by filibuster--three Republicans and four Democrats, \n     all since 1994.\n       So the grand total of presidential nominees who have been \n     blocked by filibusters (failure to obtain 60 votes to cut off \n     debate) is 14. And it is fair to say that Democrats sowed the \n     seeds of the current controversy when they filibustered Mr. \n     Bush's appellate judges in 2003.\n       So, what were Democrats complaining about?\n       For many Democrats, getting rid of the filibuster for \n     nominees is the first step in turning the Senate into an \n     institution where the majority rules lock, stock and barrel.\n\n[[Page S5765]]\n\n       The Senate would become like the House of Representatives, \n     in which a majority of only one vote could establish a Rules \n     Committee with nine members of the majority and four of the \n     minority. Every meaningful decision would be controlled by \n     the majority. The result: The minority, its views and those \n     it represents would become irrelevant. It would be the same \n     as having the power to add an inning or two to a baseball \n     game if you don't like the score in the ninth inning.\n       Alexis De Tocqueville, the young Frenchman who traveled the \n     United States in the 1830s, warned against this kind of \n     governance. He wrote that the two greatest dangers to the \n     American democracy were Russia and the ``tyranny of the \n     majority.''\n       In his book on Thomas Jefferson, Jon Meacham writes of an \n     after-dinner conversation between President Adams and Vice \n     President Jefferson. Adams said that ``no republic could ever \n     last which had not a Senate and a Senate deeply and strongly \n     rooted, strong enough to bear up against all popular \n     passions'' and that ``trusting to the popular assembly for \n     the preservation of our liberties was [unimaginable].''\n       John Adams was right. And so was then-Minority Leader Harry \n     Reid in 2005 when, opposing Majority Leader Bill Frist's \n     effort to use the ``nuclear option'' to kill the filibuster \n     on judicial nominations, he said: ``And once you open that \n     Pandora's box, it was just a matter of time before a Senate \n     leader who couldn't get his way on something moved to \n     eliminate the filibuster for regular business as well. And \n     that, simply put, would be the end of the United States \n     Senate.''\n       The only real confirmation issue before the Senate is Mr. \n     Obama's use of his recess appointment power to install two \n     members of the National Labor Relations Board when the Senate \n     was not in recess, a blatant affront to the constitutional \n     separation of powers that the District of Columbia Circuit \n     Court of Appeals said was unconstitutional. Fortunately, a \n     compromise has been reached in which the president is sending \n     to the Senate two new, untainted nominees for the board. This \n     week's debate, however, shows the threat to the end of the \n     United States Senate lingers.\n       Those Democrats still seeking to create a Senate in which a \n     majority can change the rules whenever it wants should be \n     prepared for what could happen next. Their dream of a \n     Democratic freight train running through a Senate in which a \n     majority can do whatever it wants might turn into their \n     nightmare if, in 2015, that freight train is the Tea Party \n     Express.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, first, before the Senator from Tennessee \nleaves the floor, if he was getting ready to, I wish to commend him on \nhis activities over the last 8 days. For the second time in a decade, \nwe came to the brink of making a bad mistake in the Senate. But we \nproved--and Senator Alexander really proved through the facts, which \nare stubborn things--that if you study history and you read the history \nof the Senate, you understand there is a purpose for the cloture rule, \nthere is a purpose for the filibuster, but there is also a purpose for \nbeing judicious in its use.\n  I commend the Senator on his historic history lesson, his personal \nexperiences as being one who has gone through the process himself when \nhe was nominated to be Secretary of Education, and I appreciate very \nmuch his leadership on the Committee of Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  I will be brief, but I would like to speak for a minute about the \nnomination of Thomas Perez.\n  The Labor Department is an important Department in the United States \nof America, and jobs are an important need we have in this country. We \nneed an aggressive leader at the Department of Labor who is trying to \nget the Workforce Investment Act passed, trying to get people trained, \ntrying to get wrongs righted, trying to be a leader. But what we do not \nneed to have is one who throws up stumbling blocks to progress, \nstumbling blocks to jobs, and stumbling blocks to business.\n  Thomas Perez has a history of using disparate impact to enforce or to \nmove toward where he wants to go in terms of the regulations he has had \nresponsibility for in the past, namely at the Department of Justice.\n  Disparate impact is where you take unrelated facts, pull them \ntogether to get a pattern or practice, and then make a case against \nsomebody for something that because of those disparate facts you think \ncould draw you to a conclusion that they discriminated or they \novercharged or they redlined or whatever it might be. Disparate impact \nis a very difficult thing to use. It is an even more difficult thing to \ndefend yourself against. It would certainly be the wrong way to run the \nDepartment of Labor.\n  We know from Thomas Perez's experience in St. Paul, MN, with a \nwhistleblower that his use of disparate impact caused him to work with \nthe City of St. Paul to deny a whistleblower what he deserved in terms \nof his rights and the American people in terms of what they deserved in \nbeing reimbursed for the money that had been lost because of the \nactions the whistleblower uncovered.\n  It is important for us to understand that the Department of Labor is \na job creator, not a job intimidator. We have had an issue in the last \n4 years with the Department of Labor about the fiduciary rule--a rule \nthat, if put in place, would cause the American saver and investor, the \nsmall saver and the small investor--it would deny them investment \nadvice or cause them to pay so much for investment advice that the cost \nof that advice would be more than the yield on the investment they \nhave. That would be the wrong thing do. I fear Thomas Perez will \nregenerate the fiduciary rule--which we fortunately beat back 2 years \nago--and try to bring it forward again.\n  Going back to disparate impact, with the regulation of OSHA, the Mine \nSafety and Health Administration, MSHA--all the things that are done by \nthe Department of Labor--to begin to use disparate impact as a pattern \nor practice to enforce mine safety laws, occupational safety laws, or \nany other type of laws which are very definitive in the way they should \nbe enforced would be the wrong direction to go.\n  But most importantly of all, the nomination of Thomas Perez \ndemonstrates why it is important to have cloture, why the filibuster, \nused judiciously and timely, can be a benefit to the Senate.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter dated \nJuly 8, 2013, from the Chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform \nCommittee in the House of Representatives, Darrell Issa.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Congress of the United States, Committee on Oversight and \n           Government Reform,\n                                    Washington, DC, July 18, 2013.\n     Hon. Thomas E. Perez,\n     Assistant Attorney General, U.S. Department of Justice, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Perez: I am in receipt of a letter dated June 21, \n     2013, from Peter J. Kadzik, Principal Deputy Assistant \n     Attorney General, regarding your extensive use of a non-\n     official e-mail account to conduct official Department of \n     Justice business. I am extremely disappointed that you \n     continue to willfully disregard a lawful subpoena issued by a \n     standing Committee of the United States House of \n     Representatives.\n       The subpoena issued on April 10, 2013, requires you to \n     produce all responsive communications to and from any of your \n     non-official e-mail accounts referring or relating to \n     official business of the Department of Justice. The \n     Department has represented that about 1,200 responsive \n     communications exist, including at least 35 communications \n     that violated the Federal Records Act. On May 8, 2013, \n     Ranking Member Cummings and I wrote to you requesting that \n     you produce to the Committee all responsive documents in \n     unredacted form, as the Committee's subpoena requires. As of \n     today, you have not produced a single document to the \n     Committee; therefore, you remain noncompliant with the \n     Committee's subpoena.\n       Your continued noncompliance contravenes fundamental \n     principles or separation of powers and the rule of law. I \n     once again ask that you immediately produce all responsive \n     documents in unredacted form as required by the subpoena. \n     Until you produce all responsive documents, you will continue \n     to be noncompliant with the Committee's subpoena. Thank you \n     for your attention to this matter.\n       Sincerely,\n                                                     Darrell Issa,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. This letter demonstrates that Mr. Perez, as of that day, \nhad still failed to comply completely with a subpoena issued on April \n10, 2013, for information to be considered.\n  I recognize that Mr. Issa is not a Member of the U.S. Senate, but he \nis the head of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee in the \nU.S. House of Representatives. He deserves to be responded to, and we \ndeserve to know the facts.\n  I attended the hearing on St. Paul, MN, and the whistleblower there, \nMr. Newell, when I went to the House about 2 months ago. I know there \nare unanswered questions, and the American people deserve them.\n  Cloture should be used judiciously, but this is a time--the reason I \nvoted\n\n[[Page S5766]]\n\nno on cloture last night is because this is a time where we need all \nthe answers. This is an appointee whose record demonstrates that he may \nbe dangerous for the Department of Labor, not positive for the \nDepartment of Labor. I think it is important, when used judiciously, we \nget all the answers people need to know so that when we vote to approve \nor to deny an appointee, it is based on all the facts--not based on \nintimidation but all the facts the American people deserve.\n  For that reason, I will oppose the nomination today of Thomas Perez \nto be the Secretary of Labor for the United States of America.\n  I yield back my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/18/senate-section/article/S5766-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5766]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, today I would like to address two \ntopics. One is that within the hour President Obama is going to be \ndelivering remarks about his health care law. I would like for all \nAmericans to pay close attention to the President's remarks and see if \nhe continues to make promises he knows he cannot keep.\n  Is he going to once again say that if you like what you have, you can \nkeep it? Well, if so, we know that is not true. Just ask the unions \nthat recently wrote a letter to Majority Leader Reid and to Nancy \nPelosi about how this law is not allowing them to keep the insurance \nthey have.\n  Is the President going to call it affordable and say again that \npremiums will decrease by an average of $2,500 per family? Well, if so, \nwe know that is not true. Just ask the folks in Ohio, where the average \nindividual market health insurance premium in 2014 is going to cost \nabout 88 percent more.\n  Is the President going to say again that the law is working as it is \nsupposed to work? Well, if so, we know that is not true. Just ask the \nadministration why they decided to delay the disastrous employer \nmandate that is making it harder for employers to hire new workers and \nfor Americans to find full-time jobs.\n  Is the President going to say this law is good for young Americans? \nIf so, we know that is not true. Just ask the young, healthy adults who \nwill see insurance rates double or even triple when they look to buy \nindividual coverage starting next year.\n  It is time for the President to level with the American people. This \nlaw has been bad for patients, it has been bad for providers--the \npeople who take care of those patients, the nurses and the doctors--and \nit is terrible for taxpayers. We need to repeal this law and replace it \nwith real reforms that help Americans get the care they need from a \ndoctor they choose, at lower cost.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/18/senate-section/article/S5766-2", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5766-S5767]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          McCARTHY NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, the second topic I would like to address \nis the issue of energy and a national energy tax, which the President \nessentially proposed in his June 25 speech. At that time he unveiled \nwhat I believe is a national energy tax that is going to discourage job \ncreation and increase energy bills for American families.\n  This announcement that he made about existing powerplants--existing \npowerplants--came after the administration has already moved forward \nwith excessive redtape that makes it harder and more expensive for \nAmerica to produce energy. It also came as a complete surprise to \nMembers of the Senate, especially since Gina McCarthy, the President's \nnominee to lead the Environmental Protection Agency--a nominee whom we \nwill be voting on today--since that nominee told Congress that it was \nnot going to happen. She is currently the Assistant Administrator of \nthe Air and Radiation Office at the EPA. Here is what she told the \nSenate about regulations on existing powerplants, the ones the \nPresident talked about on June 25. She said:\n\n       The agency is not currently developing any existing source \n     greenhouse gas regulations for power plants.\n\n  None.\n\n       As a result we have performed no analysis that would \n     identify specific health benefits from establishing an \n     existing source program.\n\n  So I would say it is clear with President Obama's June 25 \nannouncement on existing powerplants that Gina McCarthy is either out \nof the loop or out of control. She either did not tell the truth to the \nSenate in confirmation hearings in response to questions or she does \nnot know what is going on in her own agency. Either way, she is not the \nperson to lead the EPA.\n  I would encourage all of my colleagues to oppose McCarthy in her \nnomination. This has nothing to do with ideology and everything to do \nwith having an agency that is accountable to the elected \nrepresentatives of the American people. I believe this behavior is \nindicative of the way the EPA has been run during Gina McCarthy's reign \nas an Assistant Administrator of the EPA.\n  Many of my colleagues on the Senate Environment and Public Works \nCommittee have expressed concerns with the lack of transparency at this \nspecific agency. One of the major areas of concern is the use of the \nso-called sue-and-settle tactics. This is where environmental activist \ngroups sue the EPA or they sue other Federal agencies to make policy. \nOften, they find like-minded colleagues and allies in the EPA. Here is \nhow it works. If environmental activists want to impose new \nrestrictions on, say, farms, it is easy to sue the government to impose \nthose restrictions. At the EPA, rather than fight the restrictions, \nthey agree to this and they say: OK. We will do a court settlement. The \nEPA does not contest the new restrictions because the EPA wanted them \nin the first place. The agency just did not want to have to go through \na lengthy rulemaking process with public comments in the light of day. \nThe judge signs off on the agreement, and in a matter of weeks the law \nis made.\n  So I asked the nominee in writing: Do you believe sue-and-settle \nagreements are an open and transparent way to make public policy that \nsignificantly impacts Americans?\n  She stated in her answer:\n\n       I recognize that this committee has focused many of its \n     questions on EPA settlement practices and, if confirmed, I \n     commit to learning more--\n\n  Learning more--\n\n       about the Agency's practices in settling litigation across \n     its program areas.\n\n  Well, some of the most egregious sue-and-settle agreements have dealt \nwith the Clean Air Act, and she has been in charge of the air office at \nEPA for almost all of President Obama's first term. I find it very \ndifficult to believe she did not know what was going on. In fact, in \nanswering my next question to her--I asked: Do you believe States and \ncommunities impacted by sue-and-settle agreements should have a say in \ncourt agreements that might severely impact them--she said:\n\n       [M]ost litigation against EPA arises under the Clean Air \n     Act. . . .\n  Of course. So my question is, either she knew what was going on with \nregard to the Clean Air Act lawsuits against the Agency, the area that \nshe completely was in control of, or she does not know what is going on \nin her own department. Once again, either way, such a person should not \nbe confirmed to be in charge of the entire EPA.\n  As most folks know, my home State, Wyoming, is a coal State. The \nadministration has actively sought to eliminate this industry from the \nAmerican economy. It is no surprise to some that many of us coal-State \ncolleagues fight vigorously to oppose the President's anti-coal \npolicies. Ms. McCarthy has been the President's field general in \nimplementing these policies. These policies greatly affect families all \nacross Wyoming and across the country. So even though I strongly oppose \nthese policies, I still wanted to meet with the nominee so I could \nexplain to her how this administration's policies are hurting real \npeople in my home State and across the country.\n  I believed if we had a face-to-face meeting I might be able to \nconvince her to alter or alleviate the worst impact of the policies \npursued by this administration through the EPA. In that personal \nmeeting with me, the nominee\n\n[[Page S5767]]\n\nwas very sympathetic with the concerns I and others had expressed \nregarding the impact of EPA regulations on jobs. She also expressed in \nmany instances that she would look for flexibility, but she said she \nwas unfortunately bound by agency processes and the law.\n  Well, if she is concerned with the impact EPA regulations are having \non jobs and communities, I believe she should have sought the \nflexibility she needed from Congress to help save these communities and \nthese jobs. In a followup to that meeting, I asked in writing: What \nspecific legislative changes would you recommend to provide the \nflexibility to protect workers, to protect families, to protect \ncommunities from job losses that might occur as a result of EPA \nregulations?\n  What she stated was ``very sensitive to the state of the economy and \nto the impacts of EPA regulations on jobs.'' And then, ``If confirmed, \nI would continue to work hard to seek opportunities to find more cost-\neffective approaches to protecting human health and the environment.'' \nThis administration has pummeled coal country, powerplants, \nmanufacturing, and small businesses for 4 years, pursuing their \npreferred version of a clean energy future. Since 2009, unemployment \nhas remained stagnant. Nearly 10 percent of our coal energy capacity is \ngone. Not once has Ms. McCarthy approached Congress for flexibility in \nimplementing her own rules. I see no reason why that would happen in \nthe future.\n  I would like to commend EPW ranking member Senator Vitter for leading \nan effort to secure information from the nominee. I signed a letter, \nalong with Senator Vitter and other members of the EPW Committee, \nseeking access to the scientific data and the reasoning behind the \njustification for expensive new rules and regulations that hurt the \neconomy, that cost jobs, seeking true whole economy modeling on EPA's \nClean Air Act regulations, so we can understand the true cost of these \nrules.\n  I was also seeking an assurance that Gina McCarthy and this \nadministration honor its commitment to transparency and stop using \ndelay tactics to keep the true cost of these regulations from the \nAmerican people. Senator Vitter was able to get some information on \nmany of our requests. It was not easy and the nominee was not entirely \nforthcoming. In fact, she has not complied with many of the document \nrequests we have made. I can assure the administration that none of us \nwho signed that letter making these requests plan on giving up on \nsecuring basic information that should be readily available to the \npublic.\n  Gina McCarthy is the wrong candidate to head the Environmental \nProtection Agency. America deserves better. I would ask that my \ncolleagues oppose the nomination not on the content of this \nadministration's policies but on the actions of this specific nominee \nwith regard to accountability, competence, and transparency. I believe \nthis nominee gets a failing grade on all three counts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/18/senate-section/article/S5767-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5767]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to executive session to consider the following \nnomination, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Thomas Edward Perez, of \nMaryland, to be Secretary of Labor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my strong opposition to \nthe nomination of Thomas E. Perez to be the Secretary of the U.S. \nDepartment of Labor. Simply put, there is no shortage of reasons why \nMr. Perez should not be confirmed as our next Labor Secretary.\n  Several of my colleagues have come to the floor to discuss a number \nof troubling facts about Mr. Perez's professional history, each one of \nthem reason enough to disqualify him for this nomination. I would like \nto discuss a few that are of significant concern to me. Without \nquestion, Mr. Perez has abused his position as Assistant Attorney \nGeneral of the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice. \nRather than seek out and expose instances of racial injustice, Mr. \nPerez has turned the office into his own personal tool of political \nactivism, something that office was never meant to accomplish.\n  For example, a report issued by the Department of Justice Office of \nInspector General found during Perez's tenure at the Civil Rights \nDivision employees harassed colleagues for their religious and \npolitical beliefs. Despite having little if any evidence of racial \ndiscrimination, Mr. Perez has repeatedly opposed efforts by States to \nensure the integrity of elections.\n  Under his direction, the Civil Rights Division has pursued frivolous \nlawsuits against State voter ID laws, has ignored statutes that require \nStates to purge ineligible voters from their voter registration rolls, \nand has slow-walked attempts to protect the voting rights of our \nmilitary members, our brave men and women serving in uniform for the \nUnited States.\n  While head of the Civil Rights Division, Mr. Perez's unit used \nspurious and misleading claims to allege racial discrimination and \nselectively enforced laws to target certain groups.\n  Most troubling, perhaps, was the fact that Mr. Perez has woefully \ndisregarded a lawful subpoena from the House Committee on Oversight and \nGovernment Reform to produce certain documents relating to the use of \nhis nonofficial e-mail account for official purposes. According to the \nchairman of that committee, ``Mr. Perez has not produced a single \ndocument responsive to the committee's subpoena'' and ``remains \nnoncompliant.''\n  At a minimum this is a basic violation of the rule of law. It impedes \na fundamental function of the legislative branch to provide oversight \nof the administration. Anyone showing this type of willful disregard \nfor the law and ambivalence toward America's essential principles of \nrepresentative government should not be considered for a top post in \nany administration.\n  I therefore strongly advise my colleagues not to support this nominee \nand to raise similar objections whenever someone comes up and is \nnominated by this President or any President who possesses and displays \nthese characterizes that are so troubling.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                           Military Spending\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I am here to speak on behalf of my \ngood friend Gina McCarthy and her nomination to head the Environmental \nProtection Agency. But before I do so, I would like to raise an issue I \nraised during a hearing of the Armed Services Committee. I have come \ndirectly from that hearing.\n  I am here to express my deep dissatisfaction, in fact my outrage, at \na form of military assistance that will literally waste a total of more \nthan $1 billion in taxpayer money. In fact, we have just contracted and \nannounced that contract in June for about 30 Russian Mi-17 helicopters \nthat will cost American taxpayers $550 million to buy from \nRosoboronexport, the Russian export agency, controlled by the Russian \nGovernment, those helicopters for the Afghan national forces that lack \npilots and maintenance personnel to fly and repair and operate these \nhelicopters. They will be sitting on the runways of Afghan airfields \nwithout any use, rusting, literally wasting American taxpayer funds.\n  Don't believe me when I make these statements. Those facts come from \nthe Special Inspector General for Afghanistan who completed a report \nrecently, stating succinctly, clearly, irrefutably, that we are wasting \n$1 billion in taxpayer money buying Russian helicopters for Afghan \nnational forces that, very simply, cannot use them.\n  In fact, we committed to that contract before we even have a status \nof forces agreement with the Afghan Government for the period after \n2014 when we will be leaving that country, fortunately. If we can leave \nsooner, all the better. But in the meantime, we are buying equipment \nfrom the Russian export agency that is at the same time\n\n[[Page S5768]]\n\nselling arms to Assad in Syria for the murder and slaughter of his own \npeople, making money from those sales to Assad in Syria, and from the \ngovernment that is harboring and providing refuge to Edward Snowden, \nwho has illegally--I guess I should use the words allegedly illegally--\nbut clearly violated American law in disclosing secrets from our \ngovernment.\n  Last week I visited a National Guard helicopter repair facility in \nGroton, CT, where over 100 technicians--to be precise, 137 \ntechnicians--civilian employees at this facility alone have been \nfurloughed. They are furloughed 11 days. It was originally 22, but it \nhas been reduced to 11. Our helicopter repair function in that region, \nand similarly across the country, has been hampered and impeded because \nof the sequester and the impact in requiring furloughs. Our military \nreadiness is suffering because of lack of funds on the part of the U.S. \nGovernment, when we are at the same time buying Russian helicopters \nthat will have no use for the Afghan Government. In fact, they have no \npilots to fly them or people to make repairs and maintain them. \nSomething is wrong with this picture.\n  Yet in the hearing I have just left, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff, General Dempsey, maintained to me his view that a waiver \nshould be exercised under the National Defense Authorization Act \nproviding for the purchase of these Russian helicopters.\n  I respectfully disagree. I strongly disagree. I think the American \ntaxpayers, certainly my fellow residents of Connecticut, ought to be \nequally outraged. We should be outraged in this body that we are \nwasting this money when precious funds have been forgone that can be \nused for military readiness of our Armed Forces.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in saying to our U.S. military leaders \nthat our national security is imperiled, not by refusing to acquire \nthose helicopters but in fact by wasting taxpayer money on those \npurchases for an Afghan army that cannot use them, and for purchasing \nfrom a country that certainly means us no good and, in fact, an export \nagency that is selling arms to a murderous government and harboring an \nindividual who has violated our laws and endangered our national \nsecurity.\n  I will not let this matter rest. I will not let this issue go. I \nintend to pursue it. I ask my colleagues to join me in making sure we \nstop these purchases. In fact, Senator Ayotte and I have a bill, which \nis called No Contracting with the Enemy, to expand very useful \ncontracting tools that now apply in Afghanistan, where we have found \nour aid and assistance finding its way to enemy hands. I can't think of \na more blatant example of contracting with the enemy than handing over \nour taxpayer money to a company that is at the very same time selling \nS-300 air defense systems to the Syrian Government for use against its \nown people and violating international sanctions by helping Iran with \nthat missile equipment.\n\n\n                          McCarthy Nomination\n\n  I wish to turn to the reason I came to the floor, having just left \nthat Armed Services Committee meeting, to speak on behalf of my very \ngood friend Gina McCarthy.\n  I worked with Gina McCarthy over a number of years when she was, in \nfact, not only a fellow State official--I was then State attorney \ngeneral--but also a client because I was her lawyer. I came to know her \nin a way that I think is very rare for any public official to know \nanother, seeing her in times of crisis and public policy opportunity, \nthe ups and the downs of public service.\n  I came to know her as a pragmatic person of consummate intelligence, \nintegrity, an environmental protector for all seasons. She is not a \npartisan by any stretch of the imagination. There may be individuals \nwho are more aggressive in the enforcement of environmental laws. There \nmay be people who are more solicitous of economic progress and job \ncreation, but I don't know. I certainly know no one who strikes the \nbalance and seeks both goals of job creation, along with economic \ngrowth, and environmental protection with such zeal, passion, and great \ngood humor.\n  I said before on this floor and I will say it again, Gina McCarthy \nknows how to bring people together. She knows how to work for a common \ngoal.\n  We should seize this moment as a body to expand and enhance the \nbipartisan spirit of this past week and approve Gina McCarthy \noverwhelmingly because she epitomizes the kind of bipartisan spirit we \nshould seek to grow and attract in our Federal Government, in fact, in \nall levels of government.\n  Let me give a few examples. My colleague Senator Murphy spoke last \nnight about a number of her specific accomplishments, but there are \nmany more--maybe most important, which I don't think has been given \nenough attention on the floor, is her work in designing, building, and \nimplementing the Northeast's pioneering cap-and-trade program, known as \nthe Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, RGGI. Nine States currently \nparticipate in RGGI: Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, \nMassachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont. It \nis a highly innovative program. It is a model for the Nation and the \nworld.\n  A 2012 report issued in 2012 estimates that RGGI investments will \noffset the need for more than 27 million megawatt hours of electricity \ngeneration and 26.7 British thermal units of energy generation. These \nsavings will help avoid the emission of 12 million short tons of carbon \ndioxide pollution, an amount equivalent to taking 2 million passenger \nvehicles off the road for 1 year.\n  The numbers not only fail to tell the whole story about the \nenvironmental impact but also fail to tell about Gina McCarthy's role \nin bringing together Republican and Democratic Governors for a common \ngood, what she will do in this country for environmental protection and \nwhat she has already done in her role at the EPA.\n  Under her guidance, the State of Connecticut settled a Clean Air Act \nsuit against Ohio Edison on July 11, 2005, again requiring pollution \nreduction consistent with business needs and goals.\n  She settled a citizen suit against American Electric Power on \nDecember 13, 2007, a dramatic reduction in nitrogen oxide and tons of \nsulfur dioxide. These Clean Air Act suits, which I assisted her in \nbringing to conclusion, I think embody her goal of reducing air \ncontamination and pollution consistent with the business community's \nconcern for its bottom line. She is sensitive to both.\n  She is remarkable for her professionalism, for her zeal and passion \nas an environmental protector, and also for her willingness to listen, \nher willingness to hear and truly listen to people sitting across the \ntable who may come into the room with different and sometimes \nconflicting views and come to a common conclusion. She knows how to get \nto yes, and she does it as a tough, fair, balanced environmental law \nenforcer.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in my enthusiasm because the \nPresident couldn't have picked a more qualified person. Gina McCarthy \nis as good as it gets in public service. She is as good as it gets for \nintegrity, intellect, and dedication to the public good.\n  It is my wish that we will move forward as united as possible, \ncarrying forward the great bipartisan spirit that has characterized \nthese last few days in our consideration of the President's nominees, \nwhich I hope will be enhanced and continue as we move forward today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican whip.\n\n\n                               ObamaCare\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. In a few minutes, President Obama is scheduled to give a \nmajor speech highlighting what he believes are the achievements of his \nsignature health care law, the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as \nObamaCare.\n  I could understand why he is feeling a little defensive and why he \nfeels he needs to frame the discussion because, after all, ObamaCare \nhas disappointed some of its most ardent former supporters.\n  For example, back in 2009 and 2010, American labor unions were among \nthe biggest supporters of the President's health care plan. Along with \nmany of my friends across the aisle, they are having second thoughts \nand, in some cases, buyer's remorse.\n  Last week, three of the country's most prominent labor leaders, James \nHoffa, Joseph Hansen, and Donald Taylor, sent a very concerned letter \nto\n\n[[Page S5769]]\n\nSenator Reid and former Speaker Pelosi. Here is part of what they \nwrote:\n\n       When you and the President sought our support for the \n     Affordable Care Act, you pledged that if we liked the health \n     plans we have now, we could keep them. Sadly, that promise is \n     under threat.\n\n  Picking up on this chart, they went on to say:\n\n       Right now, unless you and the Obama Administration enact an \n     equitable fix, the ACA [Affordable Care Act] will shatter not \n     only our hard-earned health benefits, but destroy the \n     foundation of the 40-hour workweek that is the backbone of \n     the American middle class.\n\n  They went on to say:\n\n       The unintended consequences of the ACA [Affordable Care \n     Act] are severe. Perverse incentives are already creating \n     nightmare scenarios. . . . The law, as it stands, will hurt \n     millions of Americans.\n\n  ObamaCare has been controversial since its passage in 2010. Some \nMembers of Congress voted for it. Obviously, the Democratic majority \nvoted for it. Some people voted against it, people such as myself in \nthe Republican minority.\n  But whether you supported the law with the hopes and aspirations that \nit would somehow be the panacea or answer to our health care needs in \nthis country or whether you were a skeptic such as I, who believed that \nthis could not possibly work, the fact seems to be--as these labor \nleaders have said--it has not met expectations and certainly it has \ncreated many problems that need to be addressed.\n  This same letter went on to detail some of the nightmare scenarios \nthese labor leaders have concerns about. They pointed out that many \nbusinesses are cutting full-time employment back to part-time in order \nto avoid the employer mandate.\n  As I mentioned yesterday, the number of people working part-time for \neconomic reasons has jumped from 7.6 million to 8.2 million, just \nbetween March and June. In fact, last month alone that number increased \n322,000.\n  A new survey reports that in response to ObamaCare, nearly three out \nof every four small businesses are going to reduce hiring, reduce \nworker hours or replace full-time employees with part-time employees.\n  We know the President has unilaterally decided to delay the \nimposition of the employer mandate until 2015, but that doesn't change \na lot. These businesses have to plan for the future and small \nbusinesses still have the same perverse incentives to limit the hiring \nof full-time workers, as these labor leaders point out.\n  The employer mandate is one reason why ObamaCare needs to be repealed \nentirely and replaced with something better. As these leaders say in \ntheir letter, the law, as it stands, will hurt millions of Americans.\n  We have already seen its effect on job creation, not only with the \nemployer mandate but also with the medical device tax that has prompted \nmany companies, including those in Texas, to simply grow their \nbusinesses in places such as Costa Rica, where they can avoid that \nmedical device tax, rather than in my State or in other States that \nhave medical device companies. It has also caused these companies to \nclose factories and cancel plans for new ones in the United States.\n  We have also seen, as these leaders point out, that ObamaCare will \ndisrupt Americans' existing health care arrangements. As they point out \nin their letter, one of the promises the President made was that if you \nliked what you have, you can keep it, but, in fact, that has not proven \nto be true.\n  Indeed, my constituents are already getting their letters from health \ncare providers informing them that their current policies are no longer \ngoing to be available because of the implementation of ObamaCare. \nMillions of people will eventually have that same experience, according \nto the Congressional Budget Office.\n  Why have we made this huge shift in one-sixth of our economy? What \nwas the goal of the proponents of this piece of legislation? What we \nwere told is that it was universal coverage. There were too many people \nwho didn't have health care coverage. But as for this promise of \nuniversal coverage, I am afraid that is another broken promise as well.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, even if ObamaCare is \nfully implemented on schedule, there will still be 31 million people in \nAmerica without health insurance by the year 2023. Even though the \nproponents of ObamaCare said we need to do this, as expensive as it is, \nas disruptive as it is to the existing health care arrangements, we \nneed to do this because everybody will be covered, that promise is not \ngoing to be kept either.\n  Let me repeat, 13 years after the passage of ObamaCare, America will \nstill have 31 million uninsured. Meanwhile, many of the newly insured \nunder ObamaCare will be covered by Medicaid, a dysfunctional program \nthat is already failing its intended beneficiaries.\n  I, perhaps unwisely, decided during the markup of the Affordable Care \nAct in the Senate Finance Committee to offer an amendment that said \nMembers of Congress will henceforth be put on Medicaid. I told my \ncolleagues that I knew if Congress was covered by Medicaid we would do \nour dead-level best to fix it because, as it exists now, it is a \ndysfunctional program. It is dysfunctional for this reason: Giving \npeople coverage is not the same thing as access. Many Medicaid \nrecipients have a very hard time finding doctors who will accept \nMedicaid coverage because the program reimburses providers at such low \nrates. In my State, it is about 50 cents on the dollar as compared to \nprivate coverage. In my State of Texas, fewer than one-third of \nphysicians will accept a new Medicaid patient, and many of them are \naccepting no new Medicaid patients.\n\n  Most Texas physicians believe Medicaid is broken and should not be \nused as a mechanism to expand coverage, certainly if it is not fixed \nand reformed, which it needs to be. By relying on Medicaid as one of \nthe primary vehicles for reducing the number of uninsured in America, \nthe Affordable Care Act will make the program even more fragile and \nweaker and less effective at securing dependable health care for the \npoor and the disabled, the very people it is designed to protect.\n  We also have good reason to fear ObamaCare's Medicaid expansion will \nreduce labor force participation. A new National Bureau of Economic \nResearch paper argues ObamaCare ``may cause substantial declines in \naggregate employment.'' Rather than expand and damage an already broken \nsystem, the Federal Government should give each State more flexibility \nto manage the Medicare dollars that come from Washington so they can \nprovide better value for recipients and taxpayers.\n  Right now, State policymakers can't manage Medicaid without first \ngoing through a complicated waiver process and obtaining Federal \napproval--too many strings attached. Ideally, Washington would give \neach State a lump sum--a block grant, if you will--as well as the \nfreedom to devise programs that work best in their States and for the \npopulation covered.\n  Meanwhile, we should adopt health care reforms that would make health \ncare more affordable and accessible to everyone--for example, \nequalizing the tax treatment of health insurance for employers and \nindividuals; expanding access to tax-free health savings accounts so \npeople can save their money, and if they don't use it for health care, \nthey can use it for other purposes, such as retirement. We should let \npeople and businesses form risk pools in the individual market, \nincluding across State lines. We should improve price and quality \ntransparency.\n  One of the most amazing forces in economics is consumer choice and \ntransparency and competition. It is called the free enterprise system, \nand we see it at play in the Medicare Part D Program, for example, one \nof the most successful government health care programs devised. We made \na mistake when we passed Medicare Part D because it was not paid for--\nit should have been--but it has actually come in 40 percent under \nprojected cost and it enjoys great satisfaction among its \nbeneficiaries, seniors who have access to prescription drugs, some of \nthem for the first time. But the reason why it has come in 40 percent \nunder cost is because companies have to compete for that business, and \nthey compete--as they always do in the marketplace--on price and \nquality of service, and we get the benefit of that market discipline.\n  We also need to address frivolous medical malpractice lawsuits--\nsomething my State has done at the State level, which has made medical \nmalpractice insurance more affordable and\n\n[[Page S5770]]\n\nwhich has caused many doctors to move to Texas who otherwise might not \nhave gone there, providing greater access to health care.\n  As I have said, we also need to allow the interstate sale of health \ninsurances policies. There is no reason why I shouldn't be able to buy \na health insurance policy in Virginia if it suits my needs better than \none available in Texas. Why would we not allow that? Again, why would \nwe not want the benefit of that competition and the benefits to the \nconsumer in terms of service and price?\n  We also need to boost support for State high-risk pools to protect \nAmericans with preexisting conditions. This is one of the reasons why \nthe President and other proponents of ObamaCare said we have to have \nObamaCare, because we need to deal with preexisting conditions, and we \ndo. But we can do it a lot cheaper and a lot more efficiently by using \nFederal support for existing State preexisting condition high-risk \npools. We don't have to take the whole 2,700-page piece of legislation \nthat cost us several trillion dollars. We can do it much cheaper and \nmore efficiently.\n  Finally, we need to save Medicare by expanding patient choice and \nprovider competition. These policies would allow us to expand quality \ninsurance coverage and improve access to quality health care without \ndisrupting people's existing health care arrangements, without \ndiscouraging work and job creation, without raising taxes on medical \ninnovation, and without weakening Medicaid and Medicare.\n  The chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, one of the principal \nSenate architects for the Affordable Care Act, famously described the \nimplementation of ObamaCare as a train wreck. These three leaders of \nAmerican labor would agree, and they have also warned us that unless we \nfix it, it could destroy the very health and well-being of millions of \nhard-working Americans.\n  It is time for us to acknowledge the reality that whether you were a \nproponent and voted for ObamaCare or whether you were an opponent and a \nskeptic that it would actually work, we need to deal with the harsh \nreality and the facts that exist. It is time for Democrats, including \nthe President, to work with us to replace ObamaCare with better \nalternatives.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if my friend from Virginia will yield to me \nfor the purpose of doing a unanimous consent request, we have an \nagreement as to when we will proceed with votes.\n  Mr. KAINE. I have no objection.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote on the \nconfirmation of the Perez nomination as Secretary of Labor occur at \n12:15 p.m. today; that if the nomination is confirmed, the motion to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no \nintervening action or debate; that no further motions be in order; that \nany related statements be printed in the Record; and the President be \nimmediately notified of the Senate's action; further, that following \ndisposition of the Perez nomination, the time until 2:30 p.m. be \nequally divided in the usual form prior to the cloture vote on the \nMcCarthy nomination.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, while I have the floor, I want the Record to \nreflect how fortunate the State of Virginia is for the work done by \nthis good man. We have a good situation with our delegation from \nVirginia--two former Governors, and they are both such outstanding \nhuman beings and wonderful Senators.\n  As I have told my friend personally, the person whom I just \ninterrupted--and I spread this in the Record here--there is no one I \nknow in the Senate who is able to deliver the substance of what he says \nas well as the Senator from Virginia. He does such a good job of \nexplaining things. We all have an idea of what we want to say, but \nsometimes we don't explain it very well. He does an excellent job.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. KAINE. I thank the majority leader for his kind words.\n\n\n                     War Powers Resolution of 1973\n\n  Mr. President, I rise in order to note an important anniversary. \nForty years ago this week the Senate passed the War Powers Resolution \nof 1973. The resolution was passed in a time of great controversy--\nduring the waning days of the Vietnam war. The purpose of the \nresolution was to formalize a regular consultative process between \nCongress and the President on the most momentous decision made by our \nNation's Government--whether to engage in military action.\n  The question of executive and legislative powers regarding war dates \nback to the Constitution of 1787. Article I, section 8 of the \nConstitution provides that ``Congress shall have the power . . . to \ndeclare war.'' Article II, section 2 of the Constitution provides that \nthe President is the ``Commander in Chief'' of the Nation's Armed \nForces. In the 226 years since the Constitution was adopted, the powers \nof the respective branches in matters of war have been hotly debated. \nIn a letter between two Virginians in 1798, James Madison explained the \nfollowing to Thomas Jefferson:\n\n       The Constitution supposes, what the History of all \n     Governments demonstrates, that the Executive is the branch \n     most interested in war, and most prone to it. It has \n     accordingly, with studied care, vested the question of war in \n     the legislature.\n\n  Madison's definitive statement notwithstanding, the intervening \nhistory has been anything but definitive. Academics and public \nofficials have advanced differing interpretations of the constitutional \ndivision of power. There is no clear historical precedent in which all \nagree the legislative and executive branches have exercised those \npowers in a consistent and accepted way. And the courts have not \nprovided clear guidance to settle war powers questions.\n  Some facts, however, are very clear. The Congress has only formally \ndeclared war five times. In many other instances, Congress has taken \nsteps to authorize, fund, or support military action. In well over 100 \ncases, Presidents have initiated military action without prior approval \nfrom Congress.\n  Congress supposed 40 years ago that the War Powers Resolution of 1973 \nwould resolve many of these questions and establish a formal process of \nconsultation on the decision to initiate military action. But this was \nnot the case. President Nixon vetoed the resolution, and while Congress \noverrode the veto, no administration since has accepted the \nconstitutionality of the resolution. Most recently, President Obama \ninitiated American involvement in a civil war in Libya without \ncongressional approval. The House of Representatives rebuked the \nPresident for that action in 2011. But the censure rang somewhat hollow \nbecause most legal scholars today accept the 1973 resolution is an \nunconstitutional violation of the separation of powers doctrine.\n  So why does this matter? We are in the 12th year of war. The attack \non our country by terrorists on September 11, 2001, was followed 1 week \nlater by the passage of an authorization for use of military force that \nis still in force today. The authorization is broadly worded and both \nthe Bush and Obama administrations have given it an even broader \ninterpretation.\n  In recent hearings before the Senate Armed Services Committee, \nadministration officials expressed the opinion the authorization of \nSeptember 18, 2001, might justify military action for another 25 to 30 \nyears in regions spread across the globe against individuals not yet \nborn or organizations not yet formed on 9/11. This was likely not \ncontemplated by Congress or the American public in 2001.\n  Congress is currently grappling with the status of the authorization \nand whether it should be continued, repealed, or revised. We face \nimmediate decisions about the reduction of American troops in \nAfghanistan and the size of a residual presence we will leave in that \ncountry to support the Afghan National Security Forces. We are \nwrestling with the scope of national security programs that were \nadopted in furtherance of the authorization, and we are engaged in \nserious discussion about new challenges--from the rebellion in Syria to \ngrowing nuclear threats in Iran and North Korea.\n  All of these issues are very hard. I recently returned from a trip to \nthe Middle East--a codel sponsored by Senator\n\n[[Page S5771]]\n\nCornyn. Accompanying us were Senators Cochran, Sessions, Bozeman, \nFischer, and in Afghanistan, Senators McCain and Graham.\n  In Turkey and Jordan we heard about the atrocities committed by the \nAsad regime in Syria and the flood of refugees pouring into those \nneighboring countries. In Afghanistan we met with our troops and heard \nabout the slow transition from NATO forces to Afghan security. In the \nUnited Arab Emirates we discussed the growing threat of Iran throughout \nthe region, and we made a meaningful stop at Landstuhl Regional Medical \nCenter in Germany to visit recently wounded Americans--and NATO \npartners--who have sacrificed so much in this long war against \nterrorism. In the voices of our troops, our diplomats, our allies, and \nour wounded warriors, we heard over and over again a basic question: \nWhat will America do?\n  Answering this question isn't easy, but I believe finding answers is \nmade more difficult because we do not have any agreed-upon consultative \nprocess between the President and Congress. The American public needs \nto hear a clear dialogue between the two branches justifying decisions \nabout the war. When Congress and the President communicate openly and \nreach consensus, the American public is informed and more likely to \nsupport decisions about military action. But when there is no clear \nprocess for reaching decision, public opinion with respect to military \naction may be divided, to the detriment of the troops who fight and \nmaking it less likely that government will responsibly budget for the \ncost of war.\n  I believe many more lawmakers, for example, would have thought twice \nabout letting sequestration cuts take effect if there had been a clear \nconsensus between the President and Congress about our current military \nposture and mission.\n  So at this 40th anniversary, I think it is time to admit that the \n1973 resolution is a failure, and we need to begin work to create a \npractical process for consultation between the President and Congress \nregarding military action.\n  In 2007 the Miller Center at the University of Virginia impaneled the \nbipartisan National War Powers Commission under the leadership of \nformer Secretaries of State James Baker and Warren Christopher. The \nCommission included legislative, administrative, diplomatic, military, \nand academic leadership. The Commission issued a unanimous report to \nthe President and Congress urging the repeal of the War Powers \nResolution and its replacement by a new provision designed to promote \ntransparent dialog and decisionmaking. The Commission even proposed a \ndraft statute, preserving the constitutional powers of each branch \nwhile establishing a straightforward consultative process to reach \ndecision in a way that would gain support from the American public. The \nHouse and Senate Foreign Relations Committees held hearings on the \nreport in 2008, but the time was not yet right for change.\n  I believe the time for change is upon us. We struggle today with \nurgent military decisions that demand better communication between the \nPresident, Congress, and our citizens. President Obama has discussed \nthis very need during his 2013 State of the Union Address and also \nduring his recent speech at the National Defense University.\n  As we reach the 40th anniversary of the failed War Powers Resolution, \nSenator John McCain has agreed to work with me to form a group of \nSenators committed to finding a better way. Senator McCain and I serve \ntogether on both the Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committees. I \nhave profound admiration for his service to this country, both as a \nmilitary veteran and a veteran Senator. I am a newcomer, but veterans \nand newcomers alike have an interest in finding a more effective \nprocess for making the most important decision that our government ever \nmakes--whether to initiate military action. We can craft a process that \nis practical, constitutional, and effective in protecting our Nation. \nWe owe this to those who fight, and we owe this to the American public.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized to speak for up to 12 minutes as in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                               Obamacare\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, just a few moments ago I heard the \nPresident speaking from the White House regarding ObamaCare. He was \nlamenting, saying: Why are we still litigating old news around here? \nLet's move on to other things. This issue has been finished.\n  The reason this issue is still being talked about is because \nObamaCare is a disaster. I think it is important to remember when we \ntalk about health insurance that most Americans do have health \ninsurance they are happy with. But no one would dispute that we have a \nhealth insurance problem in this country.\n  For many who have insurance the cost of their insurance is getting \nunaffordable, and many others have no access to insurance at all. They \nhave a job, perhaps, that doesn't provide it or they are chronically \nill so insurance is impossible for them to find or they are young and \nhealthy and they never go to a doctor, so they figure, why do they need \nit? Yes, for millions of people the cost and availability of insurance \nis a real problem, and we should do something about that.\n  The problem is ObamaCare, as a solution, is a massive government \ntakeover of health insurance in America, and it does not fix the \nproblem. It only makes it worse, and that is why we are still talking \nabout it. It makes it worse for a number of reasons.\n  Tomorrow I am going to visit a business in Florida where the reality \nis growing every single day. Tomorrow I will visit Gatorland. Gatorland \nis in central Florida. It is a tourist destination where many \nFloridians and tourists have taken their kids to see alligators and to \nenjoy Florida's unique wildlife.\n  For 135 Orlando area residents, however, Gatorland is their \nworkplace. It is their livelihood. It is how they feed their families. \nIt is how they pay their mortgages. It is how they get ahead in life. \nThe reason we are still litigating this, Mr. President, is because like \nhundreds of thousands of other businesses around the country, ObamaCare \nis threatening to unravel it all. It is threatening to unravel the \nlivelihood of 135 Floridians who work at Gatorland, to shatter their \nfinancial security for them and their families.\n  Let me describe the problem. Gatorland has 135 full-time employees. \nGatorland is currently paying 80 percent of the insurance cost for \nthese employees. But now, under ObamaCare, evidently what they are \ndoing is not going to be enough. ObamaCare, first of all, requires them \nnot to just provide insurance but to provide for them a certain type of \ninsurance, a type of insurance the government decided is enough.\n  Second, because of ObamaCare, the cost of the insurance that \nGatorland wants to provide for its employees is going to go up; that \nis, if they want to continue to pay 80 percent of the insurance costs \nfor the 135 Floridians who work there, it is going to cost them a lot \nmore money. Those are the two problems.\n  No. 1 is they have to offer a certain type of insurance; the one they \nhave potentially may not be enough according to the government. No. 2, \nbecause of all these changes, it is going to cost Gatorland more money \nto provide 80 percent of the cost of the insurance.\n  What does this mean in the real world? Here is what it means. It \nmeans that as Gatorland looks to next year and into the future, they \nnow have a new cost on their books. As they look at their business plan \nfor the coming year, all of a sudden they see on the cost side it has \ngotten more expensive. So if they want to stay in business, they are \ngoing to have to figure out a way to come up with that extra money.\n  What are their options to come up with this extra money? Option No. 1 \nis they can raise their prices. Option No.\n\n[[Page S5772]]\n\n2 is they can cut back on expenses, such as the number of employees and \nbenefits and hours. Option No. 3 is just not to comply at all with \nObamaCare and pay a fine. Basically, don't offer insurance to these \nemployees; let them go off and find it in the so-called exchanges and \npay a fine to the IRS.\n  I ask you, Mr. President, and I ask the people of this country, and I \nask my colleagues, which one of these three options is good for our \ncountry? Which one of these three options is good for America, and \nwhich one of these three options is good for the 135 people who feed \ntheir families by working at Gatorland?\n  If they raise their prices, that means the cost of going to Gatorland \nwill go up. I understand our economy is not doing very well these days. \nMillions of people are underemployed and unemployed. They are working \ntwice as hard and making half as much, and you are going to make it \nmore expensive for them to go on vacation. I would argue that raising \ntheir prices is probably not an option available to them anyway. \nGatorland is not Disneyland and not Universal, and it is not one these \nbig tourist destinations. It is a small place that has to compete, and \nif you raise prices there comes a point where people just will not go.\n  Not only is raising prices bad for our economy and people who want to \nvisit Florida and take their families there, it might not even be \nfeasible. So that certainly is not a good option. It may not even be an \noption at all.\n  The second option is they would have to cut down on their expenses \nwith their employees. That means they can lay off some people; find the \nmoney by instead of having 135 employees, try to get by with 125 \nemployees. That could mean not laying off people but as people retire \nor quit just not replacing them. That could also mean moving some of \nthese people who are working full time to part time so they can get \naround the ObamaCare mandates, and so they can lower their costs. How \nis that good for our economy? How is that good for 135 people who work \nat Gatorland? How is that good for Florida? How is that good for us?\n  The third option is they could pay the fine, but it is going to cost \nat least 135 people in my State the insurance they are happy with. I \nwant you, Mr. President, to remember what you said--in fact what you \nrepeated today in your statements a moment ago at the White House. You \nsaid if you are happy with your insurance, you can keep it. For 135 \npeople working in Gatorland in central Florida, that may not be true. \nThey could lose their insurance that is working well for them, that \nthey are happy with, because of this experiment. That is why we keep \nrevisiting this issue.\n  Interestingly enough, by the way, that is not just me saying that. \nThis week some prominent labor unions, labor unions who are actually in \nfavor of this law--lead among them was the Teamsters head, Jimmy \nHoffa--wrote a letter to the President attacking this very point. They \nsaid the new law is breaking the promise that was made that if you are \nhappy with your coverage, you are not going to lose it.\n  I single out Gatorland because that is the real world. That is where \nI am going tomorrow, and that happens to be in my State. There are \nthousands of businesses like this that are facing these decisions. \nThere is not one, there are hundreds of thousands of businesses that \nare facing this dilemma, that have these same concerns.\n  By the way, this is not the only problem with ObamaCare. There are \nmany others. The President keeps saying: There are people in town who \nwant this plan to fail. They keep bringing up ObamaCare because they \nwant it to fail.\n  The plan is already failing. It is failing by your own admission. You \njust had to cancel, had to suspend one of the critical components of \nthis bill because it is not doable. This plan is already failing on its \nown.\n  By the way, if you are going to accuse us of wanting ObamaCare to \nfail, you better accuse the Teamsters of it because they have the same \ncriticisms on this point that I have raised today.\n  I think we have reached a point where no matter how you voted on \nObamaCare--I was not here, but no matter how you may have voted on \nObamaCare if you were here, no matter who you voted for for President, \nno matter if you are a Republican, a Democrat, or an Independent, it is \nbigger than politics--this is really about people. Today I highlighted \nthe plight that 135 people in Florida are facing, but hundreds of \nthousands if not millions of others will soon face this plight as well. \nAs Americans, we have to come to grips with the fact that this law is a \nterrible mistake, and we cannot go forward with it because it is going \nto hurt millions of middle-class Americans in the ways I have just \ndescribed.\n\n  We are going to have an opportunity to get this right in September \nbecause we are going to have to vote on a short-term budget to fund the \ngovernment. I implore my colleagues to use that as an opportunity to \nput the brakes on this terrible mistake before more people lose their \ninsurance, put the brakes on this before more people lose their jobs, \nput the brakes on this before more people lose their businesses. In \nthat short-term funding bill, we should not pay for the implementation \nof ObamaCare. Let me be clear. Anyone who votes for the short-term \nbudget that funds ObamaCare is voting to move forward with ObamaCare. \nDon't come here and say ``I am against ObamaCare'' if you are willing \nto vote for a budget that funds it. If you pay for it, you own it.\n  I want to make myself clear to the employees of Gatorland, the \nworking people of Florida, and anyone in America who is watching that \nI, for one, will not vote for any bill or any budget that funds the \nimplementation of this disaster. Does that mean we shouldn't do \nanything about health insurance in America? Of course it doesn't mean \nthat. We should do something--something that protects what is good \nabout the current system and fixes what is bad with it. ObamaCare \nthrows out what is good about the current system in order to try to fix \nwhat is bad with it, and in the end it messes up everything.\n  We should repeal ObamaCare and replace it. We should replace it with \nideas that allow uninsured and underinsured Americans to find \naffordable insurance without taking away other people's insurance and \nother people's jobs.\n  For example, we should expand flexible savings accounts. These are \naccounts like the ones to which every Member of Congress has access. \nThat allows us to take money out of our paycheck every month tax free \nand put it in a savings account for health purposes. We don't have to \npay taxes on that money. A deposit is made every month, and it starts \nadding up. That money can be used to buy medicine or to pay for a \ncopayment or any other medical expense. It is our money, and we control \nit. It has to be used on health care, but it is tax free. If Members of \nCongress get this, why shouldn't every American have a chance to have \nsomething like that?\n  I used that account last year to pay for my daughter's braces. \nMillions of Americans should have the chance to do that. Why don't \nthey? Because ObamaCare undermines it instead of encouraging it. It \nlowered the amount we can save every year from $5,000 to $2,500. \nRidiculously enough, it says that in order for me to pay for children's \nAdvil for my kids with my flex savings account, I have to get a \nprescription from a doctor. Think about that. If you buy children's \nAdvil because your child has a fever, you now have to go to a doctor \nand get a prescription if you want to use your money to pay for it. \nInstead of encouraging the flex savings account, ObamaCare undermines \nit.\n  Another good idea would be to allow people to buy insurance with \ntheir own tax-free money. Let's use the example of Gatorland. Let's say \nthat the monthly premium is $1,000 and Gatorland pays $800 of it. They \ndon't pay taxes on that $800. But let's say that tomorrow a business \nlike that decides it is going to give you the $800 so you can go out \nand buy insurance from any company. If it does that, you have to pay \ntaxes on the $800. If the employer buys the insurance for you, they \ndon't pay taxes on the money. If you buy insurance for yourself, you \npay taxes on the money. That is ridiculous. That is something we should \nbe for.\n  Here is another one. Why can't we Americans buy insurance from any \ncompany that will sell it to us? I live in Florida. If there is a \ncompany in Georgia that will sell me health insurance, why can't I buy \nit? I can't buy it\n\n[[Page S5773]]\n\nbecause they are not licensed by the State of Florida. This ignores the \nfact that every American needs a different type of health insurance.\n  If you are like me, with four children, you need a family plan that \nwill cover a lot of things, and that will cost more.\n  What if you are a 25-year-old healthy single person who hardly ever \ngets sick? What you probably want is a hospitalization and catastrophic \ninsurance account and a health savings account. The health savings \naccount can be used if you get the flu, so you can take out $50 or $100 \nwith the tax-free money you have saved and pay for the doctor's visit. \nIf, God forbid, you get hit by a car, your insurance steps up and pays \nfor it. A plan such as that is a lot more affordable, but right now you \ncan't buy it. Most States have rules, and most of the rules say: You \neither have to sell them a Cadillac or nothing at all. What if you \ndon't want a Cadillac? What if you want a Geo? The same is true with \nhealth insurance, and it is wrong. We should encourage those things.\n  It is not too late to change all of this. It would be a terrible \nmistake to move forward. This is not about defeating a President's \nagenda or wanting or rooting for it to fail. We do have a health \ninsurance problem, and we should address it. What we are doing now is \ngoing to hurt an economy that is already struggling. There are people \nwho will lose their jobs, lose hours at their jobs, paychecks will be \ncut, and they will lose the health insurance they are happy with. There \nare businesses in America that are going to be forced to absorb these \ncosts by laying people off or raising prices or both. There are people \nwho will lose coverage now and be thrown into exchanges that don't \nexist yet. This is a disaster. We should take the time to slow this \ndown, and we will have a chance to do that in September.\n  I will repeat it. I, for one, will not vote for any budget that funds \nthe implementation of this disaster and hurts people in this way. I \nhope my colleagues will put partisanship and pride aside and come \ntogether. The fact is that if ObamaCare goes through and begins to be \nimplemented, it is going to hurt us in ways that are potentially \nirreversible. It is not too late to stop.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I am pleased we are finally at the point \nwhere we can vote on the nomination of Thomas Perez to serve as \nSecretary of Labor. Indeed, it seems as though the most important \nquestion before us today has gotten lost in all of the debate. Will Tom \nPerez be a good Secretary of Labor? The answer is unequivocally yes. \nThere is no question that he has the knowledge and experience needed to \nguide this critically important agency.\n  His outstanding work in Maryland as their secretary of labor has won \nhim the support of the business community and workers alike. Here is a \nquote from the endorsement letter from the Maryland Chamber of \nCommerce:\n\n       Mr. Perez proved himself to be a pragmatic public official \n     who is willing to bring differing voices together. The \n     Maryland Chamber had the opportunity to work with Mr. Perez \n     on an array of issues of importance to employers in Maryland, \n     from unemployment and workforce development to the housing \n     and foreclosure crisis. Despite differences of opinion, Mr. \n     Perez was always willing to allow all parties to be heard and \n     we found him to be fair and collaborative. I believe that our \n     experiences with him here in Maryland bode well for the \n     nation.\n\n  That is a pretty strong endorsement by a chamber of commerce for a \nnominee whom the minority leader this morning characterized as a \n``leftwing ideologue . . . willing to bend the law to achieve his \nideological ends.'' That is what the minority leader said this morning. \nThat grossly unfair characterization is manifestly inconsistent with \nthe experiences of the Republican leaders and business leaders who have \nactually worked with Tom Perez. These people clearly disagree with the \nminority leader's assessment of Mr. Perez's qualifications and \ncharacter. I am informed that the minority leader never met with Mr. \nPerez. Mr. Perez offered to meet with him, but the minority leader said \nno. Yet the minority leader comes down here and makes these kinds of \njudgments as to his character and his integrity?\n  We have heard a lot of discussion about the controversy surrounding \nMr. Perez's nomination over the last couple of days on the Senate \nfloor. His integrity and character have been viciously and unfairly \nattacked.\n  I take particular issue with the minority leader's suggestion this \nmorning that Mr. Perez doesn't follow the law or believe it applies to \nhim. I respectfully suggest that the minority leader needs to check his \nfacts. Those allegations couldn't be more to the contrary. Tom Perez \nbelieves deeply in the law. He believes that all the laws on the books, \nespecially those that protect our most important rights--the right to \nvote, the right to be free from discrimination in the workplace, the \nright of people with disabilities to live in their own communities--Tom \nPerez believes strongly that these rights should be respected and \nenforced. These are the same laws that I sometimes think some on the \nRepublican side would like to forget are on the books, but these laws \nmatter. Voting rights matter. Fair housing rights matter. The rights of \npeople with disabilities matter. And Tom Perez has fought for that.\n  We shouldn't shy away from using every tool in our arsenal to \nstrengthen our enforcement of civil rights laws. These laws are part of \nwhat makes our country great. I am incredibly proud of the work Mr. \nPerez has done at the Department of Justice to make these rights a \nreality again after years of neglect. He should be applauded, not \nvilified, for the service he has provided to this country.\n  He is a leader whose career has involved passionate and visionary \nwork for justice. Yes, he has had to make difficult decisions. He has \nfaced management challenges. As we now know, he has been the target of \naccusations, mudslinging, and character assassination. I have looked \ncarefully into Mr. Perez's background and record of service, as the \nchair of the authorizing and oversight committee. I can assure Senators \nthat Tom Perez has the strongest possible record of professional \nintegrity and that any allegations to the contrary are unfounded. They \nare simply unfounded allegations. There is absolutely nothing that \ncalls into question his ability to fairly enforce the law as it is \nwritten. There is absolutely nothing that calls into question his \nprofessional integrity, moral character, or his ability to lead the \nDepartment of Labor.\n  I am particularly disappointed that Republicans continue to raise \nconcerns regarding Mr. Perez's involvement in the global resolution of \ntwo cases involving St. Paul, MN--the cases called Magner and Newell. I \nspoke about that at length, and Republicans have talked about it. This \nhas been debated exhaustively. Quite frankly, there is nothing there.\n  This is an issue the HELP Committee and the Judiciary Committee have \nthoroughly examined and found no cause for concern. The House Oversight \nand Judiciary Committees have also thoroughly explored the underlying \nfacts. In fact, both the majority and minority staff on the House \nOversight Committee have released reports on the matter. What the \nreports revealed is that the evidence is clear--Mr. Perez acted \nethically and appropriately at all times. Indeed, he had clearance to \nproceed as he did from the appropriate ethics officers at the \nDepartment of Justice. Noted experts in legal ethics have confirmed \nthis.\n  There is no foundation for any allegation of wrongdoing by Mr. Perez \nin these cases involving St. Paul, MN. Yet they keep being drummed up. \nBut they are just allegations. Anybody can make an allegation--\nespecially here on the Senate floor. Members can make all kinds of \nallegations. I simply ask for proof. Back up those allegations. There \nis no proof. There is nothing to back up those allegations that somehow \nMr. Perez acted unethically or in violation of law.\n  I am also deeply disappointed that my Republican friends are \nsuggesting that Mr. Perez has been unresponsive to requests for \ninformation by Members of this body. Nothing could be further from the \ntruth. Mr. Perez has been as open and aboveboard as he possibly can be \nwith both my committee and Members of the Senate. He has met with any \nMember personally who requested a meeting. He requested a meeting with \nthe minority leader, and the minority leader said no. He appeared \nbefore our committee in a public hearing. He answered more than 200\n\n[[Page S5774]]\n\nwritten questions. He bent over backward to respond to any and all \nconcerns raised about his work at the Department of Justice.\n  This administration has also been extraordinarily accommodating to my \nRepublican colleagues--especially to their concerns about Mr. Perez's \nhandling of the Magner and Newell cases while at the Department of \nJustice.\n  The administration has produced thousands of documents. They have \narranged for the interview of government employees and access to \ntranscripts of inspector general interviews. They have provided access \nto Mr. Perez's personal e-mails. They have facilitated almost \nunprecedented levels of disclosure to alleviate any concerns. They have \nresponded to every request for information, including the letter by \nChairman Issa that Senator Isakson submitted for the Record this \nmorning.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the response to \nChairman Issa's letter from the Department of Justice at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         U.S. Department of Justice, Office of the Assistant \n           Attorney General,\n                                    Washington, DC, July 15, 2013.\n     Hon. Darrell E. Issa,\n     Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, U.S. \n         House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Issa: This is in response to your letter, \n     dated July 8, 2013, to Assistant Attorney General Thomas E. \n     Perez, regarding your request for emails that existed both in \n     Mr. Perez's personal email account and in the Department's \n     email system.\n       As we explained in our letters of June 21, May 10, May 3, \n     and April 17, 2013, we have gone to great lengths to \n     accommodate the Committee's stated oversight interest in the \n     Federal Records Act and the availability of emails for other \n     records requests. The mails in question that were in Mr. \n     Perez's personal account had also, before your inquiry, \n     already been sent to or from a Department email address and \n     thus were captured by the Department's system pursuant to the \n     Federal Records Act (FRA). Nonetheless, we invited Committee \n     staff to view the date, sender, and recipient fields of these \n     emails so that they could confirm this fact. Indeed, \n     following Mr. Cummings' staff's review of the emails, he \n     wrote to the Department to state that the review had allowed \n     him to ``verify that [all the emails] were, in fact, sent \n     from or received by official government e-mail accounts,'' \n     which addressed his concerns. The substantive content of \n     these emails is not pertinent to an inquiry into FRA \n     compliance.\n       Only 5 communications initiated by Mr. Perez--and just 30 \n     initiated by others--had not already been captured in the \n     Department's email system prior to your inquiry. When he \n     located these communications, Mr. Perez immediately forwarded \n     them to a Department email address, ensuring that they are \n     now in the Department's system. These 35 communications were \n     made available for review by your staff.\n       As a result, as we explained in our letter to you on June \n     21, 2013, we believe that we have addressed your stated \n     oversight interest.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Peter J. Kadzik,\n                      Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General.\n  Mr. SCOTT. Madam President, I rise today to express my opposition to \nthe nomination of Thomas Perez to be Secretary of Labor.\n  Given our relentlessly high rate of unemployment over the past 55 \nmonths and stagnant economic growth, we simply must do more to foster \nlasting economic prosperity. After analyzing Mr. Perez's role at the \nDepartment of Justice, I do not believe he is the proper candidate to \nhelp our Nation return to full employment or reach our economic \npotential. I have great concerns regarding some of the decisions he has \nmade, the professionalism and ethics of those decisions, and his \noverall management abilities. The Department of Labor has, \nunfortunately, pursued guidance and rulemakings that are daunting to \nlarge and small businesses alike, and I believe Mr. Perez would only \nexacerbate these problems.\n  Mr. Perez accrued an alarming record of mismanagement and utter \npoliticization of the law during his tenure at the Department of \nJustice, DOJ. The DOJ's inspector general 2013 report gave a highly \ncritical review of the Voting Section under Mr. Perez, citing the \n``politically charged atmosphere and polarization within the Voting \nSection'' and the ``dysfunctional management chain'' under Mr. Perez. \nFurthermore, the report indicated that the handling of the New Black \nPanther Party case under his leadership ``risked undermining confidence \nin the non-ideological enforcement of the voting rights laws.''\n  When I look at the nonpartisan inspector general report and the way \nin which Mr. Perez has pursued policies singling out certain \nconservative States and industries, I simply cannot support his \nnomination. The Voting Section's decision to override career DOJ staff \nto block the implementation of my home State of South Carolina's voter \nID law is a prime example of this trend. Only after South Carolina \nspent more than $3.5 million suing the DOJ in Federal court did our law \ntake effect. Yet, even on the heels of defeat in Federal court, Mr. \nPerez was still dissatisfied and decided to send DOJ officials down to \nmonitor a special municipal election in Branchville, SC--a town with a \nvoting population of 800 and where fewer than 200 people voted in the \nspecial municipal election.\n  Finally, I believe it is irresponsible and an abdication of \ncongressional authority to move a nominee who has repeatedly failed to \ncomply with an outstanding congressional subpoena. The House Oversight \nand Government Reform Committee issued a bipartisan subpoena on April \n10, 2013, regarding 1,200 e-mails sent from Mr. Perez's nonofficial e-\nmail account that referred to official business of the Department of \nJustice. Mr. Perez's failure to comply with this obligation casts \nconsiderable doubt on the deference he would give to Congress as \nSecretary.\n  What we need at the Department of Labor is simple: a Secretary who \nwill put politics aside and a strong management structure in place to \nhelp get our economy back on track. States, businesses, and employees \ncannot afford to have a Secretary of Labor who seeks to micromanage and \npoliticize the most mundane aspects of everyday life. For these \nreasons, I oppose Mr. Perez's nomination.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, once again I wish to reiterate my \nstrong support for Tom Perez, a man eminently qualified to serve our \ncountry as the next Secretary of Labor.\n  Tom Perez was cleared by the HELP Committee over 2 months ago and \nshould have been confirmed soon after, but we know that wasn't the \ncase.\n  I am glad that Leader Reid was able to break the nominations logjam \nthis week so that we could begin confirming some very deserving \nnominees, including Tom Perez.\n  Tom Perez is the quintessential public servant. He is a consensus \nbuilder. As Secretary of Labor in Maryland, he brought together the \nchamber of commerce and Maryland labor unions to make sure workers \nreceived the level of wages and benefits they deserved and business had \nthe skilled workforce they needed.\n  Most recently, he has served as Assistant Attorney General for the \nCivil Rights Division of the Department of Justice, where he increased \nprosecution of human trafficking by 40 percent, won $50 million for \nservicemembers whose homes were improperly foreclosed on while they \nserved, and settled the three largest fair lending cases in the history \nof the Fair Housing Act, recovering more money for victims in 2012 than \nin the previous 23 years combined.\n  He has spent his entire career in public service.\n  He is a Brown University graduate with a master's in public policy \nfrom the Kennedy School and a Juris Doctorate from Harvard Law.\n  He is an advocate for people with disabilities and won the largest \never disability-based housing discrimination settlement.\n  Tom Perez is a civil rights champion. He obtained the first \nconvictions under the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr., Hate Crimes \nPrevention Act, and has always supported ending discrimination on the \nbasis of sexual orientation.\n  Tom Perez is a good man and a good nominee. So let's do what we \nshould have done a long time ago.\n  He is a qualified, competent, professional public servant, nominated \nby the President, and already confirmed by the Senate to the post he \nholds today.\n  As I said when I first endorsed Tom Perez, and I will say again \ntoday; he is an outstanding public servant, and I applaud President \nObama for selecting him to be our Nation's next Secretary of Labor.\n  I have no doubt that he will continue the administration's efforts to \ncreate\n\n[[Page S5775]]\n\njobs and get people back to work. Mr. Perez has dedicated his career to \nchampioning the rights of workers and all Americans, and I am confident \nthat he will continue to do the same if confirmed.\n  As former Secretary of Labor in Maryland, Mr. Perez prioritized \nmatching community colleges, labor unions, and the private sector to \nhelp get people jobs that are in demand today and in the future--an \ninitiative that is much needed on a national scale, and something I \nhave proposed in legislation that would close the skills gap by \ntraining workers with the skills needed to fill such jobs.\n  This is a remarkable nominee who brings a compelling personal story \nand a wealth of knowledge and leadership to the Department of Labor.\n  I am very pleased the time has finally come for good people like Tom \nPerez to get the up-or-down vote they deserve.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote to confirm this qualified nominee who \nhas waited too long.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I rise in support of one of Maryland's \nfavorite sons, Mr. Tom Perez, the President's nominee to lead the \nDepartment of Labor. Mr. Perez has been the Assistant Attorney General \nfor the United States and has also been Maryland's Secretary of Labor \nand Licensing and also was a member of the Montgomery County Council. \nAll three of these jobs show his expertise and his ability to navigate \nsome very complex situations. I believe he is the right man for the \njob.\n  I support his nomination, not only because he is one of Maryland's \nfavorite sons, but because I believe he brings integrity, competency, \nand commitment to the mission of the Department of Labor.\n  His resume is outstanding. A Harvard Law School graduate. He has \nserved in public service at the Federal, State, and county levels and \nhe has a commitment to the mission of each agency.\n  In terms of personal background, it is really the story of America. \nHis father came to this country under very difficult circumstances. His \ngrandfather was one of the leaders of the voices of freedom in the \nDominican Republic--punished for that and declared a persona non grata. \nBut his father was able to stay in this country as a legal immigrant, \ngo on to military service, and become a physician. And to show his \ngratitude to this country, he worked only for the Veterans \nAdministration serving the country that saved him and his family.\n  Tom grew up with public service in his DNA. His father died when he \nwas a young boy and he will tell that compelling narrative, but through \nthe dint of hard work, a loving mother, and a nation that offered \nopportunity--he was able to work his way through school, get the \nscholarships, worked even as a trash collector during summer break to \nbe able to advance himself.\n  He knows what the American dream is, but he also knows what hard work \nis, and he knows what an opportunity ladder we need to have in this \ncountry.\n  But in addition to that, he brings a great deal of skill--we know Tom \nat the Montgomery County Council level where government is closest to \nthe people had to really govern best. And it is a complex, growing \ncounty where you had to work with public-private partnerships.\n  I admire Tom so much for his work as head of the Maryland Department \nof Labor. They now have a letter in the Record recommending Tom to be \nthe Secretary of Labor. Why? Because he listens, he learns, and he \nbrings everybody to the table for a pragmatic, fair, and collaborative \nwork.\n  That is how he earned support from worker advocates and many of the \nMaryland's largest employers, the Maryland University System, the \nMaryland Association of Community Colleges, the Maryland Minority \nContractors Association, and the Greater Baltimore Committee.\n  I am confident Tom Perez will be an excellent Secretary of Labor. I \nknow he will be a strong voice for the working class and for keeping \nthe government on the side of the people who need it. I urge my \ncolleagues to support his nomination.\n  Mr. LEAHEY. Madam President, today the Senate will finally proceed to \na confirmation vote on the nomination of Tom Perez to serve as \nSecretary of the U.S. Department of Labor. This vote continues the \nprogress we made on executive nominees this week following our \nbipartisan caucus on Monday night. I am pleased that six Republican \nSenators joined with Democratic Senators to invoke cloture on this \nnomination on Wednesday, and now we can proceed to getting this well-\nqualified nominee confirmed to lead the Department of Labor.\n  Tom Perez is a dedicated public servant, and since 2009, he has \nworked hard to restore the reputation of the Civil Rights Division at \nthe Justice Department. This was no small task after the prior \nadministration had amassed one of the worst civil rights enforcement \nrecords in modern American history. Under the leadership of Attorney \nGeneral Holder, Tom Perez has guided the Civil Rights Division back to \nits core mission of vigorous civil rights enforcement. He has many \naccomplishments to be proud of under his stewardship of the Division. \nAmong them is his successful implementation of legislation I offered in \nthe Senate, the Shepard-Byrd Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which was \nsigned into law by President Obama just after Tom Perez was confirmed \nas the Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division in \nOctober 2009. Under Tom Perez's leadership, the Division implemented \nthis important law and brought several important hate crimes \nprosecutions. Under his leadership, the Division has also been vigilant \nin protecting American homeowners against discriminatory predatory \nlending, and in protecting our men and women in uniform from \nforeclosure by lenders while overseas on active duty. He also led the \nDivision to expand the number of human trafficking prosecutions by 40 \npercent during the past 4 years, including a record number of cases in \n2012.\n  I have no doubt that Tom Perez will bring to the Labor Department the \nsame leadership and commitment that he brought to the Civil Rights \nDivision, and our Nation will be better for it. As a former Secretary \nof Labor in Maryland, and a fierce defender of workers' rights and \ncivil rights, he is uniquely suited to serve in this important post at \na critical time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 more \nminute to conclude my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. In short, the Department of Justice has made all e-mails \navailable for review. It is true Congressman Issa has continued to \nrepeat his requests, but that doesn't mean Mr. Perez and the \nadministration have not been responsive, because they have.\n  The fact is this nominee has been more than thoroughly vetted. He has \nthe character and the integrity and the expertise to lead the \nDepartment of Labor. The President has chosen Mr. Perez to join his \nCabinet, and there is absolutely no reason why the Senate should not \nconsent to this choice.\n  I am proud to support Mr. Perez's nomination. He will be an asset to \nthe Department of Labor and to our entire country.

Madam President, as chairman of the EPW Committee, this \nis a day I have longed for for a long time. This has been the longest \ntime the EPA has been without an Administrator in all of history. We \ncould not have a more qualified nominee. We could not have a more \nbipartisan nominee.\n  The bottom line is Gina McCarthy has worked for five Republican \nGovernors. She is a beloved individual. I wish to thank so many outside \nof this body who have weighed in on her behalf, including Christine \nTodd Whitman, the former Republican Administrator of the EPA, and Gov. \nJodi Rell. It has meant a lot to Gina McCarthy. It has meant a lot to \nus who know that the EPA deserves a leader, and this woman Gina \nMcCarthy deserves a promotion.\n  I will be back on the floor in about an hour or so just to make some \nmore brief comments. But I wish to thank my colleagues from both sides \nof the aisle. We did avert a tough challenge for both parties. We \naverted that. I am very happy we did. One of the benefits of that \nagreement is we are having votes on people as qualified as Gina \nMcCarthy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that after my \nremarks, Senator Reed be recognized for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I would like to talk about the \nnomination of Gina McCarthy to serve as Administrator of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency. I had the pleasure of meeting with her \nearlier in the confirmation process and talking with her at length \nabout many important issues. She is experienced. I believe she is a \ngood person. She has given her assurance that EPA would become more \nresponsive--at least my interpretation of her response would be that--\nand her management has been encouraging.\n  However, the Environmental Protection Agency appointment is no small \nmatter. The job of EPA Administrator has the potential to impact the \nlife of every American in both positive and negative ways. For example, \nin the 1970s, Congress passed the Clean Air Act. It focused on \npollutants. We were talking about NOX and SOX, \nsulphur oxide, nitrogen oxide, particulates, things that adversely \naffect the health of Americans.\n  At that point in time, we had no dream in our mind of a problem--\nglobal warming--that might arise and become a big issue in the future, \nnor did Congress have any inclination that carbon dioxide, plant food, \nthat product in the atmosphere that plants take in and breathe out \noxygen--we breathe in oxygen and out CO2--would be declared \na pollutant.\n  By a 5-to-4 decision, the Supreme Court seemed to declare that, \nalthough it was not absolutely mandatory, EPA could regulate \nCO2 under the Clean Air Act. EPA has seized that authority. \nThey say that, for example, CO2 is a pollutant. Congress has \nnever voted to declare CO2 a pollutant. I believe it is a \nstretch and an abuse of the Supreme Court's authority to interpret the \nlaw we passed in the 1970s as including that.\n  If CO2 is a pollutant, as the EPA now assumes and asserts \nit is, every backyard barbecue, every lawnmower as well as every \nfactory and plant in America is subject to their control because they \nare required to limit and control pollutants. This is how things happen \nin America.\n  So we have an unelected bureaucracy, the Environmental Protection \nAgency, virtually unaccountable to the public, often refusing \nsteadfastly to produce reasonable answers to inquiries put to them by \nthe Congress. They dictate matters that impact every person in America. \nIt is an awesome power. It is something too little discussed in \nAmerica.\n  I am going to talk about another subject briefly. I understand Ms. \nMcCarthy and her experience. She is going to be elevated now from EPA's \nAir Office, where they have been hammering coal, hammering natural gas, \nand other fuels, carbon fuels, in their regulations to a degree that it \nis driving up the cost for every American to obtain energy, their \nelectricity, their automobiles, and the heating in their homes.\n  I wish to focus for a few minutes on a central problem at the EPA: \nits disregard for Congress, the law as written, and the use of unlawful \nagency guidance.\n  Agency guidance. These are documents they issue to effectively \nrewrite the law in a way that favors the administration's policies and \npolitical agenda. That is what we are seeing too much of. People say: \nOh, they just do not like the EPA. All of these complaints from farmers \nand businesses, it is all just overreaction. Those are guys who want to \npollute the atmosphere and the farmlands and do all of these things. \nThey are not reasonable people.\n  Most Americans are not dealing face-to-face with the guidance, the \nregulations of the EPA officials who attempt to dictate so much of what \nthey do. There is perhaps no better illustration of the dynamic than in \nthe context of the administration's effort to grasp control over every \nditch, stream and creek and pond in the country.\n  We actually had a vote on this issue in May during the debate on the \nWater Resources Development Act. I joined with my colleague Senator \nBarrasso in introducing an amendment, the Barrasso-Sessions amendment \nNo. 868 to the Water Resources Development Act. A clear majority of the \nSenate, 52 Members, voted for our amendment that would stop EPA from \nimplementing an agency guidance document that would vastly expand the \nAgency's jurisdiction over the Clean Water Act.\n  So they issue a guidance, direct it to all of their subordinates, and \ntell them how the law is to be enforced. So actually it becomes a new \nlaw; it becomes the effect of an actual statute. First, the problem \nwith what they have been doing is it is contrary to the plain reading \nof the statute, the Clean Water Act.\n  This law, enacted in 1972, requires a Federal permit for activities \nimpacting navigable waters--navigable waters. That is what is in the \nstatute, which Congress has defined as waters of the United States. \nEPA's guidance document broadly interprets this term--broadly \ninterprets it and would give Agency employees throughout the country \nthe authority to make case-by-case determinations with virtually no \njurisdictional limits whatsoever.\n  I recently asked Ms. McCarthy about this issue. She did not detail \nher views. She would not answer specific questions.\n  The Supreme Court has ruled several times on the meaning of this \njurisdictional term, most recently in its 2006 decision, just a few \nyears ago, Rapanos\n\n[[Page S5777]]\n\nv. United States. That 4-1-4 decision--which, I think the Chair did not \noften see in her State when she was attorney general, not often did I \nsee that, a 4-1-4 decision. The Supreme Court held that the Army Corps \nof Engineers overreached by asserting jurisdiction under the Clean \nWater Act over nonnavigable wetlands in that case.\n  On behalf of the four-member plurality comprised of Justices Roberts, \nScalia, Thomas, and Alito, Justice Scalia wrote that ``waters of the \nUnited States'' include nonnavigable wetlands only if there is an \n``adjacent channel [that] contains a . . . relatively permanent body of \nwater connected to traditional interstate navigable waters.'' That is \nstretching it pretty far, is it not?\n  So at least there is a stream that is supposed to be connected to \nsome navigable water. Further, Justice Scalia concluded ``the wetland \nhas a continuous surface connection with that water . . . '' So there \nis at least some continuous connection to the water. It does not just \ndry up for most of the year and only have water in it when it rains \nheavily. The opinion of Justice Scalia is, to me, in line with the \nClean Water Act's original meaning of the term ``navigable waters.'' \nThe key swing vote was provided by Justice Kennedy, who joined Justice \nAlito, making five votes and remanding the Army Corp's decision in that \ncase but under a different interpretation of ``waters of the United \nStates.''\n  With Justice Kennedy's concurrence, five of the nine Justices \nrejected the idea that the EPA and the Army Corps have unlimited \njurisdiction over anything wet in the United States. As a result, in \n2008, EPA, under the Bush administration, issued a guidance document \nexplaining the Agency interpretation of ``waters of the United States'' \nin light of the Supreme Court decision. That document did not seek to \nexpand the Agency's decision or change existing regulations.\n  Rather, in that guidance document, the Agency adopted a reasonable \nview that recognizes the need for a significant nexus to traditional \nnavigable water, so a connection at least to navigable water. We call \nthem branches in Alabama. Sometimes they dry up. They are not a \nnavigable stream. However, soon after entering office, the Obama \nadministration sought to replace that 2008 guidance document, expanding \ntheir power with a guidance document, even though there had been no \nintervening Supreme Court case. They submitted a guidance document that \nwould vastly expand the Agency's assertion of jurisdiction and power.\n  A second problem with EPA's approach is that their approach is \ncontrary to the principle of cooperative federalism, which was \nfoundational to the enactment of the Clean Water Act from the \nbeginning. That principle recognizes that there must be a strong \npartnership between the Federal Government and the States if we are to \naddress environmental challenges.\n  One way the law recognizes this approach is through giving a limited \nrole for the Environmental Protection Agency. The States have the \nprimary responsibility for protecting water quality, not the EPA. Water \nis primarily to be protected by the States. This was contemplated in \nthe Clean Water Act.\n  But EPA's guidance document would seek to involve EPA in a wide range \nof permitting actions that should otherwise be left to the States. I \nbelieve this guidance is based on a false premise that water quality is \nprotected only by EPA--only they can be trusted, not the people who \nlive in the States where the water is. So, finally, EPA is \ncircumventing Congress by using a guidance document to rewrite the law.\n  For those reasons, I will be continuing to work on this issue. It is \nvery important in our EPW Committee. I would urge the Senate to act to \nstop the power grab by EPA. As I noted, a majority of the Senate has \nvoted for that but did not receive the 60 votes required for passage.\n  I am disappointed, to date, that Ms. McCarthy has not agreed to push \nback and back down from the aggressive bureaucratic power grab that has \ncome to define this administration's use of EPA. There are many more \nproblems within the Environmental Protection Agency. They are \nunelected. They have used powers Congress has never explicitly given \nthem to regulate virtually every aspect of the American economy.\n  I hope Ms. McCarthy will do a good job if she is given this position, \nbut she serves at the pleasure of the President. She will take her lead \nfrom him. It is quite clear he has no intention of constricting the \nexpansion of EPA power but indeed is behind expanding it to the fullest \nextent he can achieve. That is very troubling.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                             Student Loans\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, over the last few weeks many of my \ncolleagues have been engaged in a very serious, very deliberate, very \nthoughtful attempt to deal with the issue of student loan interest \nrates, which doubled July 1 for subsidized loans. They have contributed \nsignificantly in terms of trying to move this issue forward to reach a \nthoughtful and appropriate conclusion.\n  From what I have heard, under their approach--the Bipartisan Student \nLoan Certainty Act of 2013--I don't think, despite the good efforts and \ngood intentions, that they have reached the objective, which is to make \ncollege affordable for all of our students and to somehow try to \nprevent this tidal wave of student financial debt, which is in some \ncases overwhelming to so many students and families across the country. \nInstead of emphasizing the students, I think what they have done is \njust tried to shield the government from investing in those students.\n  The clear impact of the legislation that is being proposed is that it \nwill increase the cost of education for students. We were in a position \nwhere we legislatively reduced the rate to 3.4 percent. We had an \nextension for 1 year to this July. It doubled to the previous rate in \nexisting law of 6.8 percent.\n  What this proposal does is to keep the rate relatively low at first--\nalthough it goes up a bit higher than the 3.4 percent--but invariably, \nmathematically, it gets very high. They have placed some caps there--\nand that is something for which I salute the authors, their efforts to \nput caps on the different programs--but those caps are very high also.\n  The inevitability is that the one sure thing is that over the course \nof the next few years, students will pay more for higher education at a \ntime when they can afford it less and less and at a time when we need \nmore fully qualified graduates to take the jobs of this new century to \nbe competitive internationally.\n  I think we have before us, despite all these great efforts, \nlegislation that will shift more and more costs to students. Instead of \npreventing the doubling of these rates to 6.8 percent, it would \ngradually raise these rates above 6.8 percent. We might see 1, 2, or 3 \nyears of rates that are relatively below that number, but inevitably, \nmathematically, those rates will go beyond 6.8 percent, and the caps \nare rather high.\n  High school students of today will be paying a lot more for their \nstudent loans, and their families will be paying a lot more. It will \nadd to the debt of these students and their families. It will restrict \ntheir ability to become not only qualified workers in our economy but \nalso the people who drive the economy, young people who buy homes, buy \nautomobiles, and who are able, because of their skills, to earn enough \nto contribute not just to the productivity of the country but their own \nability to make purchases and keep that engine of the economy moving \nforward.\n  There is no real guess as to what level it would go up to because now \nwe are moving away from fixed rates and moving toward an adjustable-\nrate. The rates have been pegged to a 10-year Treasury bill--a rate \nthat we know is going up. It has gone up nearly 1 percent since just \nMay, and in this environment it is likely to continue to go up. The \nrate students could pay could rise much more quickly than the \nprojections even that CBO is suggesting. It could rise because of \nFederal Reserve policy. If they decide to unwind quantitative easing, \nand in such a way that rates shoot up, then those rates could spike \nvery dramatically.\n  Students and advocates have raised their voices loud and clear urging \nus not to take this kind of action. They have said that no deal is \nbetter than a bad deal. The people we are trying to\n\n[[Page S5778]]\n\nhelp are actually saying: No, that is not the kind of help we need.\n  With deep regret, I believe this is not the right approach going \nforward. What the students and advocates have asked us to do is to keep \nit at 3.4 percent. I have proposed legislation to do that for a year so \nthat we could work on some of the fundamental issues that are driving \ncosts, such as the incentives and disincentives in colleges for \ntuition; the issue of--which is separate but very important--how we not \nonly provide reasonable interest rates but how we refinance all those \nstudents who are overwhelmed by debt, how they take advantage of the \nhistorically low rates of today. All of those difficult issues are \nbeing put off. I think they should be engaged, and I think we need the \ntime to engage on those issues.\n  Unlike the approach of at least another year of 3.4 percent, the \nproposal before us would lock in about $184 billion in student loan \nrevenue. That is in the current CBO baseline. Then there is an \nadditional $715 million that this proposal would generate. All of that \nis coming out of the pockets of students and families.\n  Paying for college is tough. This legislation, unfortunately, could \nmake it tougher because it would put in a permanent structure for \nsetting student loan interest rates that could quickly result in \nstudents and parents paying more for student loans. This is not a \ntemporary fix to get us to a better place in terms of incentives for \ntuition, in terms of refinancing, in terms of letting students more \nactively and more affordably pursue college education; this is the long \nterm.\n  It is simple math. In a zero budget environment--and that is one of \nthe principles incorporated in this legislation--reducing what students \npay today means that students will have to pay more tomorrow. If we are \nassuming a 6.8-percent fixed rate over 10 years and we lower that rate, \nas this legislation does, then just do the math--it is going to have to \nbe higher to keep it zero or neutral with respect to the budget, and \nthat is what is going to happen. So we are going to have some relief \ntoday, but it will be followed inevitably by students who will pay more \nand individually have a much larger burden to bear.\n  I think we are in the position of taking steps that are going to make \ncollege more expensive at a time when we have to make it more \naffordable not only for individual families and students but for the \nfuture and success of our economy.\n  We are also departing from our past experience with market-based \ninterest rates in the Federal student loan programs. This proposal also \nlocks in historically high surcharges on top of basing the loans on a \nhigher cost instrument. Previously we were using the 91-day T-bill, and \nbecause it was a short-term note, the interest rates were lower \nrelative to the 10-year note. Now we are using a much higher baseline, \nand then we are adding historically higher premiums to that baseline \nfor graduate students and parents. So the legislation builds in \nadditional costs that we haven't used even when we had rates that were \nbased on market conditions.\n\n  Under the market-based rates that were in effect from 1998 to 2006, \nstudents benefited from historically low interest rates. These rates \nwere indexed, as I said, at the lower 91-day Treasury bill rate rather \nthan the 10-year Treasury bill rate. As I mentioned before, we already \nknow this 10-year Treasury bill rate is moving up.\n  We are making these changes from the perspective of interest rates at \nexactly the wrong time--at the bottom of the interest rate curve as it \nstarts its climb up. That argues, to me--and, frankly, I think most \npeople, if they were going to make a choice on a loan today, would try \nto pick a fixed rate, even if it was a little higher than the \nintroductory rate on a variable loan, because of the experience of the \nlast several years and because of what they are seeing all around \nthem--rising interest rates over time.\n  This year, borrowers who are repaying these loans--I am talking about \nthe loans that were made in that period of time, 1998 through 2006--\nhave an interest rate of 2.35 percent, and over the last 5 years their \nrate averaged 2.41 percent. They have benefited from the declining \nrate. They have benefited from the huge expansion of Federal Reserve \nquantitative easing. They have benefited from an economy that slowed \ndown, ironically, so that interest rates were falling. Now we are on \nthe other side of that curve, and students won't benefit from the \nmarket rates. They will actually see higher rates as we go forward.\n  We offered these rates in the context of the old program where we had \nto also subsidize banks. Today, I would think, with the banks out of \nthe picture and with the government, through direct lending, doing the \nlending, we should be able to find a solution where we can actually \nlock in much lower rates for students. This is the kind of solution \nthat will take time--the time, I believe, that we could have spent and \nshould spend by extending the 3.4 percent rate another year and looking \ncreatively and thoughtfully at a whole spectrum of issues but with the \ngoal of trying to give students and families the assurances that they \ncan afford college and also that college will be affordable in the \nsense that the cost of college will start coming under some type of \ncontrol. That takes a lot of work, and we are not doing that work \ntoday. Instead, under this proposal, we are adopting a rate structure \npermanently that, because of where we are in the economy, will \ninvariably mean that students will pay more and more each year.\n  I have mentioned before that because of the great effort of some of \nmy colleagues--Senator Manchin, Senator King, Senator Alexander, \nSenator Burr, Senator Durbin, and Chairman Harkin, I could go on and \non--there have been some improvements made in the initial version of \nthis legislation, particularly caps on individual loan programs. Those \ncaps are very high. Under the new proposal, the cap for the \nundergraduate loans is 8.25 percent, and then there are caps that go \nall the way up to 10.5 percent. Again, let's step back here. We are \nputting a cap at those levels because there is a reasonable expectation \nthat we will reach those levels. As a result, we are going from the \ncurrent law, which is 6.8 percent, to as high as--in some cases for \nparent loans--10.5 percent. This is a huge swing not in favor of the \nstudents but to their disadvantage.\n  This is why I am working on an amendment, which I hope to offer, that \nwould put the cap at 6.8 percent for all Stafford loans and at 7.9 \npercent for the parent PLUS loan.\n  Again, if we are looking at a fixed rate of 6.8 percent and we can't \ndo better than that 2, 3, 4, 5 years from now, we have to ask ourselves \nwhether we really need to make these changes or whether we should make \nthese changes.\n  If we adopt the amendment I propose, at least we are telling parents \nthey won't be worse off than current law and they will be better off--\nbecause of interest rates at the moment--in the next several years. I \nhope we can do that.\n  We are looking at Federal student loan debt that is over $1 trillion. \nThis can only mathematically increase that debt. We should be investing \nin our students, giving them the benefit of relatively low-cost loans \nso they can go to school, get on with their lives, and get our economy \nmoving again.\n  This is also an issue that goes to one of the core issues we face as \na country, and indeed it is a core issue across the globe--the growing \ninequality of income and, in a sense, opportunity in our country and \ncountries across the globe.\n  In the United States, the great engine for opportunity has always \nbeen education. If we make it more expensive, then fewer people can \ntake advantage of it. If fewer people take advantage of it, the \ninequality will grow because they won't have the chance for the good-\npaying jobs. By the way, in a competitive global economy, we could see \nour position slip because we don't have these talented people.\n  So this is an issue that strikes not only at the technical aspects of \na program, this goes to the heart of what it is that gives opportunity \nto America, and I believe it is education. I believe that if we make it \nexpensive, fewer opportunities will be available. If we make it \nexpensive, we will be less productive and less competitive.\n  I believe that despite the efforts of extraordinarily talented and \ndedicated colleagues, we can do better and we should do better. As \nsuch, I reluctantly\n\n[[Page S5779]]\n\noppose the underlying legislation. I would at least hope we could cap \nit if the amendment I offered would be accepted.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I think we are going to have a cloture \nvote in the early afternoon, and I wish to share a few thoughts. The \nnominee, Gina McCarthy, is a fine person.\n  I have been on the Environment and Public Works Committee since I \ncame to the Senate in 1994. In fact, when the Republicans were in the \nmajority, I chaired that committee, and then, as a minority, I was the \nranking minority member. So I was there when Lisa Jackson was the \nAdministrator of the EPA--someone I had a great deal of respect for. In \nfact, some of my Republican friends criticized me. I was the only one \nwho really liked her because, in spite of the fact we disagreed with \neach other philosophically, she always answered honestly, even when it \nwas uncomfortable for her to do so.\n  I remember one time I asked her a question during a hearing that was \nlive on TV, as our hearings were at that time. We were talking about \none of the cap-and-trade bills that had come up. I don't know how many \nwe have had--10 or so in the last 12 years. I asked her: If you really \nbelieve--which I don't--that CO2 is bad, it is a pollutant \nand all that--if we were to pass this cap-and-trade bill, which is \ngoing to cost in the range of between $300 billion to $400 billion--\nwith a ``b''--would that reduce worldwide emissions of CO2? \nShe said: No, it wouldn't.\n  The reason is very obvious. People hide from this. They are not \nhonest, as she is. Obviously, if we just do this in the United States, \nwhere we already have emission controls on a lot of pollutants, but \nthey don't do it in China and India, they don't do it in Mexico, then \nit is not going to reduce CO2. In fact, the reverse would be \ntrue. It would have the effect--if we only had limitations on \nCO2 in this country--of causing an increase in \nCO2 worldwide because our manufacturing base and others \nwould go where the energy is and that would be to countries such as \nChina where they don't have any controls on anything.\n  A lot of people say: Oh, well, they are waiting for us. They are \ngoing to follow our example. That is garbage. What the Chinese want to \ndo, they are waiting, anticipating, hoping, and praying we will start \nhaving restrictions on our emissions because they know our \nmanufacturing base will end up going over there.\n  Here is another thing I can remember also. One of the problems I have \nwith the United Nations is they are trying to become independent. It \njust kills them every time they have to say or do something because we \nthreaten to withhold our contributions to the United Nations. So they \nhave been attempting for a long period of time to get themselves in a \nposition where they are self-supporting and they do not have to be \nanswerable to anyone or accountable to anyone. Consequently, they are \nthe ones who started this whole global warming matter.\n  If you follow through, going all the way from the Kyoto convention of \n12 years ago and up through all these bills, all these pieces of \nlegislation, they are the ones, if that becomes a reality, we will have \nto turn to. All of a sudden they will have a source of income, so they \nwill not have to be dependent upon the United States, which pays 25 \npercent of their bills, or any of the other countries.\n  One of the things the United Nations does and has been doing for 10 \nyears or so--I guess longer than that--is they have the biggest party \nof the year in the most exotic places in the world they can find to \nhave these parties, and they invite all the countries--192 countries--\nto come to it. When they have these big conventions, the only price of \nentering is to agree with the concept of global warming and that you \nare going to start restricting your CO2. Obviously, these \ncountries are not going to do it, but it is worth lying to be able to \ngo to the party.\n  The biggest one of those parties was held in Copenhagen in 2009. At \nthat time, Lisa Jackson was the Administrator at the EPA. Quite \nfrankly, I don't wish to be disrespectful, but all those who attended \nfrom the United States--and I am talking about John Kerry, the \nPresident, Barbara Boxer, Nancy Pelosi, and all of them--had said: Yes, \nthe United States of America is going to pass cap and trade. We will be \nright there with you.\n  That wasn't true and they knew it wasn't true. So I decided to go \nthere. In fact, I went all the way there, stayed 3 hours, and came all \nthe way back, as the one-man truth squad.\n  I can recall right before I left to go to Copenhagen we had a hearing \nand Lisa Jackson was a witness at the hearing, and I said to her: It is \nmy feeling, as I leave to go to Copenhagen as the one-man truth squad, \nto let them know we are not going to pass anything over here, and since \nyou know we can't get this done legislatively, that you are going to \nhave an endangerment finding in the United States and then use that as \nan excuse to pass with regulation what you couldn't do with \nlegislation. She kind of smiled. I could tell that was going to happen. \nI said: When this happens--when I leave town and you come out with an \nendangerment finding--it has to be based on science. So what science \nwill you use?\n  She said: The IPCC. The IPCC is the Intergovernmental Panel on \nClimate Change, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is \nthe United Nations. They were formed by the United Nations. They were \nformed and stacked with scientists who were all preprogrammed to \nbelieve all this garbage, and they did.\n  Then something happened, and it couldn't have happened at a better \ntime because it wasn't but a few days after Lisa Jackson had said we \nwere going to be depending upon the IPCC. Here we were, preparing to \npass the largest tax increase in the history of America, and doing it \nthrough regulations, which was the same thing as cap and trade, only \nmore expensive, and it was going to be based on science and that \nscience was the IPCC. It wasn't but hours after that when climategate \ncame in--and all of a sudden the things we had been saying for 10 years \non the floor in talking about the scientists who had been shut out of \nthe process at the United Nations--and they were totally discredited. \nThey had cooked their science, cooked the numbers, and climategate was \nthe result. It was so bad the major newspapers in London characterized \nit as the greatest single scientific scandal in the history of the \nworld. Now, that is a big deal.\n\n  Anyway, that went on, and then they started working on doing this \nthrough regulation since they couldn't get it done through legislation. \nThe reason I bring that up is because during that timeframe, while Lisa \nJackson was the Administrator of the EPA, Gina McCarthy, the one who is \ncoming up for a cloture vote in maybe an hour or so, was the Assistant \nAdministrator of the EPA in charge of air issues. What went on during \nthat time were these huge punitive things.\n  We can forget about the greenhouse gases or the cap and trade they \nare going to be coming up with, even though that is the largest of all \nof them, they passed Utility MACT. MACT means maximum achievable \ncontrol technology. What Utility MACT does is ask the question: What \ntechnology is out there to restrict and to reduce emissions? What \ntechnology? So what they have done in Utility MACT is put a restriction \non emissions--and this was impossible technologically to achieve, but \nthe whole idea was to run coal out of business. Quite frankly, they \nwere able to get it through.\n  I remember at that time there was this little provision that isn't \nvery often successfully used, but it is called the CRA--the \nCongressional Review Act. That provision says if an unelected \nbureaucracy that is not accountable to anyone comes out with \nregulations that are so onerous, so bad that it is going to be very \ncostly and is something that doesn't make any sense, then we in the \nSenate and House can do a CRA--a Congressional Review Act. We have to \nget 30 cosponsors--30--and then we have to get a majority--51 in the \ncase of the Senate--to pass it. I did a Congressional Review Act on the \nUtility MACT, which was to cost us $100 billion and 1.65 million jobs. \nThese numbers, by the way, are not denied by anyone, to my knowledge.\n  So there we were, in a position to get this through. I got my 30 \ncosponsors and we came within 2 votes of getting it done. So the CRA is \nsomething where it does inject something to reflect the will of the \npeople, because we\n\n[[Page S5780]]\n\nare elected by the people, and we came very close to doing it. \nNonetheless, that is now a law, and there are millions of people out \nthere--right now in excess of 1 million people--who have already lost \ntheir jobs because of that.\n  Boiler MACT is the same thing--maximum achievable control \ntechnology--for a boiler. Every manufacturer has a boiler. So this \nwould do the same thing to manufacturers as Utility MACT did to coal. \nThat involved $63.3 billion and 800,000 jobs lost.\n  The next was cement MACT. That would have been--here they are on the \nchart. Cement MACT is one that would cost $3.5 billion and 80,000 jobs. \nThat is already implemented.\n  If ozone, the next one, should come up, that would perhaps be even \nmore serious than the top 3--second only to greenhouse gases--and that \nwould mean 2,800 counties in the United States would be out of \nattainment. In my State of Oklahoma, we have 77 counties. All 77 \ncounties would be out of attainment.\n  I can remember when I was mayor of Tulsa, Tulsa County was out of \nattainment. That meant we couldn't recruit jobs, we couldn't start new \nindustries, and we had to fire a lot of people who were working there \nbecause we were out of attainment in ozone emissions.\n  That had been delayed until after the election. Now that the election \nis over, they can go ahead with some of these they hadn't done before.\n  Hydraulic fracturing. I have talked from this podium I don't know how \nmany times about the President's war on fossil fuels. It is critical. \nHere we are in a position in the United States where we can be totally \nindependent of any country--the Middle East or anybody else--if we only \nwill use our own resources, but we don't do that. We are in a position \nright now where we have, in the last 4 years, increased our production \nby 40 percent because of getting into the shale areas and the tight \nformations and using hydraulic fracturing to extract the oil and gas. \nBut that is all on either State or on private land. On Federal land, \nbecause the Obama administration will not let us drill on Federal land, \nit has actually decreased by 7 percent. Is that possible, to increase \nall of our production by 40 percent except that part which is on \nFederal lands? Yes. In fact, that is exactly what has happened.\n  When they talk about hydraulic fracturing, this is something that has \nbeen regulated by the States, and there is a reason for that, by the \nway. The reason is my State of Oklahoma has different formations than \nAlaska, for example, or now with the Marcellus, going through \nPennsylvania and New York. That is different--different depths. So the \nregulation has been very successful. The first hydraulic fracturing job \nwas done in my State of Oklahoma in 1949, and there has never been a \ncase of groundwater contamination in over 1 million applications of it.\n  Again, this gets back to Lisa Jackson. I asked her that question, \nwhen I asked: Has there ever been a confirmed case of groundwater \ncontamination from hydraulic fracturing? She said: No, there hasn't \nbeen.\n  That is the kind of honesty I like in the answers we get. The only \nreason I bring that up is the President is trying to use hydraulic \nfracturing. He will stand, as he did in the joint session, and say: We \nhave an abundance of good, clean, cheap natural gas, and that is what \nwe need to be turning to, but we have to do something about hydraulic \nfracturing. We can't get to the natural gases necessary without using \nthis technique called hydraulic fracturing. So they are trying to kill \nit that way.\n  I could go on and on--this is on this chart behind me--but the only \nreason I bring this up is we do have a vote coming up on a very fine \nlady, Gina McCarthy. But we have to keep in mind when all these air \nregulations were conceived, they were done when she was the Assistant \nAdministrator of the EPA for air. These are all air regulations. So she \nis certainly more than just partially responsible for that. She was the \nengineer of all these regulations.\n  If we add up all of these regulations, the total figure we had--do we \nhave it on the chart? It was the NAM that did a study that no one has \nchallenged, where they say we now, just because of these air \nregulations--what we have done already exclusive of cap and trade--have \nlost $630 billion from our GDP and 9 million jobs have been lost.\n  That is how critical this is to our economy. That is how expensive it \nis. All these things translate into taxes. I do a calculation every \nyear. In my State of Oklahoma, the $300 billion to $400 billion would \ncost the average taxpayer in Oklahoma $3,000. Yet, by their own \nadmission, the greenhouse gas cap-and-trading CO2 would not \nreduce CO2 emissions at all. I am sure a lot of people have \nbeen notified by their manufacturers and businesses back home: We can't \nallow the increase of cost of all these regulations, so we want you to \noppose it.\n  Two votes are going to take place today. The first is the cloture \nvote. It takes 60 to pass a cloture vote. The next vote, if they should \nbe successful to have cloture, will be the vote to put her into office. \nThat would be only 51 votes.\n  I hate to say this about my fellow Senators, but I know there are \ngoing to be some Senators out there who say, I will fool the people \nback home; I will vote against her confirmation, but I will go ahead \nand vote for cloture, because they have to have my vote to reach 60. So \nthey vote for cloture, and then, to make the people at home think they \nare against all these regulations, they will vote against her. I am \npredicting that is going to happen. We will know in a couple of hours.\n  The second vote is not important. The only important vote is the \ncloture vote. The cloture vote would be the first one that comes at \n2:30 today. So you are going to see a lot of people voting for cloture \nand then end up voting against her. That is what there is to look for.\n  This will be the last time I say this; tThat is if you really want to \ndo something about the regulations and you feel she has demonstrated \nshe will not be helpful in this respect, the one important vote is \ngoing to be the cloture vote that takes place at 2:30 this afternoon.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, we are about to vote on a new Administrator \nfor the Environmental Protection Agency. I have a real problem with the \nindividual who has been nominated to direct that Agency. I will cast my \nvote shortly, but I want to take the opportunity here to talk about the \nEPA, an Agency that I think has exceeded the authority given to it by \nthis body, it has overstepped its role and its bounds, and has had an \nenormous negative impact on my State and on our country.\n  The overreach, the regulation after regulation and rule after rule \nthat has come out of EPA may have achieved some benefit in some places, \nbut these benefits have come nowhere close to exceeding their costs.\n  The Competitive Enterprise Institute totals EPA regulations at \nroughly $350 billion a year, making it the single most expensive \nrulemaking agency in government. This is particularly relevant now, \nbecause a vote on the new Administrator is before us and I think it is \nimportant that we focus on what the EPA's impact has been over the last \n4 or 5 years and what the EPA rules and regulations have imposed upon \nour economy.\n  Whether it is the war on fossil fuels, whether it is the war on the \nproduction of energy, or any of a number of other issues that have been \nbrought forward through their rules and regulations, the EPA has had a \nserious negative impact on our ability to be an energy-secure, energy-\nefficient, and low-cost Nation.\n  Our country has taken great strides to improve air quality over the \nyears. To date, the utility industry has spent over $100 billion in \ncapital investment for air pollution controls which have resulted in \nsignificant declines in emissions. By singling out these providers and \neffectively prohibiting coal-fired electricity generation, the \nadministration is putting our economic well-being, grid reliability, \nand American jobs at risk.\n  Air quality and energy production don't have to be at war with each\n\n[[Page S5781]]\n\nother. They don't need to be incompatible. We can, and must, achieve \nboth. But we also must have some flexibility and transparency from this \nadministration and its rulemaking agencies if we are going to \naccomplish that goal.\n  I applaud my colleague from Louisiana, Senator Vitter, for his \npersistence in seeking responses from the EPA. So often this Agency \nresearches benefits and secondary benefits but does not reveal a \ndetailed economic analysis of the true costs associated with their \nrules. Senator Vitter's work in getting a commitment from the Agency to \nconvene independent economic experts to examine the Agency's economic \nmodel is something that I believe needs to be done.\n  I think the administration should welcome this, because we are trying \nto find that balance between putting people back to work, getting our \neconomy moving again, and imposing, yes, necessary health and safety \nregulations but not one at the cost of the other. These can be \ncompatible.\n  Senator Manchin and I, on a bipartisan basis, have sought not to give \nthe electricity coal-fired plants across our country--and many of which \nare in our respective States--an excuse not to comply with the clean \nair laws, but simply to extend the time in which they are mandated to \nbring new pollution control measures onboard. Some of these industries \nare halfway through the production process of doing this. They have \nmade the commitment. All we asked for was a temporary waiver--nothing \nto do with achieving the goal, but a temporary waiver to give them a \nlittle more extra time to comply and finish what they were doing.\n  Some of these coal plants were in the middle of installing extremely \nexpensive air pollution control measures. Yet the hard and fast rule \nimposed upon them by the EPA--with no ability to give them a waiver for \ndemonstrated good-faith effort to comply--and because they couldn't get \nall the construction and implementation made by a certain date, they \nnow have to switch to another source of fuel or shut down. Many had to \nshut down, at significant economic impact not just to my State but to \nmany States, particularly those States that have heavy manufacturing \nthat needs a lot of electricity.\n  So while I don't want to go into great detail in terms of which \nspecific regulations and rules ought to be looked at and given some \nflexibility, I want to make the larger point that if we are sincere \nabout dealing with issues and policies that will allow us to achieve \neconomic growth and put more people back to work, we need to have \nresponsible rules and regulations--not this onslaught of rules and \nregulations that continues to come out of EPA, some of which seem \ndriven by ideology rather than by effective cost-benefit analysis--with \nthe understanding that we are in a precarious economic time. We have a \nlot of people out of work, and that delay or an advancement of time in \nwhich to achieve certain regulations and a sincere evaluation on the \nbasis of what is the real cost-benefit of going forward with this ought \nto be imposed.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Pancreatic Cancer\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need to \ninvest in research to fight pancreatic cancer.\n  Just six percent of Americans diagnosed with pancreatic cancer live \nmore than 5 years--6 percent.\n  Sixty-five percent of folks with colon cancer survive that long; 90 \npercent live 5 years with breast cancer and nearly every man diagnosed \nwith prostate cancer is still living after half a decade.\n  Why is pancreatic cancer a different story? It is because we do not \nhave a reliable way to detect this deadly disease in its earliest \nstages.\n  As a result, nearly 40,000 Americans will die from pancreatic cancer \nin 2013. But despite being a leading cause of cancer death, pancreatic \ncancer receives far less support--and far fewer research dollars--than \nother forms of cancer.\n  This must change because support for cancer research saves lives.\n  Supporting pancreatic cancer research will lead to breakthroughs in \ntreatment. It will lead to needed advances in early detection. And it \nwill show the American people that we are serious about saving the \nlives of their closest family and friends.\n  For Leigh Enselman, it will make it clear that we are standing with \nher and her mother.\n  Leigh lives in Bozeman, MT while her mother, who suffers with \npancreatic cancer, lives in Seattle.\n  Leigh works hard to support her mom during chemotherapy and radiation \ntreatments. She also volunteers her time to support pancreatic cancer \npatients and raise awareness about the disease.\n  But Leigh worries what is in store for her and her mom. She prays \nevery day that her mom will be among the 6 percent of pancreatic cancer \npatients who survive.\n  Myra and Ed Pottratz from Great Falls, MT know what Leigh and her mom \nare going through. Together, they are fighting Ed's cancer. Ed recently \nhad surgery, but the tumor spread to his liver. He now faces painful \nchemotherapy treatments, something far too many cancer patients \nexperience.\n  Supporting pancreatic cancer research will also honor the life of \nLanny Duffy of Darby, MT.\n  Lanny and his wife Deborah were not born and raised in Montana. They \ncame west from Chicago so in retirement Lanny could be closer to his \nbeloved fly fishing. But Lanny was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, \nand he only got to enjoy the State he loved for a year before the \ndisease took his life.\n  Congress took a big step forward last year to support folks such as \nLeigh, Ed and Lanny. We passed the Recalcitrant Cancer Research Act. \nThis bill--supported by a bipartisan majority--increased research into \npancreatic cancer. It gave the National Cancer Institute the tools it \nneeds to tackle this lethal disease.\n  But the sequester is taking back our promise. The sequester cut \nfunding to the National Institutes of Health--which does most of our \ncountry's research into this form of cancer--by 5 percent.\n  That 5 percent cut eliminated 250 million dollars-worth of funding \nfor cancer research.\n  Talk about sending mixed messages. One moment, we are telling Leigh \nand her mom that we're fighting cancer with them. The next moment, we \nare telling them they are on their own.\n  Just last week, the Senate Appropriations Committee restored the \nfunding that was cut by sequestration so NIH could beat pancreatic \ncancer. This is my first year as a member of the subcommittee that \nfunds the NIH. It has been an honor to work with Chairman Harkin to \nensure that the NIH and medical research all over the country is well \nfunded by this bill.\n  But this measure--which I wholeheartedly support--has a long way to \ngo before becoming law.\n  We need to rein in our spending. We need to get our budget in order. \nBut we cannot hurt our neighbors in the process. We owe that to people \nlike Leigh, and Ed and Deborah. For their sake, we need to find a \nresponsible solution to our budget problems.\n  Folks around the country are skeptical right now in Congress' ability \nto make smart, responsible decisions.\n  And cutting funding to fight deadly diseases like pancreatic cancer \nonly adds to their frustration. That is because they know it will slow \ndown the progress we have made toward detecting pancreatic cancer early \non and saving lives.\n  This disease touches me and my office personally. Two members of my \noffice have lost relatives to pancreatic cancer. Chances are I am not \nalone in this regard. Chances are each of my Senate colleagues knows a \nLeigh, an Ed, or a Deborah.\n  In support of those we know, those we've met, and those we love, I \nurge my colleagues to support increased research into pancreatic \ncancer, to support the Appropriations Committee's recent NIH budget \nplan, and to stand for smart and responsible measures to balance our \nbudget.\n\n[[Page S5782]]\n\n                        Government Surveillance\n\n  I also want to talk about the need to protect our civil liberties and \nour Constitutional rights. When I joined the Senate in 2007, I was a \nbit of an outlier. But I am not referring to my status as the only \nworking farmer in the Senate or to my haircut.\n  I am referring to my opposition to the Patriot Act.\n  Montanans elected me to the U.S. Senate after I made it clear that I \ndidn't just want to fix the Patriot Act, I wanted to repeal it. I still \ndo. But recent events have focused many of us in the Senate on my \nconcerns with the Patriot Act and some parts of the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act or FISA.\n  A recent national survey reveals Americans are shifting in favor of \nreining in government surveillance programs. In fact, since 2010, \nnearly twice as many Americans say government spying is going too far \nand restricting our civil liberties.\n  Folks like me are now mainstream. Support for repeal--or at least \nchanges--to the Patriot Act is up among both Democrats and Republicans.\n  As a result, more Members of Congress are expressing their concerns \nabout the extent of the government's spying programs, and the Nation is \nfinally talking about how to fundamentally balance our civil liberties \nwith our national security.\n  Of course, the recent NSA scandal is at the heart of Washington's \nnewfound interest in standing up for our civil liberties. And lawmakers \nshould be outraged, because the secret collection of our phone and \ninternet records is a perfect example for what happens when government \nignores our Constitutional rights. We didn't need Edward Snowden to \ntell us the Federal Government is circumventing our Constitutional \nrights.\n  Whatever one thinks of Edward Snowden--and I think what he did was \nwrong and hurt our country--the reality is that he was not blowing the \nwhistle on illegal activities. He disclosed information about programs \nthat were perfectly legal.\n  And that is the problem. The NSA is using bad laws to undertake \nmassive data collection on American citizens.\n  Just over 2 years ago--here on the Senate floor--I said the Patriot \nAct is compromising the very liberties and rights that make our Nation \ngreat and respected around the world.\n  At that time I said the Patriot Act gives our government full \nauthority to dig through our private records and tap our phones--\nwithout even having to get a judge's warrant.\n  It did not take rocket science to figure it out, it is in the law.\n  And now it is time to have a full, open debate about the Patriot Act \nand the FISA amendments.\n  The Patriot Act is an invasion of privacy. The FISA Amendments Act is \nno better.\n  Both are an affront to our freedoms, and--to me--they raise \nconstitutional questions. I am not a lawyer, so I do not know if they \nare unconstitutional. But I can tell you that they do not represent the \nvalues and the privacy rights of law-abiding Americans.\n  That is why I have voted to repeal it. And it is why I voted against \nextending the FISA Act in December.\n  But we can not go back in time. We can only move forward and take \naction now to better balance our civil liberties with our national \nsecurity.\n  To get our intelligence policy back on track in a way that is true to \nour values, here is what we need to do:\n  First, we have to fix our laws. We need to do more than just put the \ngovernment's spying programs under the microscope and we need to rein \nthem in.\n  That is why I am also supporting a bill that makes it harder for the \ngovernment to obtain phone call records and forces Federal officials to \nprove that sought-after records can be linked to a foreign terrorist or \ngroup.\n  The Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee wrote this bill. I \ncertainly would not call the senior Senator from Vermont an outlier.\n  We must have increased transparency and accountability about how \nthese programs are being implemented and why they are being run the way \nthey are.\n  That is why I joined with one-quarter of the Senate to call on the \nDirector of National Intelligence to justify the collection of \nAmericans' phone and personal information. It has been 3 weeks, and we \nhave not gotten a response yet.\n  We need answers, and they need to be truthful.\n  That is also why a bipartisan group of Senators has once again \nintroduced legislation to declassify important Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court opinions.\n  Americans deserve to know what legal arguments the government is \nusing to spy on them, and this bill will do just that.\n  We need a functioning Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board. \nThe Privacy and Civil Liberties Board is charged with making sure \nnational security measures do not violate the rights of law-abiding \nAmericans. For years, seats on the panel sat empty.\n  But soon after I called on the panel to investigate the NSA, board \nmembers found themselves at the White House meeting with the President.\n  That is a good thing. And they need to continue to have the access \nand the ear of the President to do their job effectively on behalf of \nthe American people.\n  It is a new day. Times are changing. The American people are taking a \nhard look at what Federal officials are doing in the name of national \nsecurity, and what it means for them and their families. The question \nis whether this body will live up to the American people's new \nexpectations.\n\n  After the attacks of September 11, Congress approved the PATRIOT Act \nand our Nation went to war. We stamped out Al Qaeda cells and put \nterror on its heels around the world.\n  Then and now, our military and intelligence communities performed \nbravely. They are better trained, stronger, smarter, and more effective \nthan any other force on the planet. I thank them for their service. \nFrom top to bottom, I thank each and every one of them for doing their \ndifficult jobs each and every day.\n  Congress did not give our intelligence community a blank check to \nwalk all over the constitutional rights of law-abiding Americans and \nMontanans. I am confident American citizens can be kept safe without \nsnooping around in our private lives.\n  Americans and Montanans are concerned about the government right now. \nThey have seen the recent news about the government missteps, overreach \nand scandals and wonder where Washington's priorities lie. They wonder \nwhether anyone is looking down the road to see where this country is \ngoing.\n  Every measure I have outlined today will help restore the balance \nbetween national security and privacy, and every one of them has strong \nbipartisan support.\n  I will keep working with Democrats, Republicans, Independents, and \nanyone else to defend our civil liberties and for the ideals of our \nFounding Fathers. Freedom, privacy, and a government controlled by the \npeople are the principles on which our forefathers founded our Nation, \nand they are the principles that led Montanans to send me to Washington \nand represent them.\n  Our constitutional rights are what make us the greatest country in \nthe world, and we cannot let them be taken away one new law at a time.\n\n\n                           Pancreatic Cancer\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, today I wish to remember all those we \nhave lost in Connecticut and throughout the Nation due to pancreatic \ncancer and other types of recalcitrant cancers, and to raise awareness \nof the importance of continued efforts to bring about more effective \ntreatments and widespread education to fight this pernicious disease.\n  Lisa Hayes was a journalist from Connecticut. She worked for an \ninternational nonprofit organization that worked to get medications and \nhealth care to developing countries. She was the editor for Doctors \nwithout Borders, and a fearless advocate for the underdog. Lisa was 45 \nwhen she was diagnosed with stage IV pancreatic cancer. Her symptoms \nwere dry skin and fatigue. Being a working mother of two and it being \nwinter, Lisa thought nothing of it. When she was diagnosed, she was \ntold ``There is no hope. Go home and kiss your kids good-bye.'' Lisa \ntried an oral chemotherapy regime, but it was unsuccessful. She lived \nfor 4 months afterwards, then died four days\n\n[[Page S5783]]\n\nshy of her 46th birthday, leaving behind a husband and two children \nunder the age of 12.\n  While overall cancer incidence and death rates are declining, that is \nfar from the case for pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer is the \ndeadliest of all major forms of cancer, having the lowest 5-year \nsurvival rate of only 6 percent. It will strike more than 45,000 \nAmericans this year--73 percent of whom will die within a year of their \ndiagnosis.\n  Recalcitrant cancers, such as those that develop in the pancreas, are \ndifficult to detect. By definition, these cancers have low survival \nrates; and, sadly, we have not seen substantial progress in diagnosing \nor treating these diseases. For these reasons, I was proud to cosponsor \nthe Recalcitrant Cancer Research Act, which was passed and signed into \nlaw near the end of the 112th Congress. In addition to other \nprovisions, this law authorized the National Cancer Institute, NCI, to \nimplement a strategic plan to battle pancreatic cancer. This law takes \nfurther steps to establish a committee to advise the NCI on research \ngoals for pancreatic cancer, and also requires the creation of an \neducation program to train health care providers, patients, and their \nfamilies on issues specifically related to this devastating disease.\n  As required by the Recalcitrant Cancer Research Act, the NCI recently \nreleased its report on these issues. The report includes four \nrecommended research initiatives as identified by a working group of \nleading health experts. I applaud the NCI for taking this important \nstep, and I look forward to continuing to support the agency's work in \nthis area. Efforts such as these are vital to improving our health, and \nI invite my colleagues to join me in their support.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUNT. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I rise to discuss my hold on the nominee \nwhom we will be voting on this afternoon, Gina McCarthy. Gina McCarthy \nis the President's nominee to lead the Environmental Protection Agency. \nThere is no doubt that there are lots of things to be concerned about \nwith the Environmental Protection Agency.\n  There are 12 States that just sued the EPA over the Agency's sue-and-\nsettle tactics. There are rules and regulations, if they are allowed to \ngo forward, that will raise energy prices. There are lots of issues to \ndebate, and we will continue to debate those.\n  This is about a more targeted area. I have only been in the Senate \nfor a couple of years. What is a hold? A hold is put on a nomination \nwhen there is a problem that needs to be solved or for a problem that \njust can't be solved. Some may object to the nominee or some may object \nto something that has happened that should permanently disqualify that \nparticular individual from any job.\n  This is a hold on a problem that could be solved. This is one of the \nthings that individual Senators still have the ability to do. This is \nnot intended to stop a nominee but to at least make it more difficult \nfor that nominee to be confirmed. It is one of the things we can do to \nsay: Let's do what we can to solve this problem. It has to be \ndefensible. In my view, it has to be something a Senator is willing to \ntalk about. We did away with the so-called secret holds in the Senate \nin recent years so we know who has the hold. If anyone wants to know, I \nsuppose they could almost always find out why they have it.\n  In my case, I would like the administration to do something they \npromised to do in February; that is, to reach an agreement on a set of \nfacts that relate to a longstanding project in my State of Missouri. \nLet me be clear: I am not asking anybody to spend any money. I am not \nasking anybody to approve a project. This is about a draft statement \nthat is out there that the government keeps arguing with itself about.\n  There is an old saying that you are entitled to your own opinion, but \nyou are not entitled to your own facts. I don't care what opinion any \nof these agencies have. That is outside of this discussion.\n  What I care about is agreeing on the facts. There is a project in the \n``bootheel'' of Missouri. Actually, for anyone who has a map of the \nUnited States, you can get pretty close to where the project is \nlocated. The bootheel in southeast Missouri is pretty easy to find on \nany map that identifies the States. Anybody can get very close to this \nproject. The St. Johns Bayou-New Madrid Floodway Project has been mired \nin bureaucratic infighting and unresolved government disputes for at \nleast 30 years.\n  In fact, 1954 was when the government said they would take care of \nthis levee problem. They said it again in 1986. It is as if every 32 \nyears we need to renew our commitment to do this job.\n  Congress authorized this project. It would add 1,500 feet of levee. \nIt would close a gap in the levee system around the river; 1,500 feet \nis not a long space. It can be measured by football fields or however \nelse you want to measure it. We are talking about 1,500 feet. We are \ntalking about how that would work.\n  After years of going back and forth over the first environmental \nimpact statement, the Army Corps of Engineers produced a second draft \nof this statement in July of 2011. What do I mean by agreeing to the \nfacts? One of the facts in dispute in any levee flood is always \nwetlands. In this case, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said there \nwere 500 acres of wetlands. The Environmental Protection Agency said: \nNo, there are 118,000 acres of wetlands.\n  Obviously, this is a pretty big floodway if 117,500 acres of it could \nbe in dispute as to whether it is wetlands, and that is a pretty big \ndiscrepancy. These are two government agencies. There is only one \ndefinition for wetland. Is it 500 acres or is it 118,000 acres? I think \nthe U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service had some number somewhere in the \nmiddle, but that is no way to solve disputes.\n\n  The facts are the facts. What meets the definition? This draft of the \nenvironmental impact statement--people could comment on this draft if \nit became public. It is not a final statement. I have been asking for a \ndraft statement. It has now been out there for 2 years. In March of \n2012, I sent two letters to try to address this problem. One letter \nwent to the Fish & Wildlife Service and one was sent to the EPA.\n  In June of 2012, the Army Corps withdrew the revised statement due to \nongoing concerns with these other two agencies.\n  In September of 2012, Congresswoman Emerson--who is from that \ncongressional district in Missouri--and I sent a letter expressing our \ndisappointment about all of this foot dragging.\n  In October of that year, we visited the project to try to figure out \nwhat the problem could be for all the farm families and those who would \nbe impacted as well as others who want to be sure they have the right \nkind of flood protection.\n  In December of 2012, Missouri colleague Senator McCaskill wrote the \nheads of the EPA and Fish & Wildlife demanding that they reach a \nresolution in 30 days and that they present this new environmental \nimpact statement in 60 days. So now there is a Republican Senator and \nDemocratic Senator asking the government to quit arguing with itself \nand come up with an agreement on the facts. This is about the facts, \nnot about opinions.\n  In July of 2013, the Army Corps withdrew its revised draft statement \nonce again and the EPA said: We are going to take this all the way to \nthe White House for review.\n  In February of this year, 2013, Senator McCaskill and I had a meeting \nin her office with representatives of these agencies. During that \nmeeting in February, all the agencies agreed to reach an agreement \nsurrounding the facts by March 15.\n  They came up with this deadline. Senator McCaskill and I didn't ask \nthem when or how quickly they could do this. They said: We will get \nthis done by March 15.\n  Unfortunately, on March 15 they called and said: We couldn't quite \nget it done by March 15. So I said: OK. One way I can have some impact \nis with this nominee for EPA. So the next week, March 18, I placed a \nhold on her nomination.\n\n[[Page S5784]]\n\n  Frankly, I thought this would be a couple of weeks. After all, 1 \nmonth earlier they thought they could do this in 2 weeks. Now I am \nsaying: OK, let's get this done. They can't just promise Members of the \nSenate that they are going to do something and then decide to ignore \nit. As a result, nothing has happened yet. The March 15 deadline has \ncome and gone.\n  In May of 2013, I went to the project site again. I met with Gina \nMcCarthy that month to express my concerns over this bureaucratic \ninfighting. I contacted the White House to attempt to get this \nsituation resolved for southeastern Missourians and people in \nneighboring States who benefit from this floodway as well. \nUnfortunately, we are still waiting.\n  Ten days ago, the EPA, the Corps, and Fish & Wildlife sent a letter \non the status. They said there was a common understanding. I wrote back \nand said: What does that mean? Does that mean you don't understand how \nyou don't agree with each other? What does it mean? Can we get these \nfacts determined?\n  So far I have heard nothing. I want to know whether the Natural \nResource Conservation Service agrees with the new definition. The EPA \ncame up with a new definition of farmable wetlands. No one I know has \nheard of this before. It is not defined anywhere in law. It is just at \nthe EPA.\n  Finally, has there been an agreement with the Corps, EPA or Fish & \nWildlife on whether proposed mitigation actions are both valid and \nadequate? Of the 471 comments that came out, 115 of them concerned \nmitigation, and most of them came from EPA. I am referring to internal \ncomments. We have not gotten to a point where a citizen can say: I like \nthis project or I don't like it, and here is what I think is wrong with \nit. I sent a response to the administration on July 9 with more \nquestions.\n  The most pressing question is: Why can't we manage the government? \nThe administration on this issue said: The government is big and \ncomplicated and we can't expect the President to run everything in the \nadministration. Actually, I do expect the President to do that. The \nConstitution expects the President to do that.\n\n  Again, as I conclude, let me just say I will vote to not go forward \nwith her nomination, although I may not prevail. This is a reasonable \nquestion. I am not asking the Federal Government to spend a dime or to \napprove construction; I am just asking them to agree to the facts. One \nwouldn't think that would be hard to do, but in this case it has been \npretty hard to do.\n  The government needs to stop arguing with the government. I am going \nto keep fighting for the people I work for to have a right to know what \nthe facts are and what we should be considering as we decide whether we \nshould move forward with this project. The Federal Government said, in \n1954 and again in 1986, here is something we are going to do and here \nis the authorization to do it. Let's find out if it really works by \njust putting the facts on record.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I support President Obama's nomination of \nGina McCarthy to be the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental \nProtection Agency, EPA. The work of the EPA is critical to protecting \nAmericans from toxic air emissions, polluted waters, harmful chemicals, \nand contaminated soils. EPA restores habitats enabling flora and fauna \nto flourish, improving drinking water supplies, enhancing our quality \nof life, and providing recreational opportunities. Since the EPA was \ncreated in 1970, the air we breathe is safer, our waterways are \ncleaner, and hundreds of thousands of contaminated acres have been \ncleaned up.\n  This progress needs to continue, and Gina McCarthy would be an \nexcellent leader to protect our treasured environment and improve \npublic health, while at the same time promoting economic growth. I had \nthe pleasure of meeting with Gina McCarthy this April and we had a \nfrank discussion about commonsense environmental regulations. For \nexample, I support strong ballast water regulations to protect the \nGreat Lakes from destructive invasive species, but a patchwork of \nvarious State regulations would be impossible for shippers to comply \nwith and thus we need a single strong federal standard. While Ms. \nMcCarthy was not able to comment on this specific matter, she assured \nme that she would move forward with environmental regulations that are \npractical and workable. Her work on other EPA regulations, including \nthose addressing toxic air pollutants from power plants and boilers, \ndemonstrate that she has a history of doing this, of listening to all \nstakeholders and addressing valid concerns.\n  Gina McCarthy has worked at the local, State, and Federal levels on \nenvironmental issues, as well as with coordinating policies related to \neconomic growth, energy, transportation and the environment. She has \nled EPA's air office, overseeing a number of important regulations to \nreduce toxic pollutants in the air we breathe. She is committed to \nserving the public. I support her nomination because we need the type \nof leadership she has already demonstrated: willingness to work on a \nbipartisan basis, commitment to responding to what science tells us, \nand understanding the economic consequences of regulations.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, this is a very important day for the \nAmerican people. We are beginning to give President Obama the team he \nwants to work with. I am not suggesting everyone here likes his \nchoices, but he won the Presidency. Every President, whether I agree \nwith him or disagree with him, or whether I agree with her or disagree \nwith her, or whether it is a Republican or Democrat, every President \ndeserves a team in place.\n  If I were to ask people how important clean air is to them or how \nimportant it is that when children breathe the air they don't wind up \nwith asthma, I will tell my colleagues that 80 percent of them will say \nit is very important. If I were to ask them how important clean water \nis, the quality of our lakes and streams and oceans, I would say they \nwould think it over and they would say it is pretty important. That is \nwhere we get our fish. That is where we go to recreate. That is a \nlegacy we want preserved.\n  If I were to say: How about safe drinking water, do you think you \nought to be nervous when you or your child drinks your water out of the \ntap--and, sadly, fewer and fewer people are drinking water out of the \ntap--I would suggest to my colleagues, knowing what the American people \nknow and seeing how smart they are about what bacteria could be in the \nwater, I would say they would think it very important--at least 80 \npercent.\n  If I asked them: How important is it that Superfund sites that had \ndangerous toxins on them be cleaned up? How important is it to clean up \nSuperfund sites that are dangerous to the health of our children and \ndangerous to the health of our families? Brownfield sites that are \ndangerous to our families, how important is it that those responsible \nfor making that mess clean up their mess so those sites can be restored \nand they can be, in fact, built upon again? I would say vast majorities \nwould say it is very important.\n  If the Presiding Officer ever goes to visit a school and talks to the \nkids and asks them to raise their hands if they have asthma or someone \nthey know has asthma, I guarantee too many kids will raise their hands. \nWe know asthma is the greatest cause of school absences.\n  So why am I starting off discussing the EPA by raising these issues \nof clean air, clean water, safe drinking water, Superfund sites, \nbrownfield sites? Because the Administrator of the EPA will be carrying \nout the laws that make sure our air is safe, our water is safe, our \ndrinking water is safe, and the Superfund sites are cleaned up. That is \nwhat the Administrator of the EPA does.\n  For the longest time, we have had a holdup of Gina McCarthy, who was \nnominated by our President, not because people don't respect her and \nnot because people don't like her. The woman served five Republican \nGovernors, one Democratic President. She got a unanimous vote in her \ncurrent position as Deputy Administrator. They did it because, frankly, \nI don't think they like the Clean Air Act. I don't think they like the \nSafe Drinking Water Act. I don't think they like the Clean Water Act. I \ndon't think they like the Superfund Act. So instead of\n\n[[Page S5785]]\n\ngoing at it head on, because they know they don't have a chance to \nrepeal those laws because the American people revere those laws, they \ngo about it in a roundabout way: Oh, I didn't get the papers I wanted. \nI didn't get the questions answered. Well, how about 1,000 questions \nbeing submitted to Gina McCarthy and she answered every one.\n  So all of this holdup--stopping this woman from getting the promotion \nshe deserves--isn't about her--it isn't about her. It is about the fact \nthat they don't like the Environmental Protection Agency, even though \nit was created by a Republican President named Richard Nixon and \nsupported by every President, Democratic and Republican.\n  Then, of course, there is the issue of climate change. There is the \nissue of too much carbon pollution in the air, which we are seeing the \nresults of almost every day. The Administrator of the EPA will be \ncarrying out the President's vision for how to get that carbon \npollution out of the air, and she will be good at it.\n  When 98 percent of scientists tell us climate change is real, it is \nreal. I guess 2 percent of scientists are still saying tobacco doesn't \ncause cancer. Well, bless their hearts, that is their right, but I am \nnot following them, nor are the American people following the 2 percent \nof scientists who say tobacco isn't linked to lung cancer. And, thank \nGod, we are seeing more and more Americans walk away from smoking. But \nI have to tell my colleagues, for years we had doctors paid by the \ntobacco industry and scientists paid by the tobacco industry to say, \nunder oath: We don't see the connection. The tobacco officials \nthemselves actually said that. I will never forget the sight of one \nafter the other: We swear to tell the truth. There is no connection.\n  Today we had a hearing in the environment committee. It was a \nterrific hearing about the science of climate change. The Republicans \nbrought forward two witnesses. They were not scientists; they were \neconomists. They said doing anything about climate is terrible for the \neconomy.\n  I have to tell my colleagues, I looked at the organizations they \nrepresented: funded by the Koch Brothers, funded by ExxonMobil. That is \na fact. So this isn't about Gina McCarthy, this whole holdup where we \nhad an agency with an acting head--a very good guy, but we need someone \nin this position who is going to have the gravitas of this confirmation \nto head the agency.\n  If we look at the lives that have been saved because of the Clean Air \nAct, and if we look at the economic prosperity that came about because \nof the Clean Air Act, it would shake people up. Over a 200-percent \nincrease in the GDP as the Clean Air Act was being carried out; jobs \nand jobs and jobs created after the special interests told us it would \nbe calamitous.\n  Do my colleagues know what we found? And we will find it out, as \nPresident Clinton just said yesterday at a ceremony where I was proud \nto be present. When we clean up the environment and we do it in a good \nway, a wise way, a way that Gina McCarthy will lead us toward, we will \ncreate hundreds of thousands of good jobs. We will bring alternative \nclean energies to the table that will wind up saving money for the \nAmerican people.\n  I drive an electric hybrid car, and I hardly ever go to the gas \nstation. It cost a little bit more in the beginning, but after a few \nyears I had it paid for, and after that our family is saving money. I \nwas able to put a solar rooftop on my home. Granted, it is in \nCalifornia where the Sun shines a lot. The fact is, in a few years, I \nwill be reaping the benefits of it because I do not pay for \nelectricity.\n  So we can reap the benefits. Instead of telling people it is going to \nhurt them, the truth is it is going to help them.\n  I will never forget when the wall came down in Eastern Europe. I \nvisited that wall in Germany. When that wall came down, the first thing \nEastern European countries did was clean up the air. People could not \nsee. The truth is, if a person can't breathe, they can't work, period. \nIn China, they can barely see, and they are going to undertake a huge \ncleanup of their environment.\n  So this battle about Gina McCarthy is not about Gina McCarthy; it is \nabout the fact that a lot of our colleagues simply believe we would be \nbetter off without an EPA. If my colleagues look back at the lives \nsaved because of the EPA, if they look at the jobs created because of \nthe EPA, my colleagues would think, I believe--if they really looked at \nit without a prejudice--they would agree with the American people who \nsupport the Environmental Protection Agency in numbers that are 70 \npercent, 80 percent.\n  So to say that I am relieved we are having this vote is an \nunderstatement. I am so happy to see this moment come, when we will put \nin place an Administrator for the EPA who will do us all proud, who \nwill be fair to all sides, and who will move our Nation forward in both \ncleaning up the environment and creating good jobs in the process.\n  I thank the Chair very much. I don't see anyone else here, so I note \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Under the previous order and pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays \nbefore the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will \nstate.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the nomination of \n     Regina McCarthy, of Massachusetts, to be Administrator of the \n     Environmental Protection Agency.\n         Harry Reid, Barbara Boxer, Benjamin L.

On this vote, the yeas are 69, the nays are \n31. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  Pursuant to S. Res. 16 of the 113th Congress, there will now be 8 \nhours of debate equally divided in the usual form prior to a vote on \nthe McCarthy nomination.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I rise to talk about the substance of \nthe Gina McCarthy nomination. It is a very important nomination. It is \na very important Agency that has been taking dramatic action in the \nlast 4 years. Gina McCarthy is not some outsider coming to this anew. \nShe has been at the center of that very dramatic, and in my\n\n[[Page S5786]]\n\nopinion, draconian action, in a methodical march against affordable, \nreliable energy.\n  The EPA has crafted and will continue to put forward multiple rules \nto stop the use of coal as part of our energy mix, to increase prices \nat the pump, to create energy scarcity at a time when energy \nindependence is within our reach. This is a crucial debate. Because \nwhile the President says he is for all of the above, while he says he \nwants to pursue that strategy, the particular policies of EPA have done \nthe opposite. It has not been all of the above. It has been a war on \ncoal. It has not been energy security, it has been increasing prices at \nthe pump. It has not been energy independence, it has been trying to \nmuffle the progress we can make to produce good, reliable, affordable \nenergy right here in our country.\n  The EPA will play a pivotal role in the execution and implementation \nof the President's recently announced climate action plan. With this \nedict from the President, EPA is further emboldened and will strengthen \nits grip on the Nation's economy.\n  EPA's significant rulemaking agenda is not only estimated to cost \nbillions of dollars, but it suffers from inherently flawed foundations. \nIn the recent past, this has necessitated the reconsideration or \nrevision of multiple rules after they were promulgated--for instance, \nreconsideration and revisions to the mercury and air toxics rule, the \nboiler MACT rule, the cross-State air pollution rule, the oil and gas \nNSPS rule, and the Portland cement rule. So there alone you see the \ndeep flaws in what they have been doing, because they have had to back \nup and clean up the mess.\n  EPA needs to show the public the truth and the ultimate consequences \nof its actions. The extent of the economic harm of the rules put \nforward during the last 4 years and those they are talking about for \nthe next 4 years must be known to the public not only through FOIA \nrequests, not only through congressional inquiries, not only through \nmore accessibility to information which we have won, but by being \nhonest with the American people about their policies.\n  Let me talk about a few areas where this is particularly important.\n  First, greenhouse gas regulation. The regulation of greenhouse gases \nalone is expected to cost more than 300 to $400 billion a year, and it \nwill raise energy costs across the board.\n  EPA will continue to issue regulations industry by industry until \nvirtually all aspects of the American economy are constrained by \nregulatory requirements and high energy prices.\n  When the EPA IG investigated the basis upon which EPA moved forward \nwith a greenhouse gas regulation endangerment finding, the IG found \nthat EPA did not follow its own peer-review procedures to ensure that \nthe science behind the decision was sound. This is a very important \npoint, and we need more and different action from the EPA.\n  Directly related to that are the so-called social costs of carbon. In \norder to justify this regulatory regime that I am talking about, put \nforward by the administration, including unilateral action to be \nundertaken as part of the climate action plan, for the second time in \njust a few years an interagency working group crafted, behind closed \ndoors, a monetized estimate of the damages caused by emitting an \nadditional ton of CO2 in 1 year. These estimates are \nreferred to as the social cost of carbon.\n  The problem is that the EPA completely jiggered the methodology \nbehind that to obtain a certain result. In fact, OMB has guidance on \nhow to go about this. They have specific guidance on what discount \nrates to use. And the IWG failed to use their normal recommended \ndiscount rate for a very simple reason: it wouldn't get them to the end \ngoal, the objective they needed to get to. This is more evidence of the \nserious problems we have with EPA.\n  Another important category is the ozone national ambient air quality \nstandards. Beyond the regulation of greenhouse gases, EPA will propose \nrevisions to the ozone national ambient air quality standards which, if \nset between 60 and 70 ppb, would cost potentially hundreds of billions \nof dollars annually. EPA itself estimates now that this would cost \nbetween 19 and $90 billion annually and would likely find 85 percent of \nU.S. counties designated ``nonattainment.'' This is a big deal. EPA \nneeds to talk honestly with the American people about where it is \npushing us.\n  Overreach. In general, this Agency's overreach has been historic. For \ninstance, in an attempt to smear the idea of hydraulic fracturing, EPA \nhas carried out a campaign against that process in an attempt to \njustify unnecessary Federal regulations that would usurp the successful \nand traditional regulation of that process.\n  The EPA, in three separate instances--Pavillion, WY; Dimock, PA; and \nParker County, TX--came out with outlandish and unsubstantiated claims \nof contamination and ridiculous claims of dangers, such as houses \nexploding due to hydraulic fracture. In all three of those cases, EPA \nhas been forced to walk away from their baseless claims and withdraw \nfrom their investigatory witch hunts.\n  There is yet another example of improper action and complete \noverreach and mismanagement of existing programs--the renewable fuel \nstandard. While that fuel standard, in my opinion, is inherently flawed \nand may be in need of outright repeal, EPA is in charge of its current \nimplementation. It is not taking action while a crisis mounts under \nthat current implementation.\n  As renewable fuel mandates increase each year while demand for \ntransportation fuels decreases, refiners are forced to blend more \nbiofuels into a gasoline and diesel pool that is shrinking. We are \nhitting a blend wall. It is a mounting crisis. It is right before us. \nEPA is managing--or I should say mismanaging--this existing program. \nEPA has existing powers to do something about it so we don't hit the \nblend wall, so we don't cause unnecessary spikes in prices at the pump, \nand it is not happening.\n  Those are the highlights--or I should say the low lights. Those are \nsome of the obvious areas where this Obama EPA--with Gina McCarthy as a \nkey player--has acted to the detriment of the American people, jobs, \nthe economy, and our future.\n  It is for those reasons that I continue to have profound concern with \nthis direction at EPA. As I have said, the present nominee is not an \noutsider. She is not new. She does not have no element of involvement. \nShe has been at the very heart of many of these matters as head of the \nclean air program. For those reasons, I not only express my strong \nreservations, I will vote against the nomination of Gina McCarthy.\n  I urge my colleagues to look long and hard at the record of this EPA. \nIt has been a job killer. It has slowed economic recovery, and it \nthreatens to do even more damage. I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  I yield back my time and invite others who would like to speak to \ncome to the floor immediately.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I yield back all remaining time.\n  I understand the Republican side has yielded all time, and I would \nlike to see us get to a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, all time is yielded back.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Regina McCarthy, of Massachusetts, to be Administrator of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative called the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Mississippi (Mr. Wicker).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNET. Madam President, I ask to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Commemorating the Aurora Tragedy\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Madam President, on Saturday, July 20, Colorado will \ncommemorate a solemn anniversary because a year ago, almost exactly to \nthe day, in Aurora, CO, a theater full of people, who at that moment \nwanted nothing more than to escape the heat and enjoy a movie with \ntheir family and with friends, found themselves in the middle of a \nsenseless and violent tragedy. A gunman opened fire and took 12 lives a \nyear ago, innocent people, loved by family and by friends. He \nphysically wounded scores of others.\n  Days later, as this photo shows, thousands of Coloradoans attended a \nvigil hosted by the city of Aurora. We shared tears and prayers. We \nalso resolved to support each other, to heal, and to always remember \nthose who lost their lives--which is what brings me here today.\n  Since that time, we have continued to see an outpouring of support \nall across Colorado and, for that matter, all across the United States \nof America for those we lost, their loved ones, and for the city of \nAurora. The grace and courage of the families and survivors affected by \nthis terrible tragedy serve as a powerful reminder to all of us of the \nresilience of the human spirit.\n  Today we remember the victims, victims such as Jessica, an aspiring \nyoung journalist; Rebecca, a mother of two who joined the Air Force \nafter high school; and Veronica Moser Sullivan, age 6, who had just \nlearned to swim and loved to play dressup.\n  We also remember the acts of heroism and the resolution demonstrated \nby so many Coloradoans in the aftermath of this tragedy, people such as \nMatt McQuinn, who threw himself in front of his girlfriend on the night \nof the shooting, saving her life; and the brave first responders and \nvolunteers who helped save lives and comforted those in shock and \nheartbreak.\n  We remember the city of Aurora and the State of Colorado, which has \nonce again come together to help one another through unspeakable loss \nand heartache.\n  At a recent service of over 3,000 people at the Potter's House, an \nAurora-based church, Rev. Chris Hill told those in attendance that ``We \nbelieve morning is coming to Aurora. Aurora means the dawn.'' I think \nthat captures the spirit of resilience and toughness that characterized \nAurora, my beautiful State of Colorado, and these United States of \nAmerica.\n  Before I leave the floor, I want to read once again the names of the \nvictims in Aurora: Jon Blunk, AJ Boik, Jesse Childress, Gordon Cowden, \nJessica Ghawi, John Larimer, Matt McQuinn, Cayla Medek, Veronica Moser, \nAlex Sullivan, Alex Teves, and Rebecca Wingo.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Coal in America\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, weeks and months ahead and maybe even for \nyears to come, we will be debating President Obama's latest global \nclimate proposal. It is crucial that this debate be based on crystal \nclear facts and not clouded by political ideologies on either side.\n  So, starting today, I plan to deliver a series of speeches on energy, \nand I plan to start with coal, which I know is no surprise to the \nPresiding Officer. Coal is America's greatest energy resource. I think \nit is important to lay out the facts about coal for several reasons.\n  No. 1, coal is America's most abundant, most reliable, and most \naffordable source of energy, and it will be for decades to come.\n  No. 2, the coal industry and its supporters have been falsely \nportrayed by opponents as monsters who have done something wrong, that \nthey value money over health and the environment.\n  No. 3, I think the American public has some basic misconceptions \nabout coal and how important it is to keeping our economy growing and \nour Nation secure.\n  I think that because I was recently asked: If coal is so \ncontroversial, then why don't we as a nation just use more electricity? \nThe question shows that, basically, people don't understand where their \nelectricity comes from. When we turn the lights on, over 40 percent of \nthe people depend on coal. Most of this industry and this country has \nbeen built on the back of coal and what coal has produced.\n  I didn't know how to respond to the person who asked that. It was one \nof those rare moments when I was at a loss for words. Just imagine \nstanding there and being asked: Why would we continue to keep mining \ncoal? Why wouldn't we just use more electricity?\n  I guess what I should have said was this: When we surf the Internet, \nwatch TV or play video games, when we charge a cell phone or turn on an \nair-conditioner or plug in our hybrid car to charge it, we are using \nelectricity, and there is a good chance that electricity came from \ncoal.\n  Coal has a distinguished past. In fact, one can't tell the history of \nAmerica without telling the history of coal. It fueled the \nindustrialization of America in the 19th and early 20th centuries, \nmaking us what we are today: the richest and most powerful Nation in \nhistory.\n  Coal also has a distinguished present. It is responsible for 37.4 \npercent of all electricity generated in the United States today--more \nthan any other source of energy.\n  Just as important, coal has a distinguished future ahead of it. The \nU.S. Department of Energy says it will remain\n\n[[Page S5788]]\n\nthe dominant fuel for electricity generation in our country at least \nthrough 2040.\n  Despite so many attempts to kill it, coal is critical to meeting the \nfuture energy needs of America. In other words, we can't make it \nwithout coal.\n  Coal has the longest and perhaps the most varied history of all \nfuels. It has been used for heating since the caveman. It was once \nprized as the best stone in Britain by Roman invaders who actually \ncarved jewelry out of it. Native Americans used it long before the New \nWorld settlers to bake their pottery, and blacksmiths have used coal to \nforge tools and all kinds of metal objects at least since the Middle \nAges. In fact, a deep, rich vein of coal runs through all of human \nhistory and not just American history. Given all the blame it gets for \ncarbon pollution today, it is worth remembering that coal was \nuniversally regarded as a carbon treasure.\n  It is difficult to exaggerate the importance of coal to both the \nAmerican and British economies in the 19th and 20th centuries. Coal was \nthe fuel that fired the Industrial Revolution. In the popular \nimagination, the industrial revolution is cotton mills, railways, \nsteamboats, engines, and factories. But at the core of the industrial \nrevolution was our use of energy, and the energy that powered the \nmills, the railroads, the steam engines, and the factories was coal. In \nfact, when James Watt invented the steam engine, he used coal to make \nthe steam to run his engine, making it possible for machinery to do \nwork previously done by humans and animals.\n  But perhaps the most important role coal played in the industrial \nrevolution was in the making of steel--the predominant building \nmaterial of the time. In 1861, when the country was torn by Civil War, \nfactories used coal to produce steel for the guns, the bullets, and the \ncannons that preserved this Union.\n  By 1875, coke, which is made from coal, replaced charcoal as the \nprimary fuel for iron blast furnaces to make steel. With the rise of \niron and steel, coal production increased by 300 percent during the \n1870s and early 1880s. By the early 1900s, coal was supplying more than \n100,000 coke ovens, mostly in western Pennsylvania and northwestern \nWest Virginia.\n  In the 1880s, coal was first used to generate electricity for \nfactories and homes. Long after homes were being lighted by electricity \nproduced by coal, many of them continued to have furnaces for heating \nand stoves for cooking that were fueled by coal. I can remember as a \nyoung person at my grandparents' home, I would always stoke the fire at \nnight and bank up the coal so it would be warm all night long.\n  Of course, political, economic, and intellectual conditions also \ncontributed to the industrialization of America. Representative \ngovernment, capitalism, and the free expression of new ideas all played \ntheir part. But at the heart of this sweeping industrial revolution, a \nprofound transition from hand production to machines, was because of \ncoal.\n  The first coal miners in the American Colonies were likely farmers \nwho dug coal from beds exposed on the surface and sold it by the \nbushel--by the bushel. In 1748, the first commercial coal production \nbegan from mines around Richmond, VA. By the late 1700s, coal was being \nmined on what was known as Coal Hill. Now it is known as Mount \nWashington in Pittsburgh, PA. The early settlers there used coal to \nheat their homes, but they also carried it in canoes across the \nMonongahela River to provide fuel for the military garrison at Fort \nPitt.\n  Coal was first discovered in what is now West Virginia by German \nexplorer John Peter Salling in 1742 in what is now Boone County. I have \nto wonder how hard it was to discover coal in West Virginia because \ncoal occurs in 53 of West Virginia's 55 counties.\n  As early as 1810, the residents of Wheeling--once a part of Virginia \nand now a treasured part of West Virginia--used coal from nearby mines \nto heat their homes. By 1817, coal began to replace charcoal as a fuel \nfor the numerous salt furnaces on the Kanawha River. But it was not \nuntil the mid-1800s that there was extensive mining in West Virginia.\n\n  The coalfields in southern West Virginia opened in the 1870s, and \nmany of them owed their success to the coming of the Chesapeake and \nOhio Railway.\n  Of course, you cannot talk about coal without talking about coal \nminers--the bravest and most patriotic men and women I have ever met in \nmy life. A lot of Americans only know the TV and movie stereotypes of \ncoal miners, so they do not always give miners the respect they \ndeserve. The fact is that they deserve the same respect as our military \nveterans because they go down into the mines for the same reasons our \nveterans took up arms--to protect this country. It is not just a job, \nit is a calling, it is a way of life, even an act of patriotism in the \ndefense of this great country, and to tell you the truth most of the \ncoal miners I meet in West Virginia are also military veterans.\n  Coal miners are vital to the security of this Nation. That was never \nso clear than in World War II when Franklin Roosevelt nationalized \nAmerica's coal mines--it was that important to us.\n  In a fireside chat in 1943 explaining his actions, Franklin Delano \nRoosevelt said:\n\n       A stopping of the coal supply, even for a short time, would \n     involve a gamble with the lives of American soldiers and \n     sailors and the future security of our whole people.\n\n  That was the President of the United States in 1943.\n  A stopping of the coal supply is still a gamble with the future \nsecurity of our country.\n  My own family first came to America to work in the mines back at the \nturn of the 20th century. Growing up in the small coal-mining town of \nFarmington, I saw just how proud and courageous all these miners were. \nIn 1968, after the horrific Farmington No. 9 mine disaster that claimed \n78 victims, including my uncle, I experienced the healing strength of \ncoal-mining families.\n  Working conditions and living conditions were difficult for miners in \nthe early days, but they did their best to make a living and provide \nfor their families. They fought and struggled for everything--first \nalone, then as union members led by the legendary John L. Lewis, the \nlion of labor. Lewis pleaded the case of the miners in what was once \ndescribed as ``the thundering voice of the captain of a mighty host, \ndemanding the rights to which free men are entitled.''\n  If you ever have any doubt about the courage of coal miners, read the \nscribbled last words of one of the miners who died in the mining \naccident at Sago, WV, in 2006. I was Governor at that time. In the \npitch black of the mine, the miner, Mr. Martin Toler, Jr., wrote:\n\n       Tell all I'll see them on the other side. I love you. It \n     wasn't bad. Just went to sleep.\n\n  Can you imagine? They were all sitting in that area knowing what \ntheir fate would be.\n  From the very beginning coal mining was tough and demanding. It still \nis. But today it is also safe and efficient, and it is even high-tech. \nIn the 1880s coal miners were learning how to use mules and donkeys to \nhaul coal through the mines. Today they are training in robotics, \nautomation, and positioning technologies. And the pay is good--starting \nout around $60,000 a year, sometimes even starting at as much as \n$80,000 a year.\n  Coal mining provides more than 20,000 direct jobs in West Virginia at \nan average wage above $79,000 per person, generating more than $1.6 \nbillion in income, but it also accounts for another 25,500 indirect \njobs in West Virginia. The most recent available data show that the \neconomic impact of the coal industry in West Virginia equals nearly $20 \nbillion a year--$20 billion a year in my little State.\n  To the miner, coal is the energy business, so they are mystified when \nthey hear talk out of Washington about getting rid of coal, even as we \ncontinue to try to achieve energy independence. They cannot understand \nwhy their own government tries to kill the good well-paying jobs that \nsupport their families and provide the energy this country needs. And I \ncannot understand it either. I really cannot. It does not make any \nsense.\n  Coal is America's most significant source of electricity, and it will \ncontinue to be for decades to come. The United States holds the largest \nestimated recoverable reserves of coal in the world--enough to last \nnearly 300 years. Coal currently generates almost 40 percent of the \nelectricity in America, and our own Energy Department\n\n[[Page S5789]]\n\nreports that our country will get 37 percent of its energy from coal at \nleast through 2040. So it is obvious that removing it from our energy \nmix will have disastrous consequences for our economy, which is still \ntrying to get back on both feet. We need an ``all of the above'' energy \npolicy that uses every energy source we have--hydroelectric, nuclear, \nbiomass, renewables, and fossil fuels, including coal. You cannot tell \nthe history of America without telling the history of coal, and you \ncannot plan an energy future for America without coal.\n  To put it in a nutshell, there are 8 billion tons of coal being \nburned in the world today. One billion tons of coal are being burned in \nAmerica. For those who are saying we are destroying the global climate \nbecause of the coal we are burning, we burn it better and cleaner than \nmost any nation on Earth.\n  I am not a climate scientist, but I do know that the ocean currents \nand the wind currents do not start and stop in North America. I do know \nthat. And I know that if you stop burning every ton of coal in America, \nthinking you are going to save the climate of the world, when there are \n7 billion other tons of coal being burned--and it is growing faster \nthan any time in history--we have oceanfront property in West Virginia \nat a bargain for you. That is what we are dealing with today. It does \nnot make any sense at all.\n  I know I have my good friend Senator Hoeven here from the good State \nof North Dakota, which is the leading energy producer in the country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my distinguished \ncolleague from West Virginia in this discussion of an energy source \nthat is vital to our Nation, and that is coal. North Dakota, like the \ngreat State of West Virginia, is a major coal-producing State and a \nmajor energy-producing State.\n  I think my distinguished colleague from West Virginia hit the nail on \nthe head when he said we need a comprehensive energy plan in this \ncountry that is truly ``all of the above.'' We need to use all of our \nenergy resources. And different States have different types of energy, \nand every type of energy has different strengths and weaknesses. The \nkind of energy we produce in one part of the country or the source of \nproducing that energy is different than in another part of the country.\n\n  But the point is that if we take an ``all of the above'' approach, we \ncan be truly energy independent in this country, but also think of the \njobs and the economic growth that come with it. My colleague just went \nthrough how coal, for example, creates tremendous jobs, and he is \nright--good-paying jobs. So when we talk about an ``all of the above'' \nenergy approach, we are talking not just about national security in \nterms of energy independence--not depending on the Middle East or \nVenezuela or these other places for our energy; that is national \nsecurity--but it is also about economic growth and jobs and \nopportunity, a great living for families, a great way to earn and \ngenerate income for families across this Nation. That is what a real \n``all of the above'' energy approach is about.\n  So when the administration talks about an ``all of the above'' energy \nplan, they have to not just talk about it, they have to do it. It is \nnot just talking about it; it is making it happen. The way you make it \nhappen is you have a clear legal, regulatory, and tax climate that \nencourages investment, does not hold it up, encourages investment, does \nnot tie it up in redtape and regulation that prevents that investment. \nWhen you make that investment, what happens is you not only produce \nmore energy, but you deploy these new technologies that do it with \nbetter environmental stewardship.\n  So let's go back to the issue of coal. My distinguished colleague is \ntalking about coal in his State. Well, coal in North Dakota--we are a \nmajor producer of coal, and we are a powerhouse for energy in this \ncountry--not just coal but oil and gas. We do renewables, solar, \nbiodiesel, ethanol. We do wind. We do all of them. But in the area of \ncoal, we are one of the leaders in deploying these new technologies, \nand as a result we are one of 14 States in the Nation that meet all \nambient air quality requirements nationally. Think about that. Here we \nare, we are a major coal-producing State, we are a major electricity-\nproducing State, yet we are one of 14 States in the country that meet \nall ambient air quality requirements.\n  What am I saying? What I am saying is that when you empower that \ninvestment that gets that capital invested in these new technologies, \nyou deploy that technology, you produce more energy, you create great \njobs, you grow our economy, and you get better environmental \nstewardship.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Will the Senator yield for a question.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I will.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. If I may ask the Senator this, the Senator and I know \nthe facts of what we do in our States and how we do it and how much \nenergy we produce. Both of our States are energy-producing States. We \nare net exporters of energy, correct?\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Correct.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Here in Washington, in the atmosphere that you are \nlooked upon, let's say, in the atmosphere you enter into, do they \nbelieve we just throw caution to the wind and we do not care about the \nenvironment because we come from an energy State? Is that what the \nSenator is finding when he talks to other colleagues who might not know \nwhat an energy-producing State is about, but they sure like what we do?\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I would respond to my colleague, that is exactly what I \nam saying. Here we are, a major coal-producing State. We are one of 14 \nStates that meet all ambient air quality requirements. We are No. 1 in \nsurface reclamation, land reclamation--No. 1 in the country. We are \nrated right at the top in terms of our water and saving our lakes and \nprotecting our water programs.\n  That is the point the Senator is making. That is the point I try to \nmake all the time. With a States-first approach, States are the ones \nthat can not only encourage that investment but take tremendous pains \nto make sure they are protecting the environment, growing the economy, \nand taking care of people who live in those States as well. That is why \nwhat we need to do to truly have an ``all of the above'' energy plan \nfor this country is to empower States and empower that investment that \nwe are talking about for all types of energy. Do not say ``all of the \nabove'' as a Federal Government and then come up with regulations that \nprevent, block, preclude the very investment we need to deploy these \ntechnologies and produce energy from coal and other sources.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Let me ask another question. If the plan the President \nhas put forward makes it almost impossible to build another coal \nplant--and maybe shut down many in this country--is there still going \nto be a demand for our coal overseas? Will we be exporting that coal? \nIt will be burned somewhere in the world.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Again, my colleague makes a great point and a factual \npoint; that is, what we are seeing happening as a result of the redtape \nand the regulations the administration is continuing to put forward and \nis proposing again to add to in its most recent policy pronouncement on \nenergy--the net effect of that is to preclude investment, is to \npreclude not only developing new plants with the latest, greatest \ntechnologies that will help us take steps forward, exciting steps \nforward in clean coal technology, but it is forcing existing plants to \nshut down because the requirements are not feasible, they cannot be met \nwith the current technology. As you shut those plants down, you not \nonly lose the energy, lose the jobs, lose the economic growth here at \nhome, but the coal then is still mined and now exported to other \ncountries, where it is consumed in those other countries that have \nlower standards than we do.\n  And think--and think--if, instead, you empower the kind of investment \nin technology I am talking about in this country, other countries would \nfollow us, so that then when they use their coal, they use these new \ntechnologies as well, and on a global basis you start to actually \nreduce emissions and produce better environmental stewardship.\n  Again, I would turn back to my colleague for his thoughts.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Let me just say this to the Senator. I found out today--\nthe\n\n[[Page S5790]]\n\ninformation I received today was most disturbing from this standpoint: \nWe all know that if we could develop and have a partnership with our \ngovernment--with the EPA, with the Department of Energy--of finding the \nlatest, greatest of technology that helped us still be able to use the \nmost abundant resource--and the resource that is in the most demand for \nthe whole world, correct--if we could do that, then we could truly make \na difference in the global climate--we truly could--worldwide.\n  I found out today--I am going to make sure these figures are \naccurate--that there is $8 billion. So the administration can tell me \nand you: Senators, guess what. We still have $8 billion for clean coal \ntechnology in a line item for the Department of Energy.\n  Guess what. That $8 billion has been line-itemed since 2008. Not one \nproject has been approved for which to use the money. I do not know if \nyou found that. We have not had the technology perfected on a \ncommercial basis for carbon capture sequestration. You have a coal-to-\nliquid plant, I believe. It has worked well for how many years?\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I would say to my colleague, he is exactly right. He hit \nthe nail on the head. We are talking about clean coal technology and \nencouraging development in clean coal technology. But to do it, we have \nto have regulations that are attainable and feasible that encourage the \nkind of investment we are talking about.\n  The project the Senator is referring to is the Dakota Gasification \nCompany, which has been operating now in our State successfully for \nyears. It actually takes coal and converts it to synthetic natural \ngas--natural gas. That natural gas then goes into a pipeline, goes for \nall different uses, and meets the CO2 requirements the \nadministration is talking about attaining right now because it is \nnatural gas.\n  So it meets that natural gas standard. The coal, we burn. Then we \ncapture the CO2, we compress it, put it in a pipeline, and \nit goes into the oilfields for a tertiary or secondary recovery. So we \nare also producing more oil for mature oilfields. That is an example of \nthe technology and the capital investment and kind of regulatory \nenvironment that encourages technology development to not only produce \nmore energy, more jobs, and growing the economy, but as my colleague is \npointing out, better environmental stewardship.\n  That is how to get it done, not just in this country but globally. So \nthe Senator is exactly right.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I want to ask my friend this question: Does he believe \nhe could have built that plant in North Dakota today under the \nregulations that the EPA and this administration were to put in front \nof him?\n  Mr. HOEVEN. This is exactly the point. We need these kinds of \nprojects. Work with us as States to empower that kind of development, \nnot shut it off. The Senator is exactly right.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. What we are saying is how many people would think in \nWest Virginia we have one of the largest wind farms east of the \nMississippi? How many do you think really understand that? They think \nwe are all just a one-horse show. We have wind, we have gas, we have \ncoal. We have hydro and biofuel. We are all in. We are trying to use \nevery resource we have the best we can.\n  All we are asking for is a partnership. It is so hard to find. The \npeople cannot understand. There is an old saying back home: You cannot \nlive with me, and you cannot live without me. I guarantee you will live \na lot better with me than you will without me.\n  This country cannot live with us today and cannot live without us, \nbut they have lived pretty darn good and will live a lot better if they \nwill work with us than against us. I think that is what we are seeing. \nOur little States are doing the heavy lifting. Our little States have \ndone the heavy lifting. We are providing the energy this country needs. \nWe are providing the economic opportunities to compete globally. If \nthey continue to overregulate to the point they strangle us, they are \nstrangling the economics of this country.\n  I am just praying to the Good Lord they will listen to us.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I would say to my distinguished colleague, I have been to \nWest Virginia. It is an absolutely beautiful State. It is breathtaking, \nwith its hills and valleys and bridges over rivers. It is just a \ngorgeous, beautiful State.\n  As my distinguished colleague was saying, what we are talking about \nis an opportunity. We have a real opportunity to do this and do it \nright, but we have to get the Federal Government to work with us, \nwhether it is the great State of West Virginia, the great State of \nNorth Dakota, or across this country. And it is not just in coal. It is \nin all of these different types of energy. But you have to work with \nthe States. You have to take a States-first approach that empowers \nthem, that unleashes the entrepreneurial spirit of this country. That \nis what we need, not a big regulatory maze that nobody can get through. \nWe are talking about common sense that empowers us to do things that \ncan make a big difference for this country.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. The only thing I would say to my good friend is, we are \na Democrat and a Republican from two energy States. It is not \nbipartisan. Energy should have no partisanship. Energy basically is \nsomething we all need and we all use. When you open that refrigerator, \nyou need that energy to keep it cool. When you go into a house out of \n100-degree weather, you need to be cool and comfortable. You need \nenergy as a basic quality of life. That has basically made us different \nfrom most every Nation.\n  Every developing nation today is trying everything they can to \ndeliver what we take for granted. All we are asking for is for our \nPresident--he is my President, he is your President, he is all of our \nPresident. We want to work with him. We want him to be our partner. Do \nnot be my adversary; be my ally. Work with me. We can do it. But we \nhave to be serious about it.\n  If there is $8 billion sitting on the sideline at the Department of \nEnergy, and you are telling me you are going to use that for clean coal \ntechnology, let's start using it. Let's be a leader of the whole world \nand show the other 7 billion tons of coal that is being consumed in the \nworld how you can do it and do it better. I think that is really what \nwe are saying.\n  To my good friend from North Dakota, I appreciate so much the \napproach he has been taking, a most commonsense, a most reasonable, \nresponsible approach. We have been friends for a long time. We were \nboth Governors of our respective States. We worked together. We tried \nto solve problems. It is exactly what we are still doing here in the \nSenate. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I would like to thank my distinguished \ncolleague not only for his work on energy--he is already recognized as \nan energy leader in this body--but also most recently for student \nloans. He has taken a bipartisan lead on student loans that I believe \nhas produced a great product, which I am pleased and proud to \ncosponsor, and on which I believe this body will come together next \nweek and pass.\n  I think if we pass it, the House will take it up and pass it right \naway. It is so important for students, so important for our students \nand their families. It is just such a great example of what we can do \nworking together. I think the good Senator from West Virginia does this \nso well. I thank him. Whether it is energy or student loans or just a \nlot of other issues, I want to express my deep appreciation and my \nfondness for working with him on these important issues.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 minutes on \nanother very important issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             The Farm Bill\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I rise today to speak on an issue of great importance to \nour country, and one that we need to act on and we need to act on now. \nThat is the farm bill. We in the Senate have passed a strong farm bill. \nIt saves $24 billion to help reduce our debt and our deficit. It \nstreamlines our farm programs to make them more efficient and more \nusable for our farmers and our ranchers. It ensures that our farmers \nand ranchers continue to have good risk management tools that they need \nto manage their operations, particularly enhanced crop insurance which \nis so important for our farmers and ranchers.\n  Now the House has also passed a farm bill and sent it over to us in \nthe Senate. So we have it. I rise today to urge\n\n[[Page S5791]]\n\nmy colleagues to join with me and form a conference committee with the \nHouse now to get this farm bill done for our farmers and ranchers--not \njust for our farmers and ranchers but for the American people. This \nreally is about serving the American people, and it is about making \nsure that we continue to have the highest quality, lowest cost food \nsupply in the world.\n  That means every single American benefits from good farm policy. We \nneed to move on this bill. We need to act. The current farm bill \nexpires September 30. We are already operating under a 1-year \nextension. It is time. We need to get going. We need to get this done. \nWe need a long-term farm bill in place for our farmers and for our \nranchers.\n  As I said right now, all Americans benefit from the highest quality, \nlowest cost food supply in the world. But the farm bill is more than \njust a food bill, it is a jobs bill as well. Right now in our country \nthere is something on the order of 16 million jobs on a direct and \nindirect basis--more than 16 million jobs that depend on agriculture. \nSo businesses large and small across this great Nation depend on \nagriculture.\n  In addition, agriculture has a favorable balance of trade for our \ncountry. Let me just give you a few of the statistics. This year it is \nestimated that we will export almost $140 billion worth of ag products. \nThink of all the dollars, the revenue that comes back to our country, \nthe job creation, the economic growth, the employment, at a time when \nwe need to create more jobs in this country, $140 billion that we \nexport in food products all over the world supporting jobs and economic \nactivity in this country.\n  A favorable balance of trade helps us in terms of our financial \nsituation--a favorable balance of trade of almost $30 billion. In 2012, \nexports, more than $135 billion; in 2011, more than $137 billion in ag \nproducts from this country supporting jobs and economic activity in \nthis country, and a favorable balance of trade of more than $40 \nbillion.\n  Finally, agriculture is about more than just food. It is about fuel \nand fiber, and it is about national security. We do not have to depend \non other countries for our food supply because our farmers and ranchers \ntake care of it right here at home. So it is even a national security \nissue as well, making sure that we have the food supply that is \ndependable, nutritious, the highest quality, lowest cost in the world \nright here available to us at all times.\n  One other point I will make before I conclude; that is, our farmers \nand ranchers are stepping forward at a time when we have a deficit and \na debt, and they are doing their part to help address this deficit and \ndebt--$24 billion in savings, when the actual portion of the farm bill \nthat actually deals with farmers is actually less than 20 percent of \nthe whole bill.\n  Our farmers are stepping forward and helping the deficit with $24 \nbillion in reduction. Just think for a minute. If we can do that across \ngovernment, think of the impact it would have in terms of helping us to \nreduce this deficit and get our deficit and debt under control in this \ncountry.\n  It is time to move forward with the farm bill. The next step is to go \nto a conference committee with the House. We need to get that done. We \nneed to get that done now and get a long-term farm bill in place for \nour farmers, for our ranchers, and for this great Nation.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. WARREN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hirono). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                          Student Loan Program\n\n  Ms. WARREN. Madam President, it has been 18 days since the interest \nrate on new direct student loans doubled from 3.4 percent to nearly 7 \npercent. Students will head off to college in a few weeks and Congress \nstill has not found a way to keep their interest rates low. In \nMassachusetts, our kids, our parents, our schools are worried.\n  I want to go over the history so we are all clear about how we got \nhere. For months Democrats have argued we need to keep interest rates \nlow. We have made at least three attempts to do this. For example, I \nintroduced a bill that would have dropped interest rates on direct \nloans for 1 year to the same level at which banks borrow from the \nFederal Government, which is currently less than 1 percent. I \nintroduced that proposal because I believe the Federal Government \nshould invest in our students, not just in our biggest banks.\n  We also proposed to extend the current interest rates at 3.4 percent \nfor 2 years, paid for by closing tax loopholes, and Senator Reed and \nSenator Hagan offered a bill to keep rates low for 1 year. All three \nproposals had two features in common: They cut costs for students, and \nthey gave us some short-term breathing room to take on bigger problems, \nincluding how to refinance $1 trillion in outstanding student loan \ndebt, and how to reduce the overall costs of college for all our \nstudents.\n  When we brought the last two proposals to a vote, they won by a \nmajority, but they didn't pass because the Republicans filibustered \nboth bills. We could have kept rates low, but the Republicans, every \nsingle one of them, voted to block that. Instead, Republicans put \ntogether their own long-term plan. It was an amazing plan. According to \nofficial government accounting, it would have generated $184 billion in \nprofit that the government is already projected to make by doubling \ninterest rates on student loans over the next 10 years; and then the \nRepublicans would have added another $16 billion in new profits.\n  That is billions in pure profit--profit after we have accounted for \nthe cost of money, after the cost of administering the loan, and after \nthe cost for bad debt losses. All those profits would be made off the \nbacks of our kids who are trying to get an education.\n  So here we are, 18 days past the July 1 deadline, and students are \nbeing hurt because Republicans filibustered these reasonable plans, \neven though the plans had support from a majority of Senators.\n  Chairman Harkin, who has been a leader on this issue from the very \nstart, has been doing his absolute best to find a solution that \nRepublicans would not filibuster so when students start taking out \nloans in a few weeks they won't be the ones to pay for Republican \nobstruction. Others, such as Senator Jack Reed, Senator Stabenow, and \nthe majority leader, have also worked very hard to find a solution. But \nhere is the problem: From the very beginning, Republicans have dug in \ntheir heels and insisted that any new student loan proposal maintain \nthe same $184 billion in profit the government will make on new student \nloans over the next 10 years. They insist that whatever we do, the \ngovernment must make the same profits off the students they will make \nnow by doubling the interest rate to 6.8 percent. They say: Whatever \nyou do, make sure the government makes $184 billion off our students.\n  Many Senators who care deeply about this issue, such as Chairman \nHarkin, Senator Durbin, Senator Manchin, and Senator King, have been \ndoing their best under these circumstances to help the students, and I \napplaud their commitment to our students. They have succeeded in \ngetting at least some Republicans to support a proposal that will \nresult in lower interest rates for some students for a couple of years. \nBut in the end, this is a simple math problem. If Republicans insist we \ncontinue to make the same amount of profit in the student loan program, \nthat means students in future years will have to pay even higher rates \nto make up the difference. In other words, kids who are sophomores in \nhigh school right now will end up paying even more so students who are \nsophomores in college today can pay a little less. I don't believe in \npitting our kids against each other. I don't think high school \nsophomores should pay more so college sophomores can get a little \nbreak. In fact, I think this whole system stinks.\n  We should not go along with any plan that demands our students \ncontinue to produce huge profits for the government. This is wrong. \nMaking billions and billions in profits off the backs of our students \nis obscene. The Republican position is that they refuse to give up a \nsingle dime of these profits. In fact, the latest proposal adds another \n$715 million in additional profits. The Republican position is we don't\n\n[[Page S5792]]\n\nneed to close tax loopholes or to ask wealthy Americans to pay their \nfair share because we have a ready-made profit center for funding the \nFederal Government--middle-class families who are struggling to pay for \ncollege.\n  I have the deepest respect for the Senators who have tried so hard to \ncome up with a deal for our students under these Republican conditions, \nand I have no doubt their intentions are honorable. But I can't support \nthis proposal. I have fought hard for working families and middle-class \nfamilies for nearly all of my grownup life. I fought back against \ncredit card companies that put out zero-interest cards planning to make \nall their profits in the fine print. I fought back against teaser-rate \nmortgages that promised low rates in the first 2 years but then shot up \nto rates that pushed millions of people into foreclosure. And now the \nSenate is offering its own teaser-rate loan program? A great deal for \nstudents this year and next, but every kid who borrows after that gets \nslammed. That is not the business the U.S. Government should be in.\n  I understand compromise isn't always pretty, but there is no \ncompromise in this bill. With the student loan rates now at 6.8 \npercent, if Congress does nothing, the government will make $184 \nbillion in profits. Under the new proposal, the government will make \nthe same $184 billion in profits plus another $715 million in \nadditional profits. And that all comes directly off the backs of our \nstudents.\n  I want to see these profits go down. I know we may not be able to do \nit all at once, but we need to take a step now to lower the profits we \nmake off the backs of our kids, not lock them in for the next 10 years. \nAt a minimum, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment of Senator \nJack Reed to cap the interest rate under this plan at current law. That \namendment is the only way to ensure no student ever ends up paying more \nthan they would if Congress did nothing.\n  Long term, we need to do three things: First, eliminate government \nprofits from new student loan programs, period. Second, refinance \nexisting student loan debt to reduce the profits that are crushing our \npeople. And third, reduce college costs so that American families can \npay for college without burying themselves in debt. That is what we \nneed to do. And no matter what happens with this current proposal, that \nis exactly for what I am going to keep fighting.\n  I appreciate the hard work my colleagues have done to try to defeat \nthe Republican filibuster on keeping student loan rates low, but our \nstudents are drowning under $1 trillion in student loan debt, and I \ncannot support a compromise proposal that squeezes even more profits \noff our kids.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I wanted to come to the floor while the \nSenator from Massachusetts was giving her remarks and was still here to \nsay a few things about the bipartisan student loan proposal.\n  There are a couple of things I want to point out for the Record. She \nhas made a point about our student loan programs and how much they cost \nstudents, and she is right about the basic $184 billion the government \nis going to generate over 10 years in this program. I would support a \nproposal to change that, but the fact is it doesn't have the votes to \npass.\n  Here is the reality. We are talking about this issue with a divided \nCongress. We are talking about this issue where the House of \nRepresentatives is controlled by the other party and doesn't see this \nissue at all the same way the Senator from Massachusetts and I do. \nSecondly, we are up against the filibuster rule in the Senate requiring \n60 votes. We have 54 Democrats. So this global change she has spoken of \nand referred to is one she and I could probably agree on in a hurry but \nit is not going to happen. The question is: What can we do now to help \nstudents?\n  On July 1, because we did nothing, the student loan interest rate on \nsubsidized loans went from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent. Students are now \nfacing 6.8-percent interest rates on subsidized loans. I think that is \njust plain wrong. What can we do about it? One version says nothing, do \nnothing. Don't change anything. Let the students right now continue to \npay 6.8 percent. What is wrong with that?\n  It is obvious. Basic interest rates in this country are dramatically \nlower than that. You can get mortgage interest on a home for 3 or 4 \npercent, maybe even lower in some places. In addition to that, we have \nstudents who have to make some life decisions pretty quickly. They need \nsome certainty about what is going to happen here. So I have set out to \nbring that interest rate down as quickly as possible, as low as \npossible. That is the bipartisan proposal before us. Those who vote \nagainst the bipartisan proposal are voting to keep interest rates now \nat 6.8 percent--the interest rates that have doubled from 3.4 percent \nto 6.8 percent. And the Senator from Massachusetts can tell you that \nwill generate many billions of dollars to the Treasury at the expense \nof these students. So a vote against any change, a vote for the status \nquo, is a vote to charge students $37 billion in interest over the next \n5 years.\n  I don't think that is right. I think it is far better for us to bring \nthese student interest rates down as quickly as we can and hold out the \npossibility we will revisit this again and bring them down even further \nin the future. Maybe things will change politically. But to step away \nfrom this whole conversation and say that because we can't change the \nglobal problem of student loans, because we can't bring them down to \nthe level we want, we will leave them at 6.8 percent, I don't think is \na good outcome. I don't think that is in the best interests of the \nstudents and their families. They are going to be facing more debt for \nthe next 5 years with that approach than they would under the \nbipartisan bill. And that is the one thing I would like to correct for \nthe Record. I believe the Senator mentioned that students would be \npaying more than 6.8 percent in 2 or 3 years. Under the proposal before \nus, based on projections on interest rates, the same projections \neveryone is using here, it isn't until after the fifth year that \nstudents would pay anything near 6.8 percent. It would be 6.29, 6.3 \npercent that fourth year, and then 7.0 percent the fifth year.\n  So doing nothing means students who would be protected with lower \ninterest rates, for 4 out of the next 5 years by this projection, are \ngoing to pay more. How is that a victory for students? How do they come \nout ahead in that deal? They didn't. They are paying higher interest \nrates.\n  There are some who want to hold out for something different. I would \nlike to join them, but I have watched the votes. The Senator from \nMassachusetts and I have both voted the same way. We voted with Senator \nJack Reed: Let's keep that rate at 3.4 percent--and we lost. Then he \ncame back and said: Let's try it again--and we lost. Now he is going to \npropose a 6.8-percent cap--which I can vote for--and we will lose \nagain.\n  Then you face the reality, are you going to say at that point: I \ndon't want to talk about this anymore. I just want to go home. That is \nthe end of the story. Students pay 6.8 percent. Sorry, we couldn't \nsolve it--or do you accept this bipartisan compromise, which brings the \ninterest rates down for the next 4 years below 6.8 percent? I think \nthat is a pretty easy choice. I think it is one that may not be what I \nwant to see, but I am dealing with the reality of Congress as it \ncurrently exists and what we are currently faced with.\n  In terms of the cost of education, though, the Senator from \nMassachusetts and I do agree on this part of it: Kids pay too much for \ncollege today virtually every place they go, and the interest rates are \ntoo high. But it is a dual problem. Simply addressing student loan \ninterest rates, even for 4 years, still leaves the overall arching \nissue of the cost of higher education.\n  I have had several conversations with the President over the last \nseveral days. I know he is going to come back quickly with a proposal \nfrom this administration to deal with the cost of higher education. I \nam going to support him too. I don't know the particulars. Maybe I will \ndisagree with one thing or another, but I will sure support his effort \nto bring down the overall cost of higher education. That is an \nimportant part of this conversation.\n  I just was on the phone with him a few minutes ago talking about the \nstudent loan program and what we are faced with. He doesn't like the \nchoices we are faced with, but he wants to keep\n\n[[Page S5793]]\n\ninterest rates below 6.8 percent, if we can. The bipartisan approach \nkeeps them below 6.8 percent. Voting against it means that students for \nthe next 4 years will pay higher interest rates on their student loans \nthan they have to.\n  So I would encourage my colleagues, don't dismiss the bipartisan \nplan. Vote for the alternatives. Jack Reed may offer one, Bernie \nSanders of Vermont may offer one. Vote for those. We know what will \nhappen. We will not get enough votes. But then make the hard choice: Do \nyou want students to face 6.8 percent this year, next year, and the 2 \nfollowing years or a lower interest rate, which is what this bipartisan \nplan will produce.\n  We went through a lot of negotiations on this. Many Republicans have \na much different view than we do on this whole subject. I was lucky. I \nam old enough to have benefited from the first student loan program. It \nwas a student loan program that came about because the Soviets launched \na Sputnik satellite that scared the world out of the United States. We \ndidn't have one. They sent a rocket to space and launched a Sputnik \nsatellite and we thought: Oh, my goodness. They have the bomb and now a \nsatellite and we are doomed. Congress, in a bit of a panic, created the \nNational Defense Education Act. The Presiding Officer remembers that \nand maybe she benefited from it. I did and so did the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  I borrowed money to go to college and law school and 3 percent was \nthe interest rate. I think it was a fixed interest rate, if I am not \nmistaken. One year after I finally graduated from school, I started \npaying it back in 10 installments, paying 3 percent--a pretty good \ndeal. I paid my money back, thinking now the next generation can \nbenefit from it.\n  My personal point of view is that education is worth a subsidy. So \nwhen Jack Reed comes to the floor and says a 6.8-percent cap and will \npay for it by closing a tax loophole, he has my vote. But he will not \nhave 60 votes on the floor.\n  So if that fails, what do we do next? Nothing? If we do nothing, the \n6.8-percent interest rate stays in place, and students pay it, even \nthough under the alternative they wouldn't have to face it for the next \n4 years. I think in 4 years we can do better. I think, within that 4-\nyear period, protecting them from 6.8 percent, we have a chance to do \neven better, and I would like to work to achieve that goal.\n  Congress may change. Maybe it will change with a more positive \nviewpoint toward student loans. But at the moment, we have to make a \nchoice, and the choice involves buy-in on the Republican side.\n  What they are looking for--not unreasonable but different--is to have \na long-term approach rather than a short-term approach. I would rather \nhave a short-term approach. They prefer a long-term approach. They want \nit based on some basic interest rate we can calculate, a 10-year \nTreasury rate, as applied to virtually every option we have considered, \nsave one. All the others have had a 10-year Treasury rate as a basis. \nThey say you can add to that 10-year Treasury rate what it costs for \ndefaults on loans and administration of loans, and we have tried to do \nthat. We have said to them, at the end of the day, we don't want to add \nmore money from the students and their families to pay off the deficit. \nIt shouldn't be viewed as a tax on students.\n  Here is where I would disagree with the Senator from Massachusetts: \n$715 million over 10 years is a lot of money. It is a huge amount of \nmoney. Let's put it in context, and here is the context: Each year, \nstudent loans amount to about $140 billion; over 10 years, $1.4 \ntrillion. What percentage of $140 billion is $71 million? That is 715 \ndivided by 10. I did the calculation, and it is something like .0005 \npercent. It is decimal dust: $71 million a year out of $140 billion in \nloans. I would like to get it down to nothing.\n  But here is the bottom line. This tiny fraction of decimal dust, $71 \nmillion a year, is no reason not to protect these students from 6.8 \npercent interest.\n  By my calculation, if you accept the notion we are going to go to 6.8 \npercent interest and stay there as our solution, for the time being, \nstudents are going to pay about $100 more a month, as I understand it, \non the basic loans they are faced with. That, to me, is an unacceptable \nalternative.\n  For $71 million a year, for $140 billion in loans, this tiny fraction \nof a percentage is no reason to walk away from a loan package that is \nmuch more generous to students and their families. If we can get it \ndown to zero, let's get it down to zero. But please, walking away from \nthat just doesn't make sense.\n  Here is what students will face. If this bipartisan proposal goes \nthrough, the interest rates students pay now on their student loans, \nsubsidized and unsubsidized, will go down from 6.8 percent to 3.8 \npercent. That is the immediate savings this year for students who are \nenrolling in college, 6.8 to 3.8. For students who are borrowing money, \nit is a lot. To walk away from that and say: I am sorry. If I can't get \na better deal, then students are just going to have to pay that extra 3 \npercent interest, I don't think that is a good outcome.\n  It is better for us to give this relief to the students and their \nfamilies and work to improve it. I will work with the Senators from \nMassachusetts and Hawaii to do that. But simply saying 6.8 percent \nforever is a victory is not. It is a penalty. It is a penalty on a lot \nof hard-working families and the students who come from those families. \nLet's avoid that if we can.\n\n  Let me add one particular footnote and chapter to this. The worst \noffenders when it comes to student loans and student loan defaults are \nthe for-profit colleges.\n  I always ask people to remember three basic numbers about the for-\nprofit students: What are the for-profit schools? Let me give you the \nbig names. The University of Phoenix is the biggest one, with more than \nthe combined enrollment of all the big 10 schools. The University of \nPhoenix, Kaplan University, which is owned by the Washington Post \nCompany, DeVry University out of Chicago, those are the three big ones.\n  As a category, for-profit colleges educate 12 to 13 percent of all \nthe high school graduates in this country. So stick with the number, 12 \npercent of high school grads go to for-profit schools. For-profit \nschools receive 25 percent of all the Federal aid to education. They \nare soaking up the dollars for students by a margin of 2 to 1 over the \nstudents they are taking. Here is the kicker: 47 percent of all student \nloan defaults come from students in for-profit schools.\n  What does that tell you? They are being charged too much for their \neducation, they can't get a job to pay it back, and they default on the \nloan. The bottom line on student loans is they are not dischargeable in \nbankruptcy. A student who can't pay that loan still has that debt and \nburden for a lifetime. The parent who cosigned? They are on the hook as \nwell--not dischargeable in bankruptcy. It is a lifetime debt.\n  So we have a lot to do to clean up higher education, and I hope we go \nafter for-profit schools as part of it. They need to be held \naccountable.\n  I will close by saying this. I accept the premise of the statement \nmade earlier by the Senator from Massachusetts: We can do better on \nstudent loans. I am for it.\n  We don't have the votes to achieve it. We don't have them in the \nSenate. We don't have them in the House. So the question is, will we do \nnothing? Doing nothing means that students and their families will pay \n6.8 percent interest on their loans for the foreseeable future, 1 year, \n2, 3 or 4 years. Taking the bipartisan compromise reduces the interest \nrate on student loans for both subsidized and unsubsidized loans from \n6.8 percent to 3.8 percent immediately--a 3-percent savings right now \nfor students and families--and it doesn't reach 6.8 percent until the \nfifth year from now. Between now and then we can do better.\n  Walking away from this bipartisan approach is going to mean more debt \nfor today's students and higher interest payments, and I don't think \nthat is fair.\n  So let's do the best we can to change the system, accept the \npolitical reality, and come out with the best outcome for students and \nfamilies.\n  I hope that at the end of the day we can see some change in the \ncomposition of Congress and move closer to a model we all accept.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n[[Page S5794]]\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I thank my friend from Illinois for all \nthe work he has done on this issue and so many other issues. He knows I \ndisagree with him on this and do not intend to vote for this bipartisan \nagreement.\n  He makes a good point in saying we don't have the votes. We don't. We \ndon't have the votes because we have a political party here that could \ncare less about the needs of working families and about college \naffordability.\n  I would say to my friend from Illinois that if we are going to win \nthis fight and protect college students, we have to take the fight to \nthe American people. When we work with Republicans to make college \nunaffordable, then the American people are going to say: What is the \nalternative?\n  So from a political strategy, I would say to my friend from Illinois \nwe have the people on our side. We have parents on our side and we have \nyoung people on our side. Our job is to bring forth a proposal that \nthey can demand be accepted. If we collapse on this issue, then they \nare going to be looking out and saying: What is the alternative?\n  The Senator from Illinois makes a valid point; that in the next few \nyears, in fact, it is not a bad deal. It is not as good as I would \nlike, but it is not a bad deal. That is why, as I mentioned to the \nSenator a few moments ago, I will be bringing forth an amendment to \nsay: Let us sunset this agreement in 2 years. We are bringing up the \nhigher education authorization bill. It will give us an opportunity to \ndeal with this issue of student loans and the higher cost of college in \ngeneral. Why do we need a permanent bill right now when we are going to \nbe working in the fairly near future on the higher education bill?\n  So my view is a 2-year sunset to this bill. It is not everything I \nwant, but it will protect students. If we are going to talk about \nvariable interest rates, let them at least take advantage of lower \ninterest rates.\n  What CBO is projecting is that in years to come interest rates are \ngoing to go up. According to the CBO, under this legislation, the good \nnews is that interest rates would only be, for Stafford subsidized, \n3.86; in 2014, it will be 4.6, not so good; 2015, 5.4, really not good; \n2016, 6.29, worse; 2017, 7 percent; 2018, 7.25; and, by the time we get \nto 2023, it would also be at 7.25.\n  We have a crisis right now in terms of student indebtedness. Why \nwould we want to make that crisis even worse?\n  The second point I would make is that right now it is estimated that \nthe Federal Government will earn about $180 billion in profits over the \nnext 10 years on student loans. I suggest that while I have no problem \nwith the Federal Government making profits on this or that endeavor, \nthis is not a particularly good area to be making profits because they \nare making profits off of low- and moderate-income people who want to \nsend their kids to college.\n  I can think of a lot better ways to make money, to help us with the \ndeficit, than by forcing low- and moderate-income parents and students \nto pay more than they should be paying. If we want to do deficit \nreduction, maybe we can ask the one out of four corporations in America \nthat pays nothing in taxes to start paying their fair share of taxes. \nMaybe we can address growing wealth and income inequality in a way that \nbrings us in more revenue. But it is almost a form of regressive \ntaxation to say to low- and moderate-income students and families: You \nwant to go to college, you want to make something of yourself, you want \nto make it into the middle class, you want to help make our Nation more \ncompetitive--and in a 10-year period we are going to make $180 billion \nin profits off of your desire to go to college. I think that is wrong.\n  If we look around the world, in an increasingly competitive global \neconomy what we find is that we are at the very bottom in terms of the \nkind of support we give our young people and their families to go to \ncollege. Right now in Vermont, which is a little bit higher than the \nnational average, our young people are graduating from a 4-year school \n$28,000 in debt. That is on average, meaning lower income young people \nwill graduate deeper in debt.\n  What does it mean in a difficult economy, a challenging economy, to \nstart off your adult life $40,000 or $50,000 in debt? If you go to \ngraduate school, that number goes way up. I talked to a couple of young \ndentists in Vermont last year. They had over $200,000 in debt starting \noff their professional careers--dentists, doctors, people in graduate \nschool.\n  A couple of months ago I had the Ambassador from Denmark come to the \nState of Vermont to do some town meetings with me. Do you know how much \ndebt young people who graduate college, graduate school, medical \nschool, in Denmark have? They have zero because that country and many \nother countries have made what I think is the rational conclusion that \nit is important to invest in our young people. We need their \nintellectual capital, we need the best educated workforce that we can \nget, and we want to encourage people to go to college, not discourage \nthem by high college costs.\n  I think we can do a lot better than this bipartisan bill. The danger \nwith the bipartisan bill is that the CBO and virtually all economists \ntell us interest rates are going up. If you peg your student loan to a \nvariable interest rate, and those interest rates are going up, then the \nproof is in the pudding, according to the CBO, that in a number of \nyears students are going to be paying very high interest rates.\n  Given the fact we are going to be dealing with higher education \nreauthorization within a year, which needs to tackle a whole lot of \nissues within the issue of higher education, including student loans, \nmy suggestion will be, and my amendment will be to say: Let's sunset \nthis legislation at the end of 2 years. Let's take advantage of the \nlow-interest loans and give us the time to come up with a long-term \nplan.\n  I look forward to my colleagues supporting that amendment.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, let me just take a moment to thank my \nranking member Senator Cochran and to indicate we are in fact now \nofficially sending back our Senate bill to the House and requesting a \nconference on the farm bill. This is a very important step this \nevening.\n  I thank the senior Senator from North Dakota Mr. Hoeven, who has done \nyeoman work this evening and today, and the senior Senator from Georgia \nMr. Chambliss, who has been very involved, as well as other members of \nthe committee, for working hard to bring us to this point.\n  As everyone knows, we have been working very hard on a bipartisan \nbasis in the Senate. We have produced a product that is comprehensive, \nbipartisan, balanced; that addresses the agricultural needs and \nconcerns of our country in a 5-year farm bill; that addresses food \nsecurity and conservation of our soil and land and water; bioenergy, \nrural development--we could go on and on with all of the pieces of the \nfarm bill that are so important.\n  We also do this on behalf of the 16 million men and women in America\n\n[[Page S5795]]\n\nwho work hard every day in some part of agriculture and the food \nindustry, the riskiest business in the world. Nobody else has to worry \nfor their products or services, about whether it is going to rain or \nnot today or be too hot or too cold. There are folks who do that every \nsingle day. Because of them we have the safest, most affordable food \nsupply in the world.\n  On behalf of all of them, I truly thank my committee, our committee \nthat has worked incredibly well together. As I said, we have had \ntremendous leadership shown as we have moved to this process to go to \nconference. I could thank every member of our committee, but I do \nbelieve I need to, one more time, indicate that Senator Hoeven and \nSenator Chambliss have been invaluable in this process. Senator Hoeven \nwas spending a lot of time tonight, as everyone else was getting on \nairplanes, to help be able to get to this point.\n  I certainly could go down the list. I hate to always not mention \nsomeone I may have missed because we certainly had a strong committee \npresence and a desire to continue to do great work in the Senate on the \nissue of supporting farmers and ranchers. This is a very important step \nas we move forward in what I am very confident, despite the twists and \nturns, will result in a bipartisan farm bill.\n  I commend, despite terrific odds and challenges, the chairman in the \nHouse and ranking member in the House for their efforts. I am confident \nthat working together we will be able to get this done for the American \npeople.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask consent that the following letter \nbe placed in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 18, 2013.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Senate Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: I request that I be consulted \n     before the Senate enters into any unanimous consent \n     agreements or time limitations regarding S. 162, the Justice \n     and Mental Health Collaboration Act of 2013.\n       I support the goals of this legislation and believe \n     incarcerated offenders suffering from mental illness should \n     have access to treatment. However, I believe the \n     responsibility to address this issue, as it relates to \n     inmates in state and local prisons and jails, lies with the \n     state and local governments that manage these correctional \n     systems. Furthermore, while I do not believe this issue is \n     the responsibility of the federal government; if Congress \n     does act, we can and must do so in a fiscally responsible \n     manner. My concerns are included in, but not limited to, \n     those outlined in this letter.\n       While this bill is well-intentioned, it authorizes $40 \n     million per year for five years, costing the American people \n     at least $200 million dollars without corresponding offsets. \n     Furthermore, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has not \n     yet scored the legislation. This bill authorizes new \n     permissible purposes for the existing grant program \n     including, among others, funding for veterans' treatment \n     courts, correctional facility programs, and state and local \n     law enforcement academy training. Expansion of services \n     through additional permissible purposes or new grant \n     programs, however, requires the Department of Justice (DOJ) \n     to carry out additional responsibilities. Thus, even if the \n     legislation may be implemented by existing DOJ staff, it is \n     not free of future administrative expenses or costs the CBO \n     may identify that would result in a score beyond the bill's \n     stated funding authorization.\n       It is irresponsible for Congress to jeopardize the future \n     standard of living of our children by borrowing from future \n     generations. The U.S. national debt is now over $16.7 \n     trillion. That means almost $53,000 in debt for each man, \n     woman and child in the United States. A year ago, the \n     national debt was $15.9 trillion. Despite pledges to control \n     spending, Washington adds billions to the national debt every \n     single day. In just one year, our national debt has grown by \n     $800 billion or 5%.\n       In addition to these fiscal concerns, there are several \n     problems specific to this legislation. First, while I \n     recognize both our federal and state criminal justice systems \n     must accommodate mentally ill offenders, which is a difficult \n     and costly task, it is not the responsibility of the federal \n     government to provide funding to treat this population of \n     offenders within state and local prison systems.\n       In fact, states face a much larger challenge than the \n     federal government, as they incarcerate the vast majority of \n     inmates in this country. According to the Department of \n     Justice Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), of the 1.59 \n     million total inmate population in 2011, 1.38 million are \n     incarcerated in state facilities compared to 216,362 in the \n     federal system. As a result, states also care for the largest \n     population of mentally ill offenders. The most recent BJS \n     data notes 56 percent of state inmates and 64 percent of jail \n     inmates displayed a mental health problem compared with 45 \n     percent of federal inmates. Furthermore, BJS found only 8.9% \n     of federal inmates displayed both a history and symptoms of \n     mental health problems, while over 17% of state and local \n     inmates experienced those problems. Thus, although states \n     have an awesome responsibility in this area, they also have a \n     great opportunity to lead by way of experience and example. \n     Many have done so by developing and funding their own \n     innovative ideas to enhance programs for and treatment of \n     mentally ill inmates.\n       In September 2009, the Senate Judiciary Committee, \n     Subcommittee on Human Rights held a hearing entitled, ``Human \n     Rights at Home: Mental Illness in U.S. Prisons and Jails,'' \n     in which we heard testimony from representatives of two state \n     prison systems and a state court judge who outlined the \n     different challenges faced by their states. These states and \n     others have taken action to address their mentally ill prison \n     populations, but often each tackles the problem with a \n     different approach. For example, from 2003-2007, New York \n     legislators and governors engaged in a battle over reforming \n     the slate's policies on this issue, and in 2007, Oklahoma \n     established a program to provide inmates with serious mental \n     illness a comprehensive plan for release, including access to \n     support services and medication. The program set up two \n     intensive care coordination teams in Oklahoma City and Tulsa \n     to help state inmates close to release obtain access to \n     community mental health centers, among other services.\n       There is significant diversity within the inmate population \n     both among states and between state and federal prison \n     systems, Oklahoma and New York incarcerate different types of \n     inmates with different mental\n\n[[Page S5796]]\n\n     health needs. Indeed, each addressed the problem with diverse \n     solutions--New York focused on in-prison treatment \n     alternatives, while Oklahoma chose to provide post-\n     incarceration support services. Thus, the one-size-fits-all \n     approach to treating mentally ill state and local inmates \n     outlined in this legislation also fails to address the \n     variety of state needs.\n       Second, Congress should focus instead on its duty to \n     federal inmates within the DOJ Bureau of Prisons (BOP). Over \n     the last several years, BOP costs have significantly \n     increased such that its budget is poised to surpass the \n     Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) as the largest \n     percentage of the entire DOJ budget. In its FY 2014 budget \n     submission, the DOJ requested approximately $6.9 billion for \n     the federal BOP, an increase of $295.1 million over FY 2012. \n     As a result, the BOP represents 25 percent of the entire DOJ \n     budget ($27.6 billion), with the FBI barely ahead at $8.44 \n     billion, representing 30.5 percent of the DOJ budget. \n     Congress must live up to its responsibility to conduct \n     oversight and set an example to the states by ensuring the \n     BOP's massive budget appropriately allocates taxpayer dollars \n     for all of its programs, including services for mentally ill \n     offenders who are truly in need of treatment.\n       However, S. 162 ignores the problems within the federal \n     BOP. The bill funds the Adult and Juvenile Collaboration \n     Program grant for state and local governments to use federal \n     dollars to support treatment and services for state and local \n     inmates who are mentally ill. It also expands this grant \n     program to allow funds to be used for services for veterans \n     treatment courts, training for employees of state and local \n     correctional facilities to respond to incidents involving \n     mentally ill inmates, and support for state and local law \n     enforcement orientation programs, continuing education and \n     academy curricula. By failing to address the challenges faced \n     by mentally ill inmates within the federal BOP, Congress \n     exacerbates its misplaced spending priorities.\n       Finally, I do not believe the federal government has the \n     authority under the Constitution to provide federal funds to \n     state and local governments to provide services to state and \n     local inmates with mental health problems or provide training \n     to state and local law enforcement officers. Article I, \n     Section 8 of the Constitution enumerates the limited powers \n     of Congress, and nowhere are we tasked with funding or \n     becoming involved with state and local corrections issues.\n       There is no question those who suffer from mental illness \n     should be treated appropriately while incarcerated. However, \n     I believe this issue, as it pertains to state and local \n     inmates, is the responsibility of the states and not the \n     federal government. Despite these Constitutional limitations, \n     if Congress does act in this area, like most American \n     individuals and companies must do with their own resources, \n     we should evaluate current programs, determine any needs that \n     may exist, and prioritize those needs for funding by cutting \n     from the federal budget programs fraught with waste, fraud, \n     abuse, and duplication.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Tom A. Coburn, M.D.,\n     U.S. Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/18/senate-section/article/S5796-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5796-S5797]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO AMBASSADOR JOSEPH V. REED\n\n       Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, I rise today to recognize a \n     distinguished and outstanding citizen of the State of \n     Connecticut, Ambassador Joseph Verner Reed.\n       Ambassador Joseph Verner Reed has served as a senior \n     diplomat at the United Nations for 30 years. A diplomat's \n     diplomat, he was appointed by President Ronald Reagan as \n     Ambassador of the United States of America to the Kingdom of \n     Morocco in 1981 and in 1985 as the Representative of the \n     United States to the Economic and Social Council of the \n     United Nations as Deputy Permanent Representative at the \n     United States Mission. In 1987, he was appointed Under-\n     Secretary-General of the United Nations for Political and \n     General Assembly Affairs. In early 1989, President George H. \n     W. Bush appointed Ambassador Reed the Chief of Protocol of \n     the White House, where he served until late 1991.\n       In 1992, the then Secretary-General of the United Nations, \n     Dr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, appointed Ambassador Reed Under-\n     Secretary-General of the United Nations and Special \n     Representative for Public Affairs, concluding his assignment \n     in February 1997. In June 1997, Secretary-General of the \n     United Nations, Mr. Kofi A. Annan, re-appointed Ambassador \n     Reed as President of the Staff-Management Coordination \n     Committee, SMCC, the highest internal body of the World \n     Organization. Ambassador Reed served SMCC for 12 years, \n     concluding his assignment in December 2004.\n       In January 2005, Secretary-General Kofi A. Annan appointed \n     Ambassador Reed as Under-Secretary-General and Special \n     Adviser. In February 2009, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \n     reappointed Ambassador Reed as Under-Secretary-General and \n     Special Adviser. Ambassador Reed continues to serve the \n     organization.\n       Recently, Ambassador Reed was honored with the presentation \n     of the distinguished achievement award by the American \n     Society of the French Legion of Honor. I ask unanimous \n     consent that the remarks made at that event by the President \n     of the Society, Guy Wildenstein, as well as Ambassador Reed's \n     response, be printed in the Record.\n       There being no objection, the material was ordered to be \n     printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n  Annual Meeting of the American Society of the French Legion of Honor\n\n\n   Presentation of the Distinguished Achievement Award to Ambassador \n                           Joseph Verner Reed\n\n    INTRODUCTION BY MR. GUY WILDENSTEIN, PRESIDENT OF THE SOCIETY, \n      WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 14, 2012, THE LINKS CLUB, NEW YORK CITY\n\n       Fellow Legionnaires, Dear Friends, It is always a privilege \n     and an Honor to be able to present our Society's most \n     prestigious medal.\n       On December 6, 1966, at our Society's Annual Meeting, \n     almost 46 years ago, a new resolution was adopted.\n       It was decided that a medal of the American Society of the \n     French Legion of Honor be struck and that such medal would be \n     awarded yearly for distinguished achievement to individuals \n     whom the Society may wish to especially honor.\n       According to the minutes of the December 1966 meeting, the \n     medal would be presented to persons esteemed by the Society \n     to honor their humanitarian acts for cultural, educational, \n     artistic, scientific or business objectives.\n       Today, we are gathered to present this prestigious medal to \n     such an outstanding individual, Ambassador Joseph Verner \n     Reed.\n       In some cases, such as this one, there is an added emotion \n     for me; the one I feel when presenting it not only to someone \n     I profoundly admire, but also to a friend.\n       Mr. Ambassador, dear Joseph, I have learned that your \n     ancestors arrived by means of a very small boat called the \n     Mayflower.\n       Little did they know that the land they were setting foot \n     on would become the most powerful country in the world, and \n     that their descendant would be traveling the globe on board \n     Air Force One.\n       To get back to you, you were born in New York City and \n     after graduating from Deerfield Academy and Yale University, \n     in 1961, you joined the World Bank as Private Secretary to \n     the President.\n       From 1963 to 1981 you were Vice President and Assistant to \n     the Chairman of the Chase Manhattan Bank, Mr. David \n     Rockefeller.\n       Your brilliant diplomatic career started, when President \n     Ronald Reagan appointed you Ambassador of the United States \n     to the Kingdom of Morocco in 1981.\n       Upon leaving this post in 1985, you were conferred the \n     prestigious Order of Commander of the Throne, the only time a \n     foreigner had received this honor. President Reagan then \n     appointed you as the Representative of the United States to \n     the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations and as \n     Deputy Permanent Representative at the United States Mission.\n       In 1987, you were appointed Under-Secretary-General of the \n     United Nations for Political and General Assembly Affairs, \n     and later President George H. W. Bush appointed you the Chief \n     of Protocol of the White House, where you served until late \n     1991.\n       In 1992, the then Secretary-General of the United Nations, \n     Dr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, appointed you Under-Secretary-\n     General of the United Nations and Special Represetative for \n     Public Affairs.\n       In 1997, his successor, Secretary-General Kofi Annan, re-\n     appointed you as Under-Secretary-General and as President of \n     the Staff-Management Coordination Committee, the highest \n     internal body of the World Organization, on which you served \n     for twelve years.\n       In 2005, you were appointed Under-Secretary-General and \n     Special Adviser by Secretary-General Kofi Annan, and re-\n     appointed in 2009 by the current Secretary-General, Mr. Ban \n     Ki-moon.\n       This past April you became the Dean of UN Under-Secretaries \n     General, having served at that level with various capacities \n     for almost three decades.\n       Today, you continue to serve the organization with the same \n     fervor and polished savoir-faire than when you started.\n       Along your prosperous career, you have also received \n     numerous honors and decorations.\n       You have been described as courteous, elegant and \n     knowledgeable: in my humble opinion an understatement, when \n     describing the consummate diplomat that you are.\n       When decorated Officier of the French Legion of Honor in \n     1991, you were cited for your special talents for the \n     profession of diplomacy.\n       ``Who can say how much diplomacy--and I am thinking, of \n     course, not only of United States diplomacy, but of diplomacy \n     at large--would have been lost if Joseph had not entered its \n     ranks?'' asked the Ambassador of France to the US Jacques \n     Andreani.\n       Additionally, you have received many decorations from \n     Italy, Spain, Egypt, Jordan, Central and South America and \n     Africa.\n       You also received several honorary doctorates, and Yale \n     University awarded you their highest honor: The Yale Medal.\n       You have served on this Society's Board as a Director and \n     Vice President for many years, and in addition currently \n     serve on our Executive Committee.\n       We could not imagine running this Board without your \n     distinctive expertise and knowledgeable guidance, and the \n     Society is extremely honored to count you among its Life \n     Members.\n       And today, Mr. Ambassador, dear Joseph, I am very proud to \n     present you with our Society's 2012 Medal for Distinguished \n     Achievement.\n\n[[Page S5797]]\n\nResponse by Ambassador Joseph Verner Reed Upon Receipt of the Medal for \nDistinguished Achievement at the Annual Meeting of the American Society \n                     of the French Legion of Honor\n\n\n       Wednesday, November 14, 2012 The Links Club New York City\n\n       I am greatly honored to receive this ``Award for \n     Distinguished Achievement'' from the Society.\n       I love France.

He later \n     lived in Paris and Senlis.\n       I was honored to receive the Legion of Honor from President \n     Mitterrand when I served as Chief of Protocol of the White \n     House under President Bush Senior. As Chief of Protocol I \n     organized more visits between President Bush and President \n     Mitterrand than Mr. Bush had with any other Head of State.\n       In my youth I had the privilege of having a Governess from \n     France.\n       Soon after the close of World War Two I had the pleasure of \n     being with a French Family for a Summer near the City of \n     Tours. That started my love affair with ``La Belle France''.\n       It was France that turned the American quest for \n     Independence into a reality.\n       France's legendary culture has spread her elegant language \n     (the language of Diplomacy) across the globe with 73 French \n     speaking nations forming the Francophonie.\n       France shapes global tastes.\n       Everyone's second country is France.\n       I have worked at the United Nations for thirty years. \n     France is a powerhouse at the Parliament of Man being a \n     Permanent Member of the Security Council.\n       France is at the peak of success with her Couture, \n     Painting, Music, Film, Drama, Cuisine, Wines from Bordeaux \n     and Burgundy, Champagne (who wouldn't love a country with 640 \n     types of cheese?).\n       My mind turns to -\n       The City of Lights, the Statue of Liberty, La Cote D'Azur, \n     Versailles, the Tricolor, Normandy and the bluffs of the \n     beaches of Utah and Omaha, Talleyrand, Le Musee D'Orsay, \n     Napoleon, La Marseilles, Chartres, The Chateaux of the Valley \n     of the Loire, President Wilson, General De Gaulle, General \n     Eisenhower, Francoise Mitterrand.\n       President Wildenstein and friends, thank you, thank you, \n     thank you for bestowing on me this great honor. I am touched, \n     humbled and proud.\n       Encore, Bon Soir\n       Bon Thanksgiving and Dieu Vous Benisse.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/18/senate-section/article/S5797-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5797]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              CONGRATULATING RENO TUUFULI AND ASHLIE BLAKE\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize two \nexceptionally talented young people from my home State of Nevada, \nAshlie Blake and Reno Tuufuli. These two young athletes were selected \nto represent the United States as members of the U.S.A. Track and Field \nWorld Youth Team, and competed in the International Association of \nAthletics Federations--IAAF, World Youth Championships in Donetsk, \nUkraine. These dedicated and hardworking young Nevadans competed with \ngreat skill against the best young athletes in the world, and they \nrepresented their State and their Nation admirably at the competition.\n  Ashlie Blake and Reno Tuufuli helped lead Team USA to its best \nshowing at the World Youth Championships. The team took home 17 medals \nover the course of the competition, more than any other country. Ashlie \nplaced third out of 55 athletes from around the world, winning the \nU.S.A.'s first medal of the competition for her performance in the \nwomen's shot put event. Reno surpassed his personal best record in the \nmen's discus throw and placed seventh out of 30 international athletes \nin the men's discus competition.\n  There is no doubt that both of these outstanding performances were \nthe result of many hours of hard work and dedicated training, and \nAshlie and Reno should be proud of their efforts and achievements. I \ncongratulate Ashlie Blake and Reno Tuufuli on their success, and I wish \nthem all the best as they continue their athletic endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/18/senate-section/article/S5797-2", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5797]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING GORDON BELCOURT\n\n Mr. TESTER. Madam President, today I wish to honor the life \nand legacy of Gordon Belcourt, the executive director of the Montana-\nWyoming Tribal Leaders Council. Gordon passed away on July 15 in \nBillings, MT.\n  Gordon was a tremendous leader and advocate for Indian Country. A \ntrusted and experienced voice, Gordon could always be counted on to use \ncommon sense to get to the heart of the issue and find a solution. He \nleaves big shoes to fill, and he will be missed by all Montanans. \nSharla's and my heart goes out to all of Gordon's friends and family \nwho are mourning his loss.\n  Gordon grew up on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation and graduated from \nBrowning High School. He attended the University of Santa Clara in \nCalifornia, where he participated in the ROTC Program, before becoming \na second lieutenant in the U.S. Army. He earned a master's degree in \npublic health from the University of California at Berkeley and \nreturned to the Big Sky State to attend law school at the University of \nMontana. He also served as president of the Blackfeet Community \nCollege. Gordon, who was honored by the State of California and the \nUniversity of California Berkeley as a Public Health Hero, received an \nhonorary doctorate from the University of Montana for his work to \nimprove Native American health.\n  Gordon built the Montana-Wyoming Tribal Leaders Council from the \nground up, serving as executive director beginning in 1998. He gave the \ncouncil a powerful voice--both throughout the region and across the \nNation. He worked tirelessly to improve life in Indian Country through \ninfrastructure projects, the permanent reauthorization of the Indian \nHealthcare Improvement Act, and the creation of the Tribal Law and \nOrder Act. He also created the regional Tribal Institutional Review \nBoard for the protection of the rights of Native Americans.\n  Gordon was a courageous leader on issues of alcoholism and suicide in \nIndian Country. Due to Gordon's leadership, the Tribal Leaders Council \nreceived $5 million in 2009 to combat alcohol abuse among American \nIndians. His extensive knowledge of the issues facing the community and \nhis commitment to doing what was right made him an outstanding advocate \nfor Native Americans.\n  As we bid farewell to Gordon, we recognize that he was a true warrior \nfor Indian Country. His given Blackfeet name, Mixed Iron Boy, was in \nremembrance of the combat his uncle endured in World War II, and it \nwill serve as a reminder to all of us of Gordon's remarkable strength, \nunwavering courage, enduring compassion, boundless vitality, and \nlasting legacy.\n  Our thoughts and prayers are with Gordon's widow, Cheryl, and all of \nhis family and many friends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/18/senate-section/article/S5797-3", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5797]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ROSHOLT, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. THUNE.

A bill to address the continued threat posed by dangerous \nsynthetic drugs by amending the Controlled Substances Act relating to \ncontrolled substance analogues; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Protecting Our \nYouth From Dangerous Synthetic Drugs Act of 2013 along with my \ncolleagues and friends, Senators Klobuchar, Manchin and Schumer. This \nbill will provide law enforcement and prosecutors with an important new \ntool to address the growing threat posed by dangerous, synthetic drugs.\n  Synthetic drugs are unregulated substances designed by scientists to \nmimic the effects of controlled substances. They are packaged in a \nmanner which is intended to appeal to our Nation's youth and are sold \nat gas stations, head shops and over the Internet.\n  Manufacturers of these products boldly seek to circumvent Federal law \nby marketing their merchandise as innocuous items like potpourri, \nincense, bath salts and plant food and stating that they are ``not \nintended for human consumption.'' Make no mistake; the individuals who \nproduce, distribute and sell these products are nothing more than drug \ntraffickers who seek to profit from the human use of these drug \nproducts.\n  When Congress outlawed several of these synthetic drugs last year, \ntraffickers did not stop producing them. Instead, they made slight \nalterations to the chemical structure of the illegal drugs to skirt the \nlaw. By doing this, the traffickers produced ``controlled substance \nanalogues.''\n  The bill I am introducing today will give law enforcement the tools \nthey need to prosecute individuals who produce and distribute \ncontrolled substance analogues.\n  Many of the controlled substance analogues on the market today are \ndesigned to mimic the effects of THC, the principal chemical in \nmarijuana. The Monitoring the Future survey, which tracks the drug-\nusing behaviors of adolescents, began studying the use of synthetic \nmarijuana in in 2011. Their 2012 report found that 11.3 percent of 12th \ngraders had used synthetic marijuana in the prior 12 months. Aside from \nalcohol and tobacco, synthetic marijuana was the second most widely \nused drug among 12th graders after marijuana.\n  There are many other ``families'' of controlled substance analogues \nwhich\n\n[[Page S5802]]\n\nhave been encountered in the market place. They mimic the effects of \ndrugs like ecstasy, PCP and LSD and therefore produce strong stimulant \nand/or hallucinogenic effects when ingested.\n  Altogether, there are an estimated 200 controlled substance analogues \navailable today. The threat is global and is rapidly expanding.\n  Fortunately, the Obama Administration has made progress combatting \nthis threat. Two nationwide operations targeting designer synthetic \ndrugs--one in 2012 dubbed Operation LogJam and the other which \nculminated approximately two weeks ago named Operation Synergy--\ndemonstrate this progress. These operations resulted in at least 318 \narrests; 681 executed search warrants, including at least 29 for drug \nmanufacturing facilities; $93 million in cash and assets seized; and \nthe removal of 10 tons of synthetic drugs from the supply chain.\n  Today, I am introducing a bill that will put these drug traffickers \non notice that if they seek to develop products containing controlled \nsubstance analogues that put our nation's youth in harm's way, then \nthey will be brought to justice. This will be accomplished by creating \na new tool by which the administration can designate, and publish, an \nadministrative list of outlawed controlled substance analogues.\n  First, the Protecting Our Youth from Dangerous Synthetic Drugs Act of \n2013 will establish an inter-agency committee of scientists, headed by \nthe Drug Enforcement Administration, DEA, which will be responsible for \nestablishing and maintaining an administrative list of controlled \nsubstance analogues. The Committee is structured so that it can respond \nquickly and robustly to the threat.\n  Second, DEA officials have informed my staff that virtually all of \nthese controlled substance analogues arrive as bulk powders from \noutside our borders. My bill will make it illegal to import a \ncontrolled substance analogue on the list unless the importation is \nintended for non-human use.\n  Third, the bill directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to review, and \nif appropriate, amend the federal sentencing guidelines for violations \nof the Controlled Substances Act pertaining to controlled substance \nanalogues.\n  Finally, it is important to note that controlled substance analogues \nare not controlled substances, meaning that the registration, reporting \nand recordkeeping requirements of the Controlled Substances Act do not \napply to those who seek to perform bona fide scientific research or use \na controlled substance analogue for non-human industrial applications.\n  This bill sends a strong message to drug traffickers who continue to \ncircumvent our Nation's laws. Congress recognizes that no matter how \nyou alter the chemical structure of synthetic drugs to get around the \nlaw, they remain dangerous and should not be available for human \nconsumption.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1323\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to conduct \na special resource study of the archeological site and surrounding land \nof the New Philadelphia town site in the State of Illinois, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator Durbin to \nintroduce a bill in support of New Philadelphia, the first town founded \nby a freed African-American. This bipartisan legislation directs the \nSecretary of the Interior to conduct a special resource study of New \nPhiladelphia to determine the feasibility of designating the area as a \nunit of the National Park System.\n  In 1836, Frank McWorter platted and officially registered the town of \nNew Philadelphia, the first known town founded by a freed African-\nAmerican before the Civil War. After saving money from neighboring \nlabor jobs to purchase his own freedom and the freedom of fifteen \nadditional family members, Mr. McWorter purchased a plot of land \nbetween the Illinois and Mississippi Rivers in Pike County to establish \nNew Philadelphia. The town became a station along the Underground \nRailroad and was a community where European-American, freeborn African-\nAmericans and formerly enslaved individuals were able to live together \nduring a time of intense racial strife.\n  In 2005, the town of New Philadelphia was designated as a National \nHistoric Place and in 2009 the town was designated a National Historic \nLandmark. Further designating New Philadelphia as a unit of the \nNational Park System will ensure that its historical legacy is \npreserved as an inspiring example of freedom and opportunity for future \ngenerations.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1328\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``New Philadelphia, Illinois, \n     Study Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) Frank McWorter, an enslaved man, bought his freedom and \n     the freedom of 15 family members by mining for crude niter in \n     Kentucky caves and processing the mined material into \n     saltpeter;\n       (2) New Philadelphia, founded in 1836 by Frank McWorter, \n     was the first town planned and legally registered by a free \n     African-American before the Civil War;\n       (3) the first railroad constructed in the area of New \n     Philadelphia bypassed New Philadelphia, which led to the \n     decline of New Philadelphia; and\n       (4) the New Philadelphia site--\n       (A) is a registered National Historic Landmark;\n       (B) is covered by farmland; and\n       (C) does not contain any original buildings of the town or \n     the McWorter farm and home that are visible above ground.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of the Interior.\n       (2) Study area.--The term ``Study Area'' means the New \n     Philadelphia archeological site and the surrounding land in \n     the State of Illinois.\n\n     SEC. 4. SPECIAL RESOURCE STUDY.\n\n       (a) Study.--The Secretary shall conduct a special resource \n     study of the Study Area.\n       (b) Contents.--In conducting the study under subsection \n     (a), the Secretary shall--\n       (1) evaluate the national significance of the Study Area;\n       (2) determine the suitability and feasibility of \n     designating the Study Area as a unit of the National Park \n     System;\n       (3) consider other alternatives for preservation, \n     protection, and interpretation of the Study Area by--\n       (A) Federal, State, or local governmental entities; or\n       (B) private and nonprofit organizations;\n       (4) consult with--\n       (A) interested Federal, State, or local governmental \n     entities;\n       (B) private and nonprofit organizations; or\n       (C) any other interested individuals; and\n       (5) identify cost estimates for any Federal acquisition, \n     development, interpretation, operation, and maintenance \n     associated with the alternatives considered under paragraph \n     (3).\n       (c) Applicable Law.--The study required under subsection \n     (a) shall be conducted in accordance with section 8 of Public \n     Law 91-383 (16 U.S.C. 1a-5).\n       (d) Report.--Not later than 3 years after the date on which \n     funds are first made available for the study under subsection \n     (a), the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Natural \n     Resources of the House of Representatives and the Committee \n     on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate a report \n     containing--\n       (1) the results of the study; and\n       (2) any conclusions and recommendations of the Secretary.\n       (e) Funding.--The study authorized under this section shall \n     be carried out using existing funds of the National Park \n     Service\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 1332. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nensure more timely access to home health services for Medicare \nbeneficiaries under the Medicare program; to the Committee on Finance\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and \nSenator Schumer to introduce legislation to ensure that our seniors and \ndisabled citizens have timely access to home health services under the \nMedicare program.\n  Nurse practitioners, physician assistants, certified nurse midwives \nand clinical nurse specialists are all playing increasingly important \nroles in the delivery of health care services, particularly in rural \nand medically underserved areas of our country where physicians may be \nin scarce supply. In recognition of their growing role, Congress, in \n1997, authorized Medicare to begin paying for physician services \nprovided by these health professionals as long as those services are \nwithin their scope of practice under state law.\n  Despite their expanded role, these advanced practice registered \nnurses and physician assistants are currently unable to order home \nhealth services for their Medicare patients. Under current law, only \nphysicians are allowed to certify or initiate home health care for \nMedicare patients, even though they may not be as familiar with the \npatient's case as the non-physician provider. In fact, in many cases, \nthe certifying physician may not even have a relationship with the \npatient and must rely upon the input of the nurse practitioner, \nphysician assistant, clinical nurse specialist or certified nurse \nmidwife to order the medically necessary home health care. At best, \nthis requirement adds more paperwork and a number of unnecessary steps \nto the process before home health care can be provided. At worst, it \ncan lead to needless delays in getting Medicare patients the home \nhealth care they need simply because a physician is not readily \navailable to sign the form.\n  The inability of advanced practice registered nurses and physician \nassistants to order home health care is particularly burdensome for \nMedicare beneficiaries in medically underserved areas, where these \nproviders may be the only health care professionals available. For \nexample, needed home health care was delayed by more than a week for a \nMedicare patient in Nevada because the physician assistant was the only \nhealth care professional serving the patient's small town, and the \nsupervising physician was located 60 miles away.\n\n[[Page S5804]]\n\n  A nurse practitioner told me about another case in which her \ncollaborating physician had just lost her father and was not available. \nAs a consequence, the patient experienced a two-day delay in getting \nneeded care while they waited to get the paperwork signed by another \nphysician. Another nurse practitioner pointed out that it is ridiculous \nthat she can order physical and occupational therapy in a subacute \nfacility but cannot order home health care. One of her patients had to \nwait eleven days after being discharged before his physical and \noccupational therapy could continue simply because the home health \nagency had difficulty finding a physician to certify the continuation \nof the same therapy that the nurse practitioner had been able to \nauthorize when the patient was in the facility.\n  The Home Health Care planning Improvement Act will help to ensure \nthat our Medicare beneficiaries get the home health care that they need \nwhen they need it by allowing physician assistants, nurse \npractitioners, clinical nurse specialists and certified nurse midwives \nto order home health services. Our legislation is supported by the \nNational Association for Home Care and Hospice, the American Nurses \nAssociation, the American Academy of Physician Assistants, the American \nCollege of Nurse Practitioners, the American College of Nurse Midwives, \nthe American Academy of Nurse Practitioners and the Visiting Nurse \nAssociations of America. I urge all of my colleagues to join us as \ncosponsors of this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/18/senate-section/article/S5804-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5804]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 198--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE \nGOVERNMENT OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION SHOULD TURN OVER EDWARD SNOWDEN TO \n           UNITED STATES AUTHORITIES, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM (for himself and Mr. Schumer) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S.
