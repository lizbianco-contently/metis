Mr. President, for the first time in 3 years the Senate is \npoised to confirm members of the National Labor Relations Board. \nAlthough too few Americans are aware of the important job this Board \ndoes, the NLRB looks out for rights of millions of U.S. workers every \nday and remedies unfair practices by private companies. This Board is \nan important safeguard for workers in America, regardless of whether \nthe employees are union or nonunion. Without the work of the NLRB, \nemployees who have been cheated and treated unfairly would have no \nentity to address the wrongs. Union elections would be meaningless to \nemployers and employees. Labor abuses and unfair employment practices \ncould go unchallenged.\n  I am glad the Senate is moving forward as agreed under this process, \nset forth at the beginning of this Congress, to confirm five nominees \nto the NLRB, two Republicans and three Democrats.\n  The Senate will consider three Democratic nominees and two Republican \nnominees for the NLRB today. Once they are confirmed, the NLRB will \nhave five Senate-confirmed members for the first time in a decade.\n  The five nominees are all eminently qualified.\n  For example, Mark Pearce has served on the National Labor Relations \nBoard for 3 years, since 2010. He has served as chairman since 2011.\n  Mr. Pearce was a founding partner of a Buffalo, NY law firm, where he \npracticed employment law.\n  He previously worked in the Buffalo, NY regional office of the NLRB.\n  Mr. Pearce received his Bachelor's degree from Cornell University and \nhis law degree from SUNY Buffalo.\n  Kent Hirozawa, whose nomination we will also consider today, is \ncurrently chief counsel for the National Labor Relations Board.\n  Before joining the NLRB staff in 2010, Mr. Hirozawa was a partner at \na New York law firm, where he worked on Federal and State and labor and \nemployment law.\n  Mr. Hirozawa also served as a field attorney for the NLRB from for 3 \nyears prior to entering private practice.\n  He received a Bachelor's degree from Yale and his law degree from \nNYU.\n  Nancy Schiffer, the third Democratic NLRB nominee we will consider \ntoday, served as associate general counsel for the American Federation \nof Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations.\n  She has also worked for the United Auto Workers and served as a staff \nattorney in the NLRB's Detroit regional office.\n  Ms. Schiffer received her Bachelor's from Michigan State University \nand her law degree from the University of Michigan.\n\n[[Page S6030]]\n\n  Once we vote on the 3 Democratic nominees, I expect we will consider \nthe 2 Republican nominees by consent.\n  The first Republican nominee, Harry Johnson, is a partner at a Los \nAngeles law firm and practices labor and employment law.\n  Mr. Johnson received his Bachelor's degree from Johns Hopkins \nUniversity and his law degree from Harvard.\n  The other Republican nominee, Philip Miscimarra, is a partner in a \nChicago law firm, where he also practices labor and employment law.\n  Mr. Miscimarra received his Bachelor's degree from Duquesne \nUniversity, and his M.B.A and J.D. from the University of Pennsylvania.\n  These nominees will be responsible for ensuring fair compensation and \nworking conditions for American workers.\n  Look at the resumes of these people. They are pretty impressive.\n  They are experienced and dedicated public servants, and I have no \ndoubt that they will perform their duties on this crucial board with \ndistinction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/30/senate-section/article/S6030-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6030]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Markey). The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today, the President will continue his \ncampaign road tour in Chattanooga. We hear he plans to make an \nannouncement about corporate taxes. And while I understand he is \nlooking for headlines here, reports indicate that the policy he intends \nto announce doesn't exactly qualify as news. It is just a further-left \nversion of a widely panned plan he already proposed 2 years ago--this \ntime with extra goodies for tax-and-spend liberals.\n  The plan, which I just learned about last night, lacks meaningful \nbipartisan input, and the tax hike it includes is going to dampen any \nboost businesses might otherwise get to help our economy. In fact, it \ncould actually hurt small businesses. And it represents an unmistakable \nsignal that the President has literally backed away from his campaign-\nera promise to corporate America that tax reform would be revenue \nneutral to them.\n  Not only is this a rebuke to one of his party's most senior \nSenators--the Finance Committee Chairman--it also represents a serious \nblow to one of the best chances for true bipartisan action in \nWashington. I truly hope the President reconsiders this plan and \nconsults with Congress before moving any further.\n  Two summers ago, Republicans and Democrats came together to agree on \na set of spending caps for the following decade. President Obama agreed \nto it, as did the leaders of both parties in the Senate and the House.\n  It was essentially a promise made to the American people that \nWashington would reduce spending by $2.1 trillion, and I was happy to \nhelp lead the effort.\n  Well, 2 years later Democrats are now trying to find ways to walk \naway from it.\n  They are pressing to abandon the 2011 agreement in favor of higher \nspending, as evidenced by appropriations bills like the one we're \nconsidering this week--which hikes up spending by double digits. And \nthe President is now actually threatening to veto bills that live up to \nthat commitment we all made.\n  Let me repeat that: The President of the United States who, during \nthe campaign, took credit for the very savings Democrats now want to \nwalk away from, is threatening to veto spending bills that would \nactually follow the law and live up to the commitment he himself \nsigned.\n  This represents a stunning shift for Democrats, who just recently \nwere warning against breaking the agreement. The Chairwoman of the \nBudget Committee said last year that we have to be able to count on \nagreements that have been made, instead of threatening a Government \nshutdown. Yet that is just what she and her party are now threatening \nto do--to shut down the Government unless an agreement we all made is \ntorn up and thrown away.\n  So if Democrats want to shut down the Government because they can't \nwiggle their way out of a deal they agreed to, I guess there is not \nmuch we can do to stop them. But Republicans intend to stick by the \ncommitments made to our constituents.\n  That said, there is also this to remember: Republicans have always \nsaid that there may be more effective ways to achieve comparable \nspending reductions. If Democrats want to propose smarter spending cuts \nthat achieve the same kind of savings they committed to in 2011, we are \nready to listen. Comprehensive Government spending reforms would be a \ngood place to start.\n  Because Republicans understand that America's largest fiscal \nchallenges stem from the fact that programs our fellow Americans hope \nto rely on in their most vulnerable years are going bankrupt. And \nRepublicans are saying that the only way to avert the kind of panicked, \npoorly thought out spending cuts and tax increases we have seen in \nEurope is to implement forward-looking reforms today. That is why it is \nalways so amusing when the President and his allies try to brand the \nkind of innovative government spending reforms we favor as ``European-\nstyle austerity,'' as he implied again this weekend.\n  Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, what the Europeans \nare doing in response to the threats from their creditors is \nessentially the opposite of the approach favored by Republicans. The \ntype of long-term spending reforms we envision are often the only \nantidote against the kind of austerity we see in Europe. Because \nEuropean austerity is not about protecting future generations from \nspending cuts, it is about staying afloat today. And the tax increases \nEuropeans enact under duress--and the kind of pain Detroiters \nexperience under bankruptcy--these are exactly the things Republicans \naim to avoid. And we aim to avoid those things by acting intelligently \ntoday, while we still have time.\n  Unlike Democrats, Republicans are not looking for some colorless \ndiscussion about raising taxes here or snipping there or moving numbers \naround on a budget chart. We would rather have a more holistic, \nforward-looking conversation, one about modernizing Government to meet \nthe challenges of the 21st Century.\n  Where we ask questions like:\n  How do we modernize entitlement programs so they'll actually be \naccessible to Americans when they need them?\n  Which government programs should be reformed, updated, or no longer \nmake sense in a 21st Century economy? How can services be delivered in \nthe most efficient and technologically savvy way?\n  And what structural reforms can we implement to ensure the most \nrobust economic growth and job creation for this generation and those \nto come?\n  By addressing the big questions now--by identifying and implementing \nforward-looking reforms today--we can do a lot more than just reduce \nthe deficit in the short term. We can also create jobs now, grow the \neconomy now, make Government work better now, and eliminate the threat \nof a debt crisis everyone knows is coming, a debt crisis that would \nusher in the very kind of European-style austerity Democrats claim not \nto like, but keep accelerating towards.\n  But in order for this to happen, Democrats need to work with us.\n  As a first step, they should step back from the brink with their plan \nto shut down the Government. And they need to stop threatening to tear \nup agreements we all previously assented to. The Budget Control Act \nmight not be perfect, but at least we were able to secure important \nspending control for the American people. And if Democrats want to \ntrade some savings for innovative reforms that can serve our country \neven better over the long term, then there are policymakers ready to \ntalk.\n  But Republicans are not going to just give up on the commitments made \nto our constituents. Not only would that be a betrayal of a promise we \nall made, but we have already seen where the Democrats' left-leaning \npolicies and European-inspired ideas lead.\n  More of that is the last thing our country needs right now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/30/senate-section/article/S6030-2", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6030-S6031]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I understand we are now in postcloture \ndebate on this nominee. I understand there is up to 8 hours that can be \nconsumed for that purpose, if I am not mistaken.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I certainly hope we don't have to take that much time. \nFor this nominee and the other four to follow, I am hopeful we can get \nthrough them today and get the nominees to the President before we \nleave here this evening.\n  Today is a day that I and many of my colleagues have long waited for. \nBecause of the bipartisan deal reached on the President's nominees, it \nlooks as though we finally have a path forward to confirm a full slate \nof nominees to the National Labor Relations Board. A fully confirmed, \nfully functional board will be a huge step forward for workers and \nemployers in our country, and this will be the first time in over a \ndecade this has happened.\n  Over 75 years ago Congress enacted the National Labor Relations Act, \nguaranteeing American workers the right to form and join a union and to \nbargain for a better life. For both union and nonunion workers alike, \nthe act provides for essential protections. It gives workers a voice in \nthe workplace, allowing them to join together and speak out for fair \nwages, good benefits, and safe working conditions. These rights ensure \nthat the people who do the real work in this country see the benefits \nwhen our economy grows and aren't mistreated or put at risk on the job.\n  The National Labor Relations Board is the guardian of these \nfundamental rights. Workers themselves cannot enforce the National \nLabor Relations Act; the Board is the only place where people can go if \nthey have been treated unfairly and denied the basic protections the \nlaw provides. Thus, the Board plays a vital role in vindicating \nworkers' rights. In the past 10 years the NLRB has secured \nopportunities for reinstatement for 22,544 employees who were unjustly \nfired. It has also recovered more than $1 billion on behalf of workers \nwhose rights were violated in the last decade.\n\n  The Board does not just protect the rights of workers and unions; it \nalso provides relief and remedies to our Nation's employers. The Board \nis an employer's only recourse if a union commences a wildcat strike or \nrefuses to bargain in good faith during negotiations. The NLRB also \nhelps numerous businesses resolve disputes efficiently. For example, \nwhen two unions picketed Walmart in 2012, Walmart filed a claim with \nthe NLRB, and the NLRB negotiated a settlement. So by preventing labor \ndisputes that could disrupt our economy, the work that the Board does \nis vital to every worker and every business across the Nation.\n  Earlier this year I received a letter from 32 management-side and 15 \nunion-side labor attorneys from across the country who made this point \nparticularly well. It urged the swift confirmation of a full package of \nfive NLRB nominees and said:\n\n       While we differ in our views over the decisions and actions \n     of the NLRB over the years, we do agree that our clients' \n     interests are best served by the stability and certainty a \n     full, confirmed Board will bring to the field of labor-\n     management relations.\n\n  I could not agree more. Confirming these nominees swiftly is vitally \nimportant because the National Labor Relations Board must have a quorum \nof three Board members to act. If there are less than three Board \nmembers at any time, the Board cannot issue decisions and essentially \nmust shut down. Although the Board currently has three members, \nChairman Pearce's term expires on August 27--next month. At that point \nthe Labor Board would be unable to function unless we confirm \nadditional members. Now, that is more than just an administrative \nheadache. It would be a tragedy that denies justice to working men and \nwomen across the country. So it is imperative that we act to avoid this \nand keep the Board open for work.\n  Up until recent times, all of us in Congress agreed that the Board \nshould function for the good of our country and our economy, but in the \nlast few years that understanding has broken down. As I said, it has \nbeen a decade since the Board has had five Senate-confirmed members. It \nis not that qualified people have not been nominated, because they \nhave. The problem is that a few of my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle--I am not saying everyone, but a very vocal minority--have \nbeen trying to use the nominations process to undermine the mission of \nthe National Labor Relations Board.\n  They, first of all, do not like the National Labor Relations Act, but \nthey\n\n[[Page S6032]]\n\nknow they could never repeal it outright. So what is their solution, \nthis vocal minority on the Republican side? Keep the NLRB inoperable by \nrefusing to confirm nominees regardless of their qualifications. In \nthis case, one of my Republican colleagues announced his intention to \nfilibuster the NLRB nominees 6 days before the nominations were \nannounced, and he openly admitted his intention was to shut down the \nagency.\n  We have seen lots of nominees deemed unacceptable simply because they \nhave worked on behalf of workers or unions and they support our system \nof collective bargaining. These nominees have been accused of being \nbiased and called unfit to serve because they worked for labor unions \nor were lawyers for labor unions. But I would like to point out what \nthe National Labor Relations Act--the law--actually says. I have often \nquoted from the National Labor Relations Act on this point, and I will \ndo so again right now. Here is what the law says:\n\n       It is declared to be the policy of the United States to \n     eliminate the causes of certain substantial obstructions to \n     the free flow of commerce and to mitigate and eliminate these \n     obstructions when they have occurred by encouraging the \n     practice and procedure of collective bargaining and by \n     protecting the exercise by workers of full freedom of \n     association, self-organization, and designation of \n     representatives of their own choosing, for the purpose of \n     negotiating the terms and conditions of their employment or \n     other mutual aid or protection.\n\n  That is what the law says. The purpose is, again, to encourage ``the \npractice and procedure of collective bargaining'' for the good of our \nworkers, for the good of our economy, and for the good of our Nation.\n  So if we have a nominee who comes up for the Board who supports \ncollective bargaining, I would think that nominee would be more \nqualified, not less qualified, to serve on the Board because that \nnominee understands what the law says. So we should be seeking nominees \nwho are, in the words of one of the nominees before us today, not pro-\nunion, not pro-worker or pro-management, but ``pro-Act''--``pro-Act.'' \nIf you are pro-act, the act says that we should be ``encouraging the \npractice and procedure of collective bargaining and by protecting the \nexercise by workers of full freedom of association, self-organization, \nand designation of representatives of their own choosing.'' That is \nwhat the law says.\n  I am optimistic that the nominees before us today will bring this \nperspective to their work at the Board. All five nominees have diverse \nbackgrounds and are deeply steeped in labor and employment law. While I \ncertainly do not agree with the politics or perhaps the ideology of \neach nominee, it cannot be disputed that this is a competent and \nexperienced group of lawyers. Given their diverse backgrounds and \nqualifications, there is no reason this package of nominees should not \nbe confirmed with strong bipartisan support.\n  All five of these nominees have been thoroughly vetted. For the two \nmost recent nominees--Kent Hirozawa and Nancy Schiffer--the vetting \nprocess has been quick, but it has been thorough. They have submitted \nall of the paperwork that we receive for our nominees. They have \nappeared before our committee in a hearing, answered any questions. \nThey have met with staff for both sides, and they have answered all the \nwritten questions posed by members of my committee. They have \ndemonstrated themselves to be impressively qualified and capable, and I \nlook forward to their future service on the Board.\n  So I believe the time has come to start a new chapter for the NLRB. \nIt is time to ratchet down the political rhetoric that has recently \nhaunted this agency and let the dedicated public servants who work \nthere do their jobs. Indeed, I hope today's votes mark a new beginning \nfor the Board, with a new energy and vitality, a new spirit of \ncollaboration. A revitalized NLRB is a critical part of our continued \nefforts to build a strong economy and a strong middle class. It is long \npast time to put the Board back in business and to tone down the \nrhetoric.\n\n  I say to my friends on the other side--again, a vocal minority--\ncertainly they can vote against the nominees. That is their right. That \nis their privilege. But do not use the nomination process to try to \nshut down the Board or to thwart the implementation of the National \nLabor Relations Act.\n  I am sure there were times when a majority of the Board was appointed \nby Republican Presidents and they were probably more promanagement. I \ncannot think of one right now, but I am sure they probably made some \ndecisions that I would not be in favor of. But they did it openly. \nThere are also times under a Democratic President when the Board would \nprobably have three members who would be more from the labor side than \nmanagement side. But that is the ebb and flow.\n  Quite frankly, for most of the times in the past, even though \nRepublican Presidents had put nominees on the Board who were probably \nmore promanagement or came from the management side--they would have \nthree of those and then two from the worker or labor side--they still \nran the Board in a nonpartisan fashion and reached agreements in an \nopen fashion that were implementing the National Labor Relations Act. I \nwould be hard pressed to think of a time when the Board acted in \ncontradiction to what the act actually says.\n  Until recently--and this has just broken down in the last few years \nwhen President Obama's nominees to the Board, in the first instance, \nwere filibustered when the President had to give recess appointments to \nnominees. Of course, a recess appointment can only last so long, and \nthen that person has to leave the Board. As I said, there was a threat \nby a Member on the Republican side to filibuster nominees before they \nwere even sent down. That means the Board would have been unable to \noperate. So the President then gave a recess appointment to two \nnominees to keep the Board functioning. That then found its way into \nthe courts.\n  We have a couple of courts that decided the President did not have \nthe power to do a recess appointment the way he did it. Other courts \nhave taken different pathways. So that set of facts in that case is \nwinding its way to the Supreme Court. It probably will be decided some \ntime next year. But that is what happens when people do not let \nnominees who are fully qualified--fully qualified--come to the floor to \nget an up-or-down vote.\n  So I am very pleased this agreement that was reached a couple weeks \nago to not filibuster nominees included the National Labor Relations \nBoard. So we have an agreement from the Republican side that they will \nnot filibuster these nominees. We have five of them. This is the first, \nMr. Hirozawa. I am hopeful that, again, since they have been thoroughly \nvetted, we can move ahead expeditiously to vote on them and that we \nwill not take the full 8 hours to debate these nominees and that each \none of them--each one would have 8 hours. But, hopefully, we can \ncollapse that and have the votes on the nominees at some time later \nthis afternoon, and, as I said, turn a new chapter in the NLRB. Put \nthem down there on the Board and let them do their work, and tone down \nthe political rhetoric a little bit on the National Labor Relations \nBoard.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that time during all \npostcloture quorum calls on the Hirozawa nomination be charged equally \nto both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak for 5 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Budget Control Act\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, as we begin our final week of legislative \nactivity prior to the August work period, I rise today to discuss the \nfiscal challenges that will await us on our return. When the Senate \ngavels back into session on September 9, we will be only 3 short weeks \naway from the end of the fiscal year. We will have only 15 business \ndays to reach an agreement on all 12 appropriations bills and avoid a \ngovernment shutdown.\n\n[[Page S6033]]\n\n  Unfortunately, our progress toward reaching this goal has been less \nthan stellar. The transportation-housing appropriations bill we are \ncurrently considering is the first of 12 bills that has even been \nbrought to the Senate floor. Consider this: We cannot even agree to \ncomply with the spending limits mandated under current law. We are \nheaded for a big multitrain pileup.\n  Last Congress, the Senate and the House made a promise to the \nAmerican people--made a promise about a basic level of fiscal \nconstraint on our appropriations process; not enough, but a step in the \nright direction. As a part of the Budget Control Act, which passed with \nbipartisan support and was signed by the President, we committed to \ncapping appropriations spending at certain levels for each of the next \n10 years.\n  Less than a year ago, the majority leader emphatically proclaimed \nthem binding when he said:\n\n       We passed the Budget Control Act. We have agreed to all of \n     those numbers. They are done. They are agreed to.\n\n  In only the second year of this 10-year schedule, the 12 \nappropriation bills are mandated to spend no more than $967 billion. \nThat is a huge number to almost everyone. It is simply a whole lot of \nspending, almost $3 billion a day. But my colleagues on the other side \nwant to spend even more. In fact, they want to spend well over $1 \ntrillion this year.\n  You see, they want to pretend the Budget Control Act never passed and \nwas never signed into law. They want to keep on spending as if there is \nsome kind of alternative reality. But sadly that is not the case. Our \nNation's deficit is still too large. We are still miles away from a \nbalanced budget. The national debt continues on a course toward \ndisaster. Yet, apparently, we are going to ignore the appropriations \ncaps we all agreed to 2 years ago--not by an insignificant amount, an \nadditional $91 billion above the legal limit in the next fiscal year \nalone.\n  As a new member of the Appropriations Committee, I have been \nsurprised to watch week after week bills being advanced that simply \nignore current law. With a $17 trillion national debt, we cannot simply \nimagine our way out of this crisis. But by ignoring the Budget Control \nAct, that is exactly what we are attempting to do.\n  I continue to believe very strongly that we should be preparing bills \nthat are consistent with current law, abiding by the spending caps we \nvoted for and were signed by the President. I think we should even do \nmore than that, but complying with the current law is the bare minimum.\n  What does all of this mean? Who gets hurt if we ignore the BCA caps? \nWell, ignoring the BCA spending levels is not free money we can print \ndown at the Treasury Department. Spending over the BCA caps simply sets \nthe stage for yet another round of sequester cuts. We all remember how \npopular that was beginning this year. The administration officials \nclaimed our health, our safety, our well-being, were in the balance as \nthey traveled the country, threatening services such as Head Start, \nfood safety inspectors, and massive delays at airports because of the \nindiscriminate, across-the-board spending cuts.\n  That is exactly what we are going to see in a few weeks because the \nmajority would rather wash their hands of the responsibility to honor \nthe caps and continue spending as though actions do not matter. But \nthat is exactly the Senate's plan, spend $91 billion over what the law \nallows. When $91 billion worth of across-the-board cuts kick in, they \nhope the outcry from the American people is loud enough to convince us \nhere in Congress to add the additional spending to our national debt. \nIn my judgment, that is no way to run a railroad, but that seems to be \nthe plan: keep spending us right into another sequester, ignore the \nconsequences, and hope for the best.\n  It simply boggles the mind, especially when you consider all but two \nSenate Democrats on the Appropriations Committee supported--I emphasize \nsupported--the increased level of spending restraint in the BCA.\n  Instead, we should have been using this time as an opportunity to \nmore thoughtfully reduce spending before the end of the fiscal year. \nThat is exactly what President Obama says he wants, when he says \nCongress should use a scalpel to tame our budget problems, not an axe, \nin across-the-board spending cuts. We can responsibly meet the $967 \nbillion spending target in current law, but we have to try. But instead \nof seizing the opportunity, we are once again shirking our \nresponsibility in the hopes that no one will notice. That is \ndisappointing to the American people. By exceeding the caps, we are \nviolating yet another commitment we have made to them to get our fiscal \nhouse in order. You see, the American people figured this out long ago. \nWashington simply spends too much and, most importantly, spends too \nmuch of their own money. As their elected representatives, we should \nnot ignore this. I am hopeful we can change course, take this \nopportunity and ensure that our spending bills total no more than what \nwe promised months ago.\n  Come October 1, the American people will have the opportunity to see \nwhether we have met that challenge. I hope for the sake of the country \nthey get better news than what appears today.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schatz). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Presidential Nominations\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, this week the Senate is voting on five \nof the President's nominations for membership on the National Labor \nRelations Board. I expect all five to receive up-or-down votes, as they \ngenerally do, and I expect all five to be confirmed. The Board will \nthen have a full complement, with a Democratic majority of three and \ntwo Republican members.\n  I would like to review for a moment what has happened and how we got \nto this spot because it is an important moment in the history of our \nability as a country to maintain the checks and balances and certain \nseparations of power among the various branches of government and \nespecially to restrain the Executive, which has been an important part \nof our country's history.\n  In January 2012 the President nominated two individuals to be members \nof the National Labor Relations Board using his recess-appointment \npower. He has that power in the Constitution. The only problem was that \nthe Senate wasn't in recess--at least that was our view. The Senate was \nin a 3-day pro forma session. A 3-day pro forma session is a device \nthat was employed by Senator Reid, the distinguished majority leader, \nwhen Bush was President, and he did it to keep President Bush from \nusing his recess-appointment power when the Senate was in recess.\n  Most of our Presidents have chafed under the restraints we have \nplaced upon our Executive. President Bush didn't like that, but he \nrespected it, and President Bush never made recess appointments while \nthe Senate was in session. But President Obama did--on January 4, 2012. \nSenate Republicans objected strongly to that. After a great deal of \ndiscussion, we decided to support a lawsuit challenging the \nappointments. That lawsuit went before the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, \nand the Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with our position and said in \neffect that the President could not make a recess appointment when the \nSenate itself had determined it was in session.\n  Since then there have been two other decisions by other federal \ncourts of appeals that have said what the President did on January 4, \n2012, was unconstitutional. The case will come before the Supreme Court \nthis next term. No one knows what decision the Supreme Court will make, \nbut my sense would be that the Supreme Court will say to this President \nor to any President that, Mr. President, you can't use your \nconstitutional power to make a recess appointment at a time when the \nSenate is not in recess.\n  I said earlier that Presidents have chafed under these restraints on \nthe executive branch. That has been true ever since the days of George \nWashington. George Washington imposed his own modesty and restraint \nupon the American character when he resigned\n\n[[Page S6034]]\n\nhis commission after the Revolutionary War, when he stepped down after \ntwo terms as President and went back to Mount Vernon, when he asked to \nbe called Mr. President instead of Your Excellency. Ever since then we \nhave had many strong Presidents. They haven't all liked the idea that \nWashington also helped write a constitution that created a congress and \na bill of rights, and the whole purpose of that was to restrain the \nExecutive. After all, our revolution was against a king, and most of \nour Founders--not all of them, but the majority of the drafters of the \nConstitution didn't want a king of the United States, they wanted a \npresident of the United States.\n  One of the most important checks upon the power of the Executive is \nthe Senate's power to advise and consent, the power to review. About \n1,000 Presidential nominations come to us, and it takes a while to \nconfirm them. Sometimes it takes longer than the nominees think it \nshould. I have repeated many times on this floor that when the first \nPresident Bush nominated me to be Education Secretary and the Senator \nfrom Ohio held up my nomination for 3 months, I didn't think that was \nsuch a good idea, but the Senate had the power to do it because the \nConstitution restrains the Executive. Unfortunately, this President \ndidn't seem to read that chapter in American history because we have \nseen during this President's time repeated efforts to circumvent the \nconstitutional checks on the Executive.\n  This administration has appointed more czars than the Romanovs had. \nThat is the way you get around the nomination process. This \nadministration's excellent Education Secretary has used a simple waiver \nauthority in effect to create a national school board. When Congress \nsays we don't want to appropriate money to implement ObamaCare, the \nHealth and Human Services Secretary says: Well, if Congress won't do \nit, I will do it anyway; I will just go out and raise private money and \ndo it. Then we have recess appointments being made when the Senate is \nnot in recess. That is unconstitutional. If that could happen, the \nSenate could adjourn for lunch and come back and we would have a new \nSupreme Court Justice because the President said we were in recess.\n  So what is happening this week with these National Labor Relations \nBoard nominees has a special significance in our constitutional history \nbecause not only did Republicans support a lawsuit challenging the \nappointments, which we are winning and the case has been won in two \nother Federal courts--but the President, after much discussion, has \nwithdrawn his two unconstitutionally appointed nominees.\n  I suggested that he do this in May when we had a markup of the five \nnominees the President sent. I voted for three--the Democratic Chairman \nand the two Republicans--and I voted against the two who were \nunconstitutionally appointed. They were well-qualified people. That \nwasn't the issue. The issue was that the Senate needed a way to express \nits objection to this unconstitutional action by the Executive.\n  I suggested that what the President should do is withdraw those two \nnominees and send us two new ones in the normal process--people who had \nnot stayed on after a Federal court decided they were \nunconstitutionally there. These two unconstitutionally appointed \nnominees have participated in more than 1,000 cases. These cases are \nall subject to being vacated because there was no constitutional \nquorum.\n  It leaves quite a mess in our labor laws. But the President withdrew \nthose two and now we are, this week, doing what the Senate normally \ndoes. We are considering in the normal process his new nominees.\n  I am voting, as I said, for the two Republicans and the Chairman. The \nChairman was not unconstitutionally appointed. He did not continue to \nserve as an unconstitutionally appointed person, since he was not so \nappointed, so I voted for him in committee. I do not agree with the \nChairman and his view of labor laws, but I will have to take that up \nduring the next election. Elections have consequences, and when we \nelect the President of the United States, he normally appoints people \nwho agree with him.\n  I am also voting for having an up-or-down vote. We almost always do \nthat with the President's nominees. There have only been a few times in \nour history when we have not. We have never failed to have an up-or-\ndown vote on a Supreme Court Justice after they have come to the floor. \nWe have never failed to have an up-or-down vote on a district court \njudge after they have come to the floor; the same in terms of circuit \ncourts. We never did, until Democrats started filibustering President \nBush's judges about 10 years ago when I came to the Senate. We all know \nthat story.\n  But normally we have an up-or-down vote, and we will be doing that \nthis week on the President's five nominees. I am voting against two of \nthe nominees when that up-or-down vote comes, and I wish to explain \nwhy.\n  One is Mr. Hirozawa and the other is Ms. Schiffer. Both of them have \nexcellent legal backgrounds. But the problem is I am not persuaded--I \nhope I will be proven wrong--that they will be able to transfer their \npositions of advocacy to positions of adjudication; that they can be \nimpartial when employers come before them.\n  Employers as well as employees have a right, when they come before \nthe National Labor Relations Board, to expect that all five members, \nwhether Republicans or Democrats, from whatever background they might \nhave, will look at the case and decide it in an impartial way. It may \nbe possible that Mr. Hirozawa and Ms. Schiffer can do that, but I am \nnot persuaded that is true, and so while I am voting that they have up-\nor-down votes, I am not voting for them.\n  The President has nominated for the Board three different individuals \nwho were employed directly by major labor unions. The first was Craig \nBecker, who was counsel for two unions, and whose nomination was \nrejected by a bipartisan vote in 2010. The second was Mr. Griffin. The \nthird is Ms. Schiffer.\n  I asked Ms. Schiffer at her hearing if she could remember other \nexamples of an administration stocking the National Labor Relations \nBoard with organized labor employees and she could not think of \nexamples and I could not either. Over the last several years, the \nNational Labor Relations Board seems to have veered away from \nimpartiality. Instead of preserving a level playing field and \nprotecting the carefully balanced rights of all parties, it has shown \nfavoritism toward organized labor leadership and very little interest \nin the rights of individual employers or individual employees who want \nto exercise their rights not to join a union.\n  In fairness, I have to admit this politicization of the National \nLabor Relations Board has occurred both under Republican and Democratic \nadministrations, but I think appointing a person directly from a high \nlevel job within a major labor union is not an example of trying to \nmove away from that trend.\n  The trend is causing confusion. One labor law professor at a \nnationally recognized law school recently said she cannot even use her \nlabor law textbook anymore. She has to resort to handing out NLRB \ndecisions to explain the law because they are changing it so much. The \nNLRB has ventured into rulemaking with two new efforts, both of which \nhave been stalled by the Federal courts.\n  In August 2011, the Board issued a new rule requiring employers to \npost a biased employee rights poster in the workplace and making it an \nunfair labor practice to fail to do so. Two separate Federal courts \nhave struck down the rule because it exceeded statutory authority.\n  In December 2011, the Board issued a new rule shortening the time in \nwhich a union election is held, otherwise known as the ambush elections \nrule. The DC Circuit Court struck down this rule on the grounds it \nlacked a quorum, and the NLRB is appealing the decision.\n  So far, this administration's NLRB has sought to change the rules for \ndetermining bargaining units, the process for certifying a \nrepresentation election, the legal obligation of employers to withhold \ndues from employees' paychecks, even when there is no valid collective \nbargaining agreement in place, the validity of arbitration provisions \nin employment contracts, the legality of numerous well-intentioned \nemployee handbook provisions, the rules governing employee discipline \nwhen there is no valid collective bargaining agreement in place, the \nrules governing the\n\n[[Page S6035]]\n\nconfidentiality of employee witness statements given during a \nlegitimate investigation, the policy against forcing nonunion member \nemployees to pay for union lobbying expenses, the rules governing \nemployers' rights to limit access to their property, and attempting to \ncreate an entirely new employer obligation and unfair labor practice \nthrough the poster requirement struck down by multiple Federal \nappellate courts.\n  The effect of all of these changes seems to me to tilt the playing \nfield in favor of organized labor instead of impartiality, which is the \ndirective of the statute. So fairness and impartiality is what I am \nlooking for in any NLRB nominee. These two nominees do not pass this \ntest. That is why I plan to oppose their nominations.\n  But the most important message from this week's debate is this: The \nSenate is saying, not just to this President but to any President, \nRepublican and Democrat, that you may not abuse your constitutional \npower of recess appointments by making appointments when the Senate \nitself determines it is not in recess. To do so is an affront to the \nseparation of powers. It undermines checks and balances that were \nplaced upon the Executive at the beginning of our country as a way of \npreserving our liberties. That is an important step in the history of \nconstitutional law in this country, and I am glad to see it has been \ndone in this way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Littoral Combat Ship Program\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, over the last few years, I have spoken on \nthe floor about how the Department of Defense procures major weapons \nsystems--a system that is, to a large degree, broken, unfortunately. It \nis now even more important. With defense funding likely to be \nconstrained to reduced levels in the coming years, our role as \nlegislators overseeing major defense acquisition programs to make sure \nthey are efficient and effective is as important today as it has ever \nbeen--indeed, even more so.\n  A recently released Government Accountability Office--GAO--report \nthat is highly critical of the Navy's Littoral Combat Ship Program \nbrings me to the floor today. On that program, the Navy plans to spend \nover $40 billion to buy a total of 52 seaframes and 64 so-called \n``plug-and-play'' mission modules. These are modules that would be \nmoved on and off, depending on the mission in which the Littoral Combat \nShip is engaged. The combined capability of those modules with the \nseaframes is supposed to give these ships their intended lethality.\n  Until recently, my main concern with this program has been the \nunbridled growth in the cost to build the seaframes of the lead ships: \nthe Freedom--the steel hull version--and the Independence, which is an \naluminum trimaran version. The Navy appears to have addressed that \nproblem. While the cost to build the seaframes for the follow-ships is \nstill about double the program's original, overly optimistic cost \nestimate--which is not unusual--the cost to complete the construction \nappears to have stabilized at about $450 million each.\n  Today I am concerned about another very serious problem: that the \nNavy will buy too many of these ships before the combination of their \nseaframes, with their interchangeable mission modules, has been proven \ncapable of performing the missions these ships are supposed to perform. \nIn other words, the Navy will not know whether this Littoral Combat \nShip meets the combatant commanders' operational requirements until \nafter it has procured more than half of the 52 planned ships. This is \nparticularly troubling inasmuch as the Littoral Combat Ship fleet will \ncomprise more than one-third of the Navy's surface combatant ships.\n  The Littoral Combat Ships' stated primary missions are antisubmarine \nwarfare, mine countermeasures, and surface warfare against small boats, \nespecially in the littorals. These three primary missions appear \noriented toward countering, among other things, some of the littoral or \ncoastal anti-access/area-denial capabilities that have been fielded in \nrecent years by potential adversaries.\n  The Navy took delivery of the first of two ships--the Freedom and \nIndependence--more than 3 years ago. But the ship called Freedom \nactually deployed, albeit with limited capability, to Singapore in \nMarch and has experienced many of the technical challenges normally \nassociated with a prototype ship. The decision to deploy the ship \nFreedom prior to the completion of critical developmental and \noperational testing may be good salesmanship on the part of the Navy, \nbut the current plan to buy more than half of the total Littoral Combat \nShip fleet prior to the completion of operational testing plainly \ncontradicts defense acquisition guidelines and best procurement \npractices--and amounts to a case of ``buy before you fly,'' to borrow a \nphrase from aircraft acquisitions.\n  It also increases the risk that the program will incur additional \ncosts to backfit already built Littoral Combat Ships with expensive \ndesign changes identified through late testing and evaluation or, \nworse, operational use.\n  As is the case in several other major defense acquisition programs, \nthe problem here is ``excessive concurrency''--that is, an overlap \nbetween development and production that exposes the program to a high \nrisk of costly retrofits to earlier units in the production run. It \nsounds simple, but this is the problem that for years rendered the \nJoint Strike Fighter Program effectively unexecutable and that led to \nthe terminations of the Army's multibillion-dollar Future Combat \nSystems Program and the Air Force's Expeditionary Combat Support System \nProgram.\n  As to the Littoral Combat Ship, the General Accountability Office \nspelled out this problem in the report it released just a few days ago. \nAccording to the GAO:\n\n       There are significant unknowns related to key LCS \n     operations and support concepts and the relative advantages \n     and disadvantages of the two variants. The potential effect \n     of these unknowns on the program is compounded by the Navy's \n     aggressive acquisition strategy. By the time key tests of \n     integrated LCS capability are completed in several years, the \n     Navy will have procured or have under contract more than half \n     of the planned number of ships. Almost half of the planned \n     ships are already under contract, and the Navy plans to award \n     further contracts in 2016, before the Department of Defense \n     makes a decision about full rate production of the ships. The \n     Navy will not be able to demonstrate that mission packages \n     integrated with the seaframes can meet the minimum \n     performance requirements until operational testing for both \n     variants [the Freedom and the Independence] is completed, \n     currently planned for 2019.\n\n  I repeat: 2019.\n  I again voice my concern that the Navy plans to purchase many, if not \nmost, of the Littoral Combat Ships in the program before knowing \nwhether the ships will work as advertised and as needed.\n  The GAO report's bottom line recommendation is to limit future \nseaframe and mission module purchases until the LCS Program achieves \nkey acquisition and testing milestones that would help make sure that \nthe program delivers required combat capability. I agree completely \nwith the GAO. GAO's concerns are shared by the Pentagon's independent \nchief tester and even the Navy itself, in an internal report called the \n``OPNAV Report'' or ``Perez Report.'' I highly recommend that anyone \nwho has an interest in the Littoral Combat Ship read these reports.\n\n  In terms of the costs to national security and to the taxpayer, we \nsimply cannot afford to continue committing unlimited resources to an \nunproven program that may eventually account for more than one-third of \nthe surface combatant fleet. The LCS seaframe and mission modules are \nat different points along the acquisition life cycle. We need to put a \npause on additional ship purchases and synchronize the plans for \ntesting the seaframes and the mission modules to make sure the Navy is \nexecuting a coherent acquisition strategy that will deliver combat \ncapability responsive to what our operational commanders actually need.\n\n[[Page S6036]]\n\n  Also, the Navy has to lay out a clear top-level plan on how these \nships will be used in response to reasonably foreseeable, relevant \nthreats around the world. In other words, it needs to decide the \nconcept of operation--or CONOPS--that this ship class will support. \nAccording to a declassified internal Navy report released last Tuesday, \n``There are two options: Building a CONOPS''--that means concept of \noperations--``to match LCS' current capabilities or modifying the ship \nto better meet the needs of the Theater Commanders.''\n  The report goes on to say: ``The ship's current characteristics limit \noperations to a greater extent than envisioned by the CONOPS. . . .'' \nThe second option is to ``modify the ship to support the warfighting \nrequirements. Our review identified opportunities to modify several of \nthe ships' characteristics to more closely align with the intent of the \noriginal CONOPS.''\n  Right now, it seems as though whatever combat capability LCS can \nmuster is driving its mission, not the other way around, as in most \nships. In other words, the Littoral Combat Ship appears to be a ship \nlooking for a mission. But just to perform its three currently intended \nprimary missions, the Navy is looking at significant design changes and \nincreasing Littoral Combat Ships' crew size, even though it has already \nbought about 30 percent of all of the LCS ships it intends to buy. That \ncould increase its procurement and life cycle operation and support \ncosts well beyond current estimates and strain its affordability. Given \nhow many frigates, minesweepers, and patrol crafts the Navy currently \nplans to retire over the next 5 years in favor of Littoral Combat \nShips, this is particularly troubling.\n  Notably, the Government Accountability Office also reports: ``Current \nLCS weapon systems are underperforming and offer little chance of \nsurvival in a combat scenario.''\n  In this regard, the Government Accountability Office appears to agree \nwith the Pentagon's chief independent weapons tester. As this top \nPentagon official has noted, before proceeding beyond early production, \nthis program should complete initial operational testing and evaluation \nto determine that it is effective, suitable, and survivable. But LCS is \nnot doing so. Why not? We need an answer to that. If, for whatever \nreason, the Navy believes it must deviate from that practice, what plan \nwill it put in place to mitigate the resulting concurrency risk?\n  Let me be clear. To justify the purchase of the remaining 32 ships in \nthe program, the Navy must first provide credible evidence based on \nrigorous, operationally relevant and realistic testing and evaluation, \nthat this ship will in fact be able to adequately perform its primary \nstated missions and meet combatant commander requirements. Congress \nmust, at a minimum, thoroughly review this program before authorizing \nfunding in fiscal year 2015 to buy the next four LCS's and require the \nSecretary of the Navy to certify, on the basis of sound written \njustification arising from sufficient initial operational testing and \nevaluation, that the LCS ships will be able to adequately perform their \nintended missions and provide our operational commanders with the \ncombat capability they need.\n  The American people are--quite rightly--tired of seeing their \ntaxpayer dollars wasted on disastrous defense programs such as the Air \nForce's failed ECSS Program or the Army's Future Combat System Program \nor the Navy's VH-71 Presidential Helicopter Replacement Program. LCS \nmust not be allowed to become yet another failed program in an already \nunacceptably long list of amorphous acronyms that--after squandering \nliterally billions of taxpayer dollars--have long since lost meaning.\n  On the LCS program, the Navy must right its course--today.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I would like to be recognized for the \npurpose of making brief remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n\n\n                        Workforce Investment Act\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I am pleased to come to the floor--and \nI will be joined shortly by Senator Murray from the State of \nWashington--to announce that tomorrow in the HELP Committee--the \nHealth, Education, Labor & Pensions Committee--we will be introducing \nthe reauthorization of the Workforce Investment Act.\n  Quite honestly, the Workforce Investment Act was passed in 1998 and \nhas not been reauthorized in the last 15 years. During that period of \ntime, our country--particularly in the last 6 years--has gone through a \nsustained period of high unemployment. We also have periods where \nemployers cannot find the match of workers who are actually trained for \nthe jobs they have.\n  Workforce investment and training is important for those with \ndisabilities, those without jobs, those with skill sets that need to be \nimproved, and this bill addresses all of those areas.\n  Senator Murray has been a tireless Senator in working to find common \nground on issues that have been critical to both the Democratic Party \nand the Republican Party but, more important, to the workers of the \nUnited States of America.\n  I wish to pay tribute to her staff who has worked tirelessly with my \nstaff, and I wish to thank Tommy Nguyen on my staff, in particular, for \nhis dedication and hard work.\n  This bill represents a real step forward, and I am pleased that this \nmorning the Business Roundtable issued a release of their endorsement \nof the base bill we are putting forward tomorrow in the committee. \nHopefully, it will be on the floor this fall when we return from the \nsummer recess and we can move forward on job training, job opportunity, \nand lowering the unemployment rate in the United States of America.\n  In particular, I am very pleased this bill provides flexibility to \nour Governors in terms of transferability of funds. It provides for \nbusiness majorities on the board and a business member to be a board \nchairman and the State chairman could also be a businessperson, which \nmeans those who are doing the employing will be those who will be \nguiding the Workforce Investment Act in their State.\n  I am also particularly proud of the fact that we focus on a regional \napproach to workforce investment. So often times, you get so many \nworkforce investment boards in one metropolitan area that you have a \nvery individualized focus and not a regional focus. A regional focus is \nimportant for workers. It is important for all of us.\n  So I am pleased to announce today on my behalf--Senator Isakson on \nthe HELP Committee--that along with Senator Murray, today we are \nintroducing and tomorrow we will mark up in committee the \nreauthorization of the Workforce Investment Act.\n  I look forward to the support of all Members of the Senate to help us \ndo a better job providing jobs for working Americans.\n  I yield back my time and--no, I do not yield back my time. I can brag \nabout Senator Murray while she is here now because I have been saying \nnice things while she was on her way.\n  I thank Senator Murray for her cooperation, the spirit of cooperation \nshe has given us, and the fact that we are\n\n[[Page S6037]]\n\nfinally reaching an agreement between ourselves and our staffs. I met \nwith my side this morning. I know the Senator has done the same. We \nhave a good platform to move forward on the first reauthorization of \nthe Workforce Investment Act since 1998.\n  I defer to the Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I thank the Senator. Senator Isakson \nhas been absolutely great to work with. We have been spending a lot of \ntime on this.\n  Let me make a few remarks.\n  Over the past several weeks and months, we have spent a lot of time \nin the Senate debating everything from the Federal budget to separate \nspending bills, and throughout those debates Members of both parties \nhave agreed it is absolutely critical that we are working to write laws \nand policies that put hardworking Americans back to work, help our \nbusinesses grow and invest, and position our economy to compete and win \nin the 21st century.\n  We have had some disagreement on how to achieve those goals, but as \nour Nation now recovers from the recession, our first priority has to \nbe getting Americans back on the job. So I wish to join with Senator \nIsakson to talk about the tremendous progress we have made in the HELP \nCommittee; that is, the work to reauthorize the Workforce Investment \nAct--and to do just that: put Americans back to work.\n  Before I get to the importance of the bill itself, I do wish to take \nsome time to talk about the bipartisan process we have had at the \ncommittee level to move this forward.\n  From the very beginning of this process I have worked very closely \nwith my Republican cosponsor Senator Isakson, whom you just heard from, \nand though I know we represent very different States with different \nindustries and different issues, we have each remained very committed \nto writing a bill that works for all American businesses and workers.\n  This process has never been about scoring political points or pitting \ninterests against each other. I think it has been a rare and needed \nexample of true bipartisan legislating, and I thank my friend Senator \nIsakson, again, for his hard work and commitment throughout this \nprocess.\n  I also wish to thank our committee chairman and ranking member--\nSenator Harkin and Senator Alexander--who have both worked extensively \non this legislation and have now signed on as cosponsors as well.\n  It has been 15 years since we first passed the Workforce Investment \nAct or WIA. But perhaps more important, it has been a full decade since \nthe legislation was due to be reauthorized. So this law--which was \nfirst written in the late 1990s--was designed to be changed and updated \nback in 2003. Since then, as we all know, our country and our economy \nhave changed a lot.\n  In the late 1990s, the Internet was changing the way we do business \nand driving our economy, and the housing sector was as strong as ever. \nBut as we all know, unfortunately, both of these industries went bust.\n  But back then, we in Congress were willing to take the long view and \nmake meaningful commitments to and investments in our workforce \ndevelopment systems. So back in 1998, we wrote and passed the Workforce \nInvestment Act to help our workers and educators and businesses respond \nto an economy that was changing faster than ever before.\n  Lately, we have not done much of that, but I am very optimistic that \nby improving and reauthorizing WIA, we can get back on track. This is \nthe very law that was written to help us respond to a changing economy \nand provide the framework for our Nation's workforce development \nsystem. But it is still written to address the issues we faced more \nthan 10 years ago.\n  So working with Senators from both sides of the aisle and the \nbusiness, labor, and education communities, we are bringing to our \ncommittee tomorrow a very strong reauthorization bill that brings WIA \ninto the 21st century.\n  This bill puts more than a decade of experience and data to use by \ndoing a few things. It requires a single unified workforce plan in each \nState and replaces all the overlap and confusion between separate State \nagencies.\n  It recognizes that we need data and analysis to understand which \nworkforce programs are working well, what makes them work well and how \nto improve them and, just as important, which programs are \nunderperforming, why, and how to fix them. It makes changes to align \nour workforce systems with regional economic development and labor \nmarkets.\n  This bill is focused on using real-world data to measure the returns \nwe get on our workforce investments, and getting good return on the \nFederal dollars we invest is exactly what Americans are calling for \ntoday.\n  So while we are making important changes to the existing version of \nWIA, I wish to finish my remarks with an example of the incredible \nsuccess this law has already had in helping our economy.\n  Last year, the WIA adult and dislocated worker programs produced some \nremarkable statistics. Over 1 million adults and dislocated workers \nwere placed in jobs. Those workers earned more than $12 billion over \njust the first 6 months of their employment. In that same period, WIA \nfunds spent on those programs came to about $2 billion.\n  Let me say that again. In just 6 months, an investment of $2 billion \nyielded a return of more than $12 billion. So the investments we make \nthrough WIA programs are having an incredible impact on our economy. \nThe important point is we can do more.\n  That is why a lot of organizations across the country have called for \na modernized 21st century version of the Workforce Investment Act--\norganizations such as the National Business Roundtable, the National \nMetropolitan Business Alliance, labor and education leaders, and the \nGreater Seattle Chamber of Commerce in my home State. All of these \norganizations are supporting the efforts we have put together.\n  We are here today to announce to our colleagues that tomorrow we are \ngoing to begin marking up our reauthorization bill in committee, and I \nlook forward to continuing working with my colleagues from both sides \nof the aisle.\n  In a time when bipartisan legislation has become difficult to \nachieve, I hope we can set an example of what we are still capable of \ndoing together to strengthen our country and our economy.\n  I again want to thank Senator Isakson and all those who have worked \nvery hard to put this bill together. I am proud of what we have \naccomplished and look forward to working with him as we move through \nthis process.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        The Affordable Care Act\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise today to talk about an epidemic in \nthe American workforce that has wreaked havoc on our labor markets and \ncaused undue hardship for millions of our Nation's workers. I am \ntalking, of course, about the eradication of the 40-hour workweek \nwrought by the so-called ``Affordable Care Act.''\n  As a result of this poorly named law, businesses around the country \nare instituting hiring freezes, downsizing their workforces or reducing \nworker hours. The President's health law requires employers with 50 or \nmore full-time employees to offer health coverage of a minimum value or \npay a penalty. One of the unintended but not unforeseen consequences of \nthe law is that a number of employers are opting to unilaterally limit \nthe number of full-time employees in order to escape this burdensome \nmandate.\n  The Affordable Care Act defines ``full-time employees'' as those \nworking at least 30 hours a week. As a result of this odd definition, \nnot every employer seeking to avoid paying penalties is laying off \nworkers. Instead, an increasing number of businesses have opted to \nsimply cap workers' hours. This is happening everywhere. For example, a \nrecent Reuters survey of 52 Walmart stores found that half of the \nstores were only hiring temporary\n\n[[Page S6038]]\n\nworkers--something the stores typically only do during the holiday \nshopping season. According to a recent article in the Washington Times, \nWalmart has overall increased the share of its temporary staff from \nbetween 1 and 2 percent last year to 10 percent this year. Keep in mind \nthat Walmart is our Nation's largest employer. Although the company has \ndenied that this change in policy is as a result of ObamaCare, it is \nhard to believe this is all just a coincidence.\n  Small businesses are also being impacted. For instance, there is the \nexample cited recently in the Wall Street Journal where Rod Carstensen, \nan owner of several Del Taco restaurants in the Denver area, was forced \nto shift the majority of his workforce from full time to part time as a \nresult of ObamaCare. Mr. Carstensen previously had 180 full-time \nemployees and only 40 part-time workers. But providing benefits for \nthose workers would have imposed as much as $400,000 a year in \nadditional costs. As a result, he is now in the process of switching to \n80 full-time and 320 part-time workers, none of whom will work more \nthan 28 hours per week.\n  As I said, this is happening everywhere. It is stupid. According to a \nsurvey conducted by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, 71 percent of small \nbusinesses say the President's health law makes it harder to hire new \nemployees. Among small businesses that would be impacted by ObamaCare's \nemployer mandate, 50 percent say they will either have to cut the hours \nof workers currently employed full time or replace their full-time \nemployees with part-timers in order to avoid this vicious mandate.\n  But it is not just happening in the private sector. Public schools, \nStates, and municipalities are also limiting employees to part-time \nwork in order to avoid paying costly benefits. For example, the second \nlargest school district in my home State of Utah recently implemented a \npolicy limiting part-timers to 29 hours a week. According to the \nWashington Post, this impacted roughly 1,200 employees--mostly \nsubstitute teachers. That is 1,200 employees in a single school \ndistrict who will see their hours and their wages capped as a result of \nObamaCare. Likewise, the State of Virginia recently enacted a policy \nreducing the hours for as many as 10,000--10,000--part-time employees \nwho until recently worked more than 30 hours a week. Offering coverage \nto these workers would have cost the State as much as $110 million a \nyear. Understandably, rather than paying those crippling costs, \nVirginia was forced to reduce workers' hours and therefore their pay \nthanks to the demands and the viciousness of ObamaCare.\n  As I stated, this is reaching epidemic levels. It makes you wonder \nwhat is in the brains of those who support ObamaCare.\n  Nationwide, employers have added far more part-time employees in \n2013--averaging 93,000 a month--than full-time workers, which have \naveraged 22,000. Last year the reverse was true.\n  It is not just businesses that are noticing this epidemic. Labor \nunions--some of the largest supporters of the law when it was \noriginally drafted--have also weighed in on the matter. As was widely \nreported earlier this month, the leaders of three prominent labor \nunions sent a letter to the Democratic leaders in both the House and \nthe Senate expressing their concerns about some of the unintended \nconsequences of the ``Affordable Care Act.'' One of their major \nconcerns was that, in their own words:\n\n       The law creates an incentive for employers to keep \n     employees' hours below 30 hours a week. Numerous employers \n     have begun to cut workers' hours to avoid this obligation, \n     and many of them are doing so openly. The impact is two-fold: \n     fewer hours means less pay while also losing our current \n     health benefits.\n\n  According to these union leaders, ObamaCare threatens to ``destroy \nthe foundation of the 40-hour work week that is the back bone of the \nAmerican middle class.'' I could not agree more with that.\n  President Obama is apparently starting to feel some of this pressure. \nIndeed, despite his recent efforts to paint a rosy picture of the \nimpact of the health care law, I think President Obama knows full well \nthat the ``Affordable Care Act'' is not living up to its name. Why else \nwould he decide to delay the implementation of the employer mandate, as \nhe did earlier this month? Obviously, there are political \nconsiderations. The recently announced 1-year delay on the employer \nmandate conveniently puts the implementation of the mandate past the \n2014 midterm elections, so from that perspective I guess it makes \nperfect sense.\n  Setting aside the politics, this delay also makes some sense in terms \nof policy. The epidemic of employers reducing workers' hours is taking \na huge toll on the American workforce. Indeed, the policies established \nunder the health law are killing jobs, reducing wages, and stagnating \ngrowth. That being the case, the bigger question is, Why is the \nPresident only delaying the employer mandate for a single year? Does he \nreally believe these problems will simply go away if businesses have 1 \nadditional year to prepare or is he just thinking to get to the next \nelection and getting his people through who have voted for this?\n  Regardless of when this mandate goes into effect, it is going to send \nshock waves throughout the business community. It is going to eliminate \njobs. It is going to weaken our recovery--weak though it is today. That \nis why, despite the announcement of the 1-year delay, employers \nthroughout the country are refusing to reverse course when it comes to \ndownsizing their workforces and limiting employees' hours. Most news \nreports surrounding this issue are showing that this is precisely the \ncase. That is likely the case for the State of Virginia. It is \ndefinitely the case for my home State of Utah and Utah's Granite School \nDistrict, just to mention one aspect of our problems in Utah.\n  If the President is serious about getting our economy back on track, \nhe should work with Congress to ensure that this mandate never goes \ninto effect. While we are at it, we should also permanently delay the \nindividual mandate. For the life of me, I cannot see why President \nObama would extend his limited lifeline to the business community and \nat the same time leave individuals and their families out in the cold. \nThis is from a President who claims he is for the families and for the \nindividuals and for the poor and for those who are middle class. They \nare being left out in the cold.\n  If businesses are currently facing enough difficulties to necessitate \ndelaying the employer mandate, shouldn't we assume individuals are \ngoing to face similar difficulties complying with the individual \nmandate? Isn't it only fair that we extend the same benefits to \nindividuals and families that are being offered to businesses and \nemployers? Why not get that beyond the next year's election too? Not \naccording to the Obama administration. As it stands today, American \nbusinesses will get a 1-year reprieve from the job-killing employer \nmandate--American businesses. But the American people are still \nsquarely in the sights of ObamaCare, as the individual mandate for them \nremains in place. This is the height of unfairness. It needs to be \nrectified.\n  The House of Representatives for its part has acted responsibly. Two \nweeks ago the House passed two pieces of legislation--two pieces \nrelating to ObamaCare. The first bill would simply codify President \nObama's 1-year delay of the employer mandate. The second would provide \nsimilar relief to individuals and families struggling to comply with \nthe individual mandate. Not surprisingly, President Obama has \nthreatened to veto both bills--even the one that would simply put his \nown administration's policy into statutory form.\n  Still, that should not stop us in the Senate. If we are serious about \nhelping the business community as well as individuals and families, we \nshould work to delay permanently this catastrophic law. If President \nObama wants to officially deny the American people the same type of \nrelief he has given to the business community by not working with \nCongress, then so be it. The Senate needs to act responsibly. If the \nPresident is refusing to do the same, we ought to at least act \nresponsibly.\n  Make no mistake--I do not think a 1-year delay on the employer and \nindividual mandates is enough. We ought to get rid of them both. I am \nthe author of two Senate bills that would repeal both of these \negregious provisions of ObamaCare. In light of the President's recent \nrecognition that the employer mandate should be delayed, I\n\n[[Page S6039]]\n\nhave publicly called for a permanent delay of the implementation of the \nentire law.\n  Given what we know about the problems associated with ObamaCare and, \nquite frankly, given what we do not know, the sensible approach is to \ndelay it permanently and to work together on reform that will actually \nlower health care costs--not just promise to do it but actually do it. \nI believe we can fix these problems for everyone, for employers and for \nindividuals alike, but only if the law is permanently delayed to give \nus a chance to do so. It would give us a chance to be bipartisan for a \nchange around here and work together for the good of this country. That \nis what makes sense. That is what fairness dictates. If we are serious \nabout avoiding what even some of my Democratic colleagues have called a \ntrain wreck, that is the least we can do.\n  I am really concerned about our country. We have increased taxes $1 \ntrillion in ObamaCare. We have increased taxes $600 billion in the \nfiscal cliff legislation. Last week the majority leader and others--the \nPresident, Senator Schumer, and others--called for almost $1 trillion \nmore in tax increases. It would be one thing if all of that money would \ngo to reduce spending or if all of that money would go to balance our \nbudget. But no, they are going to spend every dime of it. Here we are, \nheaded toward problems that we have plenty of illustrative information \non, problems like Greece has gone through and is going through and \nother countries as well that just are profligate when it comes to their \neconomic wherewithal.\n  I like the President personally, but for the life of me, as bright as \nhe is, I do not see why he does not see all of this.\n  I don't see why my colleagues on the other side don't see it--or \nshould I say they ought to see it. They ought to know this is not what \nthe American people want. They would like to have health care, there is \nno question, but this is going to diminish health care all over the \ncountry. We can see the high percentage of doctors who are giving up on \nMedicaid patients. They will not take them anymore. Only this week a \nhigh percentage of doctors are giving up on Medicare patients. They \ndon't wish to take them anymore.\n  What is the administration's answer to all of these spending \nprograms? They are going to cut the providers. Already the providers--\nthe doctors, the hospitals, and the health care providers--are \ncomplaining they can't deliver the services that ObamaCare requires at \nthe low-level costs that ObamaCare gives.\n  We have to come up with a better system. We have to work together. We \ncan't keep going down this pathway.\n  I hope my friends on the other side will wake up and realize: Hey, \nthis game is over.\n  We have to find some way to solve these problems because they are \njust too large. They are going to wreck our country if we don't.\n  What is worse, they are going to hurt the health care of millions and \nmillions of people who will not be able to afford it.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, sitting here listening to the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Utah Mr. Hatch, who in many ways I \nconsider my mentor in the Senate, I couldn't help but reflect on what \nwe were all doing on Christmas Eve at 7 o'clock in the morning of 2009.\n  We were on the floor of the Senate casting a historic vote on the \nPresident's Affordable Care Act, or ObamaCare. Sadly, that piece of \nlegislation became a partisan exercise in power. All the Democrats \nvoted for it and all the Republicans voted against it. It was an \ninauspicious way to start such an important part of reform of our \nhealth care system.\n  The President pretty well got what he wanted. The 2,700-page piece of \nlegislation was made into law with $1 trillion-plus tax increases, with \npromises that if you like what you have, you can keep it, and he \npromised that even families of four could see a reduction in their \nhealth care costs of roughly $2,500 a year.\n  Whether you were against ObamaCare from the beginning, as I was, \nbecause you never believed it would actually work, or you were for it \nand you actually believed that it would perform as advertised and as \npromised, I think everyone has to now acknowledge it has not turned out \nthe way that even some of its most ardent supporters had hoped it \nwould.\n  The first indication, perhaps, was when the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services began to issue waivers, in excess of 1,000 waivers, from \nhaving to comply with the law itself. There were many questions about \nthe basis upon which these waivers were issued. Were they given to \nfriends of the administration and denied to adversaries of the \nadministration?\n  This is what happens when you pass a sweeping piece of legislation \nsuch as this and then cherry-pick who it applies to and who it does not \napply to. This started with the granting of waivers.\n  We found that most recently even the President of the United States \nhas determined the employer mandate--the mandate on employers with more \nthan 50 employees, that they provide this government-designed insurance \npolicy or else they get fined--that even the President has acknowledged \nby his action that delaying the implementation of the employer mandate \nfor a year is having a devastating effect on unemployment in America. \nThe reason we know this is because many employers are simply shedding \njobs so they can get beneath the 50-person threshold for the employer \nmandate or they are taking full-time jobs and making them into part-\ntime jobs. This is causing a lot of people who wish to work and want to \nprovide for their families--it is creating an inability for them to do \nso according to their needs.\n  We know the individual mandate--the House of Representatives has \npassed a piece of legislation that says: If you are going to delay the \nemployer mandate for businesses, shouldn't you show the same \nconsideration for individual Americans who, unless they buy this \ngovernment-approved insurance, will have to pay a penalty? The \nPresident hasn't accepted that delay in the implementation of the law.\n  There is another important piece of legislation that I filed in the \nSenate that the House is also considering this week; that is, given the \nscandals associated with the Internal Revenue Service, the fact that \nclearly the IRS has more on its plate than it is capable of adequately \nperforming, we ought to get the Internal Revenue Service out of the \nimplementation of ObamaCare.\n  With everything else it has to do, especially given the scandals that \nare currently under investigation in both Houses of Congress, we ought \nto be delaying the implementation of that individual mandate. We ought \nto be delaying the implementation of the employer mandate. We ought to \nbe cutting the IRS out of the implementation process for ObamaCare.\n  I confess, I voted against ObamaCare from the very beginning. I voted \nto repeal it every chance we could possibly have, and I voted to \ncosponsor legislation that would defund it.\n  I wish to echo some of the words of the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Utah. At some point those of us who were against it from the very \nbeginning, who would like to repeal it and defund it, have to work \ntogether with our colleagues--who perhaps hoped that it would actually \nwork as advertised--realizing now that even organized labor is writing \nletters to us saying: Please protect us from the provisions of this law \nbecause it is hurting our jobs. It is making it impossible for to us \nkeep the insurance we have.\n  We need to work together to try to come up with a solution at some \npoint. As the distinguished ranking member and the distinguished \nFinance Committee chairman said: The implementation of ObamaCare is \nclearly becoming a train wreck. We don't want to visit the pain of that \ntrain wreck and that failure on the American people but provide them a \nreasonable alternative which will provide people access to high-quality \ncare at a lower cost. There are plenty of great ideas out there.\n\n\n                          THUD Appropriations\n\n  I wish to turn to the appropriations bill that is pending before us. \nLast week, in one of the President's much publicized pivots, the \nPresident turned his attention back to the economy. Of course, most \nAmericans don't have the luxury of pivoting to or from this sluggish \neconomy, which is growing at the\n\n[[Page S6040]]\n\nmost sluggish rate in the history of the American economy since the \nlast depression, the Great Depression. The American people don't have a \nluxury of pivots. They have to live with this sluggish economy and high \nunemployment day after day.\n  We should welcome the President back to this conversation. He has \ntalked a lot about middle-class families, who, as we all would agree, \nare the backbone of our country and a source of immeasurable strength. \nThat said, the President hasn't been a member of the middle class for \nsome time, and I think he, along with some of our colleagues, could use \na refresher.\n  American families set their budgets, and they have to stick with \nthem. In lean times they trim their budgets, and in times of plenty \nthey set money aside for the future should they need it. Astonishingly, \nthis basic principle seems to have been lost on both the President and \nthe author of this legislation.\n  This bill, this underlying appropriations bill, takes the first step \ntoward violating the Budget Control Act, which President Obama himself \nsigned into law in 2011. That law sets very clear limits on spending \nlevels, which the Democratic majority, by bringing this bill to the \nfloor, has chosen to ignore.\n  They ignored it when they wrote their budget earlier this year, and \nthey are ignoring it today with this proposed appropriations bill, \nwhich is 11 percent above the Budget Control Act numbers and 4 percent \nabove the President's own proposed budget itself. That is $54 billion. \nThat is how much this bill would appropriate in discretionary spending \nand is more than $5 billion above the current level of spending for \nthis particular appropriations bill.\n  As I said, it is more than the President himself has requested. It is \nmore than $10 billion above the House bill which, unlike this bill, was \nwritten in accordance with the existing law.\n  I understand, as a negotiating tactic, why our Democratic friends \nmight think highballing the House bill is a good negotiating tactic, \nbut it is a total charade. It violates the Budget Control Act, and the \nAmerican people simply will not go along with it.\n  The American people can't understand why Congress and the Federal \nGovernment are having such a difficult time doing with 2.4 percent less \nthan we spent before the Budget Control Act went into place--2.4 \npercent. Yet here inside the beltway you will hear people talk about \nthe so-called sequester and the Budget Control Act as if it were the \nend of the world.\n  It is not. It is called living within your means, and that is what we \ntried to do when the law was passed and when President Obama signed it. \nI think it is also telling that the majority leader, who basically \ncontrols the agenda on the Senate floor, chose to bring this particular \nbill to the floor before the August recess. We could have passed any \none of a number of other appropriations bills to fund our veterans \nhospitals or to pay our Border Patrol agents.\n  The House and Senate aren't very far apart on the appropriations \nbills that would do that. Conceivably, we could have had them on the \nPresident's desk by the end of this week. Instead, the majority leader \nwould rather leave them in limbo while attempting to pass this bloated \nbill which has zero chance of becoming law.\n  My hope is that as we proceed through this next round of fiscal \ndebate, our friends on the other side of the aisle would demonstrate a \nwillingness to operate within the law and the Budget Control Act. \nUnfortunately, they are not off to a very good start with this \nparticular appropriations bill.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                          For-Profit Colleges\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, Jennifer Kerr was a single mom who wanted \nto improve her family's future. In 2009, she signed up at Vatterott \nCollege. She thought that was the best way to improve her skills and \ntraining and do a better job for her family.\n  She went to the local campus. She told the admissions representative \nthat she wanted to study to become a nurse. The admissions official \ntold her that although the school did not offer a nursing degree, it \ndid offer a medical assistant's degree that would allow her to earn $15 \nto $17 an hour and put her on a fast track to becoming a nurse.\n  After securing more than $27,000 in loans and being in the program \nfor more than a year, Jennifer Kerr learned she wasn't even enrolled in \nthe medical assistant's program--she was in the preliminary medical \noffice assistant's program. If she wanted to continue and pursue the \nmedical assistant's degree, she would need another 30 weeks of study \nand another $10,000 to be paid in tuition.\n  In a gutsy move, Jennifer Kerr sued Vatterott Education Centers for \nmisleading her, even though there was a clause in her contract with the \nschool that said if she ever sued the school and lost, she would be \nresponsible for Vatterott's legal costs.\n  A jury in Missouri decided the school did deceive Jennifer Kerr and \nordered the company to pay back the $27,000 she borrowed for tuition \nand fees. The jury then ordered the company to pay Kerr an additional \n$13 million in punitive damages. The punitive amount the jury awarded \nfar exceeded the maximum under Missouri law, but it showed the sympathy \nof the jury for situations like Jennifer Kerr's. She borrowed tens of \nthousands of dollars to earn a certificate--not even a degree--at a \nfor-profit school that turned out to be virtually worthless.\n  After she left Vatterott, she tried for 6 months to find full-time \nemployment. Earning her medical office assistant's diploma not only put \nher in debt, but it couldn't land her a job anywhere.\n  Taking away the court victory, Jennifer Kerr's story is common to an \nindustry--the for-profit school industry--that frequently uses \nunscrupulous tactics to deceive people who are trying to get an \neducation.\n  Some trade schools provide quality training for reasonable prices. I \nacknowledge that. But throughout the for-profit college industry, \nabuses are well documented. Admissions offices at for-profit schools \nare often a guise for aggressive sales operations targeting students \nfrom low-income families. They end up enrolling, with inflated \nexpectations for their employment and salary prospects upon graduating \nfrom for-profit colleges.\n  Because 96 percent of the students who enroll in for-profit colleges \ntake Federal student loans, nearly all the students who leave these \nfor-profit schools have student debt even when they don't have a degree \nor a diploma that can lead to a job. Most for-profit colleges charge \nsignificantly more in tuition and expenses than similar programs at \ncommunity colleges or even State universities.\n  In 2008 and 2009, more than 1 million students started at schools \nowned by for-profit companies that were examined in an investigation by \nSenator Tom Harkin in the Senate HELP Committee. By mid-2010, 54 \npercent of those students who started at these for-profit schools had \nleft school, without a degree or a certificate. Among associate degree \nstudents, 63 percent dropped out without a degree.\n  Vatterott made national news itself in 2009 and early 2010 when three \nof the top employees of this for-profit school in the Midwest, \nincluding Kevin Earl Woods, the former director of the Kansas City \ncampus, pleaded guilty to a conspiracy to fraudulently obtain Federal \nstudent grants and loans for students who were ineligible for these \nloans.\n  The Senate HELP Committee looked at Vatterott in the course of \nChairman Harkin's investigation of the for-profit industry. What they \nfound was discouraging. In 2009, 88 percent of the revenue going to \nthis for-profit school was Federal money. Of the money it took in, \nVatterott spent 12.5 percent on advertising and marketing and took out \n19 percent of this Federal money in profit.\n  Here is another way to look at it: Vatterott, a for-profit school, \nspent $2,400 per student on instruction in 2009, but it spent $1,343 on \nmarketing, and $2,000 it took out in profit for each student.\n\n[[Page S6041]]\n\n  In contrast, public and nonprofit schools generally spend a higher \namount per student on actual instruction. By comparison, St. Louis \nCommunity College spent $5,000 per student on instruction; Vatterott, \n$2,400.\n  Jennifer attended the Vatterott campus in Independence, MO, which is \nnow closed, but the company continues to operate a Kansas City campus. \nThe default rate on loan repayment for students who attended Vatterott \nin Kansas City is 25 percent. One out of four students who went to this \nfor-profit school defaults on their student loans. The national average \nis 15 percent.\n  Jennifer Kerr fought back and won, but the for-profit college \nindustry won't be cleaned up in the courtroom. Not every student with a \nbad experience has a strong legal case. Most are victims of a system \nthat allows unscrupulous schools to collect Federal loan and grant \nmoney from students regardless of outcomes, heaping debt on these \nstudents. Many of those students will carry that debt for a lifetime.\n  When the programs and the schools don't deliver and jobs don't \nmaterialize, the student gets the debt, the Federal Government bears \nthe risk, and the school takes the money and runs. The for-profit \nsector took in $31 billion in U.S. Department of Education money in \n2011. About one-fourth of all the Federal aid went to these for-profit \nschools, even though they only enroll 12 percent of all the students \ncoming out of high school.\n  I might add one other statistic. The for-profit schools account for \n47 percent of all the student loan defaults in America--12 percent of \nthe students, 25 percent of the Federal aid to education, 47 percent of \nthe student loan defaults.\n  Federal U.S. Department of Education regulations state that schools \nthat engage in substantial misrepresentation about a program, its fees, \nor its job placements can be denied Federal money, and yet Vatterott is \nnot the first or the only school to substantially mislead these \nstudents.\n  Abuses in the for-profit college industry will continue until \nCongress steps up and does something. It is about time for us to \nestablish some standards of accreditation that apply to all schools \nacross the board. How can you expect a student or a student's family to \nknow whether this school that is advertising on the Internet or in the \nbuses or on the billboards is a real school or a phony operation to \nlure kids into debt, have them drop out or end up with a worthless \ndiploma?\n  I have worked with my colleagues who feel as I do on this issue. \nSenators Tom Harkin and Jack Reed, among others, will continue to tell \nthese stories here on the floor of the Senate in the hopes that when \nthe Senate has its higher ed reauthorization bill we will finally \ntackle this for-profit school industry.\n  Last Congress, Senator Tom Harkin joined me in introducing a bill \nthat would include military education benefits in the calculation that \nlimits how much of a school's revenue is derived from Federal funding. \nToday I announced the VA and Defense appropriations bill for the next \nfiscal year. It was reported out of my subcommittee of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee. We called in the representatives of the major \nservices and asked them what is going on with the training of our \nactive servicemembers and their families. What they told us is more \nthan half of those active servicemembers and their families are going \nto these same for-profit schools. Some are good. Most are awful.\n  These military men and women and their families are not only wasting \ntheir time, they are wasting a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity we give \nthem for the proper training and education to prepare them to be even \nbetter in the military or to have success in civilian life. Because \nthey are lured into these for-profit schools, they end up wasting their \ntime, wasting their money, many of them deeply in debt.\n  Senator Hagan of North Carolina has proposed banning schools for \nusing Federal education dollars for marketing. She is right. Many for-\nprofit schools literally take the Federal money to bombard students \nwith messages that entice them to enroll, bringing the schools more \nFederal money.\n  I also want to take a look at the system of accreditation. Our \ncurrent system provides a seal of approval for too many schools, many \nof them for-profit colleges, that is little more than a license to rake \nin the Federal dollars as opposed to truly educating and training \nstudents. I hope Jennifer Kerr's court victory can serve as a wake-up \ncall to Congress so we can work together to correct the worst abuses of \nthis system. On behalf of the taxpayers, we need to be better stewards \nof Federal education money. On behalf of the students, we have to \nimprove a system that may or may not prepare them for a career and may \nor may not lead to a degree, but almost in every case leads to debt.\n\n\n                          Dietary Supplements\n\n  Mr. President, last week USA Today published an article that \nhighlights the stories of people and families hurt by taking a dietary \nsupplement containing the chemical DNP. It is a hazardous pesticide \nthat was used as a weight-loss drug before 1938. Then the FDA declared \nit to be toxic for humans--in 1938, 75 years ago.\n  The article in USA Today featured Matt Cahill, a dietary supplement \nmanufacturer with a high school education and no chemistry training, \nwho illegally added this toxic pesticide, DNP, to exercise and weight-\nloss supplements. Some people who used his product suffered liver \nfailure; some died. Cahill was arrested, criminally prosecuted, and \nserved time in prison, but he is back selling dietary supplements that \nraise more health concerns.\n  The article in USA Today raises serious questions about whether we \ncan do better to protect the American public. Dietary supplements have \nbecome a common health aid in medicine cabinets. More than half of \nAmericans use dietary supplements, and you may be one of them. Most \nsupplement makers are ethical and responsible. I take a multivitamin \nevery day and believe it is safe. But most people assume that \nsupplements on the shelves in stores have been tested by the Federal \nGovernment. How could they get on the shelf without a test? Most people \nthink, like drugs that are prescribed, these supplements are tested for \nsafety and effectiveness. That is not true.\n  Unlike more traditional supplements such as calcium and vitamin C, \nthere are now many new and complex supplements on the market promising \nto help people lose weight, find energy, bulk up, prevent disease--you \nname it. Consumers need to be careful. If a product is promising \nsomething too good to be true, they need to make sure the product and \nits ingredients are safe. We need to know the information on the label \nis not misleading. The FDA, the Federal Drug Administration, needs to \nknow more about these products.\n  This week Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and I are \nreintroducing the Dietary Supplement Labeling Act. Listen to what this \nbill would require. This bill would require more information on labels \nof dietary supplements and it would help ensure that the FDA has the \ninformation it needs if it turns out any of these products are \ndangerous.\n  Many people would be surprised to learn that the FDA does not know--\ndoes not even know--how many dietary supplements are being sold in this \ncountry. The USA Today article clearly states that when this Cahill \ncharacter first sold his harmful dietary supplement tainted with DNP, \nhe sold it on line. The FDA had no idea it was even on the market.\n  How does FDA learn when a product is on the market? People get sick \nand they die.\n  Another example is kava, a root whose extract people take to \nalleviate anxiety. But now that we know that kava is associated with \nsevere liver damage and death, it would be useful for the FDA to have \ninformation readily available about the products on the market in \nAmerica today containing kava. Our bill would require dietary \nsupplement makers to give the FDA the name of each supplement they \nproduce, along with a description of the product, a list of \ningredients, and a copy of the label. Is that too much to ask? If you \nare going to sell this dietary supplement in stores across America, \nshouldn't the Food and Drug Administration at least have a copy of the \nlabel and ingredients? With this information, the FDA would know what \nproducts are on the market, what ingredients are in them, and be able \nto work with supplement manufacturers to address any problems.\n  This is a commonsense provision. It is supported by the Consumers \nUnion\n\n[[Page S6042]]\n\nand already practiced by many responsible supplement makers. Let's ask \nall the companies to provide FDA this basic information.\n  In addition to asking manufacturers to tell the FDA when a product \ngoes on the market, this bill would require more information on the \nlabel of these products. Some ingredients may be safe for the general \npopulation but not for kids or pregnant women or perhaps those who have \na compromised health condition.\n  St. John's wort is used safely by many people, but it can cause \nserious side effects in people who have ADHD or people who are bipolar, \nor people who are undergoing surgery. Information like that should be \nclearly listed on the label. This bill would help to ensure the \ninformation necessary to make an informed decision by consumers.\n  We have all seen claims in supplement stores. I was in Olney train \nstation Saturday night with my wife and went into one of these dietary \nsupplement stores and the shelves were packed with all of these \nproducts claiming all of these things. Some of them promised they will \nboost your immunity, enhance your athletic performance or make you a \nbetter husband. This bill would give the FDA the authority to require \nthe manufacturer to provide upon request the evidence to support claims \nsuch as ``promotes weight loss.''\n  Consumers should be skeptical of any product making big claims and \nthey should take the time to learn if the product is safe and \neffective. But we need to give the FDA the authority to request \nevidence to support any claims made on these labels.\n  The bill would also help curb the growing practice of foods and \nbeverages with potentially unsafe ingredients masquerading as dietary \nsupplements by directing the FDA to establish a definition for \n``conventional foods.''\n  I will challenge you, whether it is West Virginia or Illinois or \nWashington, DC, or your home State, go to the cash register at a gas \nstation. What is the first thing you see next to the cash register? \nEnergy supplements, those little red bottles. They are everywhere. \nProducts such as energy drinks, the huge one in 24- and 32-ounce cans, \nand baked goods, such as Mellow Munchies brownies, that contain \nunapproved food additive melatonin are marketed as dietary supplements \nthat are safe ways to get a boost of energy or to relax. In reality, \nthey are foods and beverages taking advantage of the more relaxed \nregulatory standard for dietary supplements.\n  Here is a quiz. Did you know the Federal Drug Administration \nregulates a food product known as cola? You pick it, Pepsi, Coca-Cola, \nyou name it. Did you know the Food and Drug Administration, in \nregulating that product, regulates how much caffeine they can put in \neach bottle? They do. But when it comes to the monster energy drinks. \nAnd you ask what are the limitations on caffeine in monster energy \ndrinks? None, nada.\n  A sad case here, recently, in Virginia, a girl, 15 or 16 years old, \ntwo 24-ounce high-powered energy drinks in a 24-hour period of time, \nand she died. She died from two energy drinks. Way too much caffeine \nfor a person her age and her size.\n  I am working with Senator Blumenthal to try to get the FDA to \nestablish some standards here. These are not benign products. They are \ncertainly not benign products for young people. If they are consumed in \nquantity, they are dangerous. People get sick and people die. I have \nhad press conferences in Chicago with emergency room physicians. You \nwould be shocked to know how many people show up having taken these \nenergy drinks, consumed too much caffeine, and are worried they are \nabout to die. That is a reality. It is time for us to establish some \nstandards to protect consumers and families.\n  Most dietary supplements available today are safe and are used by \nmillions of Americans as part of a healthy lifestyle. As I said, and \nwill repeatedly, I take my fish oil, I take my multivitamin. I do not \nbelieve I should have to get a prescription to buy them. But we also \nneed to recognize how the regulation of supplements can be improved to \nprotect the public in America. In the USA article, a representative \nfrom the U.S. Antidoping Agency, a nonprofit designated by Congress to \noversee testing of those who participate in the Olympics, said that \ncompanies like Matt Cahill's ``. . . are not fringe players. These are \nmainstream dietary supplement companies and products that are in your \nmainstream health and nutrition stores. . . . It's not there are a few \nbad actors. There are a lot of bad actors.''\n  Ensuring the health of consumers from these bad actors will take \ncooperation from the responsible people in the dietary supplement \nindustry, the Federal Drug Administration, and Congress in both \npolitical parties.\n  Senator Blumenthal and I have put in a bill which includes \ncommonsense steps to make sure risks for supplements are on the label, \nproducts are registered with the FDA, and manufacturers can be forced \nto back up their big claims. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to enact that legislation.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence much a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  I also ask unanimous consent to speak as if in morning business and \nto be permitted to engage in a colloquy with my Republican colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I don't \nintend to object, I would like to modify his unanimous consent request \nand ask that I be permitted to speak for 15 minutes after his colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               ObamaCare\n\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I rise in support of parents, families, \nstudents, employees, taxpayers, and other hard-working Americans, who, \nas of January 1, 2014, will find themselves unfairly impacted by \nObamaCare. ObamaCare is an ill-conceived, poorly crafted, and \neconomically damaging piece of legislation.\n  We have known for some time now that ObamaCare would create a set of \ncircumstances that would make health care unaffordable. It is \nunaffordable from several standpoints: No. 1, for the country and for \nthe U.S. Government. The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan \nentity, recently reported that this law is likely to cost the U.S. \nGovernment about $1.8 trillion over the next 10 years. That is \nsignificantly more--some would say roughly double--than the initial \nestimates given to Congress when this law was passed.\n  This is an enormous amount of money. It is an especially enormous \namount of money for a government that is now $17 trillion in debt and \nis adding to that debt at a rate of about $1 trillion every single \nyear. It is not as though we have an overabundance of money within the \nFederal Government. It is not as though we can afford to take on newer, \nmore expensive programs, such as this one, especially when they run \npricetags that are substantially above and beyond what was presented to \nus.\n  It is also proving to be unaffordable for American families. There \nare a number of studies that have been conducted in recent months which \ntell us that premiums are going to become more expensive. The name of \nthe law, of course, was the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. \nThis implies, of course, this would protect patients and make health \ncare more affordable, not less. What we found is that this is a \nmisnomer. What we have found through the studies that have been \nreleased recently is that it is going to make health care less \naffordable for American families, not more affordable.\n  The interesting thing about these studies is that they are all over \nthe map. We don't know exactly how much health care is going to cost \nus. We don't know exactly how much less affordable health care will \nbecome under the Affordable Care Act because there are so many \nuncertainties created by this law. The 2,700-page bill that became \nObamaCare has been modified and will continue to be modified by \ncountless pages--tens of thousands of pages of regulations.\n\n[[Page S6043]]\n\n  This act has also been modified in significant ways on a couple of \noccasions, which we will get to in a minute. All of these modifications \nhave created additional uncertainty that is a source of a lot of \nconcern to a lot of Americans. What we do know is that it is likely to \nresult in premium increases.\n  One study concluded that even on the low end, the increased premiums \nfamilies would be paying in a small group premium context would go up \nbetween 13 and 23 percent, on average. Other studies--including one \nthat was conducted in the State of Indiana--suggested that premiums \nwould go up in that State by 72 percent for those with individual \nplans. I am told Maryland's biggest health insurance provider has \nproposed raising premiums for individual policies by an average of 25 \npercent next year.\n  In many instances, these numbers are even worse for young people. \nThere are also numbers which suggest that there is a lot of \nuncertainty, and we truly don't know. It is almost impossible to know. \nAn analysis of more than 30 studies has shown that premiums are likely \nto increase between 145 and 189 percent for young people seeking health \ninsurance. In Utah, my State, there is a study suggesting that for \nyoung people seeking health insurance, their premiums are likely to \nincrease between 56 and 90 percent with respect to individual policies.\n  This law is also bad for America's workers. Businesses are cutting \nhours, moving workers to part-time, and in many cases they are not \nhiring at all.\n  According to a recent U.S. Chamber of Commerce survey, 74 percent of \nbusinesses will fire employees or cut hours; 61 percent will not hire \nnext year.\n  Daniel Kessler, who is a professor of law and business at Stanford \nUniversity, has predicted that 30 to 40 million Americans will be \ndirectly harmed by ObamaCare through higher premiums, stiff penalties, \ncutbacks in hours, and job losses.\n  We have known for some time--as a result of these studies--that \nObamaCare was going to make health care unaffordable. We now know it is \nalso going to be fundamentally unfair. The President recently admitted \nthe law is not ready for prime time. He admitted he is not ready to \nimplement the law as it has been written. Because ObamaCare was so \npoorly crafted, he simply is not going to enforce it the way it was \ncrafted. He is going to selectively enforce its provisions.\n  Most important, the President of the United States has said that \nwhile he is going to require hard-working Americans, individuals, to \ncomply with the law's individual mandate. According to one recent \nstudy, only 12 percent of the American people actually support that \nprovision today. However, he is going to implement and enforce that \nprovision, but at least for the first year of the law's full effect \nnext year, he will not be implementing or enforcing the employer \nmandate. So hard-working Americans have to comply but big business does \nnot have to comply.\n  This is significant because the law doesn't give the President of the \nUnited States the power to rewrite the law. The law sets forth a \nspecific set of timelines, a specific set of deadlines that cause the \nlaw's various provisions to kick in. This did not give the President \nthe authority or the discretion to decide which among the law's several \nprovisions could be favored or disfavored by the President of the \nUnited States.\n  So we have hard-working Americans, individuals, and families on the \nhook, and we have big business being thrown a big bone. This is not \nfair. This is not something that is consistent with the rule of law. \nThis is not something the American people ought to tolerate.\n  The Affordable Care Act, as it is called, will shatter not only our \nhard-earned health benefits, but in many instances it will destroy the \nfoundation of the 40-hour workweek that has become the backbone of the \nAmerican middle class. It will do all of this in a way that will \ncontribute to or be part of a system of selective unfair enforcement.\n\n  The American people deserve better. The American people demand \nbetter. The American people deserve not to have this law implemented \nand enforced if, as the President of the United States has told us, it \nis not ready for prime time. Then it is not ready to be implemented.\n  I ask of my friend and colleague, the distinguished junior Senator \nfrom Florida, how he feels about this and how the people in the State \nof Florida feel about the selective implementation and enforcement of a \nlaw that Americans already knew would be unaffordable and a law they \nknow will also be unfair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah for \norganizing this effort.\n  Let me answer that question by coming up with a couple of things we \ncan find consensus on. First of all, I think all of us agree the \nAmerican middle class is one of the things that make us exceptional. \nAll the countries in the world have rich people. Unfortunately, every \ncountry in the world has people who are struggling. But what has made \nAmerica unique and different from all of these other countries is that \nwe have a vibrant middle class. We have people who work hard, make \nenough money to own a home, take their kids on vacations, save for \ncollege expenses, and kind of fulfill many of their dreams.\n  I grew up in that environment. I tell people all the time I didn't \nhave everything I wanted, but we always had everything we needed. \nThrough hard work and sacrifice my parents became part of that great \nAmerican middle class--working-class Americans who had the opportunity \nto give us the life they never had.\n  I think we can all agree the middle class is very important for \nAmerica because it is one of the things that makes us exceptional, \nunique, and sets us apart from the rest of the world. Quite frankly, \none of the reasons why people want to live here and love being in \nAmerica is because it creates those opportunities.\n  What strengthens the middle class? We are having a debate about that \nin this country. Is it a bunch of government spending? Is it a bunch of \ngovernment programs? Is it the Senators? Is it the President of the \nUnited States? The answer is no. What rationally makes the middle class \npossible and vibrant is jobs that pay middle-class salaries. What makes \nit possible is that we have jobs that pay that kind of money so people \ncan join the middle class and give their kids a better life.\n  Where do those jobs come from? Do they come from the government? Do \nthey come from the White House? Do they come from the Senate or from \nour laws? They don't. They come from a vibrant private economy that is \ncreating those jobs. How those jobs are created is not that \ncomplicated. People have to start new businesses or grow a business \nthat already exists. Those are the two primary ways in which middle-\nclass jobs--in fact, most jobs--are created outside of government. That \nis the only place where we will find the kind of growth we need for a \nvibrant middle class. We should analyze every issue before this body \nthrough the lens of the middle class and through the lens of whether it \nmakes it easier or harder for someone to start a business or grow an \nexisting one.\n  Let's examine what the Senator from Utah just asked about ObamaCare \nin the context of what I just explained. The answer is that it is clear \nObamaCare makes it harder for people to start a business or grow an \nexisting business for a number of reasons the Senator has pointed out. \nNo. 1, it has an incentive for businesses not to grow. It tells a \nbusiness owner that if they have more than 50 full-time employees, they \nwill have to meet a set of rules which will make it very expensive for \nthem to start a business or grow an existing business.\n  The other thing it creates is a tremendous amount of uncertainty. It \ngoes back to the point the Senator from Utah raised. These laws are \nbeing canceled on a whim. The President is deciding to enforce one part \nof it but not another part of it. That creates confusion.\n  Imagine if a person has a business and some money set aside to grow, \nthat business owner doesn't know how much it is going to cost to grow. \nYou know what they do? They don't grow the business. As a result, those \njobs are not created.\n  How about the cost of that insurance, which is an issue the Senator \nfrom Utah talked about a moment ago. Yesterday in Florida the \ncommissioner of insurance said that in the individual\n\n[[Page S6044]]\n\nmarketplace in Florida next year--because of ObamaCare--rates are going \nup 30 to 40 percent. Ask yourself: Does that make it easier to start a \nnew business or does it make it harder? Does it make it easier to grow \nan existing business or does it make it harder?\n  Think about the impact all of this uncertainty is going to have on \nmiddle-class workers. Add to that the following: Right now there is an \nincentive to have part-time workers. That is why we are reading \neveryday in the newspapers that company X is moving people from full-\ntime to part-time. Companies are moving employees to less than 30 hours \nso they can avoid the penalties in this bill.\n  How about insurance? Let's say a person works somewhere that has \ninsurance and they are happy with it. This law might require the \nemployer to put that person on a new insurance or move that person to a \ngovernment exchange, which means that doctor that worker has been \ndealing with for 10 years who knows their case history might not be \ntheir doctor next year because of ObamaCare. The result is we have a \nholding pattern.\n  Businesses in America, the people who create the middle-class jobs, \nare in a holding pattern and waiting to see which direction this goes, \nbut they are all headed in a poor direction because of this.\n  So when the Senator from Utah talked about this and asked the \nquestion: What impact is the Senator hearing, that is what I am \nhearing. I am hearing that this law makes it harder for people to \ncreate jobs. This bill is going to make it harder on the middle-class \njobs. It is going to make it harder for middle-class jobs to be created \nbecause it makes it harder to start a business and makes it harder to \ngrow an existing business.\n  I imagine the Senator from Utah has heard similar concerns in his own \nState. The Senator from Texas has joined us, and he is from a State \neven larger than mine. I am sure he will share his input on what he is \nhearing from his home State and from people across the country.\n  I say to my colleague that is what I have been hearing from my \nconstituents everywhere I have been going in Florida for the last 6 \nmonths.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request? I \nunderstand the Senator has the floor until 4:30 p.m.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized at 4:30 \np.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I understand \nthe leader is going to make a request.\n  I wonder if the Senator would withhold his request for a couple of \nminutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I withdraw my request. I am willing to use \ntime perhaps tomorrow.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I see we have been joined by my friend and \ncolleague, the Senator from Texas. I wish to ask him if his \nobservations from his interactions with his constituents in Texas have \nbeen similar to those that have been shared today by the junior Senator \nfrom Florida.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from Utah for \nhis leadership on this issue.\n  I am proud to stand with Senator Lee, Senator Rubio, and with so many \nothers. I can tell my colleagues that in the State of Texas, Texans \noverwhelmingly understand that ObamaCare isn't working, that this \nlegislation is failing and it is hurting the American people.\n  When we look at jobs, there is no legislation currently in effect \nthat is damaging the economy more or damaging jobs more than ObamaCare. \nIn direct response to the law, 41 percent of small business owners have \nheld off plans to hire new employees. Thirty-eight percent said they \npulled back on plans to grow their businesses. The U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce reports that 71 percent of small businesses say ObamaCare \nmakes it harder to hire workers.\n  Beyond that, one of the most pernicious aspects of this law is that \nit is forcing more and more employees to be moved to part-time \nemployment, to be moved to working 29 hours a week or less to get out \nof the ObamaCare 30-hour threshold.\n  In 2013, employers have added more part-time employees, averaging \n93,000 a month, seasonally adjusted, than full-time workers. And it is \nimportant to understand who it is that is moved to part-time work, who \nit is that is hurt by ObamaCare. It is the most vulnerable among us. It \nis not the CEOs. It is not the wealthy. It is young people, Hispanics, \nAfrican Americans, single moms. According to the most recent census \ndata, in 2011 the poverty rate for those who worked full-time was only \n2.8 percent. The poverty rate for those working less than full-time \nyear-round was 16.3 percent.\n  I am reminded of earlier this year when we were debating the issue of \nObamaCare and I read from a newspaper article out of the State of \nOklahoma that quoted a single mom who is working in a fast food \nrestaurant. She and all of her coworkers had their hours forcibly \nreduced to 29 hours a week or less. This single mom said: I have two \nlittle kids at home. I can't feed my kids on 29 hours a week, and \nneither can the other single moms who are struggling to make ends meet.\n  Beyond the impact on jobs, on the economy, and beyond those being \nforced into part-time work, we also have the compliance costs. \nAccording to Federal agency estimates, ObamaCare will add paperwork \nburdens totaling nearly 190 million hours or more every year. To put \nthat in perspective, Mount Rushmore, which took 14 years to build, \ncould be constructed 1,547 times with the paperwork ObamaCare requires \nin 1 year.\n  Not only do we see jobs being hurt, the economy being hurt, workers \nbeing hurt, hours being reduced, paperwork going up, but we are seeing \npremiums going up--premiums going up far too high--and it is hitting \nthose who are suffering the most.\n  On Monday, Florida's insurance commissioner told the Palm Beach Post \nthat insurance rates will rise by 5 to 20 percent in the small-group \nmarket and by 30 to 40 percent in the individual market. As those who \nare at home in Florida watching what is happening, as they are seeing \ntheir insurance rates go up--they are going up because of the impact of \nthis failed law.\n  The Ohio Department of Insurance announced that ObamaCare in Ohio \nwill increase the individual market health premiums by 88 percent. If a \nperson in Ohio right now is seeing their premiums go up, they can thank \nthe men and women of the U.S. Congress.\n  According to the Wyman Firm, looking at young people, young people in \nparticular are hurt by ObamaCare. The Wyman Firm estimates that 80 \npercent of Americans age 21 to 29 earning more than $16,000 will pay \nmore out-of-pocket for coverage under ObamaCare than they pay today. If \nyoung people at home are watching this today and wondering how they are \ngoing to get a job, how they are going to climb the economic ladder, \nhow they are going to achieve the American dream, ObamaCare is driving \nup their health care premiums right now.\n  We all know that at the time ObamaCare was being debated, the \nPresident promised the American people: If you like your health care \nplan, you can keep it. The facts have conclusively proven that wrong. \nAccording to a February 2013 report by the Congressional Budget Office, \n7 million people will lose their employer-sponsored insurance. McKinsey \n& Company, a very well-regarded consulting firm, found that 30 percent \nof employers will definitely or probably stop offering health insurance \nin the years after 2014.\n  This bill isn't working, and I would note there is growing bipartisan \nconsensus on that front. As the facts have come in, the American people \nhave kept an open mind, have looked at this bill, and have seen that as \nit is being implemented, it is not working, it is hurting the economy, \nand it is hurting jobs. According to an ABC-Washington Post poll, in \n2010, 74 percent of moderate conservative Democrats--there are a \nsignificant number of Democrats who describe themselves as moderate or \nconservative--in 2010, 70 percent of them supported ObamaCare. Yet, in \nJuly, just 46 percent supported ObamaCare.\n  Not only that, we have seen the lead Senate author of ObamaCare--a \nsenior Democrat in this body--describe ObamaCare as headed toward a \n``huge train wreck.'' We have seen unions--\n\n[[Page S6045]]\n\nwhich initially supported ObamaCare--over and over turning as they \nrealize the consequences. In April the United Union of Roofers, \nWaterproofers and Allied Workers called for ``repeal or complete reform \nof the Affordable Care Act to protect our employers, our industry, and \nour most important assets, our members and their families.'' If we \nlisten to the voices of unions, unions are saying ObamaCare is failing; \nit is not working. The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers \nreleased a white paper in July explaining that ObamaCare ``threatens to \nharm our members by dismantling multiemployer health plans.'' And \nthen--really quite striking--James Hoffa, Jr., the president of the \nTeamsters Union, wrote a letter to Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi stating \nthat ObamaCare ``will destroy the very health and well-being of our \nmembers along with millions of other hard-working Americans.'' Why? \nWell, Mr. Hoffa explained that ObamaCare is destroying the 40-hour \nworkweek that has been the backbone of the American middle class.\n  If we trust the voices of unions, if we have a concern for the \nAmerican middle class, then listen to the bipartisan voices that are \nrising up saying that ObamaCare isn't working.\n  Most strikingly, we have President Obama himself, who just a few \nweeks ago was forced to unilaterally and without legal authority delay \nimplementation of ObamaCare for large corporations, for companies with \nmore than 50 employees--he unilaterally moved the employer mandate \nuntil after the next election. I would suggest there are at least two \nthings we can derive from President Obama's decision to do that:\n\n  No. 1, if ObamaCare were a good thing, if it were working, we can be \nsure President Obama would want it to go into full effect before the \nnext election. He would want to take credit with the American people \nfor the benefits of this signature bill. The fact that the President \nwas forced to concede that the wheels are coming off and to move the \nemployer mandate until after the next election I would suggest is \nhighly revealing.\n  No. 2, it raises the obvious followup question: Why is President \nObama willing to grant a waiver for giant corporations but not for \nhard-working American families, not for the men and women who are \nstruggling to make ends meet, who are climbing the economic ladder, who \nwant, like their parents and grandparents before them, to achieve the \nAmerican dream? ObamaCare is standing in their way.\n  So what are we to do about it? Well, the most important \nconstitutional check and balance that Congress has on an overreaching \nExecutive is the power of the purse. The Framers of the Constitution \nwisely gave authority over expenditures of money to the Congress, and \nthat is why the Senator from Utah, the Senator from Florida, and I, \namong many others, are standing together and saying: This isn't \nworking, and Congress should defund it.\n  In 62 days the continuing resolution that funds the Federal \nGovernment will expire. Each of the three of us, along with a number of \nothers, has publicly stated that under no circumstances will we support \na continuing resolution that funds one penny of ObamaCare. If 41 \nMembers of this body stand together and make that same statement or if \n218 Members in the House of Representatives stand together and take \nthat same position, we can do something different than we have seen \nthis year.\n  Over the past couple of years we have seen 39, 40, 41 votes to repeal \nObamaCare, all of which have been effectively symbolic because none of \nthem had a real chance of passage. With the continuing resolution, we \nhave a chance to successfully defund ObamaCare. Right now we don't have \nthe votes in this institution. If the vote were held today, we would \nnot hold 41 Senators to defund ObamaCare. But we have 62 days until \nSeptember 30, and every one of us takes very seriously our obligation \nto represent our constituents. If in the next 62 days we see what I \nbelieve we are going to see, which is the American people rising up en \nmasse--hundreds of thousands, millions of Americans standing up and \nsaying: It isn't working, it is hurting our jobs, it is hurting our \neconomy, it is hurting our health care, it is making our lives worse, \nand we need to defund it--if enough Americans speak out and demand of \ntheir elected officials that we do the right thing, I am confident we \nwill. I am confident that Republicans will, and I am hopeful that \nMembers of the Democratic Party will as well, that every one of us \nwill.\n  I believe the American people should hold their elected officials \naccountable, and that most assuredly includes me. It includes all of \nus. We should be held accountable by our constituents. The American \npeople know this bill isn't working. There is bipartisan agreement on \nit. We have the potential in the next 62 days to show real leadership--\nnot to give a speech, not to give a meaningless, symbolic vote, but, if \nwe stand together, to actually defund it.\n  Let me make one final point. Those who disagree with the position \nthat is being taken by Senator Lee and Senator Rubio and me and say \nthat taking this stand will mean Republicans will be blamed for a \ngovernment shutdown, let me be clear on what I think should happen. I \nbelieve the House of Representatives should pass a continuing \nresolution to fund the entirety of the Federal Government except for \nObamaCare and should explicitly prohibit further funding of ObamaCare \nand should adopt the legislation I have introduced as a condition to \nthe continuing resolution.\n  Now, the next step. There will be partisan critics who immediately \ncharge Republicans with threatening to shut down the government. I \nwould suggest that we then take the argument to the American people. \nThe American people should decide. If there are Members of this body \nwho are willing to shut down the Federal Government in order to force \nObamaCare down the throats of the American people, in order to say \nPresident Obama will grant a waiver to giant corporations but not to \nhard-working American families, let's take that argument to the \nAmerican people because I think the American people want economic \ngrowth back. That should be our top priority. Nothing is killing jobs \nmore. Nothing is hurting the American economy more than ObamaCare. \nThere is bipartisan agreement on that.\n  I am hopeful that Members of this body will stand and lead. I thank \nthe Senator from Utah for taking the lead on what I believe is the most \nimportant battle this Congress will confront.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, those of us who share this position feel \nstrongly that it is indisputably, constitutionally the prerogative of \nthe Congress to exercise the power of the purse. This means we don't \nhave to vote to fund something with which we fundamentally disagree.\n  Some have suggested that because this was passed by Congress 3 years \nago, we somehow have an obligation to fund it. Well, I would remind my \ncolleagues who might make that statement that the Congress as it \nexisted then is not the same Congress as it exists today. That was two \nCongresses ago. The Congress that enacted that law was fundamentally \nchanged in part because it enacted that law.\n  The law has not been popular. It has not been good to those who voted \nto enact it. Ever since the majority party in the House of \nRepresentatives changed hands after the 2010 election--due in large \npart to ObamaCare--there have been a lot of people who have suggested \nthat the Republicans in Congress need to defund ObamaCare's \nimplementation and enforcement. For a variety of reasons, that has not \nhappened.\n  We have continued to pass continuing resolutions with no restrictions \non ObamaCare's implementation and enforcement, at least as it relates \nto the ultimate implementation and enforcement of the exchanges, of the \nindividual mandate, and so forth. Republicans have had reasons for \ndoing this. Some of those reasons have included the statement to the \neffect that, well, the Supreme Court is going to knock it down. It will \nstrike it down. It will invalidate ObamaCare because it is \nunconstitutional. Of course it is, and a majority of the Supreme Court \nconcluded that it was unconstitutional as written. But the Supreme \nCourt, rather than invalidating it, instead rewrote the law not just \nonce but twice in order to save it. Some Republicans have also \njustified continuing to vote for funding\n\n[[Page S6046]]\n\nbills that contain ObamaCare implementation funding because they \nbelieved a Republican would be elected President in 2012 and would stop \nObamaCare. Well, that did not happen either.\n  We have one last opportunity to defund the implementation of this law \nbefore these provisions I just mentioned kick in on January 1--one last \nopportunity--and that is in connection with our current spending bill, \nour current continuing resolution that is set to expire on September \n30--just 62 days from right now.\n  So what we are saying is that if you agree with us, if you agree with \nthe President that this law is not ready to be implemented as it was \nwritten, as it was enacted by Congress, if the President is not going \nto follow the law, then the American people should not have to fund it. \nIf you do not like it, if you agree it is not ready, do not fund it. We \ncan and we should and we must fund government but not ObamaCare.\n  So I would ask the Senator from Florida if these are sentiments that \nare consistent with what he has been thinking, sentiments that are \nconsistent with what he has been hearing from his constituents in \nFlorida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, in response to the Senator from Utah, I \nwould say I have because I think there is a pretty clear understanding \ngrowing every day, as evidenced by the Senator from Texas a moment ago, \nwho went through all these groups out there, including labor unions \nthat have now turned on ObamaCare because of what it means to their \nmembers. So it is increasingly established how much damage this law is \ndoing.\n  The question I get, I say to the Senator from Utah, is, What can we \ndo about it? There is almost this resignation by people that, well, \nwhat can we do about it? It is already in place. Is there anything we \ncan do?\n  So I think there are three things we should be able to do, and I will \nsummarize those fairly quickly.\n  The first thing we should do is not continue to double and triple \ndown on these things.\n  I think both the Senator from Texas and the Senator from Utah grew up \nat the same time as I did, so they will remember something that a lot \nof the younger people here probably do not remember. There was a time \nwhen Coca-Cola came out with something called New Coke. It was a new \nCoca-Cola formula. After about 100-some years, they changed the formula \nof Coca-Cola and they came out with something called New Coke. It was a \ndisaster. Everybody hated it. In fact, they hated it because--they \nsaid: If we want to drink something that has that kind of sweetener, \nthere are other options on the market. We like old Coke.\n  What did Coca-Cola do when New Coke began to flounder? They did not \nsay: Well, we are just going to continue to make more of it. They \nbacked away from it. They went back to the original formula. They \nlearned from their mistake, and they did not double down. That is the \nway it is in the real world. That is the way it is in our lives, and \nthat is the way it is in the private sector--but not government, not \nWashington. In Washington, if something is going wrong, here they \ndouble and triple down. It is like an invitation to move forward. We \nshould not do that. That is the first thing I would say.\n  The second thing I would say is that we have to stop this from moving \nforward. The implications of this law are already being felt, but the \nregulations around this law--the mandates in this law, the fees and the \ncosts and the new rate increases in this law, those things, you are \nonly going to start to feel that right now. In the next few months you \nare going to really start to feel what this new law means to your life, \nto your business, to the place where you work.\n  Now is the time to act. People ask me: What can we do about it? Let \nme tell you what is probably not going to work in the short term. You \nare probably not going to get President Obama to sign a bill that \nrepeals ObamaCare, and you are not going to get the votes in the Senate \nto do that. So these repeal votes--I will vote for every single one of \nthem, but the problem is that our chances of getting that accomplished \nare probably minimal so long as President Obama is the President of the \nUnited States. So truly our last option is to stop paying for this \nthing. Why would we continue to pour billions and hundreds of millions \nof taxpayer dollars into a disaster? Why would we double down with your \nhard-earned money on a program that is going to hurt you?\n  We will have a chance to do that in September because in September, \nin order for the government to continue to function, we have to pass \nsomething called a short-term budget. I wish it were a permanent \nbudget, but it is supposed to be a short-term budget. All we are saying \nis, in that short-term budget, fund the government, keep the lights on, \npay the military, make sure Social Security checks go out. The only \nthing you should not do is you should not fund and pay for ObamaCare.\n  The pushback we get from that from some people is, well, that is \ncrazy because that means you are willing to shut down the government \nover ObamaCare. That is not the way I see it. The way I see it is that \nif we pass a budget that pays for everything except for ObamaCare and \nthe President says he will veto that, it is he who wants to shut down \nthe government, it is he who is basically saying: I will shut down the \ngovernment unless it pays for ObamaCare. That is an unreasonable \nposition. It is unreasonable because this law is so bad. His own allies \nare coming to him and saying: Please stop this from moving forward. \nWell, we are going to give you a chance, Mr. President, by refusing to \nfund it.\n  Here is my last point: To my colleagues in the Republican Party--I \nknow every single one of the Senate Members here in the Republican \nParty is against ObamaCare--this is our last chance, our last best \nchance to do something about this. When this thing starts to kick in \nand starts to take root, it is going to be very difficult to undo major \nportions of this despite the damage it is going to create.\n  Now, I only speak for myself, although I think I can speak for the \nother two Senators who have joined me here today in this effort. I want \nto be able to go back to Florida, no matter how this thing turns out, \nand say to the men and women who sent me here in 2010: I did everything \nI could to keep this from happening to you.\n  When someone comes to me and says: I just got moved to part time \nbecause of ObamaCare, I want to be able to look them in the eye and say \nthat I did everything I could.\n  When someone says to me: I just lost the insurance I was happy with; \nI now have this new insurance plan I am not that familiar with, and my \ndoctor, whom I have had for 30 years, is not on that plan, I want to be \nable to say to them that I did everything I could.\n  When someone comes to me and says: I have a pretty successful \nbusiness; I have set some money aside; I was going to open a new \nbusiness or grow this one, but I am not because of ObamaCare, I want to \nbe able to say that I did everything I could.\n  If we pass a budget in September that funds ObamaCare, you did not do \neverything you could. You paid for this. You doubled down on it in ways \nthat will have irreparable harm to our economy and to our country.\n  This is our last best chance.\n  To those who say they are against ObamaCare, I believe you. But let \nme tell you something. If we are not willing to draw a line in the sand \non this issue, then on what issue are we willing to draw a line in the \nsand? If we are not willing to go to the limit on this issue, then what \nissue is there? Is there an issue on which we are prepared to say: We \nwill not move forward because of this? Is there an issue on which we \nare willing to do everything we can and lay it all on the line? Is \nthere such an issue? And if it is not this one, which one is it?\n  That is the choice before us. I truly believe you cannot go back home \nand say you did everything you could to stop ObamaCare if you vote for \na budget that funds it.\n  I would ask the Senator from Texas if he too shares those thoughts \nand those feelings?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I do indeed share those thoughts and \nfeelings and the obligation we owe to our constituents to honor our \nword and put action behind our words.\n\n[[Page S6047]]\n\n  I would ask the Senator from Utah if he would yield for a series of \nthree short questions?\n  Mr. LEE. Surely.\n  Mr. CRUZ. The first question is, There has been much talk of a \nshutdown. Am I correct that we do not have to hypothesize what a \nshutdown would look like, that we, in fact, saw that in 1995 with two \ntemporary, partial shutdowns that occurred when Republicans in the \nHouse stood up to President Clinton?\n  When that occurred in 1995, we saw several things. No. 1, we saw that \nthe parade of horribles that was brought out did not occur. Social \nSecurity checks continued to flow, the military continued to be funded, \ninterest on the debt continued to be paid, planes did not fall out of \nthe sky.\n  Indeed, what occurs--if Democrats decide to block a continuing \nresolution and force a temporary shutdown in order to force ObamaCare \non the American people--is a partial, temporary shutdown where \nnonessential government services get suspended for a period of time, \nnot a shutdown of essential services, such as paying for the men and \nwomen who are fighting in the military and providing Social Security \nchecks. We have seen that in the past; is that correct?\n  Mr. LEE. That is correct. That is correct, and it is how it has \nhappened in the past. This is not something we want. This is not \nsomething we have threatened. This is something we think can and should \nbe avoided and we want to avoid. In the unfortunate, completely \navoidable event that did happen, it would be largely as the Senator \ndescribed it.\n  Mr. CRUZ. A second question I would ask is this: This week we saw the \nrather stunning news that the IRS employees union--the men and women at \nthe IRS charged with enforcing ObamaCare are asking not to be made \nsubject to ObamaCare. Indeed, the union leaders have said to their \nunion members: Draft letters to send to Members of this body, saying \nthat we, the IRS employees union, do not want to be subject to \nObamaCare.\n  Likewise, ObamaCare subjects Members of this body and their staffs to \nObamaCare. I am not aware of a single Senate office that is not deeply \nconcerned about that, that is not facing the prospect of staff quitting \nthe congressional offices because the arms of ObamaCare are so \nsignificant, and there have been many a panicked discussion among \nDemocrats and Republicans about what to do about subjecting Members and \ntheir staff to ObamaCare.\n  My second question of three short questions is, What does it say to \nthe Senator that the IRS employees union is asking: Let us out from \nObamaCare, and that Members and congressional staff are deeply \nconcerned about the harms ObamaCare is going to do to them?\n  Mr. LEE. Well, first of all, that tells me that those who are part of \nthat union do not want to be subject to the same provisions of the same \nlaw they will be enforcing.\n  What it also tells me in the bigger picture is that above all, this \nlaw creates uncertainty. That is why we see so much angst among people \nright here on Capitol Hill who are facing the very real prospect, the \nvery real future in the next few months of going onto these exchanges \nbecause nobody knows what this is going to look like. Nobody has any \nidea.\n  One thing Americans really do not like, in this world of a lot of \nunavoidable uncertainties, is more uncertainties heaped upon them by \ndictate of the Federal Government. We have enough uncertainties in \nlife. We do not know when somebody is going to get sick. We do not know \nwhen accidents are going to happen. So we should be able to avoid those \nthings that government thrusts upon us.\n  This is one of the many reasons why there is so much angst within the \nIRS and within the ranks of the Capitol Hill workforce. People do not \nwant to go onto these exchanges because they have absolutely no idea \nwhat this is going to look like.\n  Mr. CRUZ. My third brief question is, For those in this body who have \ncampaigned at home, who have told their constituents they are opposed \nto ObamaCare, on January 1 the exchanges go up and running, the \nsubsidies begin. And the history of the modern entitlement state is \nthat anytime a subsidy has been put in place, it has proven to be \npolitically virtually impossible to undo. Indeed, no major entitlement \nthat has been implemented in modern times has ever been undone.\n  For those who say they oppose ObamaCare, what is the alternative to \ndefunding ObamaCare with a continuing resolution? Let me ask it a \nseparate way. If we do not defund it, am I correct that come January 1, \nRepublicans will essentially be surrendering that in all likelihood \nObamaCare will be a permanent feature of the economy, hurting the \neconomy, hurting jobs, hurting low-income workers, hurting our health \ncare system? And if that is correct, has any reasonable alternative \nbeen proffered by anyone on this side of the Senate to stop that harm \nother than what you and Senator Rubio and I and others are trying to \ndo?\n  Mr. LEE. Based on historical precedent, we have every reason to \nbelieve that once this new entitlement program kicks in, it is not \ngoing away. It is a one-way ratchet. You have death, taxes, and \nentitlements. Once created, they do not go away.\n  To answer the second part of that question, I am not aware of any \nplan among any Republicans--aside from this one; aside from the plan \nthat says: Do not fund ObamaCare, fund government but not ObamaCare--\nthat would address this issue. I am not aware of any plan. The only \nother plan I am aware of would be one that says: Let's just wait and \nsee what happens. Let's wait and see what a horrible disaster this will \nbe. Let's wait and see how awful this will be for the American people, \nhow utterly intolerable they will find it. And let's just hope that \nwill provide enough political momentum for us perhaps to win elections \nat some unknown point in the future. This is not a good way to run a \ngovernment. This is not a kind thing to do to an unsuspecting public \nwho hopes and expects that we have their best interests at heart.\n  So to all those in this body who support ObamaCare, this argument \nmight not be all that persuasive to you, although you ought to look at \nthe fact that the President, who signed this into law, has said he \nhimself is not ready, is not willing, is not able to enforce and \nimplement the law evenhandedly as it was written. So maybe that ought \nto give you pause as to whether you should fund it.\n  But for those of you in this body who are, in fact, opposed to \nObamaCare, I ask you: How can you oppose it, be against it, and yet \nfund it? So I would invite you to consider the possibility that what \nyou are doing in thinking about funding it is not really where you want \nto go. Consider what might be said about this. Defund it or own it. If \nyou fund it, you are for it.\n  This law was enacted without a meaningful opportunity for the Members \nvoting on it to read it. It is 2,700 pages long. After it was enacted \ninto law, it was rewritten a total of four times: twice by the Supreme \nCourt of the United States, twice more by the President of the United \nStates. The President's rewrite came just a few weeks ago, the Supreme \nCourt's rewrite was over a year ago.\n  But what the President did was acknowledge that this law is not ready \nfor prime time. This law is not ready to implement. This law is not one \nthat he is willing to implement as written. He is going to implement \nand enforce it selectively, holding hard-working Americans, individuals \nand families to the fire, while throwing a big bone to big business.\n  This is not acceptable. This is un-American. This is not something \nthat those of us who purport to be against ObamaCare can support by \nfunding it. So I invite my colleagues to join me in this cause to vote \nto fund government but not ObamaCare.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, even though I disagree with my three \nfriends, I appreciate their sincerity, their advocacy. They are all \nthree very intelligent men, good Senators. But I am going to move on to \nanother subject.\n  I ask unanimous consent that following Senator Coburn's remarks, \nwhich are 15 minutes as I understand it, that all postcloture time on \nCalendar No. 223 be yielded back, and the\n\n[[Page S6048]]\n\nSenate proceed to vote on confirmation of the nomination with no \nintervening action or debate; further that following disposition of \nCalendar No. 223, the Senate proceed to consider the following \nnominations en bloc: 224, 104, 102, and 103; further that there be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided in the usual form prior to cloture \nvotes on Calendar Nos. 224 and 104; that if cloture is invoked on the \nnominations, all postcloture time be yielded back and the Senate \nproceed to vote on confirmation of the nomination with no intervening \naction or debate; further that if Calendar Nos. 223, 224, and 104 are \nconfirmed, the Senate proceed to vote with no intervening action or \ndebate on Calendar No. 102 and 103, in that order; that if cloture is \nnot invoked on Calendar Nos. 224 or 104, Calendar Nos. 102 and 103 be \nreturned to the calendar; further, that if a nomination is confirmed, \nthe motion to reconsider be considered made and laid on the table, with \nno intervening action or debate and no further motions be in order; \nthat any related statements be printed in the Record; that the \nPresident be immediately notified of the Senate's action; further, that \nupon confirmation of Calendar No. 103, the Senate resume legislative \nsession and that all after the first vote be 10 minutes in duration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Agreement--S. 1243\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, finally one last unanimous consent. I ask \nunanimous consent that when the Senate resumes its consideration of S. \n1243 on Wednesday, July 31, the pending amendments be set aside and \nSenator Paul be recognized to offer amendment No. 1739; that there be \n60 minutes of debate equally divided between the proponents and \nopponents; that upon the use or yielding back of that time, the Senate \nproceed to vote in relation to the Paul amendment; further, that no \npoints of order or second-degree amendments be in order to the Paul \namendment prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Reserving the right to object, I am not going to \nobject, but I wanted to ask the majority leader, as you know, we have \nlost a great American, Ambassador Lindy Boggs. Senator Begich and I \njust wanted 10 minutes on the floor sometime today or tomorrow to honor \nher. Could we include that in some agreement for tomorrow?\n  Mr. REID. If we are not able to get it done today, we will do it in \nwrap-up tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                        The Affordable Care Act\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I appreciate having the opportunity to \ntalk about this subject. I also appreciate my colleagues. They are \nabsolutely right in everything they said in terms of the effect of \nObamaCare. I was here when that debate took place. But there are two \ncontentions on which I disagree with them. I thought I would voice them \non the floor.\n  One is one of the quotes from the Senator from Texas: You can thank \nthe men and women of the Congress for ObamaCare.\n  I would just say you can thank the Democrats for ObamaCare because \nthere was not one Republican who voted for it. So it is not the \nCongress that did this; it is the President and his allies who created \nthis mess that we are about to experience.\n  The other thing I disagree with is the fact that you can design a \npiece of legislation that will defund ObamaCare, because the vast \nmajority of it is mandatory spending. So no matter what we did in terms \nof a continuing resolution, and according to the CRS--which I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record after I finish what I \nam talking about--all of the things would continue in terms of the \nimplementation of the Affordable Care Act if we carried out the \nstrategy that is outlined by my colleagues.\n  Now, their motivations are absolutely pure. I have never voted for a \ncontinuing resolution since I have been in the Senate. My American \nConservative Union rating is 99 percent. I would love to defund it. I \nwant somebody to show me a mechanism where we can do that because the \nvast majority of the money being spent today is mandatory spending that \ndoes not come under a spending bill associated with appropriations. It \nwas passed by a law. So the only effective way to truly stop \nObamaCare--and I think we ought to do it. To stop it would be to \ntotally reverse it. We do not have the votes to do that, but we do have \nthe votes to delay it.\n  When you go out and talk about the fact that they are not going to \nimplement the employer mandate but implement the individual mandate, we \ncan have a vote on that in the Senate. Then we can have our colleagues \ngo home and say why they think it is fair to do that. We can actually \nadd that.\n  The fact that they are not going to do a check on the claims for \neligibility under the exchanges, 88 percent of Americans think that is \nwrong. Why do they think it is wrong? Because they know right now, with \nthe earned-income tax credit, between 25 and 34 percent of it is fraud. \nOn the child tax credit it is the same thing. They know exactly the \nsame thing will happen when it comes to credits and payments in the \nexchanges.\n  They also know the Independent Payment Advisory Board is going to \nration care for the vast majority of the Americans. We can have a vote \non that again. A good portion of my colleagues on the other side would \nlike to get rid of that. So we can have a strategic method of delaying \nObamaCare by putting the votes up. But there is no way, according to \nthe Congressional Research Service, that the vast majority of funding \ncan be stopped unless you totally reverse the whole bill.\n  As my colleague said, they did not think President Obama would sign \nthat. So you would have to have 67 votes to let that happen. I spent \nhours on this floor trying to defeat the Affordable Care Act. Many of \nmy colleagues on this side came around to other proposals, the \nPatient's Choice Act, which accomplished many of the same things \nwithout large government, without tremendous cost, and without the \ngovernment getting in between a patient and their doctor.\n  I do have a little bit of experience on that side of the ledger in \nterms of caring for people for the last 25 years as a practicing \nphysician. So I would think it would be important that we have a way. I \ndo not disagree with the intent of what my colleagues want to do. I \nwant to defund this bill, but I also want to do it in a way that kills \nit. There is not a legislative method that we have that is capable of \ndefunding it short of 67 votes in the Senate, short of two-thirds votes \nin the U.S. House.\n  Now, can we put some riders on it to say you will not implement a \ncertain section of it? Yes, as long as it is associated with \ndiscretionary spending. So what I would ask is that my colleagues look \nat what the Congressional Research Service has said and what the \napproach will be based on their analysis of a plan.\n  I believe the vast majority of Americans want us to get rid of this \nbill, this law. They want it reversed. There is a dissonance between \nwhat Americans want and what Congress is willing to give them, much as \nmy colleague said. It is different. But to claim the fact--and I will \nbe with them on not voting for a CR. However, it will not necessarily \nbe for the same right reasons. There are good reasons. I think that is \na terrible way to fund the government, but the fact is, there are a lot \nof ways that we can delay this bill and accomplish what we need to \naccomplish.\n  I don't think we can do the other. I don't believe we can accomplish \nthat. So my colleagues will remember, it was actually 1996 when we had \nthe government shutdown. Everybody was all for it until they were not. \nI voted against reopening the government. Had we held, much like our \ncolleagues want us to hold today, we would not be $17 trillion in debt. \nWe would not have a budget deficit of $800 billion this year. We would \nnot be borrowing $34,000 a second--a second--in this government.\n  But I also know human nature. The very people who say they will do \nthings today, when it gets tough, do not do it. So I praise my \ncolleagues for what they are trying to do. They are right in wanting to \ntry to kill the Affordable Care Act: the costs, the lack of \neffectiveness, the long-term diminution of the doctor-patient \nrelationship, government involved in every aspect of your health care.\n  To have a litmus test of, if I do not agree with the process then I \ndo not\n\n[[Page S6049]]\n\nreally want to defund the Affordable Care Act, that is not a claim that \nsettles very well with me, especially spending the last 4 years trying \nto fight this bill. I would say that the administration is lawless in \nits implementation of this bill, the fact that they are going to pick \nand choose--regardless of what the law says, they are going to pick and \nchoose what they will implement and what they will not.\n  I think it is unacceptable. I think it is unfair to the average \nAmerican. It is certainly unfair to the middle class. It is certainly \nunfair to those people who are trying to get a job today and cannot get \nfull-time employment. We had 334,000 part-time jobs created last year. \nAt this time in the economy, we should be creating 800,000 full-time \njobs a year.\n  They are correct in terms of what it is doing to job creation. They \nare correct in terms of the negatives that it is having on our economy. \nThey are correct about every part of this except whether it will \nactually solve the problem. In contrast to that is what it is that we \nhave done that we can talk about with the American people that has been \npositive? We have actually shrunk the size of the Federal Government. \nFor the first time since 1995, the discredited spending of the Federal \nGovernment is going to decline--for the first time.\n  We ought to use the continuing resolution, in my mind, to accentuate \nthat one positive thing, which is that the reach and impact of the \nFederal Government in everybody's lives should be downgraded, as well \nas with the Affordable Care Act.\n  There is no one perfect way to do this. There will be disagreements, \nbut the fact is we have accomplished some great things with the Budget \nControl Act and with the sequester. What we need to do is improve on \nthat.\n  When I first came to the Senate, the average individual's debt was \n$23,000. It is at $54,000 today. Every man, woman, and child in this \ncountry, if you are born today, by the time you are 20 years of age--if \nyou count unfunded liabilities--you will be responsible for in excess \nof $1 million of debt and unfunded liabilities.\n  Let me say that again. If you are born today, by the time you become \na majority citizen, you will be responsible for debt and unfunded \nliabilities in excess of $1 million. The Affordable Care Act adds to \nthat, but it doesn't add much compared to everything else we have done.\n  We need to rein in this President. I agree. We need to rein in \nspending. We need to rein in the Affordable Care Act. If we could end \nit, I would be for ending it tomorrow. What we need to do is delay it \nto where we can get to the point where we can kill it. It does need to \nbe terminated.\n  There are positive things we need to be doing. There is no question \nthat we ought to make available, without discrimination, health care \nfor people who have preexisting illnesses. Those are positive things. \nWe can do that. There are ways to do it other than the inefficient, \nineffective way this bill does it. They weren't even ever considered \nfor a vote when we had this. There wasn't any real debate on \nalternatives because we weren't allowed to offer them in the Senate.\n  My time has expired. I commend to my colleagues the CRS, \nCongressional Research Study, ``Potential Effects of a Government \nShutdown on Implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable \nCare Act (ACA).''\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, all postcloture time \nis yielded back.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Kent Yoshiho Hirozawa, of New York, to be a Member of the National \nLabor Relations Board?\n  Mr. VITTER.

It is a fair list, and I had hoped we would be able to \nproceed tonight.\n  Regrettably, there is an objection on our side from Senator Coburn.\n  I am, however, optimistic that with further work we will be able to \ndeal with that objection. My hope is that in the morning we will have \nan agreement that will allow me to agree, as the manager on our side, \nto this list. Unfortunately, at this time, I do need to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, before I go further, I want the Senator \nfrom Washington and the Senator from Maine to hear what I am saying; \nthat is, I wish to process amendments. We are going to do one in the \nmorning, which has held up things for some time.\n  There are other amendments pending. We are going to be voting on \nthose. I have no problem with that. This is a piece of legislation we \nshould pass.\n  I heard the ranking member speak on the floor yesterday, but I was so \nimpressed because she said what is true. This is what we are, \nlegislators. When we pass this, everyone knows what the number is if we \npass it.\n  We go to conference. What happens in conference? The numbers change. \nThis\n\n[[Page S6052]]\n\nis the way things should happen around here.\n  I would hope we don't have these lines drawn in the sand and we can \nstart being appropriators again. When I came here many years ago, I was \nso fortunate, only two freshmen were on the Appropriations Committee. I \nwas on it and also Senator Mikulski.\n  I loved that committee all these years. It was so much fun.\n  It hasn't been much fun lately because we haven't had an \nAppropriations Committee that has been functioning decently. Senator \nMikulski and Senator Shelby are legislators. They wish to do \nlegislation as the two managers of this bill do. I would hope we could \nmove forward.\n  I have no problem with the Coburn amendments and Paul amendment. \nLet's vote on them and move on.\n  The time has come when we have to try to get it passed. The week is \ncoming to a close. We have other nominations. We have to move to things \nwhen we get back. We know all the problems we have when we get back. I \nwish to do some more work on appropriations bills when we get back.\n  I ask unanimous consent the mandatory quorum required under rule XXII \nbe waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I welcome this opportunity to speak on the \nfloor about the National Security Agency surveillance programs, their \neffectiveness, and their future.\n  I am proud to be joined by my colleague from Oregon, Senator Wyden, \nwho will comment as well after my remarks. He has been a stalwart \nleader on these issues, and it has been my honor to join forces with \nhim and to draw attention to this very important discussion President \nObama recently welcomed.\n  He called for a public debate on finding the right balance between \nnational security and privacy in the context of NSA's surveillance \nprograms.\n  His call is long overdue, and it is an opportunity we should not \nsquander. As I have said time and time again to Coloradans and as they \nhave said back to me as well, we owe it to the American people to have \nan open, transparent debate about the limits of the Federal \nGovernment's surveillance powers and how we reconcile the need to keep \nour families safe while still respecting our hard-won constitutional \nrights to privacy.\n  Although I would have preferred that this debate would have been \nkicked off by more transparent actions by the White House instead of by \nunauthorized leaks, we are nonetheless presented with a unique \nopportunity--an opportunity to finally have an open dialog about the \nlimits of our government's surveillance powers, particularly those \nrelating to the vast dragnet of Americans' phone records under section \n215 of the PATRIOT Act.\n  This is a debate in which I feel privileged to take part. It is a \ndebate that Senator Wyden has been a part of since before I was elected \nto the Congress and one that I have been engaged in for a number of \nyears now.\n  I want to be clear. I have acted in every possible way that I could \nwithin the confines of our rules that protect classified information to \noppose these practices and bring them to light for the American people. \nI have fought against overly intrusive sections of the PATRIOT Act and \nthe FISA Amendments Act and registered objections repeatedly with the \nadministration. I believe these efforts are critical for protecting our \nprivacy and also ensuring our national security.\n  I serve on both the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Senate \nIntelligence Committee, and in those assignments I focus every day on \nkeeping Americans safe, at home and abroad. I recognize that we still \nlive in a world where terrorism is a serious threat to our country, to \nour economy, and to American lives. Make no mistake, our government \nneeds the appropriate surveillance and antiterrorism tools to combat \nthe serious threats to our Nation. But it is up to the White House and \nCongress to ensure that these tools strike the right balance between \nkeeping us safe and protecting our constitutional right to privacy. \nThis is a balance I know we can achieve, but, in my view, the PATRIOT \nAct's bulk phone records collection program does not achieve that \nbalance. That is why I am here on the Senate floor with my colleague \nSenator Wyden to call for an end to the bulk phone records collection \nprogram, as we know it today.\n  Two years ago we were here on the Senate floor considering extending \ncertain PATRIOT Act provisions. At that time I argued that the sweeping \nsurveillance powers we were debating did not contain sufficient \nsafeguards to preserve the privacy rights of Americans. In particular, \nI argued that the PATRIOT Act's business records provision--or section \n215--permits the collection of records on law-abiding Americans who \nhave no connection to terrorism or espionage. As I said at that time, \nwe ought to be able to at least agree that an investigation under \nPATRIOT Act powers should have a terrorist- or espionage-related focus.\n  We all agree that the intelligence community needs effective tools to \ncombat terrorism, but we must provide those tools in a way that also \nprotects the constitutional freedoms of our people and that lives up to \nthe standard of transparency our democracy demands. The Bill of Rights \nis the strongest document we have. Another way to put it: It is the \nbiggest, baddest weapon we have. We need to stand with the Bill of \nRights and in this case the Fourth Amendment.\n  Following Mr. Snowden's actions and the subsequent declassification \nof information concerning the NSA's surveillance programs, Americans in \nrecent weeks are coming to understand what it means when section 215 of \nthe PATRIOT Act says the government can obtain ``any tangible thing'' \nrelevant to a national security investigation. That is the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court's way of saying that section 215 \npermits the collection of millions of Americans' phone records on a \ndaily, ongoing basis. As a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, \nI have repeatedly expressed concern that the FISA Court's secret \ninterpretation of this provision of the PATRIOT Act is at odds with the \nplain meaning of the law. This secrecy has prevented Americans from \nunderstanding how this law is being implemented in their name.\n  In my view and the view of many Americans, this large-scale \ncollection of information by the government has very significant \nprivacy implications for all of us. What do I mean by that? Information \nabout our phone calls--or, as it is known, ``metadata''--may sound \npretty simple and innocuous, but I believe that when law-abiding \nAmericans call up their friends, family, doctors, religious leaders, or \nanyone else, the information on whom they call, when they call, and \nwhere they call is private information and should be subject to strong \nprivacy protections.\n\n[[Page S6053]]\n\n  I have heard it said that the bulk phone records program collects \nnothing beyond what you could find in a phone book. But let's be clear \nabout exactly what this program does. It collects the very personal \ndetails of our phone calls--the who, where, when, and how long--and \nstores them in a database. This doesn't just happen for those who are \nsuspected of having some connection to terrorism; this program collects \nthe phone records of literally millions of Americans. This is a far \ngreater intrusion into our privacy than being voluntarily listed in the \nYellow Pages, and it is the reason why I am calling on the White House \nand Congress to immediately reform this program.\n  Let me reiterate that it is absolutely possible to have both privacy \nand security. Yet, in the case of the bulk phone records collection \nprogram, Senator Wyden and I believe we aren't getting enough of \neither. Not only does this program unreasonably intrude on Americans' \nprivacy, but it also does so without achieving the alleged security \ngains. For instance, in recent weeks the intelligence community has \nmade new assertions about the value of recently declassified NSA \nsurveillance programs, but in doing so they have conflated two \nprograms: section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act \nregarding foreigners' Internet communications and section 215 of the \nPATRIOT Act regarding bulk phone records. It appears, however, that the \nbulk phone records collection program alone played little or no role in \ndisrupting terrorist plots--I say this as someone who has been fully \nbriefed on these terror-related events--nor has it been demonstrated \nthat this program even provides any uniquely valuable intelligence. \nTherefore, saying, as the intelligence community has, that ``these \nprograms'' together have disrupted ``dozens of potential terrorist \nplots'' is misleading.\n  While the intelligence community has been conflating these two \nprograms, some of my colleagues in Congress in recent days have been \ngoing even further to say that the phone records program alone has been \ngreatly successful. They have said it has saved lives and prevented \ndozens of terrorist plots. As someone who has been presented with the \nsame information as my colleagues on the much-discussed 54 terror-\nrelated events, I have to say I disagree. Again, I have seen no \nevidence that the bulk phone records collection program alone has \nplayed a meaningful role, if any, in disrupting terrorist plots.\n\n  I have yet to see any convincing reason why agencies investigating \nterrorism cannot simply obtain information directly from phone \ncompanies using a regular court order. It may be more convenient for \nthe NSA to collect phone records in bulk rather than asking phone \ncompanies to search for specific phone numbers, but convenience alone \ncannot justify the collection of the personal information of millions \nof innocent, ordinary, law-abiding Americans, especially when the same \nor more information can be obtained using less intrusive methods. A few \nhundred court orders per year would clearly not overwhelm the FISA \nCourt, and the law already allows for emergency authorizations to get \nthese records quickly in urgent circumstances.\n  Senator Wyden and I are not alone in believing there is a more \neffective and less intrusive way to collect this information. Even \nbefore the nature of the bulk phone records collection program was \ndeclassified, there was support for narrowing the language of section \n215 from many Members of Congress of both political parties. In fact, \nwhen the PATRIOT Act reauthorization passed the Senate in 2005 by \nunanimous consent, it included commonsense language that would have \nlimited the government's ability to collect Americans' personal \ninformation unless there is a demonstrated link to terrorism or \nespionage. That language was designed to, among other things, protect \nour Fourth Amendment constitutional rights and put a check on \ngovernment power. While that language did not make it into the final \nconference bill, it demonstrated that bipartisan agreement on reforms \nto section 215 is possible.\n  Let's fast forward to 2011, when the Senate again took up the \nextension of a number of expiring provisions of the PATRIOT Act. I \noffered an amendment drawn directly from language in the 2005 Senate-\npassed bill to narrow the application of this provision. That \namendment, unfortunately, did not receive a vote. But this Congress I \nintroduced bipartisan legislation with Senator Wyden based on that same \nlanguage and principles, and we are now joined by a strong bipartisan \ngroup of our colleagues from across the country and all along the \npolitical spectrum, including Senators Durbin, Murkowski, Begich, Tom \nUdall, Merkley, Lee, and Heinrich. Our bill will responsibly narrow the \nPATRIOT Act's section 215 collection authority to make it less \nintrusive on the privacy of law-abiding Americans. Our legislation \nwould still allow law enforcement and intelligence agencies to use the \nPATRIOT Act to obtain a wide range of records in the course of \nterrorism- and espionage-related investigations, but it would require \nthem to demonstrate that the records are in some way connected to \nterrorism or clandestine intelligence activities--which is not the case \ntoday.\n  This past week there was a strong bipartisan vote in the U.S. House \nof Representatives to curtail NSA's bulk phone records collection. \nAlthough the legislation didn't pass, the American people are demanding \naction and those who share our concerns are on the march. It is time to \ntake action.\n  It is common sense that our law enforcement agencies should have \nreason to suspect a connection between the records they are seeking and \na terrorism or espionage investigation before using these broad \nauthorities to collect the private information of Americans. If the \ngovernment can use these powers to collect information on people who \nhave no connection to terrorism, then where does it end? Is there no \namount of information that our government can collect that would be off \nlimits? What is next--our medical records?\n  We must be able to put in place reasonable measures that allow our \nlaw enforcement agencies to pursue enemies who would try to harm us, \nwhile protecting our rights as Americans.\n  That is why I believe if an investigation cannot assert some nexus to \nterrorism or espionage, then the Government should keep its hands off \nthe phone records of law-abiding Americans. These are the kinds of \nreasonable, commonsense limits on the Government's powers that \nColoradoans tell me are necessary to keep us safe while also respecting \nour privacy.\n  That takes me back to the statement I made at the outset. I believe \nit is time to end the bulk collection program as we know it. Tonight I \nam calling on the White House to begin to make the administrative \nchanges to end the bulk collection of Americans' phone records and to \nconduct the program instead through direct queries to phone companies \nwhere there is a connection to terrorism or espionage. Under this \ntargeted approach, our Government would retain its broad authorities to \ninvestigate terrorism while ordinary Americans will be protected from \noverly intrusive surveillance activities.\n  Congress should support the administration's move in this direction \nby passing our legislation to end bulk collection. Passage of our \nbipartisan bill would prevent unwarranted future breaches of Americans' \nprivacy rights and focus on the real threats to our national security.\n  Taking into account the serious privacy concerns raised by the bulk \ncollection program, the lack of demonstrated unique value of the \nprogram, and our ability through direct queries to the phone companies \nto collect the data in the same but less intrusive way, I believe the \nadministration--I hope the administration will see the value in working \nwith Congress to end the bulk collection of phone records conducted \nunder the PATRIOT Act's section 215 authorities. I pledge to work with \nthe administration and all of my colleagues to see this through.\n  Let me end on this note. We need to strike a better balance between \nprotecting our country against the threat of terrorism and defending \nour constitutional rights. The bulk records collection program as we \nknow it today does not meet this balance test, and that is why I \nbelieve it must end.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, before he leaves the floor, I want to \ntell\n\n[[Page S6054]]\n\nSenator Udall how much I have appreciated having him in that \nintelligence room, because he has been a strong advocate for making \nsure our country can have security and liberty in those classified \nmeetings, just as he has done tonight. It is great to have him on the \ncommittee and to have him as a partner in these efforts.\n  He is so right when he stated tonight that this is a debate that \nshould have begun long ago. It is a debate that should have been \nstarted by elected officials and not by a government contractor. I very \nmuch appreciate the Senator's remarks. I think he made it clear that we \nare going to stay at this until we get it fixed, and I very much \nappreciate his leadership.\n  As Senator Udall has made clear, these issues are about as important \nas it gets. When you are talking about how you can secure these bedrock \nAmerican values--security and liberty--this is right at the heart of \nwhat Americans care about most. For too long, my view is the American \npeople have essentially been presented with false choices. Americans \nhave been told they can have one or the other: They can have security \nor they can have liberty, but they cannot have both. Suffice it to say, \nin the last 8 weeks, as this debate has evolved, I think Americans have \ncome to understand that this set of false choices is not what this \ndebate is all about, and they deserve better.\n  As this debate has unfolded, whether you are in a lunchroom at work \nor a senior citizens center or you are looking at a political opinion \npoll, the polls have changed something like 20 points just in the last \nfew weeks, with Americans saying, particularly, that the bulk phone \nrecords collection program is an intrusion on the rights of law-abiding \nAmericans. Whether it is what citizens say at townhall meetings or what \nthey say in the company lunchroom or in senior citizens centers, \nAmericans have come to understand that these false choices are not what \nthe discussion is all about. Americans have come to figure it out.\n  Frankly, a big part of the problem in the past--and I documented it \nlast week--is leaders in the intelligence community have made \nmisleading statements, repeatedly. It is not just a question of keeping \nthe American people in the dark--which was true--but the American \npeople were actively misled on a number of occasions.\n  Senator Udall and I have been walking everyone through that. The bulk \nphone records collection program is often compared to a grand jury \nsubpoena approach. That is about as far-fetched as it gets. Even \nnational security lawyers have made fun of that kind of argument in \npublications such as the Wall Street Journal.\n  Very often when I talk to lawyers--the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer is, of course, a particularly illustrious lawyer and has taught \nin the field. I often say when I am visiting with lawyers, or I ask for \na show of hands: Does anybody know of a grand jury subpoena where you \ncan have the bulk collection of millions of phone records of law-\nabiding Americans? Come on up to me and tell me after the meeting is \nover.\n  I do not exactly get swarmed. The reason is there are not any.\n  One of the reasons I wanted to touch on these misleading statements \nis that, just in the last few days--Senator Udall touched on this--\nthere has been an effort to commingle the two programs. One of them is \ncalled the FISA 702 Program, the PRISM Program, which targets \nforeigners and has useful value. We have made that clear. It can be \nimproved. I came to that conclusion when I was finally able to get \ndeclassified a finding from the FISA Court that on at least one \noccasion the Fourth Amendment had been violated in connection with the \nuse of the 702 Program. But even with that, I am of the view that \nprovides useful value.\n  But what a number of the leaders of the intelligence community have \ndone is essentially commingled their advocacy of these programs so that \n702 and the bulk collection program essentially ride together, when in \nreality, 702--which Senator Udall and I have supported--I think we can \nimprove it with these privacy reforms--in effect, 702 does all the \nwork. The bulk collection program, which does intrude on the rights of \nmillions of law-abiding Americans, is essentially along for the ride. \nBut you would not know that when you hear these statements from a \nnumber of the leaders in the intelligence community, when they just say \n``these programs,'' of course, are what keeps us safe.\n\n  In addition, I thought it was important to briefly start this evening \nby mentioning that over the last few days there have been a number of \ncomments about whether the PATRIOT Act has violated the rights of \nAmericans with respect to this bulk collection program. A number of \ncommentators and others have said: ``Where are the violations? I \nhaven't seen any violations.''\n  The Director of National Intelligence said last Friday, in a letter \nto you and me and Senator Udall and 23 other of our colleagues: Yes, \nthere have been violations of the PATRIOT Act--when he said \nspecifically that the Government had violated court orders on the bulk \ncollection of those phone records.\n  I am not allowed to discuss the classified nature of that, but I want \nto make sure those who are following this debate know that from my \nvantage point, reading those documents that are classified, these \nviolations are more serious than have been stated by the intelligence \ncommunity, and in my view that is very troubling. So I do hope Senators \nwill go to the Intelligence Committee and ask to see those classified \ndocuments because I think when they read them--I think they will come \nto the conclusion to which I have come that, not only is what was \nstated by the Director of National Intelligence in that letter that was \nsent to you and me and Senator Udall and 23 other Senators--not only \nwas that correct, but I think Senators who read those classified \ndocuments will also come to the conclusion that the violations are more \nserious than they thought--than the intelligence community portrayed.\n  Let me, if I might, talk a little bit more about why we spent several \nyears examining this bulk phone records program. First, I think it is \nimportant for citizens to know that the ability to conduct this secret \nsurveillance that lays bare the personal lives of millions of law-\nabiding Americans, coupled with the ability to conjure up these legal \ntheories as to why this is acceptable, and then have such limited \noversight through this one-sided adversarial FISA Court, in my view, is \nan opportunity for unprecedented control over the private lives of \nAmericans. That is why Senator Udall and I have spent all this time \nfocused on this issue.\n  I thought also tonight, and having done this before, I will provide a \nlittle more history as to how we got to this particular place. When I \ncame to the Senate early on I had a chance to work with a number of \ncolleagues who saw the extent of these problems--early on. One of them \nwas our former colleague, Senator Russ Feingold.\n  Senator Feingold saw the problems that the PATRIOT Act posed before \nthey were apparent to many Senators. He and his staff took the \nresponsibility to protect both American security and American liberties \nvery seriously. In 2007, the two of us came to understand that the \nPATRIOT Act was being secretly interpreted to justify the bulk \ncollection of Americans' records, and we made it clear that we thought, \nfirst of all, that was something very different from what Americans \nthought was going on.\n  We thought it was very different, for example, from the plain reading \nof section 215 of the PATRIOT Act, and we thought that the language of \nthe PATRIOT Act had been stretched beyond recognition because the \nlanguage in the PATRIOT Act spoke to relevance and a sense that it was \nrelevant to suspected terror activity, rather than something that \ncreated this enormous leap from what was in the statute that called for \nrelevance to collecting millions and millions of records on law-abiding \npeople.\n  So Senator Feingold and I dutifully set about to write classified \nletters to senior officials urging them to make their official \ninterpretation of the PATRIOT Act public. We said at the time that for \nintelligence activities to be sustainable and effective, they have to \nbe based on publicly understood laws and be consistent with Americans' \nunderstanding of their own privacy rights. This, in our view, was \nclearly not the case with the bulk records collection because, of \ncourse, the government's official interpretation of the\n\n[[Page S6055]]\n\nPATRIOT Act was a tightly guarded secret.\n  Back then in those early days we were rebuffed when we made repeated \nrequests that the intelligence community inform the public what the \ngovernment had secretly decided the law actually meant. In fact, there \nwas a secret court opinion that authorized massive dragnet domestic \nsurveillance, and the American people, by that point, were essentially \nin the dark about what their government was doing with respect to \ninterpreting an important law.\n  In 2009, as the expiration of the date for the PATRIOT Act \napproached, Senator Feingold and I began to caution our colleagues and \nthe public that our people were not getting the full story about the \nPATRIOT Act. At that time, we'd had the good fortune of having our \ncolleague, Senator Durbin, on the committee, and we all wrote public \nletters. We authored various articles. We wrote editorial pages for the \nnewspapers and made statements for the Congressional Record. We raised \nissues about this to the extent we could at public hearings. But, of \ncourse, the Senate rules regarding the protection of classified \ninformation limited what we could say.\n  One point I have tried to make clear is the intelligence rules--the \nclassification rules don't let a member of the committee tap the truth \nout in Morse Code. We have to comply with the rules, and they are very \nlaborious. If we don't comply with the rules, we cannot serve on the \nIntelligence Committee and be a watchdog for some of these efforts that \nwe think goes right to the heart of protecting American security and \nAmerican liberty.\n  So we decided--a small group of us who shared these views--if we \nwanted to have the opportunity to play that watchdog rule, we needed to \nwork within the rules. So we did everything we could--recognizing that \nwe can't tap out classified information in Morse Code--to alert the \npublic about what was going on.\n  After a series of short-term extensions, the PATRIOT Act came up for \na long-term reauthorization in the spring of 2011. By that time, \nSenator Feingold had been replaced on the committee by Senator Udall. \nHe, as my colleagues know, shares these concerns about the bulk \ncollection of phone records on millions of law-abiding Americans, and \nwe are lucky he has been a prominent leader in the cause of protecting, \nsecurity, and liberty.\n  During the 2011 reauthorization, Senator Udall and I spoke to \ncolleagues. We invited colleagues to secure settings so we could lay \nout what was actually happening, and many of those colleagues joined us \non the floor to oppose the extension of the PATRIOT Act for 4 more \nyears.\n  During that debate, I came to the floor and said:\n\n       When the American people find out how their government has \n     secretly interpreted the PATRIOT Act, they will be stunned \n     and they will be angry.\n\n  That week the Senate voted to extend the PATRIOT Act until 2015, but \nthose of us who opposed the extension continued the fight in the months \nthat followed.\n  At that time the NSA was also conducting a bulk e-mail records \nprogram in addition to the bulk phone records program that is ongoing \ntoday. Senator Udall and I were concerned about this program's impact \non our liberties and our privacy rights, and back in the Intelligence \nCommittee, we spent a big chunk of 2011 pressing intelligence officials \nto provide evidence of its effectiveness. It turned out that the \nintelligence community was unable to provide any such evidence. \nIntelligence agencies have made statements to both Congress and the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Court that--they had significantly \nexaggerated the effectiveness of the bulk e-mail program. When Senator \nUdall and I pressed them to back up these statements, they couldn't do \nit. The bulk e-mail records program was shut down that year.\n  Our experience with the bulk e-mail records program showed us that \nthe Intelligence Agency's assessments about the usefulness of a number \nof these particular programs, even big ones, are not always accurate. \nNow, that doesn't mean that intelligence officials were deliberately \nlying. In a number of instances--as far as I could tell--they believed \ntheir claims that the bulk e-mail surveillance program was effective, \neven though it was actually close to worthless. This was an important \nreminder that even if intelligence officials are well intentioned, they \ncan be dead wrong, and that any policymaker who simply defers to \nintelligence officials' conclusions without asking to see their \nevidence is making a mistake.\n  As we looked at that evidence, Senator Udall and I found that the \nclaims about the effectiveness of the bulk phone records program also \ndid not seem well supported by the facts. So in March of 2012, we wrote \nto the Attorney General expressly with this concern. In our letter we \nsaid:\n\n       In recent months we have grown increasingly skeptical about \n     the actual value of [this] ``intelligence collection \n     operation.''\n\n  And we added:\n\n       This has come as a surprise to us, as we were initially \n     inclined to take the executive branch's assertions about the \n     importance of this ``operation'' at face value.\n\n  The Department of Justice, unfortunately, decided not to respond to \nour letter, but we continued our efforts to educate the public and to \ncall out senior officials from intelligence agencies and the Department \nof Justice as they repeatedly made misleading statements about domestic \nsurveillance.\n  In June of this year, disclosures by the Washington Post and the \nGuardian newspaper revealed the fact of bulk collection to the American \npeople. This sparked the debate that is now ongoing about whether \noffering up the personal records of ordinary Americans is the best way \nto protect our security and our liberty. This debate--as I indicated \nwhen Senator Udall was on the floor--should have started a long time \nago, but I am sure glad it is finally happening now.\n  The fact is that Americans' phone records can reveal a lot of private \ninformation. If you know, for example, that somebody called a \npsychiatrist three times in a week and twice after midnight, you know a \nlot about that person. If you are vacuuming up information on whom \nAmericans call, when they call, and how long they talked, you are \ncollecting an astounding amount of information about a huge number of \nlaw-abiding Americans.\n  The intelligence agencies try to emphasize that they have rules about \nwho can look at these bulk phone records and when. There has been a lot \nsaid on cable by the talking heads on TV, and I want to emphasize, none \nof these rules require the NSA to go back to a court to look at \nAmericans' phone records. None of these rules erase the privacy impact \nof scooping up all of these records in the first place. On top of that, \nas I indicated in the beginning, there have been a number of serious \nviolations of those rules.\n  The Senators who got the letter last Friday know that, and I want to \ntell all the other Senators on both sides of the aisle that the \nviolations--as I have touched on tonight--were a lot more serious than \nthe public has been told. I believe the American people deserve to know \nmore details about these violations that were described last Friday by \nDirector Clapper.\n\n  I am going to keep pressing to make more of these details public. It \nis my view that the information about the details of the violations of \nthe court orders with respect to the bulk phone record collection \nprogram--the admission that the court orders have been violated--has \nnot been, I think, fully fleshed out by the intelligence community. I \nthink a considerable amount of additional information can be offered \nwithout in any way compromising our national security.\n  If the impact on America's liberties wasn't bad enough, it is made \neven worse by the fact that this program--when we asked and asked--does \nnot seem to have any unique value. I will explain briefly what it \nmeans.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 7 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Donnelly). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I will see if I can beat the clock because \nI know colleagues are waiting. In fact, Senator Baldwin has been a \ngreat advocate for liberties and showing that liberty and security are \ncompatible, both when she was a Member of the other body and here when \nshe was part of our group, and I thank her for it.\n  Intelligence officials can only point to two cases where this \nprogram--the\n\n[[Page S6056]]\n\nbulk phone records collection program--actually provided useful \ninformation about an individual involved in terrorist activity. In both \nof these cases, the government had all the information it needed to go \nto the phone company and get an individual court order and emergency \nauthorization for the phone records they needed.\n  In both of these cases, the individuals who were identified using \nthese phone records were arrested months or years after they were first \nidentified, but if government agents believed that the situation was \nurgent, they could have used emergency authorizations to obtain their \nphone records more quickly. I am glad both of these cases resolved the \nway they did. I am proud that our intelligence agencies and law \nenforcement individuals were able to identify and arrest those who were \ninvolved in terrorist acts.\n  In one case four men in California were arrested for sending money to \na militant group in Somalia. In the other case they arrested a co-\nconspirator of Mr. Zazi a few months after Zazi's plot was disrupted. \nThese men committed serious crimes. They are now being punished with \nthe full weight of the justice system.\n  What I don't see, however, is any evidence that the U.S. Government \nneeded to operate a giant domestic phone records surveillance program \nin order to catch these individuals. I have seen no evidence--none--\nthat this dragnet phone records program has provided any actual unique \nvalue for the American people. In every instance in which the NSA has \nsearched through these bulk phone records, it had enough evidence to \nget a court order for the information it was searching for.\n  Getting a few hundred additional court orders every year would \nclearly not overwhelm the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. The \nintelligence agencies may argue that collecting Americans' phone \nrecords in bulk is more convenient than getting individual court \norders, but convenience alone does not justify the massive intrusion on \nthe privacy of ordinary Americans. I believe it is vitally important to \nprotect the safety and liberty of our people. I don't see any evidence \nthat this program helps protect either. That ought to be the standard \nof any domestic surveillance program. If the bulk collection program \ndoesn't protect privacy or security, then it ought to end--plain and \nsimple.\n  The executive branch simply has not shown anything close to an \nadequate justification for this massive dragnet surveillance that has \ncompromised the civil liberties of millions of Americans. I am not sure \nthey ever could, but I am confident that I have not seen it as yet.\n  Now, let me close by way of saying that over the last few weeks we \nhave seen extraordinary support for reform. Last week over 200 Members \nof the other body voted to end the bulk phone records collection \nprogram, and a number of the Members who voted against ending it at \nthat time made it clear they have serious concerns they want to \naddress. So there are going to be more votes. Make no mistake about it, \nthere are going to be more votes on whether to end the bulk collection \nof phone records on law-abiding Americans in the 113th Congress. And \nthere are going to be efforts to reform how the entire U.S. \nsurveillance system works.\n  One of the most important reforms will be to make the significant \nrulings of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court public, which is \na goal I have been pursuing for several years.\n  Additionally, I believe Congress needs to reform the process for \narguing cases before the court. Right now the government lawyers walk \nin with an argument for why the government should be allowed to do \nsomething, and there is no one to argue the other side. That is not \nunusual if the court is considering a routine warrant request, but it \nis very unusual when a court is doing major legal or constitutional \nanalysis.\n  I believe Congress needs to create a way to advocate for the public--\na public advocate to argue cases before the court, because making this \ncourt more transparent and more adversarial is a way to ensure that \nAmericans can have security and liberty. Of course, the relevant \nprovisions of the PATRIOT Act itself will be expiring in 2015. I don't \nthink there is any reason for the administration to wait for Congress \nto act.\n  The executive branch can take action right now. They can and should \ncontinue to obtain the records of anyone suspected of connections to \nterror or other nefarious activity, and at the same time they can \nrestore protections for Americans' Fourth Amendment rights. I am very \ninterested in working with the administration on these issues, but they \ncan move of their own volition.\n\n  One way or another, we are going to stay at this until, at this \nunique time in our constitutional history, we have revised our \nsurveillance laws so we can have security and liberty. Colleagues are \ncoming to this cause. Senator Blumenthal has particularly recommended a \nnumber of constructive FISA Court changes over the last few months. I \nhope colleagues will support that, and I hope they will see this unique \ntime in our history when it is critically important that these \nsurveillance laws that I and Senator Udall have talked about tonight \ncan be reformed and we do it so as to protect the bedrock of American \nvalues, both security and liberty.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I and \nSenator Blumenthal from Connecticut and Senator Baldwin from Wisconsin \nand, if he is able to join us, Senator Murphy from Connecticut be \nallowed to engage in a colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/30/senate-section/article/S6056-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6056-S6060]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, my colleagues and I have come to the \nfloor to talk about an issue that is at the heart of the discussion of \nour national debt and deficit; that is, health care spending.\n  These days around Washington, there is a regular refrain echoing \nthrough the hallways: In order to fix our deficit, we must cut Medicare \nand Medicaid benefits. That is wrong. That idea is, according to the \nformer CEO of Kaiser Permanente--somebody who knows a little something \nabout health care--and I will quote him:\n\n       . . . so wrong it's almost criminal. It's an inept way of \n     thinking about health care.\n\n  I could not agree more.\n  It was put this way by Froma Harrop, who is a columnist for my \nhometown paper, the Providence Journal. I will quote her: ``The dagger \npointed at America's economic viability hasn't been the existence of \ngovernment programs like Medicare, it's been the relentless rise in \nhealth care costs that plagues not only Medicare and Medicaid, but \neveryone who uses health care.''\n  Attacking Medicare and Medicaid ignores the fact that our health care \nspending problem is systemwide and not just unique to Federal programs. \nOur colleague Senator Angus King has used the colorful metaphor that to \ngo after Medicare and Medicaid when the problem is our health care \nsystem would be like attacking Brazil after Pearl Harbor--wrong target. \nIt ignores the fact that we operate a widely inefficient health care \nsystem: 18 percent of our GDP compared to only 12 percent for our least \nefficient international competitors.\n  So how can we continue to stem the rise in costs and improve our \nwildly inefficient health care system?\n  Thankfully, many of the tools necessary to drive down costs have an \ninteresting collateral benefit. They actually improve the quality of \ncare for patients. The Affordable Care Act included 45 different \nprovisions dedicated to redesigning how health care is delivered for \nthe benefit of patients and taxpayers. These reforms support and \nencourage an ongoing delivery system reform movement--and there truly \nis a movement out there--driven by dedicated providers, payers, \nemployers, and even some States that have worked for years to improve \nthe quality and the safety and the effectiveness of health care.\n  We are not discussing hypothetical improvements. We are not \ndiscussing theoretical cost savings. Today I am joined on the floor by \ncolleagues who have seen how delivery system innovators in their States \nhave achieved real improvements to quality, real improvements in \npatient outcomes, and real cost savings. In Congress, we can't get over \nyesterday's\n\n[[Page S6057]]\n\nquarrels about repealing or defunding ObamaCare, but out there in the \nreal world health care leaders across the country are innovating \nforward, places such as the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, Intermountain \nHealthcare in Utah, Geisinger Health System in Pennsylvania, Gundersen \nLutheran in Wisconsin, Palmetto Health in the Carolinas, and in Rhode \nIsland, among other places, our own Coastal Medical.\n  One Rhode Island practical example: When intensive care unit staff \nfollow a checklist of basic instructions--washing their hands with \nsoap, cleaning a patient's skin with antiseptic, placing sterile drapes \nover the patient and so forth--rates of infection plummet, and the \ncosts of treating those infections disappear--no infection, no cost.\n  These reforms have the triple benefit of protecting Medicare and \nMedicaid, improving patient outcomes, and dialing back health care \nspending for all Americans. How big is it? The President's Council of \nEconomic Advisers has estimated that we could save approximately $700 \nbillion--that is billion with a ``b''--$700 billion every year--every \nyear--in our health care system without compromising health outcomes. \nThe Institute of Medicine took a look at the same question. They put \nthe savings number at $750 billion.\n  Other groups are even more optimistic. The New England Health Care \nInstitute has reported that $850 billion could be saved annually. The \nLewin Group and former Bush Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill--who as the \nCEO of Alcoa is deeply involved in the reform efforts in Pennsylvania \nthat have been very successful and knows a fair amount about this--they \nestimate an annual savings of a staggering $1 trillion.\n  Whatever the exact number is, what is clear is there is huge \npotential for savings in our health care system while improving or \nmaintaining the quality of care. Since the Federal Government does 40 \npercent of America's health care spending, when we get that right, \ntaxpayers as well as patients become big winners from these reforms.\n  I will close with two points: First, many of us are asking the Obama \nadministration to set a hard cost savings target for these delivery \nsystem reform efforts. It may be $750 billion. Pick a number that will \nbe a target to be actually achieved. A target--a measurable goal--will \nfocus and guide and spur the administration's reform efforts in a \nmanner that vague intentions to ``bend the health care cost curve'' \nsimply cannot.\n  Second, we need to put the full force of American innovation and \ningenuity into achieving that serious cost savings target for our \nNation's health care system. It is hard to do that without that target \nto strive toward.\n  This is an issue where our Republican colleagues should be able to \njoin us to accelerate these reforms in our health care delivery system \nand to move forward beyond tired-out calls to repeal ObamaCare so we \ncan deal with the ongoing reality of health care reform.\n  Let's give American families the health care system they deserve. \nInstead of waste and inefficiency, poor outcomes and missed \nopportunities, let's give them a health care system that is the envy of \nthe world.\n  I yield for my colleague, Senator Baldwin.\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for convening us and \nfor giving us an opportunity to discuss the important topic of delivery \nsystem reform and to highlight some of the innovations that are \noccurring in our own States.\n  I heard Senator Whitehouse talking about moving forward. It is \nactually the motto of the State of Wisconsin. One simple word: \n``Forward.'' Throughout our State's history, that motto has well \nrepresented our leadership in extending high-quality and affordable \nhealth care.\n  Our health care providers and payers have pioneered forward-looking \nreforms that improve the quality of care and lower costs for families \nand for businesses. We are home to world-class, highly integrated \nhealth care systems. We make quality and outcomes data widely \naccessible to providers so they can measure their success against their \npeers. We stand at the forefront of using and advancing health care \ninformation technology. All of this affords some of the highest quality \ncare in the country at a competitive cost.\n  Congress has a lot to learn from Wisconsin's health care delivery \nsystems. A recent Institute of Medicine report reinforced what we have \nknown for a long time: that geographic variation in health care \nspending and utilization is real and that variations in health care \nspending are not consistently related to health care quality. For every \nState such as Wisconsin with higher quality outcomes and lower costs, \nthere are five other States faring worse. Even within States, the \nregional variation in health care spending and quality is troublesome.\n  Unfortunately, instead of advancing and fostering forward-thinking \ninnovations such as those working in Wisconsin, far too many of my \nfellow lawmakers are looking backward when it comes to health care. In \nthe House of Representatives, the Republican leadership has scheduled \nvotes to repeal or defund the Affordable Care Act almost 40 times. Some \nState governments--including, unfortunately, my own--have refused to \nmove forward with America's new health care law and are undermining its \neffectiveness at every chance possible. Now some of my colleagues in \nthe Senate are threatening to shut down the government if investments \nin our health care system are not stripped out of our budget entirely.\n  Families and businesses in Wisconsin and across the country are tired \nof these political games. For as long as some of my colleagues and some \nof the Governors across this country remain glued to the past, waging \npolitical fights based on pure ideology, we lose golden opportunities \nto move health care reforms in our country forward. We should all be \nfocused on building a smarter and more affordable health care system, \nnot trying to tear down the law of the land.\n  That is why I am so proud to stand on the floor with my colleagues \ntonight, committed to moving our Nation's health care system forward. \nBy building on the best reforms to our health care delivery system that \nare embedded within the Affordable Care Act and making new improvements \nto how we deliver care in our country, we will lower health care costs, \nimprove quality and strengthen our economic security and reduce the \ndeficit. Better yet, we will have more States with health care systems \nsuch as Wisconsin's, and Wisconsin's system will be improved as well.\n  The possibilities are exciting. I think one of the things Senator \nWhitehouse just mentioned bears repeating: There is widespread \nagreement that significant savings can be achieved in our health care \nsystem without compromising the quality of care. The figures he cited \nbear repeating: The Lewin Group and the former Treasury Secretary Paul \nO'Neill have estimated that we could save $1 trillion per year without \naffecting health care outcomes by enacting smart, targeted health care \ndelivery reforms. The New England Health Care Institute pegged that \nnumber at $850 billion annually, the Institute of Medicine estimated \nthis number to be $750 billion, and the President's Council of Economic \nAdvisers foresees savings at $700 billion a year. No matter the exact \nfigure, these are impressive savings that would strengthen our entire \nNation.\n  The Affordable Care Act has sparked this hard work of transforming \nhealth care delivery. The law provides health care practitioners with \nincentives to better integrate care, increase quality, and lower costs. \nThese efforts are producing impressive results in Wisconsin. For \nexample, the Pioneer Accountable Care Organization Program has offered \nfinancial incentives to meet quality and Medicare savings benchmarks. \nBellin-ThedaCare Healthcare Partners in northeast Wisconsin has \nexcelled with this program. In its first year of participation, Bellin-\nThedaCare earned $5.3 million in shared savings and lowered costs for \nits 20,000 Medicare patients by an average of 4.6 percent. While not \nevery pioneer ACO has been as successful, the CMS Office of the Actuary \nbelieves this program could save Medicare up to $1.1 billion over 5 \nyears by simply better coordinating care.\n  Wisconsin boasts six additional health care providers participating \nin the law's traditional Accountable Care Organization Program which \nthe Department of Health and Human Services estimates could save up to \n$940 million over 4 years. Wisconsin health care providers are also \ntaking part in\n\n[[Page S6058]]\n\nthe Affordable Care Act's Partnership for Patients to improve health \ncare quality. This public-private partnership engages hospitals, \nbusinesses, and consumer groups with the goal of preventing injuries \nand complications in patient care--including hospital-acquired \nconditions. The administration estimates that reducing medical errors \nand preventing conditions will save up to $35 billion in health care \ncosts.\n\n  Another public-private partnership--the Affordable Care Act's Million \nHearts Initiative--is preventing heart attack and stroke. \nCardiovascular disease costs this country $440 billion per year in \nmedical costs and lost productivity. The initiative seeks to deliver \nbetter preventive care to stop 1 million strokes and heart attacks by \nthe year 2017--in part by utilizing innovative technology. Wisconsin's \nown Marshfield Clinic designed a winning mobile application for the \ninitiative. The app will encourage patients to get their blood pressure \nand cholesterol checked and to work with their health care providers to \nimprove their heart health.\n  Finally, the Affordable Care Act has empowered the CMS Innovation \nCenter to develop new ideas to improve health care quality and lower \ncosts for people enrolled in Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program. A number of the center's projects are \ncurrently underway in Wisconsin. For example, the Children's Hospital \nof Wisconsin, Aurora HealthCare, and the Wheaton Franciscan Healthcare \nsystem have created a model to decrease emergency room visits for \nchildren. The estimated 3-year savings of that project is almost $3 \nmillion. In addition, the Pharmacy Society of Wisconsin is utilizing a \nprovision in the Affordable Care Act to better integrate pharmacists \ninto clinical care teams. That initiative is set to save over $20 \nmillion in 3 years.\n  This represents a small sampling of the delivery innovations being \npromoted through the Affordable Care Act that are saving us money right \nnow. These parts of the law are empowering Wisconsin health care \nproviders to provide higher quality care at reduced costs. Public \nofficials who advocate for repealing the Affordable Care Act would end \nthese impressive initiatives as well. Instead, we must build on these \ndelivery reforms, as so much more can be done.\n  To name two priorities, Wisconsin cardiologists have developed an \ninnovative integrated network called SMARTCare to deliver better more \nefficient care for a vulnerable patient population. The Department of \nHealth and Human Services should encourage this coordinated care model \nby investing in it and measuring its results.\n  We should improve the law to increase access to Medicare claims data. \nThe Wisconsin Health Information Organization currently holds over 65 \npercent of health insurance claims data in the State--from private \ninsurers and from Medicaid. The organization shares that data with \nhealth care providers so doctors can compare their performance--in \nterms of quality and cost--against their peers. This data-sharing \npromotes competition and it lowers cost. But due to current law, the \norganization cannot access Medicare data. If we open Medicare claims \ndata, we will further improve quality and we will lower costs.\n  Lawmakers have a clear choice: Go backward and try for the 40th time \nto repeal the Affordable Care Act or put progress in our country ahead \nof politics. We welcome our colleagues to join us in moving our country \nand our health care delivery system forward.\n  I now yield for Senator Murphy.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I thank very much Senator Baldwin and \nthank the State of Wisconsin for, in a lot of ways, leading the way and \nshowing us what is possible when it comes to delivery system reform.\n  It is pretty amazing some of those statistics Senator Baldwin used \nwhen she talked about how much waste there is in the system today. The \nestimates are from the Council of Economic Advisers, $700 billion; from \nthe New England Healthcare Institute, $850 billion. To put that in \ncontext, even if the median of the two is right--somewhere in the high \n$700 billion range--that is $100 billion more than we spend every year \non the military. That is enough money to provide coverage for 150 \nmillion more Americans. That is enough to pay the salaries of every \nsingle first responder personnel in the country, including \nfirefighters, police officers, and EMTs for over a decade.\n  It is an enormous amount of money that we are wasting today because \nwe have a reimbursement system, as Senator Whitehouse said as well, \nthat essentially rewards providers and hospitals and health care \nsystems for providing volume rather than providing quality.\n  We understand there is not a single health care provider in the \ncountry that does not get into this if not for their desire to provide \nquality health care. There is no malevolent motive involved here. But, \nultimately, when you have to keep your doors open--as a medical \npractice, as a hospital, as a nursing home--and you get paid more the \nmore medicine you practice and the more treatments you order and the \nmore tests you have your patients undergo, then you are going to follow \nthe money. It is time we reorient our reimbursement model under \nMedicare and Medicaid, and in partnership with our private insurers, so \nwe are reimbursing based on the quality of medicine and the quality of \nthe outcomes you provide rather than on how much stuff you order or \nprescribe.\n  Let me talk about three examples of how we have succeeded already \nwhen it comes to changing the model of reimbursement.\n  First, the issue of readmission rates. When you go into a hospital \nfor a surgery, that hospital is going to get a set fee for the surgery \nand for the amount of time you spend in the hospital afterwards. It is \ncalled a bundle payment. Bundle payments are good because what it does \nis it encourages you to essentially use your resources wisely because \nyou are not going to get paid more if you keep the person in the \nhospital for 10 days than if you keep the person in the hospital for 5 \ndays.\n  But here is the problem when it comes to the care people were getting \nafter a particular surgery. Because the hospital got a set payment for \nthat period of time, they had an incentive to push the person out of \nthe hospital as quickly as possible. That was an incentive not only \nbecause the payment itself did not get bigger the more amount of time \nyou were in the hospital, but it also was incented that way because if \nthe person went home too early and then they came back again to the \nhospital, the hospital got a second bundle payment when they came back. \nAnd if they came back a third time and a fourth time, they got another \npayment.\n  So what was happening is there was an incentive to send people home \nbefore they were ready because not only would that save you money on \nthe first bundled payment, but it actually made the hospital or the \nhealth system money in the long run because the person came back a \nsecond or a third or a fourth time.\n  I do not think there was a single hospital in the Nation that was \ndeliberately misaligning their care so they would have people coming \nback to the hospital a second or a third or a fourth time. I am not \nsuggesting people were trying to game the system in that way. But what \ncertainly was happening was that without an incentive that pulls you \nthe other way--get the care right the first time--there was, \nunfortunately, insufficient care being provided.\n  So the health care bill says: Listen, we will pay you for maybe the \nfirst readmission, maybe for really complicated procedures we will pay \nyou for a second readmission, but at some point there has to be an end \nto this model. At some point it has to be up to you as the hospital or \nas the health care provider to get the care right the first or the \nsecond time so we are not on the hook for readmissions occurring times \nthree or times four. That is a pretty simple change, but it can save \nhundreds of millions of dollars.\n  The second example is accountable care organizations. We set up a \nbunch of Pioneer accountable care organizations. These are bigger \nsystems of care, where you have primary care doctors networked with \nspecialty care providers, working under one umbrella to coordinate the \ncare of the sickest patients. There are different numbers, but they all \ntell the same thing, which is that the sickest 5 or 10 percent of \npatients in the country are taking up about 50 percent of annual \nmedical expenditures. So if you do a better job of\n\n[[Page S6059]]\n\ncoordinating the care of that small percentage of the medical \npopulation, you are going to save a lot of money.\n  Accountable care organizations can do that. Instead of having siloed \ncare, where a co-morbid patient goes to a primary care doctor over \nhere, then a specialist here, then a specialist there, if they are all \nunder one roof and they are talking to each other, then you can save a \nlot of money just by coordination. That is the theory. So the health \ncare reform act put that theory into practice. It set up a pilot \nprogram by which Pioneer accountable care organizations--essentially, a \nbeginning set of accountable care organizations--would be set up under \na model through which Medicare would say: If you save money, we are \ngoing to deliver back to you some of those savings so that, in fact, \nthere is not a disincentive to practice less medicine because if you \npractice less medicine, Medicare will take some of the savings and it \nwill share with you some of the savings.\n  Well, we have only had a year or so of returns from this model, but \nthe results are pretty stunning. The average increase in costs per \nbeneficiary has been--in the Pioneer ACOs--less than 50 percent of that \nfor non-Pioneer ACO models. That is a pretty significant savings.\n  In addition, go back to this question of readmissions. In 25 of the \n32 Pioneer ACOs, there was a lower risk-adjusted readmission rate than \nin non-Pioneer ACOs. Coordinated care where you are reimbursing an \norganization as opposed to just the individual physicians actually \nsaves you a lot of money.\n  Then third, the issue of outliers. What you find when you look at the \ndata--and it may be that Senator Whitehouse talked about this--is that \nsometimes 60, 70, 80 percent of the system is practicing good medicine \nat the right cost, and it is really only a small handful of providers \nthat are way outside of the median and all you have to do, when it \ncomes to some subsets of reimbursement, is bring those outliers back \ninto the median.\n  Home care was a great example. In the Accountable Care Act, we said \nthat for home care providers that had utilization rates that were far \noutside the median, we were going to stop reimbursing for those \nepisodes that were far outside the median. CBO was not sure how to \nscore it because they did not really know that was going to change \npeople's practice. But it did. And it is estimated that single change, \nin controlling for the handful of outliers when it comes to high \nutilization rates in the home care line item, is going to get us almost \n$1 billion in savings over a 10-year period of time.\n  When you look at home care, actually it is only a handful of areas in \nwhich you have these outpaced utilization rates compared to the rest of \nthe country. It is places in Texas, it is places in certain counties in \nFlorida. Most of the country is right where you should be. So part of \nreforming our delivery system is also taking care of these outliers.\n  We have seen savings, whether it be in controlling readmission rates, \nsetting up accountable care organizations, or taking on outliers within \nour home care system.\n  Now it is time to do more because, before I turn it over to my good \nfriend Senator Blumenthal, here is where the rubber hits the road.\n  In about 10 years, Medicare starts taking in less money than it sends \nout. It does not go bankrupt all of a sudden, but it starts to become \nfiscally insolvent. There are only a handful of ways to stop that \nreality from happening. You can either ask beneficiaries to pay more \nout of pocket; you can cut their benefits, give them less; you can ask \npeople to pay more into the system while they are working or you can \nmake the system more efficient.\n  It may be that we have to do a mix of those. But clearly the first \nthree are not that palatable: reducing benefits, increasing copays, or \nincreasing taxes. This is not a partisan issue. Both sides agree that \nin 10 years we have an accounting problem in Medicare. Both sides agree \nthat we have to make changes today in order to stop that crisis from \noccurring.\n  It strikes me that if the most conservative Republican and the most \nliberal Democratic sat down at a table and looked at those four \noptions--increased copays, reduced benefits, increased taxes, or \nincreased efficiencies--we would all agree. The conservative Republican \nand the liberal Democrat would agree, along with probably every other \nMember of this body, that is the first place you should go is to reduce \ninefficiencies. That is what the delivery system provides. So we have \nset up a working group here in the Senate which is beginning its work \nthis week, that Senator Baldwin, Senator Whitehouse, Senator \nBlumenthal, I, and others will be building over the course of the late \nsummer and fall. We hope it will draw interest from both sides of the \naisle so we can start to put some meat on the bones when it comes to \nthe changes in our delivery system that can be made to increase \nefficiencies so as to forestall the need to balance the Medicare books \non the backs of taxpayers, workers, or beneficiaries.\n  With that, let me yield the floor to my great friend from \nConnecticut, someone who both as a Senator and our State's attorney \ngeneral has been fighting for health care consumers for a long time, \nSenator Blumenthal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague, Chris \nMurphy. Senator Murphy has been a long-time champion on this issue. My \ncolleagues may wonder why two Senators from Connecticut, both of our \nSenators, are here on the floor and part of this working group seeking \nto lead on this critically important issue of health care delivery.\n  The answer is we come from a State where it is working. We have seen \nthe future in Connecticut's health care delivery system. It is still a \nwork in progress, a lot of work still to be done, but Connecticut \nhospitals and providers and insurers and patients know it has to be our \nfuture, that cutting cost is essential to preserving and enhancing \nquality. Let me emphasize how important that basic principle is, \nbecause a lot of our colleagues believe there is a choice here between \ncutting costs and quality, that quality cannot be enhanced if we cut \ncosts.\n  In fact, the opposite is true. Cutting the cost of health care is key \nto enhancing and improving quality. It is the way we will reduce \npremature discharges from hospitals, that we will diminish the number \nof discharges from hospitals without proper rehabilitation plans, and \ncut the number of hospital-acquired infections. It is not only possible \nto do but it is essential. It is a way we avoid the false choice--and \nit is a false choice--between preserving Medicare on the one hand and \navoiding increasing copays, decreasing benefits, or increasing taxes, \nas my colleague from Connecticut has said.\n  I reject every one of those options as necessary to preserving \nMedicare. Increasing copays, decreasing benefits, or increasing taxes \nis not the way. In fact, increasing efficiencies and avoiding \nunnecessary wasteful and indeed harmful costs are necessary to preserve \nMedicare.\n  My mother taught me a number of things. She said, No. 1, if you don't \nhave something nice to say about someone, don't say anything. So I am \nnot here to say not-so-nice things about the folks who say we ought to \ncut Medicare benefits. But I would oppose those kinds of cuts as \nunnecessary and harmful.\n  She also said an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. In \nfact, that basic truth is what will help save our health care system. \nPrevention of costs, prevention of illness, prevention of obesity and \nsmoking, and other kinds of diseases and conditions that lead to \nincreased health care costs are essential to this effort.\n  My mother said also listen to your younger brother. My brother, Dr. \nDavid Blumenthal, has been a pioneer and an expert in this area. As \nmuch as it pains me to acknowledge that my younger brother knows a lot \nmore about this subject than I do, in fact, he has been able to \nenlighten me and many of our colleagues here on this point. I mention \nhim and the others who are experts and pioneers in this effort. He is \none of many who have advised and provided that kind of enlightenment.\n  Because there is no more kind of guesswork as to whether advances can \nbe made in this area by cutting costs and raising quality. It has been \ndocumented. There are projections. It can be costed out. It can be \nscored, in my view. It can be the basis for action by my colleagues \nhere in seeking to cut\n\n[[Page S6060]]\n\ncosts that are skyrocketing out of control.\n  I have seen these reforms at work throughout the State of \nConnecticut. This issue is of national importance, but it hits \nhospitals and providers in every one of our States. I have seen it and \nlistened to folks who work at places such as St. Vincent's and \nBridgeport Hospital, in Bridgeport; St. Mary's Hospital in Waterbury; \nYale-New Haven and Greenwich Hospital, Middlesex Hospital. All around \nthe State of Connecticut, I have seen the checklists at work, the \nprotocols for hand washing, the increased attention to quality care \nthat has helped reduce costs. They have helped improve patient care \nwhile reducing cost. They reject this false choice between quality and \ncost cutting. Both are possible. Both are essential.\n  We hear so much rhetoric about the Affordable Care Act in Washington. \nBut in Connecticut, we see tangible examples of how it is working and \nmaking a difference. The implementation of the Affordable Care Act is a \nhistoric opportunity for continuing this work and expanding it \nnationwide. We need to continue our dedication to health care reform.\n  My colleagues and I have come to the floor today to call for smart \nreform that helps patients and avoids harm to them, and does not \ndiscourage providers from being a part of a Federal health care \nprogram. In fact, we need to identify areas of reforms within the \nhealth care system that we can address that will strengthen health care \nin this country and address the serious concerns about the skyrocketing \ncosts of health care.\n  We have seen a slowdown in the growth of national health care \nexpenditures over the past year. But slow growth certainly does not \nmean a decrease in overall expenditures. Smart policy decisions require \nthat we address the ongoing problem of health care spending in this \ncountry, and turn a corner for the good by reducing the current costs.\n  I am concerned that there are shortsighted strategies, such as taking \nmoney from the Prevention and Public Health Care Fund established under \nthe ACA, which has been a tactic unfortunately used by both parties in \nfinancing programs. That tactic will undermine our long-term efforts at \nreducing health care spending. The Prevention and Public Health Fund is \nused in Connecticut for programs such as mental health services and \nsubstance abuse prevention, as well as public health research and \nsurveillance.\n  These measures will ultimately result in lower health care spending \nthrough prevention and preventive health care. But we need to stay \ncommitted and stay the course. What we need to do now is to continue to \nwork toward developing a sustainable health care system, through \nstructural reforms such as the accountable care organizations, health \nmaintenance organizations, patient-centered medical homes that have \nprovided advances in this area, and have created provider organizations \nthat lead to greater provider acceptance of responsibility for health \ncare outcomes in their patients.\n  Measuring the success of those organizations requires taking a closer \nlook at whether the savings and outcome improvements actually \nmaterialize. We have to be hard-headed and clear-eyed about whether \nthey are working. The metrics must be applied. We need to measure \nsuccess. Measurements are possible; as I said at the outset, no longer \na matter of guesswork. There are scientific-based measurements.\n  The success of these organizations will have more to do with how they \nare run than with how they are structured. As sophisticated as many of \nour health systems are, the development of process goals has only \nrecently become a consideration. The Association of American Medical \nColleges recommends, for example, the use of surgery checklists through \ntheir best practices program.\n  Peer-reviewed studies have shown that the use of comprehensive \nchecklists is associated with reductions in complications and mortality \nduring surgery. But they are most successful when health care \norganizations subscribe to a culture of safety. That culture of safety \nand prevention is essential.\n  Some hospitals in Connecticut have been rewarded through the Medicare \nProgram for their commitment to improving quality through the use of \nprocess measures: Bridgeport Hospital, St. Mary's Hospital in \nWaterbury, Middlesex Hospital have all seen increases in reimbursement \nrates through the Value Based Purchasing Program.\n  Again, the Federal Government can provide incentives and encourage \nand support this effort. Manchester Memorial Hospital, Hartford \nHospital, and Rockville General Hospital all have avoided Medicare \npenalties by lowering their readmission rates. While payment \ndifferences for these programs represent a small portion of the overall \nMedicare payment, hospitals should continue to be rewarded for \naddressing these issues.\n  I want to conclude by drawing attention to some of the innovative \nwork being done in my State of Connecticut around delivery reform and \ndata collection. I have mentioned the importance of measurements and \nmetrics. Much of the work is supported by grants that were made \navailable through the Affordable Care Act. But it has been the State \nitself that has decided how exactly to use these funds. While \nConnecticut has established a working group around innovative reforms \nwhich continues to work on specific proposals and recommendations for \nreforming the health care system, one of the areas of focus has been to \nensure integrated clinical data exchange between health care providers.\n  Connecticut has invested in interoperable health information \ntechnology systems and developing an all payers claims data base to \ncreate comparable, transparent information that can be better used to \nunderstand utilization patterns and enhance care access.\n  One of the most basic aspects of reforming any system should be a \nclear understanding of where the biggest problems lie, and yet we still \nlack the data necessary in many systems to truly understand where the \nunnecessary spending is taking place. It is like a diagnosis of any \nkind of medical condition. Facts are essential. Data is key, and I \nbelieve an investment in information technology and data collection \nactivities will help inform payers and consumers about where our health \ncare dollars are being spent, where they are being spent most \neffectively, and where we can reduce spending that will ultimately \nenhance health care outcomes.\n  Connecticut is taking a considered and insightful approach to \nobtaining and utilizing data while considering the needs of consumers \nand looking toward developing stronger programs for telemedicine and \nprovider coordination. Technology is advancing. Data collection can \nhelp implement technology where it does the most good.\n  We need tangible goals for long-term reform, and that is part of the \nwork that we have described and we are undertaking as part of our task \nforce.\n  I know my colleagues this evening all agree with me that we need to \ncontinue this work and take advantage of advancing technology, the \nmetrics that are now being sampled, of good practices, leadership of \nproviders, the medical community, and good ideas wherever they are and \nwhoever is willing to offer them.\n  I wish to thank my colleagues for joining in this effort, and I look \nforward to returning on this subject.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/30/senate-section/article/S6060-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6060-S6061]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HOUSING ASSISTANCE\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I wish to express my strong support \nfor the Transportation-HUD appropriations bill and take a moment to \nexplain an amendment that I have filed to this bill that ensures that \nmen and women who have bravely served our country cannot be \ndiscriminated against in the housing assistance these appropriations \nprovide.\n  I wish to thank Senator Murray and Senator Collins for their \nleadership, as well as other colleagues.\n  One of the problems I have heard described to me by veterans relates \nto discrimination when they return home after serving our country \nabroad and they become a civilian. One of the first things they often \ntry to do is find a new home, often in a location far from their \noriginal home where they may not be known, where they enlisted but now \nhave left. It may also be far from the military installation where they \nused to call home.\n  Fortunately, almost all Americans across our country rightly welcome \nour\n\n[[Page S6061]]\n\nheroes home, and they welcome them with open arms. Unfortunately, I \nhave seen reports, and I have heard descriptions of instances where \nlandlords would not rent to veterans simply because they served our \ncountry in uniform, and I find this practice absolutely unconscionable.\n  I wish to tell you about the case of SGT Joel Morgan, a combat \nveteran who bravely served our country in Iraq. Sergeant Morgan, upon \nleaving the military, wished to rent an apartment in Boston. He found \none that he liked.\n  Unfortunately, after hearing about Sergeant Morgan's service to our \ncountry, the landlord said she wouldn't feel comfortable renting the \napartment to Sergeant Morgan because she opposed the war in which he \nfought.\n  According to Sergeant Morgan, the landlord said:\n\n       I would suggest you do the right thing and look for a place \n     less politically active or controversial.\n\n  The place where he wanted to live was Boston. This kind of treatment \nis simply unacceptable to our veterans who have sacrificed so much.\n  It is a matter of common knowledge that veterans of these recent wars \nhave high unemployment rates, higher than we should accept, higher than \nis conscionable for this country to accept. Among younger veterans, \nthat unemployment rate is intolerably high, and many landlords may \nbelieve that an unemployed veteran simply isn't a good prospect for \npaying the rent.\n  My amendment would prohibit any funding in this bill from going to \npeople or organizations that discriminate against veterans in housing. \nIt would allow anyone who sees a discriminatory practice to report it \nto the Department of Housing and Urban Development and directly to that \nagency's inspector general. It also allows HUD to continue its existing \nprograms to support veterans and servicemembers.\n  This amendment will ensure that those who fight for our freedoms will \nnot have to find or fight for a place to call home. Discrimination \nagainst anyone, including men and women who have valiantly served, has \nno place in our Nation.\n  I look forward to working with the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, which has done so much to protect Americans from \ndiscriminatory housing practices, on ways we can ensure that \nservicemembers and veterans are not the victims of discrimination. As \nwe work for a permanent solution on so many of these difficult \nproblems--providing veterans with counseling, health care, jobs \ncounseling, training, and education that they need and keeping faith \nwith them so that we leave no veteran behind--we should make sure we \nleave no veteran out of housing because of discrimination.\n  One of the solutions will be amending the Servicemembers Civil Relief \nAct to ensure that housing protections are extended to all who have \nserved in uniform. I believe this amendment is an important step \nforward. Simply put, it will protect all who have protected our \ncountry. Protecting them is a matter of keeping faith and making sure \nthat we leave no veteran behind.\n  I know the Veterans' Affairs Committee is hard at work on many of \nthese issues. I am proud to serve on that committee and thank Chairman \nSanders for his profoundly important leadership on this issue, along \nwith Ranking Member Burr.\n  I look forward to extending and expanding these protections for our \nbravest and finest men and women who have helped to protect our Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/30/senate-section/article/S6061-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6061]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 FEDERAL FUNDING PROHIBITIONS OBJECTION\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, consistent with Senate standing orders and \nmy policy of publishing in the Congressional Record a statement \nwhenever I place a hold on legislation, I am announcing my intention to \nobject to any unanimous consent request to pass S. 101 Federal funding \nprohibitions unless it clarifies that it will not prohibit payments \nunder the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act.\n  This legislation, as currently drafted, has the potential to impede \ncritical payments to over 700 rural and forested counties all across \nthe United States. Those payments are paid to counties with Federal \nforest lands under the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-\nDetermination Act, and they are part of the Federal Government's \nguarantee to share funding from the Federal forests with the counties \nin which those forests are located. Declining receipts spurred the \ncreation of this program to compensate for the loss of receipts from \nFederal forests. Many counties depend on this funding to pay for \nschools, roads, and other important county services--including funding \nsearch and rescue operations on Federal lands. Particularly in tough \neconomic times, these payments have been a lifeline to many counties. \nIt is not an exaggeration to say that some of these counties might face \nbankruptcy without these payments. Because of the importance of these \npayments to many county budgets and the fact that many of them might be \nin a very vulnerable financial situation without those payments--\nincluding several counties in my home State of Oregon--this legislation \nmight very well impact them and prohibit these critical payments. I \nsimply cannot let that happen. This program has consistently received \nbipartisan support, and it should not be arbitrarily be limited by S. \n101.\n  Therefore, I must object to this legislation moving forward until it \nis explicitly clarified that it will not block any of these critical \npayments. Until that occurs, I will object to a unanimous consent \nrequest to pass the legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/30/senate-section/article/S6061-2", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6061]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO ERNEST CARY BRACE\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

This great American hero is Ernest C. \nBrace, and he was just authorized to be awarded the Purple Heart and \nPrisoner of War Medal.\n  Mr. Brace was the longest held civilian prisoner of war in Vietnam, \nheld captive for nearly 8 years. He was captured while serving as a \ncivilian pilot for USAID and assisting Lao Special Forces United, who \nwere organizing the civic action teams for hospitals and supply bases. \nHe was captured by communist forces in Laos in 1965 and held prisoner \nin the jungle under some of the most horrific conditions imaginable for \n3 years until he was moved to a prison camp in North Vietnam. It was \nthere that Ernie and I shared neighboring cells for over a year. Amidst \nthe pain and cruelty of our time together, I also vividly remember our \nconversations, Sunday night storytelling sessions, and how we kept each \nother's spirits up during those dark days when our hope never wavered.\n  After his release, Mr. Brace married a nurse, Nancy, that he met at \nNaval Medical Center in San Diego, moved to Klamath Falls, OR, and \nresumed his career as professional aviator. Preceding the Purple Heart \nand Prisoner of War Medal, Mr. Brace earned the Distinguished Flying \nCross, the Air Medal, with 3 stars, Navy Unit Commendation, a \nDistinguished Public Service Medal, a National Defense Service Medal, a \nKorean Service Medal, with 2 stars, a United Nations Korea Medal, and \nthe Korean Presidential Unit Citation.\n  I ask you all to join me in congratulating this incredibly brave man \nand American patriot, my friend Ernie Brace, on this long overdue \nrecognition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/30/senate-section/article/S6061-3", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6061-S6062]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CONSENT TO DISCHARGE AND REFERRAL\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President. I rise today to commemorate the 250th \nanniversary of the Town of Fryeburg, ME, the first town established in \nthe beautiful White Mountains of Maine and New Hampshire. The same \nspirit of determination and resiliency that carved a community out of \nthe wilderness two and a half centuries ago still guides Fryeburg \ntoday.\n  In 1763, the Seven Years' War between France and Great Britain for \ncontrol of North America ended with a resounding British victory. In \nrecognition of his courageous service, GEN Joseph Frye, an American-\nborn militia commander, was rewarded with a homestead grant in the \nWhite Mountains region. He chose the place where the great Saco River \ntumbles from the mountains on its journey to the sea, a place of vast \nforests and fertile farmland. That first settlement of seven lots soon \ngrew into a thriving town, incorporated in 1777 and named in General \nFrye's honor.\n  That first settlement was built on the foundation laid a half century \nbefore by another early American hero, CPT John Lovewell. His valiant \ndeeds to secure the colonies' northern frontier--including the \nlegendary Battle of the Pond in 1725--were celebrated by such authors \nas Longfellow, Hawthorne, and Thoreau. From those long ago days to the \npresent, the Veterans Honor Roll in Bradley Park memorializes the more \nthan 1,200 patriots from Fryeburg who have served our Nation in times \nof peril.\n  As the town of Fryeburg became a bustling center of industry with \nlumber and grain mills, the townspeople invested their prosperity in \neducation and in 1792 established Fryeburg Academy, one of America's \noldest preparatory schools. Among the academy's first teachers was \nDaniel Webster, before he began his remarkable career as a statesman in \nthe U.S. Senate and as America's Secretary of State. Fryeburg's \nconnection to the world of ideas was strengthened in 1997 when the \nInternational Musical Arts Institute was established, bringing world-\nclass musicians and conservatory students together every summer for \nconcerts that enrich the community.\n  The coming of the railroads in the mid-19th century made Fryeburg, \nwith its spectacular scenery, mountain breezes, and pristine waters, a \nfavorite destination for city dwellers escaping the summer heat. Among \nthose who found their way to Fryeburg during that era was the legendary \nArctic explorer Robert Peary, who sharpened his navigation skills while \nsurveying the town as a young civil engineer. Today, visitors and \nresidents alike enjoy Fryeburg's many quiet parks, beautifully \nmaintained historic buildings, and exciting outdoor recreation \nopportunities. The annual Fryeburg Fair, Maine's largest agricultural \nexhibition, keeps the town's origins and traditions alive.\n  The celebration of Fryeburg's 250th anniversary is not merely about \nthe passing of time. It is about human accomplishment. We celebrate the \npeople who, for longer than America has been a nation, have pulled \ntogether, cared for one another, and built a great community. Thanks to \nthose who came before, Fryeburg, ME, has a wonderful history. Thanks to \nthose there today, it has a bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/30/senate-section/article/S6062-3", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6062]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RECOGNIZING DICK LOPER\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to speak on behalf of Dick Loper, who \nwill be inducted into the Wyoming Agriculture Hall of Fame at the 101st \nWyoming State Fair in August. Since 1992, Wyoming has recognized \nindividuals each year who have made substantial contributions to \nagriculture in our State. This year I have the honor of presenting this \naward to Dick with my colleague, Senator Barrasso.\n  Dick Loper is known across Wyoming for his rangeland consulting, \nFederal agency cooperation, and community involvement. As a rangeland \nconsultant, Dick has served Wyoming's farmers, ranchers, and \nagricultural organizations throughout his entire career. He has also \nworked as a range consultant to the Wyoming State Grazing Board and has \nbeen involved in the organization since its creation. Rawlins Rancher \nand 2011 Wyoming Agriculture Hall of Fame inductee Niels Hansen \ncommented,\n\n       Since his time in the Reagan Administration, Dick has made \n     his home in Wyoming working as a range consultant and helping \n     and teaching many ranchers about the benefits of range \n     monitoring and good range stewardship.\n\n  Dick is best known for his commitment to the health of Wyoming's \nrangelands. For over 30 years, he has worked with Bureau of Land \nManagement, BLM, permitees and other parties to advance livestock \nmanagement and oversee the implementation of range improvements. As a \nmember of the Committee on Rangeland Classification, his efforts were \ncrucial in gaining national attention for rangeland health, which led \nto the establishment of standards of healthy rangelands. These \nstandards now give public land users and managers clear goals for \ngrazing.\n  Dick Loper is also active in a variety of community organizations \nimportant to Wyoming agriculture. He served on the Society for Range \nManagement Select Task Force on Unity in Concepts and the Sustainable \nRangelands Roundtable. For his service, Dick has been honored with the \nGuardian of the Grasslands Award.\n  On a personal note, it seems I can't go very long without visiting \nwith Dick Loper in Washington. In addition to seeing him in Wyoming, \nDick is regularly in DC for meetings with Federal agencies and other \npartners. It is always helpful receiving the latest on public lands \nduring his visits. I am proud to have the opportunity to recognize Dick \nLoper's achievements with Senator Barrasso as a 2013 inductee into the \nWyoming Agriculture Hall of Fame. Wyoming and its public lands are well \nserved by his lasting and continuing contributions to our State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/30/senate-section/article/S6062-4", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6062-S6063]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNIZING JW AND THEA NUCKOLLS\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I will soon be attending the 101st \nWyoming State Fair. During the Ag Hall of Fame Picnic, Senator Enzi and \nI will have the honor of recognizing Jw and Thea Nuckolls as they are \ninducted into the Wyoming Agriculture Hall of Fame for 2013. I cannot \nthink of two people more deserving of this recognition.\n  The Nuckolls family came to Wyoming from Virginia in the early 1900s. \nJw's parents sold 100 horses in order to purchase the original ranch in \n1917. In 1943, the family entered the sheep business by purchasing 500 \nhead of sheep to stock the ranch. Jw was only 12 years old when he \nbegan trailing ewes from Moorcroft, where the sheep were bought, to the \nfamily ranch 26 miles away.\n  Jw returned to the ranch after graduating from the University of \nWyoming. He was in the market for more sheep, when he met his future \nwife, Thea. He purchased part of her family's Corriedale flock. The \nfuture couple subsequently ran into each other again at the Wyoming \nState Fair in 1958 and were married the following year. How fitting it \nis for them to be honored together in the same place where their lives \nwith one another began 55 years ago.\n  Over the past five decades, Jw and Thea have built a strong, \ndiversified ranching operation. Thea brought registered Angus cows into \nthe family and together she and Jw have built herds of high quality \ncattle and sheep. Their contributions to agriculture go far beyond \ntheir own operation, however. Jw\n\n[[Page S6063]]\n\nand Thea helped to start the Mountain States Lamb Cooperative and \nCenter of the Nation Wool Cooperative which serves 1,700 participants \nand markets approximately 5 million pounds of wool each year, resulting \nin gross sales of nearly $10 million. Jw continues to serve as a board \nmember to this day. In addition to the cooperative, Jw has also been \nactive in Wyoming Stock Growers Association, Wyoming Farm Bureau, and \nthe Wyoming Wool Growers Association. Thea has served many years as a \n4-H club leader, serves on the Wyoming Cattle Women's Association, \nWyoming Wool Growers Auxiliary, and Crook County Farm Bureau.\n  Jw and Thea have been stalwart representatives of the agriculture \nindustry in every way. Wyoming Stock Growers Association executive vice \npresident Jim Magagna has said that the sheep industry is stronger \nbecause of Jw and Thea's involvement. This couple embodies what Wyoming \nis all about. Honesty, integrity, and hard work are second nature to \nthem. Their willingness to share their knowledge and experience with \nothers ensures that the sheep industry and agriculture in general will \ncontinue to be strong in both Wyoming and America for years to come. I \nwould like to extend my congratulations to Jw and Thea and thank them \nfor their dedication to the Wyoming way of life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/30/senate-section/article/S6063-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6063]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO BRIAN SCOTT GAMROTH\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, today I come to the floor to tell you \nabout one of Wyoming's own, Brian Scott Gamroth. On the radio, \ntelevision, or at any number of events, folks all over Wyoming are \nfamiliar with his deep, resonating voice. Brian is more than a radio \npersonality; he is an enthusiastic advocate for Wyoming and her people.\n  Brian spent his youth first at a ranch near Medicine Bow and then at \na ranch near Saratoga. His family finally settled in Casper in the mid-\n1970s. In the early 1980s, Brian had a chance to take on Chicago. He \nworked for CBS Records, PolyGram, and Geffen Records before the call of \nWyoming brought him home to Casper. Brian took over the K2 Radio \nmorning show almost 20 years ago. It remains one of the top rated \nmorning shows anywhere.\n  Brian is always first to lend his voice to efforts raising awareness \nfor veterans, children, and the needs of the community. No cause is too \nbig or too small for him to show his support. Whether it is the Wyoming \nWild Sheep Foundation, the Wyoming Down Syndrome Association, Special \nOlympics, or many other organizations, Brian generously supports causes \nthat make Wyoming a better place to call home.\n  Given his impressive resume of generous service, Brian has been \nselected by the Boys & Girls Clubs of Central Wyoming as the recipient \nof the Distinguished Service Award. Through his talents as an \nentertainer, master of ceremonies, and a community leader, Brian has \nraised millions of dollars for local and State charities. Last year \nalone, he was the master of ceremonies at 38 events in four States. \nBrian has the reputation of being the first to donate his talents, time \nand treasure for causes that enhance the lives of folks in Wyoming and \nthe region. He joins a distinguished group of alumni who have been \nrecognized with this award, including former U.S. Senator Alan Simpson, \nVice President Dick Cheney and his wife Lynne, former U.S. Ambassador \nto Guatemala Tom Stroock, and Governor Mike Sullivan.\n  This year marks the 15th annual Boys & Girls Clubs Recognition \nBreakfast event. For the last 12 years, Brian served as the master of \nceremonies. It is fitting that Brian has been chosen to receive the \nprestigious award this year. On behalf of the children he has helped, \nthe families he has embraced, and friends he has made, I offer my \nheartfelt congratulations. I am honored to know him and call him my \nfriend. Casper and Wyoming is a better place to live and work because \nof Brian Scott Gamroth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/30/senate-section/article/S6063-2", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6063]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO CHARLES E. HARMAN, JR.\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a man who has \nbeen an invaluable member of my team for 6 unforgettable years, my \nfriend and chief of staff, Charlie Harman.\n  Charlie first came to Washington in 1970. He took an internship with \nSenator Richard B. Russell of Georgia, to be near his then-girlfriend \nCarol, now his wife of 40 years.\n  This internship sparked a passion for public policy, politics, and \nthe United States Senate Charlie could never extinguish.\n  After his internship with Senator Russell, the Atlanta, GA native \ngraduated from my alma mater UGA, and took a job as a savings and loan \nofficer with Fulton Federal Savings.\n  However by 1980, Charlie longed to return to politics and began \nworking for Senator Sam Nunn in Georgia. He finally fulfilled his dream \nof returning to Washington, D.C. when he was asked to serve as Senator \nNunn's chief of staff in 1987. He did so until 1992.\n  He then returned to the private sector as president of the Georgia \nChamber of Commerce. In 1996, he left the Chamber and was named vice \npresident of public affairs for Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Georgia.\n  Seven years later, after Senator Paul Coverdell died tragically and \nunexpectedly, Zell Miller was appointed to fill the unexpired seat. \nCharlie stepped in to be his chief of staff--organizing his office and \nhiring his staff.\n  Miller ran for the seat in November 2000 and was elected to serve the \nfinal 4 years of Coverdell's term. Charlie returned to Georgia and his \njob at Blue Cross/Blue Shield.\n  As you can see, Charlie has been an integral part of Georgia's U.S. \nSenate history, and his was a name that came up often when I found \nmyself in need of a chief of staff in 2007.\n  When I interviewed Charlie, I remember asking him what his hobbies \nwere. He replied, `I don't have a hobby, I just like to work.' That \nturned out to be true.\n  I remember telling him my personal policy is to hire good people and \nthen leave them alone to do their job.\n  In this respect, there are never days when I worry my chief of staff \nwould not be in the office, or a task will not be done. He is \npassionate and dedicated, and I am better able to focus on my tasks \nknowing he is there.\n  Ralph Waldo Emerson once said that ``Big jobs usually go to the men \nwho prove their ability to outgrow small ones.''\n  I do not see that in Charlie. He places emphasis on all aspects of \nthe job--big and small.\n  He walks away from a room full of CEOs to answer the front office \nphones, so the staff assistants can have a break.\n  He makes constituent mail a number one priority, ensuring all \nGeorgians receive a quality response by week's end.\n  And he is never too busy to talk to folks visiting from Georgia, or \nstaffers who are having personal troubles.\n  Anyone would be amazed to see how he manages such a high-pressure \nenvironment with efficiency, focus, and vision. Charlie inspires \nconfidence in the staff and he inspires loyalty.\n  In my 19 years in Congress, I have had the good fortune of having \nmany talented staffers. You never forget the work they have done for \nyou.\n  On August 5, Charlie will be leaving my office to join Emory \nUniversity as its Vice President for Government Relations. I \ncongratulate Charlie and wish him well in his new position.\n  Charlie has made a difference in thousands of lives around the Hill, \naround this town, and around Georgia. I will never forget all he has \naccomplished, and he will be sorely missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/30/senate-section/article/S6063-3", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6063-S6064]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO GERALDINE ``JERRIE'' MOCK\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN.

On \nSeptember 14, 2013, a bronze statue will be dedicated in honor of her \naccomplishments at The Works: Ohio Center for History, Art & \nTechnology, a science and history museum for children in Newark, OH.\n  On March 19, 1964, at the age of 38, the Ohio native and self-\ndescribed ``flying housewife'' set off from Columbus, OH on her solo \nflight around the world in a 1953 Cessna 180 single-engine monoplane \nnamed the ``Spirit of Columbus.'' She made the flight in 29 days, \nincluding 21 stopovers, covering 22,860 miles.\n\n[[Page S6064]]\n\n  Jerrie has received numerous awards, including the FAA Gold Medal for \nExceptional Service. She made her mark in the aviation world as the \nfirst woman to fly solo around the world and also completed other feats \nworthy of recognition.

Mr. President, today I wish to honor Hampton, NH--\nan historic Granite State community that is also one of the most \npopular vacation destinations in New England.\n  A crown jewel of New Hampshire's seacoast, Hampton was one of four \noriginal New Hampshire towns and was located in an area originally \nknown as Winnacunnet. According to a town history, it was settled in \nthe autumn of 1638. Incorporated as Hampton in 1639, the current day \nhigh school is named Winnacunnet High School--home of the Warriors.\n  With the arrival of the railroad in the mid 1800s, Hampton became a \nsummertime favorite of travelers from near and far--starting the town's \nlong tradition of providing welcoming hospitality. On a hot summer day, \nHampton Beach can expect to see around 100,000 visitors on its \nbeautiful beaches and boardwalk. Generations of New Hampshire families \nhave spent their summer vacation on the shores of Hampton Beach--eating \nfresh seafood in its restaurants, splashing in the surf, enjoying \nbeachside concerts, and playing in the arcades.\n  Hampton has been the home of many historical and famous figures. \nFirst Lady of the United States, Jane Pierce, called Hampton home, as \ndid former Governor Stephen E. Merrill and former Congressman Tristram \nShaw.\n  Whether it is scenic Hampton Beach, the Tuck Museum or the historic \nJames House historic site--which is described as what may be the \nearliest surviving example of the two-room deep, center chimney \ncolonial in New Hampshire--the proud people of Hampton have contributed \nconspicuously to the spirit and heritage of New Hampshire during the \ntown's first 375 years.\n  Hampton holds a special place in the hearts of citizens across New \nHampshire. On this day, I am pleased to recognize the 375th anniversary \nof Hampton--saluting its citizens and recognizing their \naccomplishments, their love of country, their warm hospitality, and \ntheir spirit of independence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/30/senate-section/article/S6064-2", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6064]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         LISBON, NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Lisbon, NH--a \ntown in Grafton County that is celebrating the 250th anniversary of its \nfounding. I am proud to join citizens across the Granite State in \nrecognizing this historic event.\n  Famous for its annual Lilac Festival, Lisbon is located along the \nAmmonoosuc and Gale rivers in the shadow of Babbit Hill.\n  The land that would become Lisbon was granted in a charter as Concord \nby Gov. Benning Wentworth in 1763. Renamed Chiswick, the name was \nsubsequently changed to Gunthwaite. At a town meeting in 1824, it was \nrenamed Lisbon in honor of Lisbon, Portugal.\n  The population has grown to include over 1,500 residents. The \npatriotism and commitment of the people of Lisbon is reflected in part \nby their record of service in defense of our Nation.\n  Among those patriots were Revolutionary War veterans Samuel Young and \nMAJ Benjamin Whitcomb. Young and members of his family fought in the \nBattle of Bunker Hill, while Whitcomb, also known as the ``Dreaded \nScout,'' was the leader of Whitcomb's Independent Corps of Rangers.\n  New England Wire Technologies first opened in 1899, and it has grown \nto become a leader in the design and manufacture of multiconductor \ncables, custom braids, and strands. Today the company has over 330 \nemployees and is one of the larger employers in the area.\n  According to a town history, ``Three of the five peg mills in the \nUnited States were located in Lisbon. Parker Young Company was at one \ntime the largest manufacturer of piano sounding boards in the world. \nThere were two railroad stations, a library, a gold rush, a small \nairport and the first rope ski tow in New Hampshire.''\n  Lisbon is a place that has contributed much to the life and spirit of \nthe State of New Hampshire. I am pleased to extend my warm regards to \nthe people of Lisbon as they celebrate the town's 250th \nanniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/30/senate-section/article/S6064-3", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6064]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECOGNIZING HALLIE BELL\n\n Mr. BARRASSO.

Mr. President, I wish to commend David A. Harbison, \nJr., and his company, Bison Pumps, for being named the 2013 Aroostook \nEntrepreneur of the Year. Bison Pumps, located in Houlton, ME, both \ndesigns and manufactures hand-powered water pumps. These impressive and \nelegant devices provide reliable access to well water without the need \nfor any electricity.\n  The first Bison pump was born out of necessity during Maine's Great \nIce Storm of 1998, which crippled parts of Maine for several weeks. \nOver half of our State lost power, some areas for more than 2 weeks. \nLike many Mainers faced with adversity, Mr. Harbison and his team of \nplumbers responded to disaster with resilience and innovation. They \ndesigned and built what would be the first Bison hand pump, which \nallowed people whose electric pumps were inoperable in the aftermath of \nthe storm to access the water in their wells. Since 1998, this timely \nand resourceful design has gained international appeal and application.\n  Now a strong and growing business with 12 employees, Bison Pumps \nsells its polished stainless steel products around the country and all \nover the world. From the woods of northern Maine to the hustle and \nbustle of Singapore, these pumps are making a difference by allowing \npeople to access well water without electricity. Just recently, a \nministry organization bought one of the pumps, which is now helping \nthem provide much needed clean water to people in Haiti.\n  We have many great small businesses in Maine, and the 2013 Aroostook \nEntrepreneur of the Year Award winner, Mr. Harbison and Bison Pumps, is \ncertainly one of them. Bison Pumps represents the bold, free-thinking \nspirit that defines the State of Maine. I am proud to join in \nrecognizing their ingenuity, and I expect they will continue to impress \nus--both in Maine and around the world with their superb \nproducts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/30/senate-section/article/S6066-2", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6066]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  REMEMBERING VERNON AND MARIE NELSON\n\n Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, there are many things I admire about \nfolks from my home State of Kansas but especially how Kansans carry on \nthe traditions of previous generations. No tradition runs deeper in \nKansas than the tradition of working on a family farm.\n  Across our Nation, 98 percent of our country's 2 million farms are \nfamily owned. For many Kansas children, growing up on a farm is a way \nof life. By working alongside their parents, grandparents, and \nneighbors, young people learn important life skills and values like \nhard work, personal responsibility, and perseverance.\n  Gary Nelson of Falun, KS learned many of these life skills on the \nfarm by working alongside his parents, Vernon and Marie Nelson. The \nNelson family farm has been in his family for 144 years. It was \noriginally homesteaded by Gary's great-grandfather Lars Frederick \nNelson, in 1869. Nineteen years ago, Gary's father Vernon passed away, \nleaving the management of the farm in his hands. In the years that \nfollowed, Gary took over the farm operations with the help of his \nmother. But just a few weeks ago, Marie passed away. The community of \nFalun lost two special people when Vernon and Marie passed away.\n  Both of Gary's parents came from a strong Swedish heritage and were \nwell known in the small rural community of Falun in Saline County. They \nwere married in 1952 and spent the next 42 years together, raising \ntheir son, managing the farm, and investing in the local community. A \nstrong work ethic and an abiding care for others were defining \nattributes of both Vernon and Marie. They were also both skilled \ncraftsmen--Vernon once made a walnut box that contained a bronze \nsculpture for President Ronald Reagan, and Marie had a love for \nquilting and once worked on a special quilt that was given to Nancy \nReagan.\n  Vernon and Marie were also very proud of their son and came to visit \nGary while he was working as an intern for former Senator Bob Dole in \nthe summer of 1983. One of their special memories was enjoying lunch \ntogether in the Senate dining room at the invitation of Senator Dole.\n  In small rural towns across Kansas, people work hard, take pride in \ntheir communities and care for one another. Vernon and Marie were two \nsuch people. Gary recently said this about his parents: ``They are part \nof the fabric that is our community now and that of the future.'' \nIndividuals like Vernon and Marie also make up the fabric of our \ncountry, and their contributions have made our Nation what it is today. \nVernon and Marie lived each day to its fullest, and their devotion to \nthose around them stands as an inspiration to us all.\n  I extend my heartfelt sympathies to Gary and the Nelson family and \nfriends. I ask my colleagues and all Kansans to remember the Nelson \nfamily in your thoughts and prayers in the days ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/30/senate-section/article/S6066-3", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6066]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/30/senate-section/article/S6066-4", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6066]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor and Pensions.\n  (The message received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/30/senate-section/article/S6066-5", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6066]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3:37 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2397.

A bill to establish a pilot program to authorize the \nSecretary of Housing and Urban Development to make grants to nonprofit \norganizations to rehabilitate and modify homes of disabled and low-\nincome veterans; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am proud to be once again reintroducing \nthe Housing Assistance for Veterans Act, HAVEN Act, with my colleague, \nSenator Johanns.\n  Last year, we joined forces to successfully pass this legislation as \nan amendment during the Senate's consideration of the National Defense \nAuthorization Act, NDAA. Unfortunately, due to concerns by some on the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee, it was not included in the final version \nof the NDAA. Those concerns have been addressed in this version of the \nHAVEN Act, and I would like to thank the Veterans' Affairs Committee \nfor working cooperatively with us to strengthen the legislation.\n  Our veterans have made many personal sacrifices in service to our \nNation, and we must honor our commitment to provide them with the care \nthey have earned and deserve. One such way is to ensure that they have \naccess to adequate housing.\n  According to Rebuilding Together, 5.5 million of our veterans are \ndisabled, and one and a half million are at risk of homelessness. In my \nhome State of Rhode Island, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, there \nare more than 19,000 veterans with disabilities, each of whom face \ntheir own unique challenges in terms of their housing needs.\n  The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, has programs that assist \nveterans in adapting and improving their homes, but unfortunately, \nthese programs do not extend assistance to all veterans with \ndisabilities. It is clear we must do more, and with this legislation, \nwe are seeking to serve all veterans with disabilities, regardless of \nthe severity of the disability and whether the disability is service-\nconnected.\n\n[[Page S6074]]\n\n  The HAVEN Act will give veterans the opportunity to renovate and \nmodify their existing homes by installing wheelchair ramps, widening \ndoors, re-equipping rooms, and making necessary additions and \nadjustments to existing structures--all so that these homes are safer \nand more suitable for our veterans.\n  Our legislation encourages key stakeholders, such as the Department \nof Housing and Urban Development, the VA, housing non-profits, and \nveterans service organizations, to work together to serve our veterans. \nIn order to extend the reach of this Federal funding, grant recipients \nwould be expected to either match Federal funding or make in-kind \ncontributions, through encouraging volunteers to help make repairs or \nengaging businesses to donate needed supplies.\n  This bill is supported by the American Legion, Veterans of Foreign \nWars, Vietnam Veterans of America, Paralyzed Veterans of America, \nVetsFirst, a program of United Spinal Association, Iraq and Afghanistan \nVeterans of America, Habitat for Humanity, and Rebuilding Together. I \nthank Senator Johanns for working with me on this important bill, and I \nlook forward to working with him and the rest of our colleagues to pass \nthis legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEVIN (for himself, Mr. Durbin, Ms. Stabenow, and Mr. \n        Brown):\n  S. 1388. A bill to require the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices, in consultation with the Administrator of the Environmental \nProtection Agency and the Secretary of Energy, to conduct a study on \nthe public health and environmental impacts of the production, \ntransportation, storage, and use of petroleum coke, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am introducing today, with my colleagues \nSenators Durbin, Stabenow, and Brown, the Petroleum Coke Transparency \nand Public Health Study Act, which would require the Department of \nHealth and Human Services to conduct a study on the health and \nenvironmental impacts of petroleum coke. This bill, which is a \ncompanion to a bill introduced by Representative Peters on June 6, \n2013, was motivated by a situation in Detroit.\n  In March 2013, large piles of uncontained petroleum coke stored along \nthe banks of the Detroit River became publicly visible, raising \nquestions about the potential environmental and public health impacts. \nSitting just feet from the Detroit River, the piles have grown to \nnearly three stories high over the past several months. I want to make \nsure that this low-grade fuel does not pose a threat to the people of \nDetroit or impair our waterways. The Detroit River is a valued resource \nthat must be preserved and protected.\n  Petroleum coke is a byproduct of refining crude oil into liquid fuels \nsuch as gasoline and diesel. It is a commodity that can be cofired with \ncoal to produce low-cost energy. In recent years, a number of U.S. \nrefineries have undergone expansions in order to accommodate increases \nin processing crude oil, including the Marathon refinery in Detroit, \nMI; the Cenovus refinery in Wood River, IL; and the BP refinery in \nWhiting, IN.\n  With increases in crude oil processing in the United States and \nCanada, petroleum coke production is expected to rise. However, the \nimpacts of petroleum coke on public health and the environment have not \nbeen fully assessed. Further, each State has different regulations for \nmanaging, storing, and transporting it. It is important that we \nunderstand the market projections for petroleum coke, how to properly \nmanage it, and its potential impacts on public health and the \nenvironment.\n  This bill would address these key knowledge gaps by requiring a \ncomprehensive study on petroleum coke. The study would include an \nanalysis of the public health and environmental impacts of the \nproduction, transportation, storage, and use of petroleum coke; an \nassessment of best practices for storing, transporting, and managing \npetroleum coke; and a quantitative analysis of current and projected \ndomestic petroleum coke production and utilization locations.\n  We should ensure that energy production occurs in a diligent and \nresponsible manner and does not harm public health or our environment. \nWith a changing energy market and limited dollars, we must have a \ncomprehensive understanding of how to effectively and efficiently \nmanage our future energy supply. This bill would give us the tools to \nproperly manage petroleum coke production with good environmental and \npublic stewardship.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KING (for himself and Mr. Blunt):\n  S. 1390. A bill to establish an independent advisory committee to \nreview certain regulations, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, I would like to offer a few words on a bill \nthat I am introducing today with my colleague and friend, Senator Roy \nBlunt of Missouri. Upon my arrival to the Senate, Senator Blunt and I \nshared a conversation in which we discovered our interest in proposing \npragmatic legislation that would go about easing the ever-growing \nregulatory burden borne by businesses across the country. Since then, \nwe have worked together to craft a bill that takes a reasonable \napproach toward thinning out older regulations that have outlived their \nutility, all while retaining essential congressional oversight. Today \nwe introduce the Regulatory Improvement Act of 2013, which I believe \nwill achieve this goal.\n  The Regulatory Improvement Act will create an independent Regulatory \nImprovement Commission that will be tasked with reviewing outdated \nregulations with the goals of modifying, consolidating, or repealing \nregulations in order to reduce compliance costs, encourage growth and \ninnovation, and improve competitiveness. The composition of the \ncommission will be determined by congressional leadership and the \nPresident, and the commission will be tasked with identifying a single \nsector or area of regulations for consideration. After extensive review \ninvolving broad public and stakeholder input, the commission will \nsubmit to Congress a report containing regulations in need of \nstreamlining, consolidation, or repeal. This report will enjoy \nexpedited legislative procedures and will be subject to an up-or-down \nvote in both houses of Congress without amendment.\n  Let me be clear: the intent of this bill is not to engage in a \nwholesale dismantling of the existing regulatory regime. In particular, \nI share some of my colleagues concerns that ``regulatory reform'' can \nbe employed as a euphemism to disguise an undercurrent of efforts to \ncompletely undo significant legislation--from the Clean Air Act to the \nAffordable Care Act. I do not support such efforts. That said, I \nbelieve there is broad bipartisan consensus that regulations have a \ncumulative effect and that Congress has neither the expertise nor \nformal mechanisms through which it can effectively and expeditiously \nconduct retrospective analyses. A Regulatory Improvement Commission \nwould provide a vehicle for the review of older regulations and \nprovided much-needed relief to businesses struggling to comply with \nlayers of competing or even duplicative regulations.\n  In a larger sense, this bill seeks to reclaim some of the ground that \nCongress has ceded to executive agencies in recent years. From my \nvantage point, the current regulatory structure has become akin to a \nfourth, unchecked branch of government. As an institution, we must find \nways to reverse this disturbing trend and reestablish an appropriate \nrole of congressional oversight. Therefore, I am glad to introduce this \nbipartisan bill that offers a reasonable way to revisit older \nregulations, and I thank Senator Blunt for his interest and support of \nthe proposal.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Grassley, and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 1391. A bill to amend the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of \n1967 and other laws to clarify appropriate standards for Federal \nemployment discrimination and retaliation claims, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I join with my senior colleague from \nIowa, Senator Grassley, and with the distinguished chair of the \nJudiciary\n\n[[Page S6075]]\n\nCommittee, Senator Leahy, in reintroducing the Protecting Older Workers \nAgainst Discrimination Act.\n  The need for this legislation was vividly demonstrated by the \nexperience of an Iowan--Jack Gross. Mr. Gross gave the prime of his \nlife, a quarter century of loyal service, to one company. Despite Mr. \nGross's stellar work record, FBL Financial demoted him and other \nemployees over the age of 50 and gave his job to a younger employee.\n  Expressly to prevent this kind of discrimination, in 1967 Congress \npassed the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, ADEA. Modeled from and \nusing the same language as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964--\nwhich prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of race, sex, \nnational origin and religion--the ADEA makes it unlawful to \ndiscriminate on the basis of age.\n  When Mr. Gross sought to enforce his rights under this law, a jury of \nIowans heard the facts and found that his employer discriminated \nagainst him because of his age. That jury awarded him almost $47,000 in \nlost compensation.\n  The case was ultimately appealed to the Supreme Court. In June 2009, \nin Gross v. FBL Financial, Inc., the Court ruled against Mr. Gross, and \nin doing so made it harder for those with legitimate age discrimination \nclaims to prevail under the ADEA. In fact, on remand, despite the fact \nMr. Gross had established that age discrimination was a factor in his \ndemotion, he lost his retrial.\n  For decades, the law was clear. In 1989, in Price Waterhouse v. \nHopkins, the Court ruled that if a plaintiff seeking relief under Title \nVII of the Civil Rights Act demonstrated that discrimination was a \n``motivating'' or ``substantial'' factor behind the employer's action, \nthe burden shifted to the employer to show it would have taken the same \naction regardless of the plaintiff's membership in a protected class. \nAs part of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, Congress codified the \n``motivating factor'' standard with respect to Title VII discrimination \nclaims.\n  Since the ADEA uses the same language as Title VII, was modeled from \nit, and had been interpreted consistent with the Civil Rights Act, \ncourts rightly and consistently held that, like a plaintiff claiming \ndiscrimination on the basis of race, sex, religion and national origin, \na victim bringing suit under the ADEA need only show that membership in \na protected class was a ``motivating factor'' in an employer's action. \nIf an employee showed that age was one factor in an employment \ndecision, the burden was on the employer to show it had acted for a \nlegitimate reason other than age.\n  In Gross, the Court, addressing a question on which it did not grant \ncertiorari, tore up this decades' old standard. In its place, the Court \nimposed a standard that makes it prohibitively difficult for a victim \nto prove age discrimination. According to the Court, a plaintiff bears \nthe full burden of proving that age was not only a ``motivating'' \nfactor but the ``but for'' factor, or decisive factor. And, \nunfortunately, just last month the Supreme Court, in University of \nTexas Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar, extended Gross to \nretaliation cases under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. Moreover, \nlower courts have extended Gross to other civil rights claims, \nincluding cases arising under the Americans with Disabilities Act and \nthe Rehabilitation Act.\n  The extremely high burden Gross imposes radically undermines workers' \nability to hold employers accountable. As Professor Helen Norton \ntestified to the HELP Committee, ``Gross entirely insulates from \nliability even an employer who confesses discrimination so long as that \nemployer had another reason for its decision. By permitting employers \nto escape liability altogether even for a workplace admittedly infected \nby discrimination, with no incentive to refrain from similar \ndiscrimination in the future, the Gross rule thus undermines Congress's \nefforts to stop and deter workplace discrimination.''\n  Bear in mind, unlawful discrimination is often difficult to detect. \nObviously, those who discriminate do not often admit they are acting \nfor discriminatory reasons. Employers rarely post signs saying, for \nexample, ``older workers need not apply.'' To the contrary, they go out \nof their way to conceal their true intent. The employer is in the best \nposition to offer an explanation of why a decision that involves \ndiscrimination or retaliation was actually motivated by legitimate \nreasons. As Professor Norton testified, ``[s]uch burden shifting \nappropriately recognizes and responds to employers' greater access to \ninformation that is key to proving or disproving an element of a \nparticular claim . . .'' By putting the entire burden on the worker to \ndemonstrate the absence or insignificance of other factors, the court \nin effect has freed employers to discriminate or retaliate.\n  Unfortunately, as Mr. Gross and his colleagues know all too well, age \ndiscrimination does indeed occur. Countless thousands of American \nworkers who are not yet ready to voluntarily retire find themselves \njobless or passed over for promotions because of age discrimination. \nOlder workers often face stereotypes: That they are not as productive \nas younger workers; that they cannot learn new skills; that they \nsomehow have a lesser need for income to provide for their families.\n  Indeed, according to an AARP study, 60% of older workers have \nreported that they or someone they know has faced age discrimination in \nthe workplace. According to the Equal Employment Opportunity \nCommission, in Fiscal Year 2012, over 2,800 age discrimination \ncomplaints were filed, a more than 20 percent increase from just five \nyears ago. Given the stereotypes that older workers face, it is no \nsurprise that on average they remain unemployed for more than twice as \nlong as all unemployed workers.\n  The Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act reiterates \nthe principle that Congress established when it passed the Civil Rights \nAct of 1964, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the \nRehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act--when making \nemployment decisions it is illegal for race, sex, national origin, \nreligion, age or disability to be a factor.\n  The bill repudiates the Supreme Court's Gross v. FBL Financial \ndecision and will restore the law to what it was for decades. It makes \nclear that when an employee shows discrimination was a ``motivating \nfactor'' behind a decision, the burden is properly on the employer to \nshow the same decision would have been made regardless of \ndiscrimination or retaliation. And, like the Civil Rights Act of 1991 \nwith respect to discrimination cases under Title VII, if the employer \nmeets that burden, the employer remains liable, but remedies are \nlimited.\n  This is a common sense, bipartisan bill. In fact, the Civil Rights \nAct of 1991, key provisions of which served as a model for this \nlegislation, passed the Senate on a bipartisan basis 93-5. Further, we \nare introducing this bill only after countless hours of consultation \nwith civil rights stakeholders and representatives of the business \ncommunity. Moreover, this bill addresses the concerns that were raised \nabout an earlier version of the bill at a hearing held before the \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee in March 2010.\n  In fact, I want to comment on two changes from that earlier version \nof this bill introduced in the last Congress. Since October 2009, when \nSenator Leahy and I first introduced the Protecting Older Workers \nAgainst Discrimination Act, we have had the benefit of nearly three and \na half years of lower court application of the Gross decision.\n  The 2009 bill would have expressly amended the ADEA to make clear \nthat the analytical framework set out in McDonnell Douglas v. Green \napplied to that statute. Even though, before Gross, every Court of \nAppeals had held that McDonnell Douglas had applied to age claims, this \nclarification was meant to address a footnote in Gross in which the \nCourt arguably questioned the applicability of McDonnell Douglas to the \nADEA. Since the bill was first introduced, however, every lower court \nthat has examined the issue has continued to apply McDonnell Douglas to \nthe ADEA. As a result, because McDonnell Douglas applies to the ADEA \nalready, we deem it unnecessary to amend the statute.\n  Second, the initial bill expressly amended only the ADEA. Since \nGross, however, lower courts have applied the Court's reasoning in that \ndecision to\n\n[[Page S6076]]\n\nother statutes. Because the most notable application has been to the \nADA, Rehabilitation Act and Title VII retaliation claims, those \nstatutes are expressly amended here too.\n  Finally, in Gross, the Court defended the Court's departure from \nwell-established law by noting that it ``cannot ignore Congress' \ndecision to amend Title VII's relevant provisions but not make similar \nchanges to the ADEA.'' In other words, the Court found that because \nCongress, in the Civil Rights Act of 1991, codified the ``motivating \nfactor'' framework for discrimination claims under Title VII, but not \nfor the ADEA, Congress somehow must have intended Price Waterhouse not \nto apply to any statute but Title VII.\n  Because of the Court's reasoning, I want to emphasize that this bill \nin no way questions the motivating factor framework for other anti-\ndiscrimination and anti-retaliation statutes that are not expressly \ncovered by the legislation. As the bill's findings make clear, not only \ndoes this bill repudiate the Gross decision itself, but it expressly \nrepudiates the reasoning underlying the decision, including the \nargument that Congress's failure to amend any statute other than Title \nVII means that Congress intended to disallow mixed motive claims under \nother statutes. It would be an error for a court to apply similar \nreasoning following passage of this bill to other statutes. The fact \nthat other statutes are not expressly amended in this bill does not \nmean that Congress endorses Gross's application to any other statute.\n  In conclusion, this bill is very straightforward. It reiterates what \nCongress said in 1967 when it passed the ADEA--when making employment \ndecisions it is illegal for age to be a factor. A person should not be \njudged arbitrarily because he or she was born in a certain year or \nearlier when he or she still has the ability to contribute as much, or \nmore, as the next person. This bill will help ensure that all our \ncitizens will have an equal opportunity, commensurate with their \nabilities, for productive employment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1391\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Older Workers \n     Against Discrimination Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In enacting section 107 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 \n     (adding section 703(m) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964), \n     Congress reaffirmed its understanding that unlawful \n     discrimination is often difficult to detect and prove because \n     discriminators do not usually admit their discrimination and \n     often try to conceal their true motives. Section 703(m) of \n     the Civil Rights Act of 1964 expressly approved so-called \n     ``mixed motive'' claims, providing that an unlawful \n     employment practice is established when a protected \n     characteristic was a motivating factor for any employment \n     practice, even though other factors also motived the \n     practice.\n       (2) Congress enacted amendments to other civil rights \n     statutes, including the Age Discrimination in Employment Act \n     of 1967 (referred to in this section as the ``ADEA''), the \n     Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, and the \n     Rehabilitation Act of 1973, but Congress did not expressly \n     amend those statutes to address mixed motive discrimination.\n       (3) In the case of Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc., \n     557 U.S. 167 (2009), the Supreme Court held that, because \n     Congress did not expressly amend the ADEA to address mixed \n     motive claims, such claims were unavailable under the ADEA, \n     and instead the complainant bears the burden of proving that \n     a protected characteristic or protected activity was the \n     ``but for'' cause of an unlawful employment practice. This \n     decision has significantly narrowed the scope of protections \n     afforded by the statutes that were not expressly amended in \n     1991 to address mixed motive claims.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to clarify congressional intent that mixed motive \n     claims shall be available, and that a complaining party need \n     not prove that a protected characteristic or protected \n     activity was the ``but for'' cause of an unlawful employment \n     practice, under the ADEA and similar civil rights provisions;\n       (2) to reject the Supreme Court's reasoning in the Gross \n     decision that Congress' failure to amend any statute other \n     than title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (with respect \n     to discrimination claims), in enacting section 107 of the \n     Civil Rights Act of 1991, suggests that Congress intended to \n     disallow mixed motive claims under other statutes; and\n       (3) to clarify that complaining parties--\n       (A) may rely on any type or form of admissible evidence to \n     establish their claims of an unlawful employment practice;\n       (B) are not required to demonstrate that the protected \n     characteristic or activity was the sole cause of the \n     employment practice; and\n       (C) may demonstrate an unlawful employment practice through \n     any available method of proof or analytical framework.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \npermanently extend and expand the charitable deduction for \ncontributions of food inventory; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the Good \nSamaritan Hunger Relief Tax Incentive Act along with Senators Cochran, \nCasey, and Moran. This bill is an effort I have worked on with former \nSenator Richard Lugar for many years and I am happy to continue the \neffort on behalf of hungry families nationwide this Congress.\n  In the wake of our Nation's economic recession, the demand on food \nbanks, church food pantries, and soup kitchens has increased \nsignificantly. According to a study by the United States Department of \nAgriculture, over 50 million Americans lived in food insecure \nhouseholds in 2011. The same study found that households with children \nreported food insecurity at a much higher rate than households without \nchildren. In fact, in Vermont alone, over 12,000 children rely on food \nfrom food shelves each month.\n  Despite the increased demand for donated food, it is estimated that \nbetween 25 and 40 percent of the food that is produced, grown, and \ntransported in the United States will never be consumed. This \ncontributes to the 70 billion pounds of fit and wholesome food that are \nsent to landfills in the United States each year.\n  This bill would address this troubling trend by giving greater \nincentives to all businesses to donate food to non-profit organizations \nthat feed the hungry. The current tax code allows corporations to \nreceive a special deduction for donations to food banks, but it \nexcludes many other small businesses such as farmers, ranchers, and \nrestaurant owners from the same tax incentive. Unfortunately, these \nbusinesses often find it more cost effective to throw away food than to \ndonate it to those in need.\n  I am pleased beginning in 2006, Congress temporarily extended this \ntax incentive to most businesses, and most recently extended the \nprovision through the end of 2013. After the provision was enacted, in \nthe restaurant industry alone we saw a 137 percent increase in the \npounds of food donated. The Good Samaritan Hunger Relief Tax Incentive \nAct would make this provision permanent, and would extend the deduction \nto farmers who often have large amounts of fresh food to donate.\n  This bipartisan legislation is supported by numerous organizations \nincluding Feeding America, the American Farm Bureau Federation, the \nFood Marketing Institute, Grocery Manufactures Association, the \nNational Restaurant Association, the Vermont Food Bank, and Hunger Free \nVermont. I hope as this Congress considers comprehensive tax \nlegislation in the future this measure is included. We must do more to \nensure that no one in America goes hungry, and increasing the amount of \nfood available to food banks is a critical step toward meeting that \ngoal.\n      By Mr. DURBIN:\n  S. 1399. A bill to amend the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act to \nextend the interest rate limitation on debt entered into during \nmilitary service to debt incurred during military service to \nconsolidate or refinance student loans incurred before military \nservice; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1399\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to increase access to adult education to provide for \neconomic growth; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, our economy will not work for individuals or \nfor our nation unless we create and support avenues for adults to \ncontinue their education and build their skills. These are longstanding \nissues that I\n\n[[Page S6078]]\n\nhave worked on for many years, including the last attempt to \nreauthorize the Workforce Investment Act. I was pleased to work with \nSenator Webb in the 112th Congress on the Adult Education and Economic \nGrowth Act, and I am proud to reintroduce it today with Senator Brown. \nI thank Congressman Ruben Hinojosa for introducing the companion \nlegislation in the House of Representatives.\n  The Adult Education and Economic Growth Act increases the investment \nin adult education programs; ensures better coordination among adult \neducation programs, workforce development programs, and higher \neducation; strengthens professional development for adult education \nproviders; expands the use of technology in adult education programs; \nand provides incentives for employers to support their workers who need \nadult education services.\n  In Rhode Island, roughly 41 percent of working age adults have a \ncollege degree. By 2018, it is estimated that 61 percent of Rhode \nIsland jobs will require some postsecondary education. We have an \nestimated 91,000 individuals without a high school diploma--the basic \nticket to accessing postsecondary education and training.\n  Nationally, the numbers make a similar case for the need to invest in \nadult education. According to the National Commission on Adult \nLiteracy, 80 to 90 million U.S. adults today, about half of the adult \nworkforce, do not have the basic education and communication skills \nrequired to obtain jobs that pay a family-sustaining wage. These \nindividuals continue to struggle in the recovering economy, with \nunemployment rates above 10 percent for individuals who do not have a \nhigh school diploma, compared to 7.6 percent for high school graduates \nand less than 4 percent for workers with bachelor's degrees.\n  Simply put, we will not be able to close the skills gap without a \nrobust investment in adult education. Unfortunately, we have not been \nmaking this kind of investment. Funding has been anemic, and as a \nresult, services reach fewer than 3 million adults annually--a fraction \nof the need.\n  The Adult Education and Economic Growth will help turn around this \ndire situation by increasing the authorization for adult education \nprograms authorized under Title II of the Workforce Investment Act to \n$850 million and establishing a new state technology grant for adult \neducation to upgrade the delivery system and assist adults in attaining \ncritical digital literacy skills. This legislation requires state and \nlocal workforce investment boards to address adult education in their \nplans for using funds authorized under Title I of the Workforce \nInvestment Act, including incorporating adult education into career \npathways programs and offering integrated education and training \nprograms. It also strengthens programs and services for English \nlearners, including authorizing the Integrated English Literacy and \nCivics Program, and for adults with disabilities. The legislation will \nalso build the knowledge base on what works for adult learners through \na National Center for Adult Education, Literacy, and Workplace Skills. \nFinally, the Adult Education and Economic Growth Act will provide \nemployers with tax incentives to invest in developing the basic skills \nof their employees.\n  In sum, the Adult Education and Economic Growth Act offers a \ncomprehensive approach to reaching the millions of adults who need \nbasic skills, English literacy instruction, or a secondary school \ndiploma so that they can embark on a career pathway that leads to \neconomic stability and success. I am pleased to have worked with the \nNational Commission on Adult Literacy in developing this legislation. I \nurge my colleagues to cosponsor this bill and work with me to include \nits provisions in the pending reauthorization of the Workforce \nInvestment Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/30/senate-section/article/S6078-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6078]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 202--DESIGNATING JULY 30, 2013, AS ``NATIONAL \n                    WHISTLEBLOWER APPRECIATION DAY''\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Levin) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to.:\n\n                              S.

Res. 204\n\n       Whereas August 7, 2013, marks the 224th anniversary of the \n     signing by President George Washington of the Act entitled \n     ``An Act for the establishment and support of lighthouses, \n     beacons, buoys, and public piers'', approved August 7, 1789 \n     (commonly known as the ``Lighthouse Act of 1789'') (1 Stat. \n     53, chapter 9);\n       Whereas that Act, the ninth act of the 1st Congress, \n     established a Federal role in the support, maintenance, and \n     repair of all lighthouses, beacon buoys, and public piers \n     necessary for safe navigation, commissioned the first Federal \n     lighthouse, and represents the first public works act in the \n     young United States;\n       Whereas the establishment of the United States system of \n     navigational aids set the United States on a path to the \n     forefront of international maritime prominence and \n     established lighthouses that played an integral role in the \n     rich maritime history of the United States, as that history \n     spread from the Atlantic coast, through the Great Lakes and \n     the Gulf coast, to the Pacific States;\n       Whereas those iconic structures, standing at land's end \n     through 2 centuries, have symbolized safety, security, \n     heroism, duty, and faithfulness;\n       Whereas architects, designers, engineers, builders, and \n     keepers devoted, and in some cases jeopardized, their lives \n     for the safety of others during centuries of light tending by \n     the United States Lighthouse Service and the United States \n     Coast Guard;\n       Whereas the automation of the light system exposed the \n     historic lighthouse towers to the ravages of time and \n     vandalism and yet, at the same time, opened an opportunity \n     for citizen involvement in efforts to save and restore those \n     beacons that mark the evolving maritime history of the United \n     States and its coastal communities;\n       Whereas the national lighthouse preservation movement has \n     gained momentum over the past half century and is making \n     major contributions to the preservation of maritime history \n     and heritage and, through the development and enhancement of \n     cultural tourism, to the economies of coastal communities in \n     the United States;\n       Whereas the National Historic Lighthouse Preservation Act \n     of 2000 (Public Law 106-355;
