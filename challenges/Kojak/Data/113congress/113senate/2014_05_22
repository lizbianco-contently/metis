Additionally, Senator Leahy will control the final 5 minutes \nand Senator Paul will control the 5 minutes prior to that.\n  At 1:45 p.m. there will be two rollcall votes. The first vote will be \non confirmation of the nomination of David Barron to be U.S. circuit \njudge for the First Circuit, and the second vote will be on the \nadoption of the conference report to accompany H.R. 3060, the WRRDA \nbill.\n\n\n                             Tax Extenders\n\n  This week Senate Republicans voted against tax cuts that most of them \nhave said they like. The legislation is widely applauded around the \ncountry. I have a letter from 152 different entities that say they love \nthis legislation, and they said it should pass, two of which are the \nChamber of Commerce, which is certainly no leftwing group, and the \nNational Association of Manufacturers--the same--and there are scores \nof others. It seems the only Republicans who do not want this tax cut \nare the Republicans in Congress. Republicans around the country want \nthese tax cuts, Democrats want these tax cuts, and so do Independents.\n  This legislation is very important because it would bolster nearly \nevery segment of our society. It helps students and teachers, workers \nand employers, American families and businesses, all while saving money \nand growing our economy.\n  These 152 organizations that signed this letter to me are pleading \nwith the Senate to extend these tax provisions because not doing so \nwould ``inject instability and uncertainty into our economy.''\n  Republicans say the reason they voted against the bill is because \nthey want to vote on amendments. Yet the only amendment they have \nidentified was a poison pill amendment. Of course, what was the subject \nmatter? Their favorite subject--ObamaCare. It has nothing to do with \nthe extenders.\n  But we have seen this game play out before. The Senate is not going \nto vote on ``gotcha'' amendments designed to score political points. \nThis legislation is too important. I have said all along that I am \nwilling to undertake reasonable, germane amendments. That is certainly \nappropriate. That is what they did in the Finance Committee. They had \nan extended markup of this bill in the Finance Committee. The rule they \nhave there is that amendments have to be germane. That rule applied to \nthis bill, as it should, and that is what should be applied here on the \nfloor.\n  So if Republican Senators can come up with a list of reasonable, \ngermane amendments, I am more than happy to return to the tax extenders \nbill. Those are amendments I would not pick. They always say: Well, \nReid is picking our amendments.\n  Those are their amendments. They can file reasonable, germane \namendments. There are a multitude of amendments they could offer.\n  So let's see if Republicans want to get something done on this \nlegislation. We can debate back and forth on the finer points of Senate \nprocedure endlessly, as has happened around here in the last 5\\1/2\\ \nyears. But at the end of the day it comes down to a simple question: Do \nyou want to get something done for the middle class? Do you want\n\n[[Page S3246]]\n\nto get something done for business? Or do you want to impose more \ngridlock and obstruction and delay for the sake of delay?\n  We are here because we want to get something done for the middle \nclass. That is how we feel on this side of the aisle. It is a shame my \nRepublican colleagues cannot say the same.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Walsh).

Mr. President, later today we are going to vote on the \nconfirmation of David Barron, who has been nominated for a vacancy on \nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.\n  Yesterday, we were able to overcome the unjustified Republican \nfilibuster of this extraordinary nominee. Now, I have had the privilege \nof serving longer in this body than any other Senator here. I have \nnever seen so many filibusters of judicial nominees by any President, \nRepublican or Democratic. In fact, Republicans filibustered the very \nfirst judge President Obama sent to this body, a judge who was strongly \nsupported by the Senators from his State, one of whom was the most \nsenior Republican in this body, the other a moderate Democrat. \nFortunately, enough Senators joined together to overcome that \nfilibuster.\n  David Barron is currently a professor at Harvard Law School. He is a \nnationally recognized expert in constitutional law and the separation \nof powers, administrative law, and federalism. He clerked on the U.S. \nSupreme Court for Justice John Paul Stevens. In fact, I recall that \nJustice Stevens had so much regard for him that he attended Mr. \nBarron's nomination hearing.\n  I am in full support of Mr. Barron's nomination. It is almost as if \nhe was sent to central casting for who should be a court of appeals \njudge. I have not seen any judicial nominee with better qualifications \nby either a Republican or Democratic President.\n  Let me respond to some of the criticisms levied against him with \nrespect to the so-called drone memos as well as allegations that he \nwould not be an independent judge who adheres to the rule of law. I \nreject both of those criticisms.\n  Over the last few weeks, I have spoken extensively about the issue of \nthe drone materials and would refer specifically to my statement of May \n14 of this year. While Senators may disagree with the administration's \npolicies regarding the use of drones for lethal counterterrorism \noperations--and I have raised concerns about some of those operations--\nit is important not to conflate the confirmation of David Barron with \nthe disclosure of Justice Department memoranda over which he had no \ncontrol. He wrote an analysis of the law. Others make the decision of \nwhat they will do.\n  Yesterday the Justice Department made the right decision by agreeing \nto publicly release the redacted version of the legal justification for \nthe government's potential use of lethal force against U.S. citizens in \ncounterterrorism operations. I welcome the administration's additional \nstep toward greater transparency.\n  Incidentally, these materials have been available to all Senators in \nrecent weeks. We have had them in the unredacted form in a secure room \nhere in the Capitol. We did that so that nobody could claim: Well, if \nonly I knew what was in those memos, I could make up my mind. Every \nsingle Senator has had an opportunity to read them before today's vote.\n  We have heard some Senators argue that the Justice Department legal \nanalysis provides the government with a blank check to use lethal force \nagainst Americans in places such as Germany or Canada. Oh my God, talk \nabout grasping at straws. We are dealing with reality here, not Alice \nin Wonderland. Such a claim is simply inaccurate, inconsistent with the \nunderstanding anybody would have reading these materials.\n  In any event, the Attorney General has confirmed that Anwar al-Awlaki \nis the only American who was specifically targeted and killed since \n2009. Awlaki was a senior operational leader of all of Al Qaeda in the \nArab Peninsula, located in Yemen. He directed the failed attempt to \nblow up an airliner over Detroit on Christmas Day 2009. He was \ncontinuing to plot attacks against the United States when he was \nkilled, according to the Attorney General.\n  I am glad a number of Senators share my deep regard for the \nconstitutional rights of Americans and have spoken about that on the \nfloor. I hope that after Mr. Barron is confirmed, they will show they \nreally believe what they have been saying by joining me and 21 other \nSenators in cosponsoring the USA FREEDOM Act to help restore America's \nconstitutional and privacy rights.\n  Finally, both Mr. Barron and a long list of bipartisan supporters \nhave forcefully refuted any indication that he views the role of a \njudge as that of a policymaker. In a response to a question from \nSenator Grassley, Mr. Barron stated the following under oath:\n\n       The judicial obligation is to set aside whatever personal \n     views one may have and to decide the particular case at \n     issue. A judge must base the decision in any case solely on \n     the facts and the law, while respectfully considering the \n     arguments of the litigants. I would take that obligation to \n     be an inexorable one, just as I felt obliged to set aside any \n     personal views I may have had in providing legal advice \n     within the executive branch while serving as the Acting \n     Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel \n     and as a career lawyer in that Office. I believe the best way \n     to ensure one honors that obligation is to immerse oneself \n     fully in the particular facts of the case and the law \n     relevant to it and then to apply the law faithfully to those \n     facts.\n\n  Mr. Barron's respect for the rule of law was recently reaffirmed by \nStanford Law Professor Michael McConnell, a well-respected conservative \nscholar and former George W. Bush appointee to the Tenth Circuit. In a \nletter dated May 7, 2014 in support of Mr. Barron's nomination, \nProfessor McConnell stated:\n\n       I suspect that on particular controversial issues, Barron \n     and I disagree more often than not. But I have read much of \n     his academic work, and followed his performance as acting \n     head of the Office of Legal Counsel. In my opinion, his \n     writings and opinions have demonstrated not only intelligence \n     (even where we disagree) but respect for the rule of law. In \n     the Office of Legal Counsel, whose functions closely resemble \n     those of a judge, Barron's publicly released opinions \n     indicated that he was consistently a force for legal \n     regularity and respect for the constitution and laws of the \n     United States. That is an important and precious thing.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that Professor McConnell's letter be printed \nin the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  It should be clear from Mr. Barron's testimony and Professor \nMcConnell's letter that David Barron would faithfully discharge his \nduty as a judge in a manner consistent with the Constitution. Senator \nGrassley cited yesterday to some statements made by Mr. Barron in his \nacademic writings, but as Professor McConnell noted in his letter:\n\n       It is important to bear in mind that academic legal writing \n     in constitutional law is often exploratory and provocative. \n     No one should assume that an academic would take the same \n     approach toward deciding cases that he does in writing about \n     cases.\n\n  Professor McConnell should know, as he is a prolific academic who was \nsimilarly able to discharge his duty as a judge faithfully and \nconsistently with the Constitution when he served on the bench. As a \nreminder to Republicans who are currently opposing Mr. Barron's \nnomination on these grounds, I will note that the Senate unanimously \nconfirmed Professor McConnell's nomination to the Tenth Circuit by \nvoice vote in 2002 during the George W. Bush administration.\n  Mr. Barron is truly an outstanding nominee. So outstanding, in fact, \nthat Professor McConnell called him ``one of President Obama's two or \nthree best nominations to the appellate courts.'' I would urge all \nSenators to vote to confirm Mr. Barron to the First Circuit.\n\n[[Page S3247]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          Stanford Law School,\n\n                                                      May 7, 2014.\n     Hon.

Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Senator Charles Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Re Letter of support for David Barron.\n\n       Dear Senators Reid, McConnell, Leahy, and Grassley: I do \n     not often interject myself into the politics of judicial \n     confirmations, but in the case of David Barron I make an \n     exception. In my opinion, David Barron is one of President \n     Obama's two or three best nominations to the appellate \n     courts. Based on his scholarship and record of public \n     service, he has the potential to be one of this nation's \n     outstanding jurists.\n       It should be obvious that my assessment does not stem from \n     political agreement. Barron has described himself as an \n     advocate of ``progressive constitutionalism''; I believe the \n     Constitution should be interpreted without a partisan lens, \n     in terms of the principles reflected in its text and history. \n     I suspect that on particular controversial issues, Barron and \n     I disagree more often than not. But I have read much of his \n     academic work, and followed his performance as acting head of \n     the Office of Legal Counsel. In my opinion, his writings and \n     opinions have demonstrated not only intelligence (even where \n     we disagree) but respect for the rule of law. In the Office \n     of Legal Counsel, whose functions closely resemble those of a \n     judge, Barron's publicly released opinions indicated that he \n     was consistently a force for legal regularity and respect for \n     the constitution and laws of the United States. That is an \n     important and precious thing.\n       Some groups have been described Barron as ``an unabashed \n     proponent of judicial activism.'' That characterization, \n     frankly, demonstrates a lack of familiarity with the tone of \n     much academic debate over constitutional issues. Within that \n     framework, Barron stands out as an advocate of lawyerly \n     restraint. It is important to bear in mind that academic \n     legal writing in constitutional law is often exploratory and \n     provocative. No one should assume that an academic would take \n     the same approach toward deciding cases that he does in \n     writing about cases.\n       In ordinary times, Barron's legal ability and professional \n     integrity would suffice to ensure his confirmation. But \n     unfortunately, in recent decades, and especially during \n     President George W. Bush's presidency, the opposition party \n     has taken a more ideological and adversarial posture toward \n     judicial nominations than the framers of our Constitution \n     intended. It is understandable that Republicans today would \n     apply the same adversarial standards to President Obama's \n     nominations as the Democrats applied to exemplary nominees of \n     his predecessor. It is my hope that eventually, this process \n     of mutually assured destruction will pass, for nominees of \n     both parties. That cannot be expected to occur without mutual \n     accommodation and confidence that the same standards apply to \n     nominees from both sides.\n       Nonetheless, David Barron's nomination should be supported \n     by Senators of both parties. Perhaps the most significant \n     constitutional questions of our time arise from the \n     unilateral use of executive power in both the domestic and \n     international arenas. David Barron has written powerfully on \n     this subject, demonstrating a balance between the need for an \n     energetic executive and the centrality of law and the \n     legislative branch. He has supported efforts to adopt laws to \n     enable judicial review of executive actions that might \n     otherwise escape judicial review because of lack of standing, \n     and has written powerfully about the need for constitutional \n     limits on executive excesses.\n       Some may wonder whether Barron's defense of separation of \n     powers against executive unilateralism, which he articulated \n     in the context of the Bush presidency, will survive intact in \n     a presidency he supports. That is a legitimate question. No \n     one knows the answer. But speaking as a fellow legal academic \n     and sometime nominee, I believe that David Barron is a \n     straight shooter and will not trim the sails of his deep-felt \n     constitutional convictions on account of the different \n     direction of political winds. One of this nation's proudest \n     claims is that the limitations of constitutionalism hold firm \n     without regard to which party is in power. I believe David \n     Barron will carry on that tradition.\n       Beyond generalizations about judicial philosophy, this \n     nomination has encountered resistance because of Barron's \n     authorship of opinions in the Office of Legal Counsel \n     justifying drone attacks by American forces on specified \n     individuals abroad. The Administration's public legal defense \n     of these strikes, especially by Attorney General Eric Holder, \n     have been less than convincing as a legal matter. It is \n     important for Congress to consider the legality of these \n     strikes, but I strongly urge that Barron's nomination to the \n     First Circuit not be collateral damage to this debate.\n       The pertinent question for this nomination cannot be \n     whether any Senator agrees or disagrees with the practice of \n     drone strikes. Barron was not Commander in Chief and he did \n     not order the strikes. He has not been nominated to a \n     position with authority over drone strikes, so his view of \n     those strikes is relevant only to the more general question \n     of his suitability to be an appellate judge on a court of \n     broad jurisdiction. His job as acting head of the Office of \n     Legal Counsel was to advise the President based on the \n     traditional legal authorities of text, history, and \n     precedent. He must be evaluated in light of that role.\n       Of course, neither I nor anyone else can evaluate the legal \n     arguments made in Barron's OLC opinions until they are \n     released. But whatever their content, it is difficult to \n     imagine that they would place Barron outside the mainstream \n     of professional legal judgment. The question of drone strikes \n     is novel and much debated, and the authoritative legal \n     sources are scant. It is far from clear that the Due Process \n     Clause even applies to military attacks on targets in places \n     abroad where American law does not run. If it does, it is \n     equally unclear what kind of process is required when split-\n     second decisions are made that could save countless innocent \n     lives. These are discussions that should occur in the proper \n     place, but a judicial nomination is not the forum for their \n     resolution.\n       Ultimately, this confirmation requires a judgment about \n     judicial character. The most important characteristic of a \n     great judge is not brainpower or empathy, but the willingness \n     to apply rules of law dispassionately and unflinchingly to \n     all cases, regardless of the political context. My sense from \n     long conversations with David Barron, and review of his \n     writings and legal opinions, is that he is such a person. I \n     urge members of the Senate to give their advice and consent.\n           Best regards,\n                                             Michael W. McConnell.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

I wish to speak for a few minutes about the urgency of \npassing the tax extender bill and describe to our colleagues all the \nbipartisanship that has gone into this important effort.\n  This bill is truly urgent because America's employers file their \ntaxes quarterly, which means they are paying higher taxes today without \nthis tax extender package, which means less money for hiring and \ntraining workers, less money for buying new equipment, and less money \nfor investing in innovation and growing jobs at home.\n  For example, a restaurant owner who needs to replace a walk-in \nfreezer to keep their business running is going to pay higher taxes \nbecause they can't, in effect, hold down the costs through the \nprovision in the tax bill. That means they will be cutting shifts and \ncutting workers.\n  This bill is just as urgent for millions of other American families; \nfor example, a family with a college student who is registering for \nsummer school this week and is going to lose a tuition tax break and \nhomeowners whose place is now worth less than they paid for it. They \nfinally caught a break recently from their lender, and without this \nlegislation they will now face a real tax increase on phantom income. \nSo that is why this bill is so timely, so urgent.\n  I am going to spend a few minutes talking about the extraordinary \nbipartisan team effort that went into putting this legislation \ntogether, getting it through the Finance Committee, and sending it to \nthe Senate floor. The process began almost immediately after Chairman \nBaucus went to China, when my staff and I began working with Senator \nHatch and his staff, as well as other committee members on both sides \nof the aisle.\n  We recognized that this would not be an easy bill to write, so \nSenator Hatch and I agreed to limit the focus of the legislation to tax \nextenders, the stop-and-go tax policies that we both think should end \nwith comprehensive tax reform. After a lot of sweat equity put in by \nDemocrats and Republicans on the committee, I introduced the EXPIRE \nAct, and that was the beginning of the bipartisan odyssey to make sure \nthis bill was passed--and passed quickly--so as to deal with those \nurgent needs I described.\n  Before the committee met for markup, Senators offered 93 amendments, \nincluding 36 from Republicans. My team and I worked with both sides of \nthe committee to incorporate 13 amendments into a modified bill. Eleven \nof them had Republican sponsors or cosponsors.\n\n[[Page S3248]]\n\n  Then when the committee got together for markup, there were \nadditional amendments--seven more approved, including three from \nRepublicans.\n  This bill is thoroughly bipartisan. The committee held to the \nagreement Senator Hatch and I struck to keep the focus on tax extender \npolicies, and I want to make one thing very clear. Those bipartisan \namendments--the ones we have already included--have made the \nlegislation better. If you want the best proof, look at the amendment \noffered by our colleagues Senator Roberts and Senator Schumer, a \nDemocrat and a Republican. It did important work to strengthen the tax \ncredit for research and development. By the way, this bipartisan \namendment built on another bipartisan idea, a first-rate idea from \nSenator Coons and Senator Enzi to improve the credit; in particular, to \nmake it more attractive for the small businesses, those businesses \nacross the country starting in a garage. It would allow innovative \nstartups to use the R credit to help pay their employees' wages.\n  This is smart policy--not Democratic policy or Republican policy--\nbecause it encourages American innovation, the engine of economic \nprogress, and makes that engine stronger than it is today. It is going \nto make it easier for young companies to hire new workers, and it is \nexactly the kind of bipartisanship that the country is making it clear \nit is hungry for.\n  There are other bipartisan examples I could cite that all prove the \nsame point, but I wish to wrap up by saying now the Senate has the \nchance, using exactly that procedure, to make the bill even stronger. \nIt was made clear last week by the majority leader, by myself, and \nothers that we are open to amendments that build on what went on in the \ncommittee. By the way, there are lots of them.\n  I was here on Friday until late week and through the weekend talking \nto colleagues, an equal number of Democrats and Republicans. It would \nbe one thing if there weren't a lot of germane issues, relevant issues, \nto choose from. That is not the case. There are dozens of amendments \nfrom Senators on both sides of the aisle that directly relate to the \ntopic in question--these stop-and-go provisions that have expired--and \nif we don't move to renew them, our economy is going to get hurt in \nways I have described.\n  Our goal all along on the Senate floor has been to replicate exactly \nthe kind of bipartisanship that went on in the Finance Committee. I \nabsolutely believe that is still possible. That is why I described it.\n  As soon as the vote was cast last week, I spent the weekend looking \nfor a bipartisan pathway. We had encouraging calls over the weekend \nindicating that both sides of the aisle wanted to work together to make \nprogress. We had additional conversations about this through the week. \nSome Senators were concerned they wouldn't have a chance to offer any \namendments whether they focused on tax extenders or not. But as I said \nthen, and I repeat now, I am open to hearing from colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle about their amendments. I can keep repeating it \nagain and again, but I hope the point is getting through.\n  If I had brought a billboard to the floor, as sometimes people do, \nthe billboard would say: ``BRING ON THE AMENDMENTS'' in big capital \nletters.\n  I will wrap up by saying I know the bill is not the legislation that \nevery Senator wants, and--if I had my first choice--we would be working \non comprehensive tax reform rather than the extenders, but it hasn't \nbeen possible to do that. Today the Senate needs to focus on the urgent \nbusiness at hand; that is, making sure our people don't get punished.\n  If the Senate doesn't act on this bill, we would be punishing \nveterans coming home looking for jobs, we would punish innovators, we \nwould be punishing small businesses, punishing those homeowners who are \nunderwater on their mortgages, and punishing students with the \nmountains of debt.\n  I close by saying any colleague who is for that let me know because I \ndon't know of a single Senator, not one, who thinks that is a good \nidea--when our economy is so fragile--to weigh it down with a tax hike. \nThere aren't any Senators who are telling me they want to subject \nAmerican families and business to yet more uncertainty about their tax \nbill.\n  So our legislation, our bipartisan legislation, would keep that from \nhappening. It is absolutely essential that the Senate come together in \na bipartisan way, build on exactly what we did in the Senate Finance \nCommittee, and get this legislation across the goal line.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. First, let me compliment our new chairman of the Finance \nCommittee. He is doing a great job on this bill. He is keeping the \ntenor bipartisan as he has done throughout his whole career. He has \nonly been there a short while, but he is taking to the chairmanship \nlike a fish to water.\n  I wish to follow up. There is so much that is bipartisan in this \nbill. It was a bipartisan bill that passed out of committee \nunanimously. I worked on an amendment with Senator Roberts that Senator \nCoons had originated for the R credit with Senators Cardin, Isakson, \nand Blunt to improve the section 181 live production incentive so we \nkeep the film industry here, not London or Canada; Senators Portman and \nCardin worked on energy efficiency; Senators Brown and Portman on \ndisadvantaged workers; and Cantwell and Roberts on low-income housing \ntax credit. The list goes on and on. As a result, this bill has broad \nsupport: the Business Roundtable, Grover Norquist, as well as the NEA \nand Feeding America.\n  So where are we. And I would like to further elaborate on what the \nchairman has said. We are willing to vote on amendments.\n  I always think of my dear friend from Tennessee, Lamar Alexander, who \nremembers how the place used to work and constantly reminds us--and \nthat is a very good and salutary thing in this body. He would say on \nmost bills there would be bipartisan support in the committee. The \nranking member and the chair would get together with a list of \namendments, each for his or her side, and they would come up with the \nlist.\n  We are willing to do that. In fact, Leader Reid has been extremely \ngenerous. He said we are not going to decide it should be this one and \nnot that one, as long as the amendments are germane to this extenders \nbill. Of course we can't open the whole Tax Code for debate or debate \nthe merits of the ACA on this bill. This is not the type of bill to do \nthat.\n  It is a bipartisan bill, as Chairman Wyden outlined, that is very \nnecessary. So we would plead, almost, with our colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle, for the sake of the country, come up with some \namendments, a list. If it is 100, obviously Senators Wyden and Hatch \nwill have to whittle it down. If it is five or six from your side and \nfive or six from our side and they are germane to extenders, we will \nhave to vote them up or down.\n  But the cry from the other side--which I have sympathy with, even \nthough I don't agree that they tell the whole story--is let us do \namendments. We are answering that plea. Leader Reid has made it clear, \nChairman Wyden has made it clear we are not going to pick and say we \nwill do this one and not that one.\n  The only two limits that I can tell are time--we can't do 100 or 200 \nof these, but as the Senator from Tennessee constantly reminds us, that \nis not going to happen--nor can we go far afield way beyond the bounds \nof this bill. Germaneness makes sense in such a bipartisan and \nimportant bill, but other than that, let's let it rip.\n  I know my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are discussing \nthis. I know they are very serious about it. I have talked to \ncolleagues on the floor, in the gym, and in the corridors of these \nbodies about getting this done.\n  It is so important for the country. Even beyond that, if we can't \nwork in a bipartisan way on this bill, which was put together by \nSenators Wyden and Hatch in such a bipartisan way, which has so much \ninput from both sides of the aisle and where the offer is let's do \namendments, not picking and choosing--we will pick this one, not that \none--simply limited to what the bill is all about, germaneness, then we \nwill not get anything done.\n  I want my colleagues on both sides of the aisle--on my side of the \naisle, so many Members--and I sympathize with them--who desire to \nlegislate and do\n\n[[Page S3249]]\n\namendments, we have made that offer. Harry, the leader, the chairman, \nand I am fully part of this, have made the offer to let's do \namendments.\n  We hope the folks on the other side--it is sort of a little bit of a \ntest. I am not throwing down any kind of gauntlet, but if we can't come \nup with a way to legislate on this bill, a bipartisan bill that has the \nsupport of the left, right, and center, that everyone agrees with, as \nSenator Wyden outlined how much America needs them, what are we going \nto be able to be legislate?\n  We have a little time. We have 1 week where we can discuss this while \nwe are in our districts working away. Let's get this done. I plead with \nmy colleagues--``plead'' is the right word, the right verb--come up \nwith a list. We will come up with our list, and then let's roll up our \nsleeves, get to work on the floor, and pass this bill.\n  I believe if we do, the other body will. The other body--one other \npoint--has different ideas. They want to make a few of these permanent. \nThat is a legitimate amendment in the bounds that Leader Reid has \ntalked about. Let's vote on it. Let's debate it and vote on it. That is \nwhat we are supposed to do. If the other body's wisdom prevails, it \nwill make it easier to pass the bill. Even if the other body's wisdom \ndoesn't prevail, they will see that our body has a chance to debate it \nand decide on it.\n  Again, we are willing not to pick amendments--I know there is a \ncomplaint on the other side of the aisle that our leadership picks \nwhich amendments. We are not doing that. All we are saying is they \nought to be germane to tax extenders, focused on the issue at hand, \nwhich is the extenders. This is not a bill that came out of a figment \nof the imagination of four Democratic Senators with no Republican \ninput.\n  If we can't legislate on this bill, then what bill can we? I would \nask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, ask them to get us \nthe list they come up with of amendments they wish to vote on.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN.

Mr. President, I wanted to spend a moment or two talking \nabout the Water Resources Reform and Development Act conference report, \nand I want to say to my colleagues, both in this Chamber and in the \nHouse, some improvement in the WRRDA reauthorization has happened, but \nit is not nearly enough.\n  From 1986 to 2010, the average new authorizations were over $3 \nbillion a year, and the average amount of money was $1.8 billion a \nyear. So we have been going backwards all that time. In this report, \nthey did deauthorize less than 10 percent of the $80 billion in \nbacklogged projects. Their attempt to take some of the political nature \nout of it is a good attempt, but it is not nearly complete and will be \ngamed, just as we have seen in the past.\n  What really hasn't happened in the WRRDA bill, and partly because \nthey do not have the authority to do it, is to change the Corps of \nEngineers. There has never been a project the Corps of Engineers \ndoesn't want to build, and there has never been a study they do not \nwant to do, because what that means is their budget continues and their \njobs continue. So we do not have that distinct independent voice we can \nrely upon because bureaucratic malaise and self-interest trumps it \nevery time.\n  There is another critical problem with this report. The inland \nwaterways trust fund is out of money. We steal it every year. Like \nSocial Security, the money has been stolen and spent. Yet they change \nthe requirement for inland waterway repairs. It used to be if it was \nunder $8 million, we would pay for it out of the general fund--not the \ntrust fund--but now they have moved that to $20 million. In essence, \nwhat that says is we are going to do things that are the responsibility \nof the trust fund but we are going to charge the American taxpayer \nrather than the users of the inland waterway to do these repairs. We \nhave a lot of those in need of repair on the McClellan-Kerr waterway in \nOklahoma.\n  So there is a little sleight of hand, another smoke and mirrors set \nfrom the Congress of the United States to the American people about not \nbeing truthful about what they are doing. We need a priority of \nprojects. We need discipline within the Corps of Engineers. There is \nnone. There is no discipline. It is turf protection and bureaucratic \nexcess continued as normal.\n  What we should have done is to deauthorize about $40 billion worth of \nthe projects that are presently in line and really put a priority on \nwhat is most important for the Nation, not what is most important for a \ncertain Congressman or a certain Senator to look good at home. \nUnfortunately, we didn't have the courage to do that. We didn't have \nthe strength of character to do that. We wouldn't stand and defend \nthat. So what we did is make minimal progress--and there is some \nprogress; I will admit it--but it is certainly not enough to get my \nvote. When we fix symptoms of disease rather than fixing the real \ndisease, all we do is delay the onset of the cure, and that is exactly \nwhat we have done with the water resources conference report.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on the last Monday of every May our \ncountry pauses to commemorate Memorial Day and honor the men and women \nwho died in wars around the world in defense of freedom, liberty, \npeace, and the United States of America.\n  This coming Monday is no exception. I urge my fellow Members of the \nSenate, all Georgians, and all Americans, to take a moment sometime \nover this weekend to pause and give thanks for the sacrifices made so \nwe can do what we are doing here today, and so Georgians and Americans \ncan do what they do on the lakes, beaches, and mountains of our country \nas they celebrate Memorial Day.\n  I was honored and pleased to travel to eight of the American \ncemeteries in Europe--in Italy, Luxembourg, Great Britain, and France, \nparticularly Normandy, on the 70th anniversary of D-day, which is \ncoming up--and pay tribute to the thousands of graves of Americans who \nwent overseas in World War I or World War II and gave their life--\nsacrificed and died--so we can live in freedom and peace today.\n  Our Armed Forces are a great gift to us. They never ask for anything \nin return. They always give their service to our country. They swear \ntheir allegiance to protect and defend our domestic tranquility, and \nevery single time they do the job.\n  Today we know they are deployed in Afghanistan, we know they are \ndeployed in Africa, we know they are at sea--both on top of the sea and \nunder the sea--and in the air, always looking to see that America is \nsafe and free from harm.\n  I encourage all of my fellow citizens to say a special prayer of \nthanks this weekend for the men and women who sacrificed and died on \nbehalf of our country, and on behalf of freedom, liberty, and peace for \nall mankind.\n  There is no secret that there is a scandal at the Veterans' \nAdministration. We don't know how pervasive and we don't know how deep. \nBut it surrounds the appointments and the cooking of the books in terms \nof appointments and services to our veterans and the VA health care \nsystem.\n  I know they have a hard job, but their first job and their main \nresponsibility is to see to it our veterans get the health care they \ndeserve, the health care we promised them, and the health care we are \ngoing to see to it they get.\n  I want the President to exhibit leadership and make sure we have a \nrudder\n\n[[Page S3250]]\n\nin the water so we sail the ship of state in the right direction in \nterms of the VA, and let the chips fall where they may--including if \nthe Department of Justice should be involved in case there is any \ncriminal intent or criminal activity. To cook the books or lie to the \nFederal Government would, in my opinion, be a crime and people should \nbe held accountable. But to call for the head of just one person \nwithout going through the entire VA is wrong.\n  Last August I held a hearing in Atlanta because we had three untimely \ndeaths in the Atlanta VA--two by suicide, one by drug overdose. All \nthree were determined to be the fault of the VA in terms of the mental \nhealth ward in particular and the lack or failure to follow up on \nappointments. That was the beginning of my awareness of what was \nhappening in Georgia.\n  To Georgia's and Secretary Shinseki's credit, we replaced the \nDirector in Georgia with Ms. Wiggins. Ms. Wiggins now meets with me on \nan every-other-month basis to go over the activities in the VA--and \nwhen we had an incident 6 weeks ago, she was the first to call me \nbefore the news media, saying a mistake had been made and punishment \nhad been issued, and she was going to see to it that VA had a 100-\npercent record of service to the veterans. We need that attitude and \napproach in every single VA hospital, VA clinic, and VA medical \nfacility in the country.\n  I hope the President will exhibit the leadership necessary to call on \nevery element of government--from the inspector general, to the Justice \nDepartment, to the VA itself--to get to the bottom of what has gone \nwrong, because it is intolerable, it is unacceptable, and it is wrong, \nhere on the doorstep of a holiday where we celebrate those who \nsacrificed their life for our freedom, if there are veterans losing \ntheir life because of our inability to serve them in the VA hospitals.\n  I hope the President will exhibit that leadership. I hope we get to \nthe bottom of it. As one member of the veterans committee, I pledge my \ncommitment to get to the bottom of it.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the Internet \nTax Freedom Forever Act, legislation I introduced on a bipartisan basis \nwith my colleague Senator Ron Wyden to make the expiring Internet tax \nmoratorium permanent. Because of the moratorium Americans have not been \ntaxed on Internet access for 16 years, but this is going to change and \nnew taxes will be levied starting in November if Congress doesn't act \nsoon.\n  I am proud to work with Senator Wyden on this bill, the lead Senate \nsponsor of the original Internet Tax Freedom Act that passed in 1998. \nThis landmark law known as ITFA imposed a Federal moratorium that \nstopped State and local governments from placing taxes on Internet \naccess. This moratorium has been extended three times, and it has been \ncritical to the rapid growth of the Internet.\n  As we all know, the Internet provides unprecedented economic and \nsocial benefits. Mom and pop businesses in places such as South Dakota, \nOregon, and across America found access to consumers and new business \nopportunities that are only possible through the Internet. Job seekers \nand entrepreneurs are finding opportunities that were once difficult to \ndiscover. Educators are exploring innovative tools and techniques that \nare powered by the Internet to equip students with the skills they will \nneed for the 21st Century, and health care professionals are remotely \nproviding services that are saving lives in rural areas. The idea \nbehind the moratorium is straightforward. By not taxing Internet access \nwe encourage broadband adoption and investment, which spurs all of the \nexciting activities that I just mentioned.\n  The Internet is a gateway to tremendous societal benefits. It is, \nfrankly, astounding when you consider that it wasn't very long ago that \nthe Internet was considered a novelty and only for the tech savvy. \nToday it is a must-have resource, the existence of which we almost take \nfor granted. We cannot take for granted, however, that the moratorium \non Internet access taxes has contributed to the Internet being accessed \nby hundreds of millions of Americans every single day. Thanks to the \n16-year ban, consumer access to the Internet is free from State and \nlocal taxation for nearly all Americans. This gives consumers a welcome \nbreak on their monthly bills.\n  In the commerce committee we talk a lot about finding ways to \nencourage greater broadband deployment across all of America, and as \ncochair of the Congressional Internet Caucus, I worked with colleagues \non both sides of the aisle to find ways to promote the Internet as an \nengine of economic growth and economic freedom. One of the ways that we \ncan do that is by making broadband more affordable.\n  State taxation of Internet service will make broadband more \nexpensive, which is at cross-purposes with our goal of encouraging \nInternet access and deployment. This doesn't make a lot of sense. The \nmoratorium also benefits consumers by prohibiting multiple and \ndiscriminatory taxes on goods and services sold over the Internet. This \nmeans consumers won't be taxed by multiple States on the same sale and \nStates won't tax Internet sales more than mail order or telephone \nsales.\n  Unfortunately, the Internet tax moratorium is set to expire on \nNovember 1. Because of this, many Internet service providers are \nplanning to send out notices to their customers informing them that \nthey may have to start paying taxes on Internet access if Congress \nfails to act. I expect that many millions of Americans who use the \nInternet will not be happy when they realize that their phone or \nInternet bill is going to suddenly increase. Two things are for sure: \nExpiration of ITFA will not encourage more Americans to get online to \ndo commerce, civic engagement, or social media; and countless Americans \nwill be calling Congress demanding that we keep taxes off of Internet \naccess.\n  Rather than wait for angry constituents, let us be proactive and pass \nthe Internet Tax Freedom Forever Act without delay. My bill with \nFinance Committee Chairman Wyden provides for a permanent extension of \nthe moratorium. By passing a permanent extension we will provide \ncertainty to Internet consumers in every State. Making the moratorium \npermanent also means that Congress won't have to waste time and energy \npassing yet another extension, year after year, into the future. There \nare plenty of other areas for Congress to focus on.\n  Our bill also eliminates the grandfather clause that currently allows \n6 States to tax Internet access. Eliminating the moratorium's \ngrandfather provision will provide consumers and businesses with a tax \nbreak. This includes consumers and businesses in my State of South \nDakota, where our legislation will make Internet access less expensive, \nthus helping to encourage broadband deployment.\n  The Internet Tax Freedom Forever Act currently has 46 cosponsors, \nnearly half of the Senate. The bipartisan cosponsors of the legislation \nunderstand the tremendous benefits provided by ensuring Internet access \nis not taxed and the discriminatory taxes are not applied to the \nInternet. I strongly encourage my colleagues in the Senate to join \nSenator Wyden and me and the 46 other cosponsors in this fight. When \nthe Senate reconvenes after the Memorial Day recess, we should move \nquickly to extend the tax moratorium and to ensure that Americans don't \nwake up on November 2 with new, unexpected taxes.\n  In the coming weeks and months, I plan to continue raising the need \nto pass our bipartisan legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, later today we are going to have the \nopportunity to pass a very important bill,\n\n[[Page S3251]]\n\nthe Water Resources Reform and Development Act, the WRRDA bill. The \nPresiding Officer knows firsthand the importance of this legislation to \nour ports of New Jersey and Maryland. This is a very important bill, \nand it is going to get passed. It is going to get signed by the \nPresident. It is a bipartisan bill.\n  I congratulate Senator Boxer and Senator Vitter, our chair and \nranking member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, for \ndeveloping a process where Democrats and Republicans, all members of \nthe Senate, could work to develop the very best water resources bill \nfor our country. This follows in the best traditions of the last \nCongress, when we were able to pass MAP-21, the surface transportation \nreauthorization that provided for the building of our roads, our \nbridges, our transit systems, and the FAA, which dealt with our air \nhighways, dealing with the most modern air system that we could \nhave. We are now moving forward with the Water Resources Reform and \nDevelopment Act that deals with our Nation's locks, levees, dams, \nports, channels, and harbors. There is something in common with both \nthis bill and the two other bills I talked about, the highway and \nTransportation bill, and the aviation bill. They all involve economic \nprogress and growth, planning for our future, creating the types of job \nopportunities we need, and having a modern infrastructure in order to \ncarry that out.\n\n  This bill is vitally important for my State of Maryland. The Port of \nBaltimore is an economic engine for the State of Maryland. We have the \nninth busiest port in the Nation in Baltimore. The port is No. 1 in the \ncountry as far as the roll-on/roll-off automobile and truck import-\nexport service. We are also ranked No. 1 on ores, sugar, and gypsum--\nthe bulk products. Our port is critically important to this country, \ncritically important to our national economy, and vitally important to \nthe Maryland economy.\n  Last summer the Port of Baltimore entered into a new contract with \nseveral car manufacturers--including Mazda--in order to increase its \ntraffic within the Port of Baltimore.\n  My point is that there are tens of thousands of jobs in my community \ndirectly and indirectly related to the activities of the port.\n  Why is this legislation so important? I will give many reasons, but \nthe primary reason is that we need to make sure we have acceptable \nsites to deal with the dredge material in order to maintain our \nharbor's depth so that the big cargo ships can come into our port. That \nhas been a continuous struggle for many years.\n  Several years ago in Maryland we developed the Poplar Island \nsolution. Poplar Island is a barrier island that was disappearing in \nthe Chesapeake. At one time it was habitable, but it is no longer \nhabitable. It was just about gone. Before Poplar Island, the popular \nthought was to just pick a site and dump the material and not worry \nabout it. But Poplar Island is not only a site where we can put the \ndredge material, it is an environmental restoration. It provides a \nhaven or wildlife, birds, and habitat. It offers the original purpose \nfor a barrier island, and that is to protect against the extreme \neffects of storms. So this is a win-win situation. It gives us a dredge \nsite for the materials so we can keep the harbor at the proper depth, \nit gives us an environmental plus so we can deal with wildlife in the \nChesapeake, and it protects against the extreme weather conditions that \noccur too often.\n  It was absolutely essential to change the authorization in order to \nbe able to continue to use Poplar Island as a site for dredge material. \nIn this legislation, we get that done. We accelerated the Army Corps' \nreports, we got it back in time, and now that location will be \navailable for many years to come in order to accept the dredge \nmaterials so we can keep the harbor dredged at the appropriate level.\n  There is also authorization in this bill to make sure our harbor is \nmaintained at its current depth. We have gone even further than that. \nWe have planned far into the future by now authorizing Mid Bay, the \nnext Poplar Island for the Chesapeake. It is a barrier island that is \ndisappearing, and it will be restored and used for economic purposes \nand dredge material, and it will also be converted into a positive for \nthe environment and protect us against storms.\n  That is what this bill means to my State, and that is just one \nexample. We could mention examples all over the country.\n  With regard to the Chesapeake Bay, I have taken to the floor many \ntimes to talk about it. Mr. President, $1 trillion of our economy comes \nfrom the bay. Watermen, fisheries, tourists, commerce, and real estate \nvalues are all affected by the quality of the Chesapeake Bay.\n  We made commonsense reforms to the environmental restoration program \nin the bill we will be voting on this afternoon. There is a lot in \nhere.\n  I thank Senator Warner, my colleague from Virginia. The oyster \nrestoration program is also in this bill, which is vital in order to \nrestore the oyster crops in the Chesapeake Bay. We are making progress \non oysters in the bay, and we need to continue that effort. The bill we \nwill have a chance to vote on this afternoon will allow us to continue \nto make progress on oyster restoration in the Chesapeake Bay.\n  There is a continuing authorities program--reforms to those programs. \nI mention that because some people may not pick this up, the legal \nsignificance of the changes we are making on the continuing \nauthorization programs. Those programs will help our smaller \ncommunities.\n  In Maryland and New Jersey there are a lot of smaller communities \nthat very much depend upon projects which may not be as big as Poplar \nIsland or Mid Bay, but they are very important for the local community.\n  For example, in Cumberland we have a dam that needs to be removed. As \na result of the enactment of the legislation we are going to be taking \nup this afternoon, it is going to be easier to get that type of project \naccomplished.\n  We have barrier island restorations off Crisfield on the lower \nEastern Shore which will be assisted by the changes we make in this \nlegislation. We deauthorize certain portions of two channels of the \nlower shore. That is important because the community needs and wants to \nhave boat slips in that area. By deauthorizing, they can do that, and \nthat will improve the community.\n  Those are the commonsense changes we have made as a result of the \nlegislation we will be voting on this afternoon.\n  I want to mention one other provision that is in this bill, and I \nreally want to thank the conferees. I was proud to be a part of the \nconference committee. Senator Boxer and Senator Vitter conferred with \nus frequently, and we came out with a good, bipartisan, bicameral bill. \nThis is a responsible bill that will help the economy.\n  We also put in the report reauthorization of the State revolving \nfund. We have not reauthorized the State revolving fund since 1993. \nThis is a program that is critical to our State and local governments \nin dealing with how we treat our waste. The wastewater treatment \nfacility plants get their funding from the State revolving fund. It is \nimportant to get it authorized, and that is in the bill we will be \ntaking up this afternoon.\n  I introduced the reauthorization bill in 2009. In that bill I would \nhave liked to have seen the program more robust than it is today. This \nis a reauthorization that allows us to at least make some significant \nimprovements in the State revolving fund.\n  We deal with green infrastructure and make it easier for green \ninfrastructure in our wastewater treatment plants. We address water \nrecapture and reuse. Water is a valuable commodity. We take steps in \nthis bill to do that.\n  As to energy efficiency, we waste a lot of energy in our water \ninfrastructure. This bill makes us more energy efficient, which helps \nour country and helps our environment. It helps economically \ndisadvantaged communities have a better shot at dealing with wastewater \nissues.\n  There is a lot in here that will help everything from the smallest to \nthe largest community and our economy. This is a good day for our \nNation because we are going to pass the bill. The bill passed with over \n400 votes in the House of Representatives. We are going to pass this \nbill and the President is going to sign it. This is a good day. Our \nwater infrastructure will have a brighter future. The modernization of \nour\n\n[[Page S3252]]\n\nwater infrastructure gives us a brighter future for our economy.\n  I was proud to be on the conference committee that developed the bill \nand proud to join the Presiding Officer from New Jersey in moving this \nbill forward, and I look forward to the vote this afternoon.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nWater Resources Reform and Development Act. We are going to be \nconsidering the final conference report on that legislation and voting \non it in a few hours. This WRRDA bill is a strong, bipartisan bill. It \nis a jobs bill. It is very much needed in our weak economy. That is why \nwe need to move forward and finally pass this into law. It is also a \npretty good example of how this place should work, how we can work in a \nbipartisan, constructive way, how we can move forward as an institution \nand find common ground on these sorts of important matters.\n  Earlier this week the House passed the WRRDA bill 412 to 4. That is \npretty much unheard of. I am not sure resolutions expressing admiration \nfor Mother Teresa passed by that vote in the House, so that is a strong \ntestament to the broad, bipartisan, pro-jobs nature of the bill. Again, \nit is because WRRDA has a sharp focus on what our country desperately \nneeds right now: job creation, as well as improved storm and flood \nprotection, and enhanced national commerce, particularly in our \nmaritime sector.\n  This bill invests in our Nation's waterborne assets and landside \ninfrastructure to grow jobs and to keep us competitive in global \nmarkets. Ensuring our ports and waterways are operated and maintained, \nthereby improving the flow of commerce in that way, will create jobs. \nBeing prepared for the Panama Canal expansion will increase imports and \nexports, and that will create jobs. Providing flood and storm damage \nprotection for communities large and small and businesses all along our \nNation's coasts and waterways is necessary, it is important, and will \nalso create jobs. So let me underscore: The WRRDA bill will not only \ngrow our economy, it will directly put Americans back to work.\n  Let me mention some of the specifics of the bill. Before I talk about \nwhat the bill does, let me start with what it doesn't do. It absolutely \ndoes not increase the deficit. It absolutely does not contain any \nearmarks as defined under our rules or the House rules. In fact, the \nWall Street Journal recently editorialized in strong support of the \nbill as a fiscally responsible way to address infrastructure needs. In \nfact, the bill even has a deauthorization provision--a mechanism to \nprovide authorization offsets for the important and necessary positive \nauthorizations the bill contains.\n  Now what does the bill do? Well, Corps of Engineers reform and \naccountability, No. 1. That is very important. It includes commonsense \nsolutions to streamline project delivery and environmental \ndecisionmaking.\n  The bill went to great lengths in making the Corps transparent and \naccountable to Congress and their non-Federal partners. For instance, \nthis WRRDA requires the Corps to open their financial ledgers to show \nhow taxpayer dollars are being spent and mandates timeframes and costs \nfor feasibility studies which have taken several years and millions of \ndollars to complete. So it narrows those issues and constrains them.\n  To strengthen the project delivery timeline, the bill includes \nlanguage to speed up the environmental review process to ensure there \nare not unreasonable delays in getting projects built.\n  The bill will also implement, for the first time ever, monetary \npenalties on the Corps for missed deadlines and reports. Failure to \nprovide a specific report means funds from the general expenses account \nof the Civil Works Program are subtracted from that part of the Corps, \nand they go to the division of the Corps with responsibility for \ngetting the work done. So there is appropriate penalty and incentive to \nmake sure the work is done.\n  WRRDA also authorizes 34 Corps projects for navigation, flood \nprotection, and ecosystem restoration. But, as I said, it also includes \na real deauthorization process to decrease the nearly $60 billion \nconstruction backlog and offset these new authorizations with equal or \ngreater deauthorizations. I thank Senator Barrasso for this key \nprovision. He authored it. It was refined and expanded by our \ncolleagues in the House. I think it is a very important initiative.\n  We also include a provision that began as a stand-alone bill by \nmyself and Senator Nelson last year. It puts significant project \nmanagement control in the hands of State, local, and private entities \nto try that on a pilot basis and to see if it leads to reduced delays \nand reduced costs. That is what we do with most highway projects. The \nFederal Highway Administration is not the project manager of those \nprojects. It doesn't take the lead. That is what we should do with \nwater projects as well and not demand that an already overburdened \nCorps of Engineers has to be the lead project manager on all of those \nprojects.\n  The second important category in this bill is the harbor maintenance \ntrust fund. In order to advance our Nation's waterborne commerce and \nhelp drive our Nation's economy, this bill makes sweeping reforms to \nthat trust fund. It is no secret that the harbor maintenance trust fund \nis grossly mismanaged and that in a good year half of the revenue going \ninto that so-called trust fund is stolen--taken out--for completely \nunrelated purposes, even though that revenue is supposed to be \ndedicated for the purposes of the trust fund. We have to stop that. So \nWRRDA changes that status quo and requires a ramp-up in annual funding, \nincremental increases over 10 years to get to a full spend-out of trust \nfund revenue in 2025. Additional yearly harbor maintenance trust fund \nmonies will be prioritized with ports which move 99 percent of our \nNation's commerce--those high- and medium-use ports getting the highest \nprioritization. But there is also a limited but important low-use and \nunderserved port set-aside to ensure adequate maintenance there and \neconomic growth.\n\n  WRRDA also adds additional metrics to the harbor maintenance trust \nfund, in addition to commercial tonnage. We now include oil and gas \nactivity, commercial fishing, and transportation of persons--important \nmetrics that were ignored previously in an unfair way.\n  Without the full utilization of the harbor maintenance trust fund, \nnegative impacts will be felt by manufacturers, producers, shippers, \nand carriers throughout America. They ultimately contribute to this \ntrust fund to get dredging and other work done. We need to live up to \nour end of the deal and make sure that money is used for its intended \npurpose. That has never been more important than now with the expansion \nof the Panama Canal. We need to do the dredging. We need to be prepared \nfor that economic opportunity.\n  A third important category in the bill is the inland waterways trust \nfund--another trust fund also with significant but different problems. \nWRRDA looks beyond our harbors to address serious concerns related to \nthe delivery of projects on that inland waterway system and helps \naccelerate the construction of aging locks and dams, many of which have \nfar exceeded their project design life. According to the American \nSociety of Civil Engineers, the average age of our locks is over 60 \nyears old and that continues to cause unwanted delays in the shipment \nof goods. By the year 2020, more than 80 percent of these locks will be \nfunctionally obsolete. This is extremely concerning, considering that \nmore than 70 percent of our imports and exports travel this inland \nwaterway system.\n  Again, the American Society of Civil Engineers estimates that \nunderinvestment in this inland waterway system cost our businesses $33 \nbillion in 2010, and that could rise to $49 billion in 2020 unless we \nact. This WRRDA bill takes action in the inland waterway trust fund, \nclears out some of the backlog\n\n[[Page S3253]]\n\nand clears out some of the things preventing important projects under \nthat trust fund from getting done.\n  Another very important category which I certainly deeply care about, \nconsidering the State I represent, is flood protection and levee \nsafety. Not only does WRRDA authorize critical flood protection \nprojects, but it also strengthens levee safety initiatives to provide \ncritical funds to State and local agencies to make sure levees and \nflood protection systems stay up to par. There are over 15,000 miles of \nFederal levees and almost 100,000 miles of non-Federal levees \nprotecting communities all around the country. However, many are graded \nas in unsatisfactory condition. These levees protect nearly 43 percent \nof the Nation's population, so we need to make sure they are strong and \nadequate. This levee safety initiative will provide national and local \nleadership the resources they need to promote sound technical practices \nand to keep up with aging levee and protection systems.\n  Most important for this program is levee rehabilitation funding. It \nis imperative that our non-Federal sponsors have the ability, both \ntechnical and financial, to repair and rehabilitate levees. Storm surge \nand floodwaters are damaging to our economy. We must address this. In \nthe experience of Hurricane Katrina, for instance, about 80 percent of \nthe catastrophic flooding of the city of New Orleans was due directly \nto breaches in the levee system due to inadequate design or \nmaintenance--flawed design at the beginning and inadequate maintenance \ncontinuing. Literally 80 percent of that catastrophic flooding was \ncompletely avoidable, completely manmade--that part of the disaster. We \nneed to make sure that never happens again.\n  Certainly, in all of these categories I am talking about, there are \nmajor benefits to Louisiana. I thank all of my Louisiana partners who \nhave done so much to give me the information and the expertise we \nneeded to address these important areas, including Morganza to the \ngulf, which is very important to Lafourche and Terrebonne Parishes, as \nwell as our ecosystem restoration projects under the Louisiana Coastal \nArea Program, and many other important Louisiana priorities. Again, we \ncould only address those properly with the full help and partnership of \nthose Louisiana partners.\n  In closing, I wish to thank many folks, and I will start with those \nLouisiana partners. As I said, they were instrumental in helping us get \nthe Louisiana piece right, and I thank them, and that work will \ncontinue and that partnership will continue.\n  I thank Chairman Barbara Boxer, a Washington, DC, partner on this \nbill. As she has said many times, the two of us don't agree on a whole \nlot of things, but we do agree on infrastructure needs and we do agree \non this WRRDA bill, and we came together, as a result, very \nconstructively, very productively on this infrastructure work, as we \nare doing right now on the next highway bill. Certainly that has been \nan important tradition at the EPW Committee, which we are continuing. \nThe crucial element there is the will and determination to do it, and \nshe always provided that will and determination, as did I. I thank her \nfor being such a great partner.\n\n  We also had great House partners: Chairman Shuster and Ranking Member \nRahall. They exhibited real leadership in getting a House bill done to \nbegin with and then working with us on a productive conference \ncommittee. I thank them and their staffs for all of their work.\n  Speaking of staffs, I am deeply indebted to all of the staff work \nthat went into this bill. It was very significant. The chair and I \npersonally dealt with probably a couple dozen issues and semicrises \nthat would crop up over time. Our staffs, in contrast, did that \nmultiple times over--hundreds and hundreds of problems and issues \nbefore they developed to the Member level, literally hundreds and \nhundreds.\n  I thank both staffs, but I am particularly indebted to my staff for \nall of their hard work, particularly Charles Brittingham, Zak Baig, \nChris Tomassi, Sarah Veatch, Rebecca Louviere, Jill Landry, Luke Bolar, \nand Cheyenne Steel. They put enormous hours into this bill and I truly \nappreciate their work.\n  I certainly want to also recognize and thank Chairman Boxer's staff, \nparticularly Bettina Poirier, Jason Albritton, Ted Illston, Mary Kerr, \nand Kate Gilman.\n  In closing, I strongly commend this WRRDA bill to the Senate. It is a \nstrong bipartisan jobs and infrastructure bill. It is what we need to \ndo more of, and it is the model we need to adopt more in the Senate: \nworking together on important projects across party lines. One key \nreason we were able to do it successfully is we had a strong bipartisan \nprocess and an open process that invited participation from all sides, \nincluding significant floor amendments to the Senate bill. That was \nabsolutely crucial to moving the bill in a productive way through the \nprocess.\n  We will try to implement the same approach with the highway bill. We \nreported a strong bipartisan highway bill out of our committee \nunanimously last week, but we need to bring it to the Senate floor. We \nneed to act well in advance of the highway trust fund running out of \nmoney around August. I hope we expand on this work. I hope we use this \nmodel, including an open-floor process, in many other areas on many \nother bills.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this WRRDA bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak in support \nof the Water Resources Reform and Development Act, also known as the \nWRRDA bill.\n  I thank Senator Vitter for his work on this bill. Of course, I also \nthank Chairman Boxer for her leadership in shepherding this bill \nthrough, when I think many people thought it would be a very difficult \nyear to get a major infrastructure bill done. She was able to do it, \nwork with Senator Vitter, work with the House most significantly, and \nwe are very pleased with this bill.\n  I support this legislation because it will keep invasive carp out of \nMinnesota's northern lakes. It will help towns across the country \nadvance critical flood protection projects. It will address overdue \nport and harbor maintenance on the Great Lakes. It will also ensure \nthat navigation will remain strong on the inland waterways system, \nincluding the powerful and important Mississippi River, which of course \nstarts in my State in Itasca State Park, where one can literally walk \nover the mighty Mississippi.\n  Minnesota's fishing and boating industries contribute around $4 \nbillion to our State's economy every single year. For Minnesotans, \nbeing on the water is more than just a way of life. It is also part of \nour State's culture, part of our heritage, and it is certainly part of \nour economic engine, but that way of life is under threat right now \nbecause of invasive species of carp, also called Asian carp. They were \nimported and accidentally released into the Mississippi River years \nago. How I would love to reverse that moment when they were \naccidentally released in the Southern States into the Mississippi \nRiver, but it happened, and years later we are still stuck with the \nconsequences.\n  Anyone who has not seen the YouTube video, I would suggest you view \nit--of these Asian carp literally jumping out of the water, hitting \nfishermen in the head because they eat so much every single day, and of \ncourse they are eating the fish we have come to rely on in our State \nfor great food and also great recreation.\n  As these invasive carp have worked their way farther upstream, we \nhave learned they are not deterred by cold winters, which was once \nthought to be the case. Today invasive species of carp are knocking on \nour doorstep. They have been found around Winona, MN, and they are \nalready in the St. Croix River.\n  Minnesotans know we cannot simply wish the problem away. The problem \nis literally swimming and jumping into our lives. That is why I \nauthored the Upper Mississippi CARP Act, which would close the Upper \nSt. Anthony Falls Lock in Minneapolis. My lock closure provision \nincluded in the Water Resources Reform and Development Act conference \nreport will simply require the Army Corps of Engineers to close the \nUpper St. Anthony Falls Lock within 1 year following the date of \nenactment.\n\n[[Page S3254]]\n\n  The language is a product of years of working with State and local \nstakeholders, and today, with the passage of this provision, we will \ntake a significant step forward in the fight against invasive species \nto make sure they do not move up into Minnesota's northern lakes.\n  This provision has the support of Senator Franken and also \nRepresentatives Ellison, Paulsen, Walz, and Nolan in the House. It was \nbipartisan. It was supported by Governor Dayton and the City of \nMinneapolis, as well as a large number of environmental and wildlife \norganizations, including Minnesota Trout Unlimited, the National \nWildlife Federation, the Mississippi River Fund, the Minnesota Izaak \nWalton League, the National Parks Conservation Association, and the \nFriends of the Mississippi River, just to name a few.\n  It is also supported by countless anglers across Minnesota, and I \nappreciate the broad support we have had. It is not easy closing a \nlock, and we know there were some limited uses of the lock by certain \nbusinesses that during the winter do not use the lock but use barges, \nand we know the city will be working with them. We also know the \nkayaking community was using the lock, and I truly appreciate their \nsupport in closing down this lock. We had a tour boat that was using \nthis lock, and they no longer use it.\n\n  Then of course we had the Army Corps there. We worked with them. It \nwas not easy at first, but I have appreciated their work. We know in an \nemergency the lock could be opened again. But this is not just a study; \nthis closes down this lock in 1 year.\n  I also want to thank my colleagues who worked with me on this \nprovision who may have similar locks and dams and were concerned about \nwhat precedent this would set. We were able to make this a very focused \nprovision, so we did not get resistance in the end, and they actually \nworked with me on compromise language, got it in the Senate, and I \nthank my colleagues in the House for using this exact provision in the \nHouse bill.\n  Closing this lock is supported by many people. I remember meeting \nwith a group of kayakers who, despite being impacted by the lock \nclosure, told me: ``We're with you on this!''\n  Recreational users of the Upper St. Anthony Falls Lock have taken \nvoluntary steps, as I mentioned, to limit their use of the lock to \nreduce the chance of allowing invasive carp to spread upstream, but we \nknew we had to go further, and that is what we are doing today with the \npassage of this provision.\n  Although making the decision to close the lock was not done lightly, \nit is right for our State. We know invasive species of carp can \ndominate the environment and make up an astounding 90 percent of the \nbiomass in the river. They outcompete prized sport fish. They make \nwaterskiing unsafe for families, and they make boating in our lakes and \nrivers smelly and even dangerous.\n  In Minnesota, the Department of Natural Resources and the \nMetropolitan Council studied the economic impact of closing the Upper \nSt. Anthony Falls Lock and also the economic value of recreation \nactivities upstream of this lock. They found that for every one job \ndependent on the lock staying open, over eight jobs rely on \nrecreational boat trips upstream of the Upper St. Anthony Falls Lock.\n  Closing the Upper St. Anthony Falls Lock is a key part of a strategy \nto protect Minnesota's waters for future generations, but the fight \nagainst invasive carp does not end here. I will continue to fight for \nan ``all of the above'' solution to this challenge that includes \nclosing this lock while also supporting research and carp barriers to \nprotect other bodies of water in Minnesota.\n  Solving this problem will require the continued cooperation of \nFederal, State, and local stakeholders all working together, and the \npassage of the lock closure provision is a leap forward, but of course \nit only helps with Minnesota's northern lakes. We are already seeing \nproblems in the southern rivers, and we need to develop that research.\n  There must be a way to eliminate these carp--by giving them food that \nwill not kill other fish, by doing things with bubble barriers, and \nother ideas that have been brought forward. I know the State of \nMinnesota is working on that. I know the State of Wisconsin is working \non that--and people all over the country. The Federal Government must \nplay a role, and we must protect our Great Lakes, but we also must not \nforget our waterways.\n  The WRRDA bill also advances critical flood protection projects, \nincluding the Fargo-Moorhead--or as I like to call it, being from \nMinnesota: the Moorhead-Fargo--diversion project which will protect \nMoorhead, MN, and Fargo, ND, from flooding caused by the Red River of \nthe North.\n  I have seen firsthand how hard people in the Red River Valley work to \nprepare for a potential flood. The Presiding Officer knows what this is \nlike in New Jersey with his hurricanes, but I can tell you in Minnesota \nwe literally have to plan for it every single year. They literally have \nwarehouses for people putting sand in bags, anticipating this flooding. \nIn a number of years we nearly lost these two major cities.\n  This is not the way to do this, as much as we love our volunteers--\nour seniors, our school kids, and everyone else--who have gathered \ntogether to get this project done and have stopped their lives for \nweeks. It would be much better to have permanent flood protection.\n  I have worked with Senator Hoeven, of course, and Senator Heitkamp. \nThey have both taken a lead, as well as Senator Franken, to get this \ndone.\n  The region avoided flooding this year. The river has been, however, \nin major flood stage 6 out of the last 8 years. In 2009--the year of \nthe record flood--the river rose to more than 40 feet. In Minnesota and \nNorth Dakota, the Red River does not divide us. Working together, it \nactually brings us together and unites us, and it is that spirit of \nsolidarity that drives our efforts in the Red River Basin.\n  Floods damage homes, destroy crops, and hold entire cities hostage. \nThe Fargo-Moorhead flood diversion project is critical to safety and \neconomic development in the region, and finding a permanent solution to \nthe issue makes much more economic sense than continuing to fight the \nflooding and repair damages year after year.\n  The WRRDA bill also helps address flood protection for Roseau, MN. \nRoseau has recovered from a flood in 2002 that caused widespread \ndamage, but the area needs flood protection to reduce the flood stages \nin the city. The next phase of the Roseau diversion project will reduce \nfuture flood damages by nearly 86 percent. I thank Collin Peterson, the \nRepresentative who represents Roseau, for his work on getting this \nfunding. The families and businesses of Roseau have waited too long for \nflood protection, and the WRRDA bill ensures the project will be \ncompleted.\n  But the WRRDA bill does not just protect property; it also \nstrengthens our economy. The competitiveness of our economy is directly \ntied to the strength of our infrastructure. This includes upgrading and \nmodernizing our ports, our harbors, and our waterways.\n  The harbor maintenance trust fund collects $700 million more each \nyear than it spends on dredging and maintenance. Meanwhile, our ports \nand navigation channels wait for basic maintenance.\n  Coming from New Jersey, the Presiding Officer may think of New Jersey \nas having ports. Well, we have a major port--one of the biggest ports--\nin Duluth, MN, that connects goods from the Midwest--not just from \nMinnesota, from all over the Midwest--to the Great Lakes through the \nSt. Lawrence Seaway. It is a major port and brings goods in from the \nrest of the world.\n  The backlog of sediment due to insufficient dredging is more than 18 \nmillion cubic yards and is estimated to cost $200 million. The WRRDA \nbill helps correct this disparity and ensures that funds are spent to \naddress the needs of shippers and that the Great Lakes system does not \nfall into further disrepair.\n  When ships on the Great Lakes have to light load--which means they \nhave about 10 percent less cargo than they should have--when they have \nto reduce their cargo because channels are not deep enough, our whole \neconomy suffers, not just the shippers, not just the people who are \nproducing the goods. Our whole economy suffers when we have to ship 10 \npercent less than we could on these ships and instead we are bringing \nit in from other parts of the world. This does not make any sense at \nall.\n\n[[Page S3255]]\n\n  That is why I cosponsored an amendment with Senator Levin that \nestablishes the Great Lakes ports as a single navigation system and \nsets aside additional funding for the Great Lakes ports.\n  This provision will help ensure maintenance and dredging is done \nthroughout the Great Lakes system. We are so excited about this. It is \nfinally warming up in Duluth. In northern Minnesota, it is no longer \ncolder than Mars. Our ships are ready to go and transport goods. We \nwant them to be at their full capacity. The only way we can achieve \nthis is by dredging some of these areas where we have seen some major \nproblems.\n  The bill also makes critical reforms to our Nation's rivers and \nwaterways. The inland waterways system in this country spans 38 States \nand handles approximately one-half of all inland freight. With many \nmaintenance and construction projects years overdue, the inland \nwaterways are in dire need of major rehabilitation.\n  The inland waterways trust fund, which funds these projects, is in \nsteady decline. If we do not strengthen it, the industries that so \nheavily depend on the inland waterways system and the people that work \nfor these industries--critical jobs--will suffer. That is why I \ncosponsored the RIVER Act with Senators Casey and Landrieu to help move \nforward major construction projects on the inland waterways system, \nincluding much-needed rehabilitation of the locks and dams on the \nMississippi River.\n  A number of the provisions of the RIVER Act are included in the final \nWRRDA bill, including reforms to the project management process that \nwill help ensure waterways projects are completed on time and cost \noverruns are minimized.\n  I also supported Senator Casey's amendment to increase the inland \nwaterways user fee. Let me emphasize that the user who pays this fee \nasked for it. They agreed to pay this fee. We have a case of a win-win \nsituation where the businesses that use these locks and dams want to \nactually pay more money to upgrade them because they need to carry \ntheir goods to market.\n  I think the Presiding Officer knows the only way we are going to \nadvance here in this economy on an international basis is if we are \nmaking stuff, inventing things, and sending them overseas instead of \neveryone sending their goods to America. We are not going to do that \nwithout a modern transportation system. Here we have businesses that \nare employing tens of thousands of people, hundreds of thousands of \npeople, that are willing to pay extra money to upgrade our locks and \ndams. That is all this is about.\n  Industry partners, from farmers to shippers to companies such as \nCargill in my State, strongly support this user fee increase. The \nincrease was their idea. They know this modest change will go a long \nway to ensuring that our Nation's rivers are viable for years to come. \nThe fee increase did not make it into the WRRDA bill because it is a \ntax provision. There are some good things in this bill for locks and \ndams. I do appreciate how the industry worked so well with me on \nallowing this provision of the closure of the one lock in Minnesota to \nstop the invasive species from going up into our northern lakes.\n  But I also am continuing to work with them to upgrade our locks and \ndams throughout the country. One aspect that would truly help is this \nfee that businesses are willing to pay. It is exactly what we want--\nprivate money going to upgrade our infrastructure. So we need to get \nthis done.

I thank the distinguished Senator from Arizona and a \ndistinguished member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for his \ncourtesy. I know he will be making comments in which I share his \nconcerns and for which he has been very outspoken. I will try to \ncondense my effort here.\n  On Monday, the Department of Justice announced that Swiss bank Credit \nSuisse pled guilty to the criminal charge of helping American citizens \ncheat on their taxes, and agreed to pay a $2.6 billion fine. The bank \nadmitted to using bogus entities to disguise undeclared U.S. accounts \nfrom American tax authorities, and it admitted to helping its clients \narrange large cash transactions to skirt U.S. reporting requirements.\n  The guilty plea means that the bank will be punished for its \ntransgressions, and it serves as a warning to others who would engage \nin or enable tax evasion. But astoundingly, Credit Suisse will not be \nrequired to disclose additional names of U.S. citizens who hired the \nbank to help them cheat on their taxes and evade prosecution by U.S. \nauthorities.\n  As the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations reported earlier this \nyear, the Justice Department has only been able to obtain the names of \n238 Credit Suisse customers out of 22,000 U.S.-owned accounts at the \nbank. The reason for this is simple. Swiss bank secrecy laws forbid \nCredit Suisse and other Swiss banks from sharing information about \ntheir clients with U.S. tax authorities, even if those clients are \nactively violating U.S. tax laws.\n  Luckily, we have a simple solution, one which we could enact right \nnow with the agreement from this body. On April 1, the Foreign \nRelations Committee, with strong bipartisan support, reported out \nfavorably a new protocol amending our tax treaty with Switzerland. For \ndecades, tax treaties have played a key role in facilitating greater \nand more transparent trade and investment. They have helped protect \nAmerican companies from double taxation and made it easier for them to \nexplore new markets and business opportunities.\n  They do this all while simultaneously protecting U.S. taxpayer \nprivacy and information confidentiality. They enhance our efforts to \nprevent tax avoidance or evasion. The new protocol with Switzerland \nwould not permit Swiss banks, like Credit Suisse, to withhold \ninformation on U.S. individuals who have, for years, hidden behind \nSwiss bank secrecy laws to avoid paying U.S. taxes.\n  The protocol brings our tax treaty with Switzerland into conformity \nwith both the entire internationally accepted standards on the \ninformation exchange as well as the most recent U.S. model tax treaty. \nIt includes an arbitration provision to ensure that when disputes arise \nbetween the U.S. and Swiss tax authorities over issues like the \nexchange of information, these disputes will be resolved expeditiously, \nrather than dragging on and frustrating cross-border tax enforcement.\n  The Swiss government has already ratified the protocol. We should do \nthe same. Credit Suisse pled guilty to abetting tax evasion--a criminal \ncharge. But they were not forced to disclose the names of actual tax \nevaders because doing so would violate Swiss bank secrecy laws. \nRatifying the treaty with Switzerland is therefore necessary.\n  It will enable U.S. authorities to obtain information about these and \nother tax evaders who are still taking advantage of bank secrecy laws \nto avoid paying their fair share.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be determined by the \nmajority leader, in consultation with the Republican leader, the Senate \nproceed to executive session to consider Calendar No. 9, treaty \ndocument No. 112-1; that the treaty be considered as having advanced \nthrough the various parliamentary stages up to and including the \npresentation of resolutions of ratification; that any committee \ndeclarations be agreed to as applicable; that any statements be printed \nin the Record as if read; that if the resolution of ratification is \nagreed to, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon \nthe table; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's \naction, and the Senate resume legislative session.\n\n[[Page S3256]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). Is there objection?\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, reserving the right to object, as you \nknow, I have been a critic of these treaties for some time. This \ndiscussion has gone on for quite a while. I disagree with many of the \nimplications of where these treaties would take us. But I realize there \nare some beneficial aspects of the treaties.\n  But because of the critical invasion of privacy that these treaties \nwould allow, I cannot support them. These treaties are an encroachment \non our privacy and our constitutional right to privacy. Many of the \nprevious treaties that we have had in the past focused on information \nspecific to tax fraud.\n  I am not opposed to getting the information of those who have \ncommitted fraud or broken the law, but you must have an accusation, you \nmust submit some proof.\n  We are going to have bulk collection of records without suspicion.\n  As previously stated in the previous treaties, the information that \nwas exchanged in the past under the current treaties had to show that \nthey were for preventing tax fraud. The new treaty, though, is going to \nchange the standard from looking for tax fraud--which seems to be what \neverybody is talking about--to saying that we will look for financial \ninformation that may be relevant.\n  What we are doing is taking the standard down to something ``may be \nrelevant,'' which could be a dragnet for getting everyone's \ninformation. It will be a deterrent to foreign investors both in our \ncountry as well as in other countries. I think at the very least every \nAmerican, whether at home or abroad, deserves the right to the fourth \namendment protections guaranteed by the Constitution.\n  I want the record to be very clear. I certainly do not condone \nAmericans who have not followed the letter of the law, but I can't \nsupport a law that endangers regular foreign investment and punishes \nevery American regardless of whether there is suspicion that they have \ncommitted a crime.\n  While I want the important benefits included in the tax treaties to \nbe ratified, I cannot support a treaty that would pave the way for a \nlaw that would permit the IRS to share information of customers at U.S. \nbanks with foreign governments. Imagine, we will be conceivably sharing \ninformation about customers here with governments that may well not \neven be our friends. Also, I cannot support a treaty that may \nfacilitate the bulk collection of private financial data for all U.S. \ncitizens living abroad. For those reasons, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Very briefly, I am disappointed because basically what \nwe are going to do--those of us who are law-abiding and pay our taxes \nhave to suffer the consequences of those who cheat and go abroad to do \nso. When they do that, they undermine the ability of this government to \nhave the resources to arm the men and women who serve us abroad, \nprotect them, take care of their health care, and deal with the \nchallenges of educating the next generation of Americans.\n  Let me just say that this question that the treaty somehow \ninfringes--first of all, if Switzerland is not a friendly country, I \ndon't know what is. It is not a question of a country that isn't \nfriendly, so let's remove that objection.\n  The treaty supposedly infringes on the fourth amendment rights of \nU.S. citizens. Look, these bilateral tax treaties only permit the \nexchange of information that is foreseeably relevant to the collection \nof taxes.\n  The proposed treaty also provides protection against fishing \nexpeditions. To exchange information, the requesting country must \ndemonstrate that the individuals targeted have engaged in activities \nthat suggested they are engaging in fraud.\n  The existing treaty with Switzerland requires the requesting country \nto establish tax fraud or fraudulent misconduct as a basis for the \nexchange. That standard has clearly proven to be too narrow for the \npurposes of prosecuting tax evasion, as demonstrated by the outcome of \nthis Credit Suisse settlement, where the bank still does not have to \nhand over the names of individuals who use Credit Suisse accounts to \nhide their income.\n  Now the wages and U.S. bank account interests of Americans are both \nreported to the IRS. There is no reason why people with foreign bank \naccounts should be able to hide their money from the IRS in a way that \naverage, hard-working Americans cannot. It boggles my mind that we are \ngoing to treat average, hard-working Americans in a different way than \nthose who have the money to cheat and ultimately avoid their \nresponsibility to our collective society, so we will continue to raise \nthis issue.\n  I won't expound upon it any more--I have plenty to say--in deference \nto the Senator from Arizona, who was gracious enough to yield the \nfloor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate as in morning business for such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/22/senate-section/article/S3256-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3256-S3259]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 SYRIA\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Middle East today is engulfed in an escalating \nregional conflict. The space for moderate politics in country after \ncountry is collapsing, and a process of radicalization is increasingly \ndestabilizing the entire region. At the center of this growing conflict \nstands Syria, where for over 3 years now the Syrian people have faced \nan onslaught of unspeakable violence from President Bashar al-Assad and \nhis forces.\n  As of today more than 160,000 Syrians have been killed, over half of \nthe population is in urgent need of humanitarian assistance, and 9.3 \nmillion people have been driven from their homes in what the United \nNations has described ``as the greatest humanitarian tragedy of our \ntimes.'' To give some sense for the scale of the growing refugee \ncrisis, there are now 1 million registered Syrian refugees in Lebanon. \nThat makes up one-fourth of the total population of the country. This \ndoes not include the thousands who are living there unofficially and \nunregistered. This is as if the entire population of Canada were \nuprooted and became refugees in the United States of America--twice \nover.\n  Without understanding the scale, it is hard to comprehend the stress \non resources and the escalating tensions that these refugees have \ncaused in neighboring countries. Can you imagine what we would do as \nAmericans if we were dealing with the entire population of Canada \nliving as refugees in our country? Inside Syria, they are confronted \nwith the inhumane cruelty of Mr. Assad and his forces every day.\n  We have seen evidence of this systematic abuse, torture, starvation, \nand killing of approximately 100,000 detainees, in what clearly amounts \nto war crimes and crimes against humanity. The United Nations has \ndetailed the further arrest, detention, torture, and sexual abuse of \nthousands of children by government forces. Human Rights Watch has \ndocumented how Syrian authorities have deliberately used explosives and \nbulldozers to demolish entire neighborhoods for no military reason \nwhatsoever, just as a form of collective punishment of Syrian \ncivilians.\n  The United Nations has also documented the toll of the Syrian \ngovernment's air strike campaign, and, in particular, the regime's use \nof crude cluster munitions that have become known as barrel bombs. \nTheir sole purpose is to maim, kill, and terrorize as many civilians as \npossible when indiscriminately dropped on schools, bakeries, and \nmosques.\n  Worse yet, evidence is piling up that Assad's forces have been \nequipping these barrel bombs with chlorine gas. Just last week French \nForeign Minister Laurent Fabius said that France has evidence of at \nleast 14 chlorine-based chemical attacks carried out by Syrian \nGovernment forces since 2013, adding, ``The regime is still capable of \nproducing chemical weapons and is determined to use them.''\n  Around the same time, a senior Israeli defense official stated that \n``from the day that he signed the deal, Assad has used chemical weapons \nover thirty times, and in every case citizens were killed.''\n  The State Department has further verified these reports, stating \nthere\n\n[[Page S3257]]\n\nwere ``indications'' of the use of chlorine--though it was quick to \npoint out that this is not one of the chemicals Syria was obliged to \nsurrender.\n  So it appears that we are faced with a situation in which the Assad \nregime has agreed to give up certain chemical weapons after using them \nto murder nearly 1,400 civilians last year, but it is also using other \nchemicals--less lethal but nonetheless effective--to continue gassing \ncivilians to death, and the world does nothing about it. Why? Because \ntechnically this is permitted under the chemical weapons agreement. \nThat is shameful and outrageous.\n  What is more, months after the deadline for removing all of its \nchemical weapons stockpiles, the Syrian Government has yet to fulfill \nits obligations under the treaty and is using its remaining stockpiles \nto bargain over the terms of the original agreement in the hopes of \nretaining its storage and production facilities.\n  As we are once again faced with images of men, women, and children \nwrithing on the ground and gasping for breath, Assad appears to be \ndisregarding some of his chemical weapons commitments and continuing to \ncommit mass atrocities. Again, redlines are tested and crossed, and the \nUnited States of America and the world do nothing.\n  These are just some of the many reasons our Director of National \nIntelligence referred to the Syria crisis as ``an apocalyptic \ndisaster.'' But this apocalyptic disaster in Syria is no longer just a \nhumanitarian tragedy for one country; it is a regional conflict and an \nemerging national security threat to us all. No one should believe that \nwe will be immune to what is happening in Syria. None of us are.\n  For those of you who look at these far-away events and say what \nNeville Chamberlain once told himself about a different problem from \nHell in an earlier time--that this is ``a quarrel in a far away country \nbetween people of whom we know nothing''--don't think that events in \nSyria won't have repercussions much closer to home. The terrorist \nsanctuary that Al Qaeda and its associated forces now enjoy in Syria \nand Iraq increasingly pose a direct threat to U.S. national security \nand that of our closest allies and partners. Indeed, the Secretary of \nHomeland Security, Mr. Jeh Johnson, has said, ``Syria is now a matter \nof homeland security.'' The Director of National Intelligence, James \nClapper, has also repeatedly warned that Al Qaeda-affiliated terrorists \nin Syria now aspire to attack the homeland.\n  If the September 11 attacks should have taught us anything, it is \nthat global terrorists who occupy ungoverned spaces and seek to plot \nand plan attacks against us can pose a direct threat to our national \nsecurity. That was Afghanistan on September 10, 2001, and that is what \ntop officials in this administration are now warning us Syria is \nbecoming today.\n  The latest U.S. intelligence estimates say that more than 100 \nAmericans have traveled to fight in Syria alongside extremists, joining \nsome of the most dangerous terrorist organizations in the world today.\n  Earlier this month, FBI Director James Comey stated:\n\n       All of us with a memory of the '80s and '90s saw the line \n     drawn from Afghanistan to September 11. We see Syria as that, \n     but an order of magnitude worse in a couple of respects: Far \n     more people are going there, and far easier to travel to and \n     back from.\n\n  Already, senior intelligence officials believe that between 6 and 12 \nAmericans who have gone to Syria to fight have now returned to America, \npossibly with the intention to carry out attacks here. ``We know where \nsome are,'' stated one senior U.S. intelligence official. Some? But \nwhat about the others? Does that reassure you?\n  The sheer scale of foreign fighters with Western passports traveling \nto fight in Syria has our senior-most intelligence officers worrying \nabout how easy it would be for these people to slip through the cracks. \nIn March the Director of the National Counterterrorism Center, Matthew \nOlsen, testified that the NSA simply does not have the ability to track \nthe thousands of jihadists now flocking to Syria. He testified:\n\n       This raises our concern that radicalized individuals with \n     extremist contacts and battlefield experience could return to \n     their home countries to commit violence on their own \n     initiative or participate in al Qaeda-directed plots aimed at \n     Western targets outside of Syria.\n\n  First indoctrinated, then trained and equipped, the foreign fighters \nnow joining groups such as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, known \nas ISIS--a group who proved too radical even for Al Qaeda's senior \nleadership--presents a challenge that rises above a mere \ncounterterrorism problem. ISIS no longer exists in small, concentrated \ncells, conducting operations limited in nature and scope. It has become \na real nascent state actor, similar in organization and power to the \nTaliban of the late 1990s and possessing a real army of foreign \nrecruits capable of carrying out attacks across the world. The \nterritory it possesses is no longer a safe haven within a state. It has \nbecome a de facto state that serves as a safe haven and an even more \nvibrant incubator for international terrorism than did pre-9/11 \nAfghanistan. It is a saddening irony that as our efforts to eradicate \nthe Al Qaeda safe haven in Afghanistan are proving successful, we see \nan even more dangerous terrorist sanctuary emerging on the border of \nEurope between Damascus and Baghdad.\n  My friends, here is the tragic reality of the war in Syria. After \nmore than 3 years of horror, suffering, devastation, and growing \nthreats to international security, the conflict in Syria continues to \nget worse and worse both for Syria and for the world. But the United \nStates and the international community have no effective policy to help \nbring this conflict to a responsible end. The Geneva peace talks have \nfailed entirely, as predicted. Ambassador Brahimi, the U.N. Special \nRepresentative, has himself given up on the process and resigned last \nweek. This should surprise no one. The United States and the \ninternational community have been reluctant to provide the opposition \nwith much needed material support. Meanwhile, Assad has the active \nsupport of Hezbollah, Iran, and Russia and is using nearly every weapon \nin his arsenal to kill his way to victory, and he is winning. So why \nwould he want to negotiate himself out of power now?\n  Can we finally stop hiding behind the fantasy of Geneva and admit \nwhat has been painfully obvious from the start: that there is no hope \nfor a negotiated solution until the momentum on the battlefield changes \nagainst the Assad regime. And that will only happen through greater \ninternational intervention of some sort.\n  After painful and costly experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan, a war-\nweary American public does not appear eager for an active, \ninternationalist foreign policy, and President Obama has sought to give \nthe American people what they want. While it is understandable and \nunsurprising that the American public has been reluctant to get more \nengaged with events in Syria and the wider Middle East, the tide of war \ndoes not recede simply because we wish it so.\n  The outcome of the administration's disengagement has been a \nconsistent failure to support more responsible forces in Syria when \nthat support would have mattered--the descent of Syria into chaos and \ngrowing international instability, the use of Syria as a training \nground for Al Qaeda affiliates and other terrorist organizations, the \nceding of regional leadership to our international adversaries, and the \ntolerance of war crimes and crimes against humanity. In short, all of \nthe awful things that critics said would happen if we got more involved \nin Syria have happened because we have not gotten more involved.\n  We continue to hear from the administration that there are no good \noptions in Syria--as if there ever were good options in the real \nworld--and that the only alternative to our current disengagement is a \nfull-scale ground invasion and war without end. The President \nfrequently has said as much, recently stating:\n\n       It is very difficult to imagine a scenario in which our \n     involvement in Syria would have led to a better outcome, \n     short of us being willing to undertake an effort in size and \n     scope similar to what we did in Iraq.\n\n  But this claim has been directly contradicted by other administration \nofficials who recognize that our inaction in Syria is not because we \nlack options or capability but, rather, the will.\n  In an April 30 speech at the Holocaust Museum in Washington, our own \nAmbassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, said:\n\n\n[[Page S3258]]\n\n\n       To those who would argue that a head of state or government \n     has to choose only between doing nothing and sending in the \n     military--I maintain that is a constructed and false choice, \n     an accompaniment only to disengagement and passivity.\n\n  French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius has also highlighted this \nfalse choice, recently expressing his regrets that Western nations did \nnot carry out threatened airstrikes against the regime following the \nAugust 2013 chemical attack and that more had not been done to stop the \nabominable behavior of the Assad regime. He stated:\n\n       We regret it [not carrying out threatened airstrikes] \n     because we think it would have changed everything.\n\n  That is a French Foreign Minister who regrets that we didn't carry \nout the airstrikes because ``we think it would have changed \neverything.'' In his comments he made it clear that a limited surgical \nstrike would have made all the difference in Syria and would have \nstopped the chemical attacks that continue today, saved the lives of \nthousands of people, and prevented the devastating consequences that \nhave reverberated around the world since that red line was crossed.\n\n  It is true our options to help end the conflict in Syria were never \ngood, and they are much worse and fewer now. But as Mr. Fabius pointed \nout, as bad as our options in Syria may be, we still have options. No \none should believe that doing something meaningful to help in Syria \nrequires total war or invasion. Literally no one is calling for that, \nand it is intellectually dishonest to suggest so. This is not a \nquestion of options or costs or capabilities but a question of will.\n  The continued violence in Syria is expected to kill tens of thousands \nmore and produce millions of refugees by the year's end. This is a \nhumanitarian tragedy, to be sure, but one with immediate strategic \nconsequences. The longer the devastation goes on, the more difficult it \nwill be to put Syria back together again. Failing to do so will leave a \ndangerous conflagration in the heart of the Middle East--a failed state \nat war with itself where extremism and instability will fester and \nterrorists of all brands will find ample space, resources, and recruits \nto menace the region and eventually attack the United States.\n  If ever there was a case that should remind us that our interests are \nindivisible from our values, it is Syria. We cannot afford to go numb \nto this human tragedy. I have seen my fair share of suffering and death \nin the world, but the images and stories coming out of Syria haunt me \nmost. In the time I have been speaking, at least two Syrians have been \nkilled, 45 Syrians have become refugees, and 15 Syrian families have \nbeen forced from their homes. In another 15 minutes from now, two more \nwill be killed, 45 more will become refugees, and 15 more families will \nbe forced from their homes. Is that acceptable to us?\n  Neither the United States, Europe, nor the Syrian people can afford \nthe cost of defeatism. The price of abandonment includes not only a \nfailed state in Syria but an entire region teetering on the brink of \ndisaster, and it means emboldening our adversaries and conceding a safe \nhaven and a state to the world's most dangerous terrorist groups. While \nthese are the real, tangible consequences we face, it also means \nconceding the moral sources of our great power and giving up on every \nprinciple our Nation was built on.\n  All of us, Americans and Europeans, must recognize that our power \nconfers a responsibility on us. If the most powerful nations in the \nworld have the capabilities and the options to help bring to an end one \nof the most horrific mass atrocities in modern times, what does it say \nabout us that we have not done so? History will render a bitter and \nscathing judgment on America and the world for our failure in Syria, \nand I pray we will finally recognize that and take the necessary \nactions to help the Syrian people write a better end to this sad \nchapter of world affairs.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord two articles, one entitled ``FBI Director: Number of Americans \ntraveling to fight in Syria increasing,'' and the other entitled \n``Exclusive: Al Qaeda's American Fighters Are Coming Home--and U.S. \nIntelligence Can't Find Them.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 2, 2014]\n\n     FBI Director: Number of Americans Traveling to Fight in Syria \n                               Increasing\n\n                   (By Sari Horwitz and Adam Goldman)\n\n       FBI Director James B. Comey said Friday that the problem of \n     Americans traveling to Syria to fight in the civil war there \n     has worsened in recent months and remains a major concern to \n     U.S. law enforcement and intelligence officials.\n       In a wide-ranging interview with reporters at FBI \n     headquarters, Comey said the FBI is worried that the \n     Americans who have joined extremist groups allied with al-\n     Qaeda in Syria will return to the United States to carry out \n     terrorist attacks.\n       ``All of us with a memory of the '80s and '90s saw the line \n     drawn from Afghanistan in the '80s and '90s to Sept. 11,'' \n     Comey said. ``We see Syria as that, but an order of magnitude \n     worse in a couple of respects. Far more people going there. \n     Far easier to travel to and back from. So, there's going to \n     be a diaspora out of Syria at some point and we are \n     determined not to let lines be drawn from Syria today to a \n     future 9/11.''\n       Comey declined to give a precise figure for Americans \n     believed to be involved in the Syrian struggle but said the \n     numbers are ``getting worse.''\n       ``I said dozens last time,'' said Comey, referring to an \n     interview with reporters four months ago. ``It's still \n     dozens, just a couple more dozen.''\n       A senior U.S. counterterrorism official estimated this year \n     that 60 to 70 Americans have traveled to fight in Syria. \n     Comey said that Americans in Syria are actively recruiting \n     other Americans to join the fight.\n       Comey said the threat associated with foreign fighters in \n     Syria is of concern not only to the United States but also is \n     ``a huge focus'' of European intelligence officials.\n       ``It's the first thing we talk about when I go visit a \n     counterpart,'' said Comey, who has visited 13 FBI legal \n     attache offices abroad since he became director in September.\n       Comey said thousands of fighters are traveling to Syria \n     from European countries, and they are a focus for the FBI \n     because many of them could easily get into the United States.\n       ``They're visa-waiver countries,'' Comey said. ``If someone \n     flows out of Syria, they can flow in here very easily.''\n       Comey said the al-Qaeda affiliate in Yemen remains the \n     greatest threat to the United States. He said the terrorist \n     group is bent on attacking America and that he was very \n     concerned about the group's bombmaking expertise.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  [From the Daily Beast, May 20, 2014]\n\n   Exclusive: Al Qaeda's American Fighters Are Coming Home--And U.S. \n                      Intelligence Can't Find Them\n\n                             (By Eli Lake)\n\n       The number of American extremists who have flocked to Syria \n     is higher than previously understood, American intelligence \n     sources say. And some of the fighters are coming home.\n       Western intelligence services have been warning that \n     European and American jihadists have been flocking to Syria \n     to fight. But they've been reluctant to say how many \n     Americans have joined the extremist forces there--until now. \n     The latest U.S. intelligence estimates say that more than 100 \n     Americans have joined the jihad in Syria to fight alongside \n     Sunni terrorists there.\n       Senior American intelligence officials tell The Daily Beast \n     that they believe between six and 12 Americans who have gone \n     to Syria to fight Assad have now returned to America. ``We \n     know where some are,'' one senior U.S. intelligence official \n     told The Daily Beast. ``The concern is the scale of the \n     problem we are dealing with.''\n       The scale of that problem by all accounts has gotten worse. \n     Last fall, the official U.S. estimate on Americans \n     specifically who have joined the jihad in Syria was in the \n     low double digits. In January, the New York Times reported \n     that at least 70 Americans have either traveled or attempted \n     to travel to Syria. Earlier this month FBI Director James \n     Comey told reporters that he believed ``dozens'' of Americans \n     were suspected to be foreign fighters in Syria, but declined \n     to give a more precise number.\n       In recent months, the U.S. intelligence community has made \n     the tracking of all Westerners going to fight into Syria a \n     top priority. Speaking in March before the Senate Foreign \n     Relations Committee, Matthew Olsen, the director of the \n     National Counter-Terrorism Center, described in vague terms \n     an effort by the whole government to find Western citizens \n     traveling to Syria and to track their travel.\n       ``In light of the large foreign fighter component in Syria \n     crisis, we are working together to gather every piece of \n     information we can about the identity of these individuals,'' \n     he said at the time.\n       More recently, the issue of Western foreign fighters came \n     up in top-level meetings between the Syrian opposition \n     delegation and the Obama administration last week to \n     Washington, D.C.\n       ``We view all foreign fighters as a threat and they are not \n     welcome. There is a convergence of interests between the \n     moderate Syrian opposition and the international community in \n     fighting these foreign fighters and insuring they do not use \n     Syria as a launching pad for external attacks,'' said Oubai \n     Shabandar, a strategic communications adviser to the Syrian \n     opposition's foreign mission in Washington. ``This was a \n     major topic\n\n[[Page S3259]]\n\n     of conversation this month in meetings with the Syrian \n     opposition delegation and top U.S. officials.''\n       The problem, U.S. counter-terrorism and intelligence \n     officials tell The Daily Beast, is that there are just so \n     many jihadists with Western passports traveling to fight in \n     Syria that they worry some of them may slip back into the \n     United States without being detected.\n       ``The NSA does not have the ability to track thousands of \n     bad guys--and on the human intelligence side, this is even \n     more difficult,'' another senior U.S. intelligence official \n     told The Daily Beast. ``So we are worried that people are \n     slipping through the cracks.''\n       Olsen in his March testimony said there were thousands of \n     foreign fighters in Syria and that hundreds of those fighters \n     held Western passports.\n       ``This raises our concern that radicalized individuals with \n     extremist contacts and battlefield experience could return to \n     their home countries to commit violence on their own \n     initiative or participate in al Qaeda-directed plots aimed at \n     Western targets outside of Syria,'' he said. Olsen also said \n     that a group of ``al Qaeda veterans'' from Afghanistan and \n     Pakistan have gone to Syria, making the prospect of \n     recruiting new members for the organization even more likely.\n       Aaron Zelin, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute \n     for Near East Policy who closely tracks the flow of foreign \n     fighters into Syria, said, ``In the past when we've seen \n     Americans go abroad to fight in foreign countries and a \n     number of individuals have been trained to go back to attempt \n     attacks on the homeland.'' The best example he said is Faisal \n     al-Shahzad, the Pakistani American who traveled to Taliban \n     training camps in Pakistan and then attempted to set off a \n     bomb in Times Square in 2010. Al-Shahzad failed to properly \n     detonate his bomb and was reported to the New York police by \n     a Muslim-American street vendor.\n       ``It's not just Americans who are going to Syria, but there \n     are up to 3,000 European citizens from countries that have \n     visa waivers with the United States who have also joined the \n     jihad in Syria,'' Zelin said. ``This is why so many Western \n     counter-terrorism officials are so worried, it's much easier \n     to get into our country with a Western passport.''\n       Those Americans that have gone off to fight in Syria also \n     do not fit the typical terrorist profile. Last May, the \n     Detroit Free Press reported that Nicole Lynn Mansfield, a \n     convert to Islam, was killed in fighting in Syria fighting \n     Assad. In April of 2013, a federal court charged Eric \n     Harroun, a former U.S. Army private, with firing a rocket-\n     propelled grenade while fighting alongside al-Nusra, al \n     Qaeda's official affiliate in Syria. If U.S. intelligence \n     estimates are correct, these cases could be unfortunate \n     harbingers of things to come.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Madam President, this weekend Americans will gather to \nremember all who have fought and perished so that we might live in \nfreedom. Memorial Day is our chance to honor their extraordinary \nsacrifices.\n  Of course, Kentucky has long played a proud and vital role in the \ndefense of our Nation. I am honored to represent so many Kentuckians in \nthe Armed Forces, including those stationed at Fort Knox, Fort \nCampbell, the Blue Grass Army Depot, and members of the Reserves and \nKentucky National Guard.\n  One of the reasons Memorial Day is so important to me is because it \nallows Americans to reflect and give thanks for all that we have--to \nrecognize that none of it would have been possible without so many \nAmericans we have never met putting everything on the line for us. That \nis why the men and women who protect us deserve our full support when \nthey are deployed, when they are training, and when they return home. \nMost Americans certainly agree with that statement.\n  Yet as we have recently learned, that is not what is happening. So \nmany Americans now turn on the evening news just to be sickened by the \nsteady drip, drip from the Obama administration's growing veterans \nscandal. The denial of care to our veterans is a national disgrace and \nthe scandal only seems to increase in scope by the day.\n  We first heard about 1 hospital in Phoenix, then we heard about 10 \nmedical centers across the Nation, now there are at least 2 dozen VA \nfacilities under investigation. It all leads to an obvious question: \nHow widespread is this failure to treat our veterans?\n  We need answers from the President and his administration. The White \nHouse claims the President didn't even know about the latest scandal \nuntil hearing about it on the news, even though a top official \ntestified he knew of inappropriate scheduling practices at VA health \ncare clinics as far back as 2010. It sure raises a lot of questions.\n  It is a curious thing. President Obama, the most powerful man in the \nfree world, always seems to be the last to know about what is going on \nin his own administration. From the Obama administration's IRS scandal \nto its ObamaCare Web site fiasco, just about every time, the President \nclaims to be in the dark until the wrongdoing surfaces on its own--\nusually in the press. The pattern is incredibly worrying.\n  If it is true he learns so much through the press--if he knows that \nlittle about what is going on in his own administration--then I \nrecommend he get reengaged. Right now. Right now. Because American \nPresidential leadership is needed today. This scandal appears to be a \nfailure of huge magnitude, and the people we represent are demanding he \nrise to the challenge.\n  Our veterans are counting on him to work with both parties to get to \nthe truth and to pursue solutions that can make things better--\nsolutions such as the VA reform bill that passed the House yesterday \nwith strong bipartisan support. That legislation, which I have \ncosponsored and which Senator Rubio has been the leader on, would make \nit easier to remove high-level VA employees for performance failures. \nIt is a smart idea. There is no reason for us not to pass it quickly \nright here in the Senate. The President should call for its passage \nright away too. That would be one positive step forward for him--a \nsmall one, but a positive one, even though, for some reason, the White \nHouse has been ambivalent about the bill.\n  Look, we all remember how engaged the President was when \nhealthcare.gov flopped. He was very engaged. He didn't just send a \nstaffer out to Phoenix; he didn't just give a secretary a stern talking \nto; he didn't say he wouldn't stand for it. He pulled out all the \nstops. He made it his No. 1 priority to get that Web site running, even \nif that is still not done. What I am saying is the President should put \nmore effort into helping our veterans than his attempt to fix a Web \nsite. Only he can work with us to get to the truth. Our veterans \ndeserve it. They deserve answers. They deserve accountability, and they \ndeserve solutions.\n  As we look ahead to Memorial Day, I hope the President will work \nconstructively with us to give them just that--to prove how grateful we \nare to the brave men and women who protect us every single day.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today to speak in favor of the \nconfirmation of David Barron to the First Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  As a Harvard Law professor, he has broad bipartisan support from \nthose who know him best--his colleagues. Larry Tribe and Charles \nFried--two professors at Harvard who could not be further apart \npolitically--both agree--and this is the joint quote--``Barron is a \nbrilliant lawyer who will make an excellent judge. What is clear to us \nis that Barron will decide cases based solely on the relevant sources \nof legal authority, including binding precedent, and that his political \nviews would in no way distort his legal judgment.''\n  This is the kind of unequivocal support we want for a judicial \nnominee, and David Barron is just the kind of judge we should confirm.\n  I stand alongside those of my colleagues who believe transparency is \nparamount and that we need a public debate on drone policy. Indeed, I \nsupport a robust debate on our entire drone policy, not simply the use \nof a drone to kill an American citizen who was plotting the \nannihilation of his fellow Americans.\n  Importantly, the White House just announced that it will release to \nthe general public the key memo Professor Barron wrote, so all \nAmericans will be able to take part in this debate.\n  But let us be clear: David Barron is not responsible for the \nadministration's delay in releasing the memos he\n\n[[Page S3260]]\n\nand others in the Office of Legal Counsel were directed to produce. He \nis certainly not responsible for the administration's drone policy or \nthe decision to authorize an attack. He is a lawyer who was asked to do \nlegal analysis for his client, the President of the United States.\n  Entangling David Barron's nomination with the policy of drone \ndeployment is unfair to him and unfair to the people of Massachusetts, \nMaine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Puerto Rico who need the \nvacancy on the First Circuit filled by someone as qualified as David \nBarron.\n  I believe David Barron will be an excellent judge, and that is why he \nhas my support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/22/senate-section/article/S3260-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3260]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        WRRDA CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, I commend the Senate on taking final \naction on the Water Resources Reform and Development Act, known as \nWRRDA. Today's bill includes the $310 million Boston Harbor dredging \nproject which will deepen Boston Harbor's main navigation channels.\n  Boston Harbor is an economic anchor for the entire New England \nregion, and this investment will help ensure its future as a port of \nworld class distinction. Improving the harbor to accommodate more and \nlarger ships will bring more jobs, more investments, and more economic \nactivity to the harbor, extending Boston's position as a shining city \nupon a hill as well as on the shore.\n  Dredging the harbor will double the number of containers on ships \ncoming into Boston. The project will also allow the port to accommodate \nships being built to serve the expanded Panama Canal, which is planned \nto open next year.\n  The Army Corps projects that for every dollar spent on construction, \nthere will be $9 returned in increased economic activity, resulting in \na $2.7 billion economic benefit for the entire New England region.\n  I thank Chairman Boxer and Ranking Member Vitter for their hard work \ngetting this bill over the finish line.

Madam President, on Monday, May 26, our Nation will pause \nto remember all those who paid the ultimate price while serving in the \nU.S. Armed Forces. It is a solemn day on which we recognize these brave \nheroes for their valor, their courage, and their commitment to our \ncountry.\n  As we honor and remember those who died fighting for our freedom, \nCongress must also remember we still have a promise to fulfill to the \nveterans who thankfully returned home--many with visible and invisible \nwounds of war. Our Nation has a proud history of caring for its wounded \nand disabled servicemembers and their families.\n  When these men and women volunteered their service, the United States \nguaranteed they would be cared for. As a member of the Senate Veterans' \nAffairs Committee, I believe that promise has not been kept.\n  It is no secret the Department of Veterans Affairs is facing a \nsignificant challenge with accountability at all levels of their \nagency. This failure of responsibility has an impact on the hundreds of \nthousands of veterans in my home State of Nevada.\n  Last month I was honored to have a number of veterans join me for a \nroundtable in Las Vegas. This was an opportunity for me to listen and \nhear their concerns. By far, nearly every veteran in attendance \nexpressed frustrations with the VA's claims backlog and the health care \nthey are receiving. These veterans told me they feel discouraged and \nhopeless, that the VA does not and will not keep its promise.\n  They told me about the negative impact delays in benefits and care \nhave on veterans and their families. Such comments should come as no \nsurprise given the difficulties Nevada veterans are facing. Look no \nfurther than the problem of the claims backlog here in Nevada.\n  Although the Secretary of the VA promised there would be changes to \naddress this problem, Nevada veterans are still waiting the longest in \nthe Nation--up to 352 days on average--for their disability benefits \nclaims to be processed. This is nearly three times the VA's deadline of \n125 days to complete a claim.\n  These issues in Nevada and the allegations raised across the country \nare causing veterans to lose faith in the VA, and I have raised all \nthese concerns to the Secretary in a letter I sent 2 weeks ago. I asked \nfor immediate answers about the lack of accountability on the local \nlevel and whether VA leadership finally plans to do something about it. \nAlthough I requested a response by Wednesday, May 21, the VA still has \nnot responded. What these problems ultimately amount to is a lack of \naccountability in the VA leadership.\n  When I questioned the Secretary at a Senate Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee hearing last week, he agreed he was ultimately responsible \nfor the problems with VA care and health benefits. Despite this \nadmission and admitting that veterans are not receiving the care they \nwere promised, he said he does not plan to resign. So my question is: \nIf the Secretary does not plan to resign, who is held accountable in \nthe VA?\n  The VA has been given enough chances to change and do better, but \nthese were empty promises that have not produced any results. It is now \nup to Members of Congress to take action. That is why I have already \ntaken a number of steps to exert oversight, demand transparency, and \ndevelop solutions to the problems facing the VA.\n  During last week's hearing I asked the Secretary for assurances that \nthe audits being conducted by the VA at its medical facilities would \ninclude all of Nevada's hospitals and clinics and the results would be \nshared with me and the rest of our delegation. As promised by the \nSecretary, I look forward to receiving these results as soon as \npossible, and I expect substantive immediate action should Nevada have \nany reports of mistreatment or delayed care of veterans.\n  I also visited again with Las Vegas hospital officials last Friday to \nensure veterans at this facility are receiving the care they have \nearned and that the facility is properly handling its appointment \nwaiting times.\n  It is critical that the Las Vegas VA hospital constantly work to \nimprove its services and follows recommendations from the VA inspector \ngeneral so that patients do not endure long waits--like the blind \nfemale VA veteran who waited for 5 hours before being seen in the \nemergency room.\n  I believe the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee should continue to \nexert\n\n[[Page S3261]]\n\noversight and hold hearings to keep VA officials accountable and \ntransparent to Congress, veterans, and the American public.\n  Furthermore, I believe, now more than ever, it is time for Congress \nto take legislative action to fix one of the biggest challenges at the \nVA--the disability claims backlog.\n  Despite opportunities for improvement, 293,000 veterans Nationwide \nand 3,700 veterans in Nevada have waited over 125 days for their claims \nto be processed so they can get the compensation they have earned and \nthe VA medical care they desperately need.\n  To address this issue I introduced the VA Backlog Working Group March \n2014 Report, along with a bipartisan group of Senators, including \nSenators Casey, Moran, Heinrich, Vitter, and Tester. This report \noutlines the claims process, explains the history of the VA's claims \nbacklog, and offers targeted solutions to help the VA develop an \nefficient and accurate benefits delivery system that will ensure our \nveterans will never again have to wait more than 125 days to receive a \ndecision on their claims.\n  What our working group found was that the process is not only \ncomplex, but the backlog has been a consistent problem for more than \ntwo decades, largely because the VA is using a 1945 process in the 21st \ncentury. I sent every Member of this Chamber a copy of this report and \nencourage my colleagues to take a look at it to understand how we got \nto where we are today and what it will take to fix the claims process \npermanently.\n  To put this report's targeted solutions into action, our working \ngroup introduced the 21st Century Veterans Benefit Delivery Act. This \ncomprehensive, bipartisan piece of legislation addresses three areas of \nthe claims process: claims submission, VA regional office practices, \nand Federal agency responses to VA requests.\n  I thank my colleagues--Senators Casey, Moran, Heinrich, Vitter, \nTester, Murkowski, Cardin, Warren, Klobuchar, Warner, Toomey, Thune, \nRoberts, and Pryor--for joining me to address this very critical issue.\n  I recognize because the claims process is complex and there is no \nsilver bullet that is going to solve this problem overnight, the VA's \ncurrent efforts will not eliminate this backlog. It is commonsense, \ntargeted solutions from Congress that will address some of the \ninefficiencies keeping veterans from receiving a timely decision.\n  That is why this bill has been endorsed by a number of veterans \nservice organizations, including the American Legion, Veterans of \nForeign Wars, Disabled American Veterans, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans \nof America, Military Officers Association of America, and the \nAssociation of the United States Navy. I thank these VSOs for their \nsupport and collaborating with the working group to develop solutions \nto fix this problem.\n  Time and again we have asked our men and women in uniform to answer \nthe call of duty, and they do so without hesitation. Ensuring veterans \nreceive disability benefits and quality VA medical care in a timely \nmanner is the least we can do to thank them for their service.\n  As a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, it is my role \nand responsibility to get answers for Nevada's veterans, and I will \nuphold that commitment to oversight.\n  In the coming weeks I will be watching the VA closely for changes and \nimprovements to mitigate the very serious lapse in care and services \nthat have occurred. If the VA continues on the course it is currently \non, then I think it is time to look for changes at the highest level.\n  Again, I thank all of our veterans--including the nearly 300,000 that \ncall Nevada home--for defending this country and for preserving \nAmericans' liberties. Their commitment and sacrifice will not be \nforgotten nor taken for granted.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/22/senate-section/article/S3261-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3261-S3262]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           LETTER TO THE NFL\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I come to the floor this afternoon to \nthank my colleagues who have signed on to a letter to the NFL asking \nthat they change the name of the Washington football team. I also thank \nLeader Reid for his leadership on this issue and for trying to \naccentuate the care and concern he has for 22 tribes in the State of \nNevada and their interest in seeing the dignity and respect of those \ntribes with the name change as well.\n  I also come to the floor and ask my colleagues who have not signed to \nsign on to a letter asking the NFL to take action as aggressively as \nthe NBA took action and to move on this issue. I will be sending a \nletter to each of my colleagues asking them to either sign on to this \nletter or to write their own letter, as one of our colleagues did. I am \nconvinced that if each Member of this body speaks on this issue and is \nforceful in their resolve, we can help initiate change.\n  I know not everybody in America may understand why this is so \nimportant. Having personally worked with 29 tribes in the State of \nWashington, and for a short period of time having served as the chair \nof the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, and having been a Member of \nthat my entire time in the Senate--this may not even be the top issue \nin Indian Country. We certainly have understaffed hospitals, \nchallenging school situations, decaying infrastructure challenges, and \nconcerns about fishing rights--whether they are the challenges that \nocean acidification has to our fishing ability in the Pacific Northwest \nor whether it is in Alaska making sure that Alaska Natives who are on \nsubsistence fishing are able to continue to do what they do.\n  There are many issues in what we refer to as Indian Country that are \nabout the health, safety, and welfare of those individuals. Yet this \nissue is a reminder to all of us that intolerance in our communities is \na problem.\n  We are here to say that we respect these tribal entities that have \nrequested this name change. We are saying that we have a trust \nresponsibility with these organizations and these individual tribes.\n  So when the National Congress of American Indians--an organization \nthat represents millions of Americans with Native American \nbackgrounds--calls for a change, the fact that we ignore that is a \ndisrespect to those tribal entities.\n  There are many organizations across the United States of America who \nhave joined this battle as well: the NAACP, the Anti-Defamation League, \nthe League of United Latin American Citizens, the New York State \nAssembly, the National Congress of American Indians, the DC city \ncouncil, the Prince George's County council. Even the President of the \nUnited States has spoken out on this issue.\n  So what is it going to take to get the name of this team changed? I \nsay to my colleagues that even the Patent Office--the Federal agency \ndetermining whether a word can be protected in commerce--has said this \nterm is derogatory slang and is disparaging to Native Americans.\n  We believe Commissioner Goodell should act; that he needs to do what \nthe NBA did and make sure that one of their owners puts an end to the \nwrong use of a football term and to join the right side of history. We \nare not going to give up this battle.\n  Similarly, like organizations who have a Web site on \nchangethemascot.org--which is a great 2-minute to 3-minute video of why \nNative Americans care so much about this issue--we need to continue to \nrespect the dignity of these individuals, and it is time to update the \nrelationship.\n  Yesterday at the White House there was an unbelievable ceremony, of \nwhich I am of course very proud of--the welcoming of the world champion \nSeahawks football team. They were walking into the White House where \nmany Native Americans from the State of Washington were all decked out \nin Seahawks gear. I don't know if it was protocol for the White House. \nEven though they said nobody was to take pictures, telling a crowd from \nSeattle not to use digital devices is pretty hard to accomplish.\n  But there they were--Native Americans from our State who are partners \nwith the Seattle Seahawks. They are advertising partners. They are \nsuite owners. They advertise and participate together. The logo of the \nSeahawks was designed by a Native American. That is the relationship of \nthe NFL and Native Americans today in the Pacific Northwest. Juxtapose \nthat to here in\n\n[[Page S3262]]\n\nthe Washington, DC, area where many people have spoken out and yet the \nowner remains in opposition of changing a name that has been clear to \nhim is found to be racially offensive to Native Americans.\n\n  So we are here today to ask our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle to join us. Join us because it was hard to unite our side, but I \nknow with a few of their voices we can move this issue further.\n  Why is tolerance so important? In the words of Kofi Annan, the \nSecretary General of the United Nations:\n\n       Tolerance, intercultural dialogue, and respect for \n     diversity are more essential than ever in a world where \n     people are becoming more and more closely interconnected.\n\n  While that is a global view of the challenge we face, we need to \npractice that in reality here. That is why I was so happy we passed the \nViolence Against Women Act with a provision in it making sure that \nwomen in Indian Country would also be protected. We have to ask \nourselves why did it take us so long to get that provision.\n  Even the U.N. Special Envoy on Indigenous Rights for Peoples around \nthe world, James Anaya, also said that the NFL should change, basically \nsaying it is a hurtful reminder and represents a long history of \nmistreatment in the United States of America. He cited the U.N. \nDeclaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples:\n\n       They use stereotypes to obscure the understanding and \n     reality of Native Americans today and instead help to keep \n     alive a racially discriminatory attitude.\n\n  So even the U.N., the world community, is calling on this community \nto deal with this issue and we should act. I hope my colleagues will \nhelp us in this effort to get the NFL to do the right thing.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/22/senate-section/article/S3262-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3262]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           BARRON NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. There has been considerable discussion on the floor \nabout the nominee to the First Circuit, David Barron, that has hinged \naround his tenure in the Office of Legal Counsel and an opinion he \nwrote specifying the outer bounds of Presidential authority in the area \nof defending our national security against Americans who have signed up \nwith organizations that do us harm. I wish briefly to bring to the \nattention of this Chamber that it is not the only issue with respect to \nDavid Barron and the Office of Legal Counsel.\n  The Office of Legal Counsel has indeed had a scandal, and it is \nindeed related to David Barron, but it is related to David Barron in \nthe best possible way, in that he is the one who cleaned up the \nscandal. The scandal in question--the Presiding Officer is a former \nattorney general of her State and she will understand this very \nclearly--the scandal in question related to the shabby opinions that \nwere written by the Office of Legal Counsel to justify the torture \nprogram that was run by the Bush administration. When I say shabby, \nthese were awful opinions. They were hidden from most peer scrutiny \nbecause they would not have stood up to peer scrutiny. They made errors \nas basic as failing to cite Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals decisions \nright on point.\n  There actually had been an incident in which the Department of \nJustice, where the Office of Legal Counsel is located, prosecuted a \nTexas sheriff for waterboarding victims in order to get confessions out \nof them. He was prosecuted as a criminal. He was convicted. The case \nwent to the Fifth Circuit on appeal and in the course of their written \ndecision on appeal, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals of the United \nStates--one row below the U.S. Supreme Court--described the technique \nof water torture that was used, the waterboarding, and on a dozen \nseparate occasions used the word ``torture'' to describe what was being \ndone.\n  Look for that case in the Office of Legal Counsel. Look for that case \nin the opinion of Office of Legal Counsel about whether torture is \naccomplished by waterboarding, whether waterboarding is torture. It is \nnot there. They didn't even cite the case. It was a case they could \nhave found in their own files because the Department of Justice was the \norganization that had prosecuted this sheriff as a criminal for that \nact.\n  If you wanted to bring it up as a case and try to find a way to \ndistinguish it, I could accept that. I probably would disagree with \nthat analysis, but the failure to even cite the case, knowing how \ndifficult it would be for the torture program to go forward, I think is \na sign of either the worst kind of incompetence or a deliberate fix \nbeing put into the opinion of the Office of Legal Counsel.\n  Having served as a U.S. attorney as well, I think the Department of \nJustice should have the best lawyers in the country, and within the \nDepartment of Justice the OLC prides itself on being the best of the \nbest. It was a disgraceful departure of that standard when the torture \nopinions were allowed to pass. They simply don't meet any reasonable \ntest of adequacy. So on April 15, 2009, the Department of Justice \nwithdrew the Office of Legal Counsel's CIA interrogation opinions. The \nmemorandum for the Attorney General effecting that withdrawal was \nsigned by none other than David Barron. This was the instance of a man \nwho absolutely did the right thing. He helped clean up a terrible mess \nthat had been left at the Department of Justice. We should be proud of \nthe conduct of David Barron at the Office of Legal Counsel.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the 1-page memorandum for the Attorney \nGeneral signed by David Barron be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Withdrawal of Office of Legal Counsel CIA Interrogation Opinions\n\n       Four previous opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel \n     concerning interrogations by the Central Intelligence Agency \n     are withdrawn and no longer represent the views of the \n     Office.\n                                                   April 15, 2009.\n\n\n                  MEMORANDUM FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL\n\n       Sections 3(a) and 3(b) of Executive Order 13491 (2009) set \n     forth restrictions on the use of interrogation methods. In \n     section 3(c) of that Order, the President further directed \n     that ``unless the Attorney General with appropriate \n     consultation provides further guidance, officers, employees, \n     and other agents of the United States Government may not, in \n     conducting interrogations, rely upon any interpretation of \n     the law governing interrogation . . . issued by the \n     Department of Justice between September 11, 2001, and January \n     20, 2009.''

Thank you, Madam President.\n  I am here on the floor today to talk about an issue that has received \na tremendous amount of attention, and\n\n[[Page S3263]]\n\nrightfully so, in the last few weeks and it is the outrage of what is \nhappening at the Veterans' Administration.\n  Let me start by saying certainly people need to be held accountable. \nThis should not be and it surely is not a partisan issue. I think we \nall have a deep commitment to helping our veterans, the men and women \nwho spend time away from their families and put their lives on the line \nto defend this country, to whom were made promises that when they come \nback home they will be taken care of, especially those who have been \nharmed when serving their country.\n  We are heartbroken and outraged at the news that, in fact, the agency \nthat is supposed to take care of them is not doing so. I think what is \neven more troubling is that this appears to be a systemic problem. This \nis not simply an isolated incident in Phoenix or some other institution \nin the country. This is now rearing its ugly head in every part of this \ncountry that we look into. You can imagine not just as an American am I \ndeeply concerned about this but as a Floridian. Florida is a State with \nan enormous veterans population, including my brother--men and women \nwho have served our country and have done so with great courage and \ndignity who now have health care needs that require immediate and \nurgent attention.\n  Just a moment ago on a television interview it was brought to my \nattention the story of a young man, a gulf war veteran who has a brain \ninjury, who has been waiting for weeks to even be able to see anyone, \nin fact has been waiting for months with no end in sight as to when \nthat is going to end. This needs to be addressed.\n  Yesterday we all watched with great attention as the President \naddressed this issue and expressed outrage, rightfully so, of what is \noccurring. What the President said is that over the next week there \nwill be an initial report and ultimately a report at the end of the \nmonth about what needs to be done to improve the system and, more \nimportantly, who needs to be held accountable. I think that is critical \nhere, because one of the things we are learning is not simply that \nthere is a systemic problem in the Veterans' Administration, but that \nthere has been a deliberate effort by some within the Veterans' \nAdministration to cover it up or to make things look better than they \nactually are. That should trouble us even more because the immediate \nreaction when an agency is confronted with a problem should be ``we \nneed to fix this'' and instead the reaction by some seems to be ``we \nneed to cover this. We need to make this look better than it really is. \nWe need to diminish this.''\n  This is completely unacceptable and people need to be held \naccountable for this. If in the Senate among the men and women who \nserve and work here for us some were derelict in their duties, they \nwould lose their job. If in the private sector someone did not do their \njob, they would lose that job. In the military chain of command, if a \ncommanding officer of a unit did not do his or her job, they would lose \ntheir job, and their superiors would have the ability to immediately \ndiscipline them.\n  So I think many Americans would be shocked to learn that even if the \nSecretary wanted today to fire executive managers within the agency, he \ncannot. Instead, he has to institute a long and drawn-out process, \nleading to this absurd conclusion that you are more likely to receive a \nbonus or promotion than you are to have been fired because of \nmismanagement and dereliction of duty. That is completely unacceptable.\n  We have to remember that the vast majority of the VA's more than \n300,000 employees and executives are dedicated and hard-working people. \nTheir Department's well-documented reluctance to ensure that leaders \nare being held accountable for mistakes is not only tarnishing its \nreputation, it unfortunately is impacting many of these hard-working \nmen and women who are doing their jobs within the agency.\n  What I did a few weeks ago, in conjunction with my colleague from \nFlorida, Jeff Miller, is file a bill. It is a very simple and \nstraightforward bill. The bill states that the VA Management \nAccountability Act of 2014 would simply give the VA Secretary the power \nto fire or demote senior executive service employees based on their \nperformance. It is a power similar to the power the Secretary of \nDefense already has, for example, to remove military general officers \nfrom command, and, of course, it is the same power any one of our 100 \nSenators has to remove a member of their staff.\n\n  This bill passed yesterday in the House of Representatives, and it is \nsitting here on the desk in the Senate. It passed yesterday with an \noverwhelming bipartisan majority of Members of both parties who are \noutraged by what is occurring and want to bring accountability.\n  In a press conference yesterday, the White House indicated that they \nare very open to this concept and that they were interacting with \nleaders on it. We called the White House and asked them about it. They \nalso indicated an openness to it, although they shared that they did \nhave some concerns. They didn't make any suggested edits to the bill. \nThey simply said they had some concerns, but in general they were \nsupportive of this concept.\n  Earlier today during an Appropriations Committee meeting, Senator \nMoran offered this very bill as an amendment, and it was adopted by \nvoice vote without a single objection.\n  Here is where we stand: I have come to the floor today to give my \ncolleagues the opportunity to send this to the President before we \nleave for the Memorial Day recess. We have an opportunity right now to \ntake up the bill that the House just passed by an overwhelming \nbipartisan majority, enact it into law by unanimous consent, and send \nit to the President so he can sign it. So when the results of that \ninvestigation come to his desk in a week or month from now, and that of \nthe Secretary, they can discipline and/or fire the people who have not \ndone their jobs and put our veterans in harm's way with regard to \nservices the VA is supposed to offer. That is all this bill does--\nnothing more and nothing less.\n  We are giving the Secretary--appointed by this President and \nconfirmed by this Senate--the opportunity to be able to fire employees \nof his agency who are not doing their jobs. That is all we are asking \nfor. It is not more complicated than that. I do not understand why \nanyone would not support that concept.\n  It is right here for us. To everyone around here who is talking about \nhow we need to quickly act, here is your chance. This is a very \nstraightforward bill. My hope is that it will pass unanimously so we \ncan truly say it is bipartisan.\n  We are not telling them whom they need to fire; we are giving the \nSecretary the power to hold the people who work under him accountable. \nThis will also apply to future Secretaries as well. That is all this \nbill does. I hope we will be able to do that today.\n  I think if it were put to a rollcall vote on the floor, it would pass \nby an overwhelming majority. That is why, Madam President, I ask \nunanimous consent the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of \nH.R. 4031, which was received from the House, and I further ask consent \nthat the bill be read a third time and passed and that the motion to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, without any \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SANDERS. Reserving the right to object, Madam President, I thank \nSenator Rubio for his remarks, and I think many of us share the exact \nsame concerns he has raised. When men and women put their lives on the \nline to defend our country, they are entitled to the best quality \nhealth care we can provide to them.\n  In my view and I think in the view of virtually every veterans \norganization, the VA does provide good-quality health care to those \npeople who access the VA system, but there are very serious problems in \nterms of access, there are serious problems regarding waiting lists, \nthere are serious problems regarding the possibility of hospitals \nkeeping two sets of books, and we are going to get to the root of those \nissues.\n  The one thing we do not want to do is politicize the well-being of \nAmerica's heroes.\n  I have a quote from an editorial in the Washington Post:\n\n       The men and women who have served their country in uniform \n     deserve better than delay or denial of the medical care they \n     need and have earned. So it is crucial to get to the bottom \n     of allegations of misconduct at the\n\n[[Page S3264]]\n\n     nation's veterans hospitals. America's veterans also deserve \n     not to be treated as so many pawns in election-years \n     gamesmanship--but that sadly is proving to be the case in \n     Congress's increasingly hyperbolic response.\n\n  It goes on:\n\n       That the extent of wrongdoing is unclear doesn't seem to \n     matter much to those more interested in scoring political \n     points. How else to explain the knee-jerk calls, mainly by \n     Republicans in the House and Senate, for the ouster of \n     Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric K. Shinseki or the ill-\n     advised and punitive legislation aimed at VA workers?\n\n  I will just make this point: I happen to think the bill that was \npassed in the House yesterday has many important provisions with which \nI happen to agree. But as the Senator from Florida knows, we have not \nheld a hearing on this legislation, and some of us are old-fashioned \nenough to know that maybe folks in the Senate might want to know what \nis in the bill before we vote on it.\n  The Senator from Florida is right--it passed with very strong support \nin the House. In my view, a similar bill containing some of the salient \nprovisions in the House bill will pass the Senate, but it is important \nthat we discuss that bill.\n  One of the concerns I have is that I do not want to see the VA \npoliticized. It is one thing to say--which I agree with--that if a \nhospital administrator is incompetent, the Secretary should be able to \nget rid of that administrator without a whole lot of paperwork. I agree \nwith that. It is another thing to say that if a new administration \ncomes in--whether it is Democratic or Republican--somebody sitting in \nthe Secretary's office can say: I want to get rid of 20 or 30 or 50 \nhospital administrators because we have other people we want in there. \nWe can just get rid of them, and they don't have a right to defend \nthemselves.\n  I worry about that.\n  Clearly we have to discuss the issue. I suggest that the Senator from \nFlorida understands that it is probably a good idea to discuss an issue \nbefore we vote on it.\n  The bottom line for me is, yes, every top administrator at the VA has \nto be held accountable. I do not want to see an enormous amount of \npaperwork and obstruction go forward before we can get rid of \nincompetent people. But before we vote on legislation, it might be a \ngood idea to understand the full implications of that legislation, and \nthere are some aspects of it with which I think some of us have \nconcerns.\n  I have a few more points on that issue. I hope the Senator from \nFlorida agrees with me that we have to be certain the VA is able to \nrecruit and retain high-quality leaders and managers, especially when \nthe VA is in competition with other Federal agencies for those leaders. \nTo that end it is vital to ensure we are fostering an environment at \nthe VA where individuals feel as if they are protected from the \npolitical whims of their leaders. That is the point I made earlier.\n  There are other areas that concern me in terms of setting precedents \nthat may not be a good idea, but the bottom line is I think there are \nimportant provisions in the bill that passed the House. I want to work \nwith Senator Rubio on this matter, and I think the administration wants \nto work with him.\n  If I might, I will make another point, which is that I was very happy \nto see so much concern being paid to veterans' needs over the last few \nweeks. As chairman of the committee, I am very happy to see that.\n  I say to the Senator from Florida and others that he is well aware \nthat the veterans community faces many serious problems above and \nbeyond what we have been hearing over the last few weeks with regard to \nthe VA. We have 200,000 men and women who have come back from Iraq and \nAfghanistan either with PTSD or TBI. I would assume my friend from \nFlorida agrees they need to get the quality care they deserve.\n  An hour or so ago I had the privilege of being honored by the Gold \nStar Wives. They are the widows of men who died in action. I brought \nlegislation to the floor that would have made it possible for Gold Star \nWives to be able to get a college education under the post-9/11 GI \nbill. That bill received 56 votes. One Senator was absent; otherwise, \nwe would have had 57 votes. Only two Republicans supported that bill. I \nsuspect that Senator Rubio and many others support that. That is in the \nbill I brought to the floor.\n  Right now we have--as I am sure Senator Rubio knows because the \nproblem exists in Vermont, so it most likely exists in Florida as \nwell--70-year-old women, in most cases, who are taking care of disabled \nvets, and they don't get the support they need. They are on duty 24/7, \nand they save the government money because those wounded veterans are \nstaying at home. They need some help. I want to see them get help, and \nI hope Senator Rubio will work with me to make sure they get that help.\n  Senator Rubio is aware, as is the Presiding Officer, that there is \ngreat concern not only in the military--the VA and DOD--but in the \ncivilian sector that there is too much use of opiates to treat \nproblems. We have a very serious problem in that area. We have language \nin our overall provision that extends help to the VA to move forward to \ngive our veterans alternative treatments other than opiates, and we \nthink that is a very important piece of legislation.\n  We have legislation which has passed which provides 5 years of free \nhealth care in the VA for those who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. We \nthink it is important to extend that to 10 years.\n  Many veterans out there do not have access to decent-quality dental \ncare. It is a problem in Vermont, and I suspect it is a problem in \nFlorida. We want veterans to get that care as well. There is bipartisan \nsupport for advanced appropriations for VA, and we have that in our \nlegislation.\n  While the VA is making good progress in cutting back the backlog and \nmoving from paper to a digital system, I want to see them do better. We \nhave language in there that would push them to do better.\n  Just this morning, Senator Burr and I were at a hearing that dealt \nwith the educational problems facing veterans who come back from the \nbattlefield. There are problems when they go to college. Most of us \nthink veterans should be able to take advantage of instate tuition in \nthe State in which they are living.\n  Sexual assault has been a very serious problem in the military, and \nwe want the VA to do better. Et cetera, et cetera.\n  I thank Senator Heller and Senator Moran for voting for this bill, \nalong with every Democrat. I am very glad my Republican colleagues are \nnow beginning to focus on veterans issues, and we need to step to the \nplate to help not only our veterans but their families, and that is the \nlegislation I have offered.\n  I say to Senator Rubio through the Chair that your legislation has \nmany important provisions with which I happen to agree. There are some \nthat I think need work, and we are going to hold a hearing on that \nlegislation and other legislation in early June.\n  I respectfully object to that legislation right now, but I ask \nunanimous consent that the Senate proceed to Calendar No. 297, S. 1950, \nwith the Sanders amendment, which is at the desk and is the text of S. \n1982, the Comprehensive Veterans Health and Benefits Military \nRetirement Pay Restoration Act. That is the comprehensive legislation \nsupported by virtually every veterans organization in the country, \nmillions of veterans, and the American people. It says ``thank you'' to \nthe veterans who put their lives on the line to defend this country, \nand we are going to be there for you.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this legislation be passed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard to the request from the \nSenator from Florida.\n  Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Reserving the right to object, I wish to address a couple \nof points. The first is on the issue of politicizing this. I agree. In \nfact, that is why I have not come forward and said that the Secretary \nshould resign. There are times in this process when that is important. \nThere are people who were appointed by the President who are clearly \nnot doing their jobs, and it is our job as overseers of the executive \nbranch of the government to step forward and say that.\n  I have said let's give the Secretary a chance to see what happens \nhere. I may end up asking for his resignation at some point as more \ninformation comes out, but at a minimum I think he deserves an \nopportunity--and his successors, whoever they may be--to hold the\n\n[[Page S3265]]\n\npeople underneath him accountable. They don't have the power to do that \nnow.\n\n  Also notice when I came to the floor today, I have said absolutely \nnothing of a partisan nature. I am not claiming this is a crisis \ncreated by Democrats or by another party. On the contrary, I said this \nis a solution that has had strong bipartisan support in the House and \nstrong bipartisan support in the committee today. This issue may become \npoliticized in the sense that it seems all of the reluctance to move \nforward is coming from one side of the equation, but that does not \nnecessarily have to be. In fact, I will tell my colleagues right now \nthat I believe if this came to a vote, the overwhelming majority of the \nMembers of the majority would support this legislation I have put \nforward today.\n  Two other points that were raised, one being that there have been no \nhearings. I would respectfully disagree. There was a hearing on it \ntoday. This was offered. This specific language was offered in the \ncommittee, and with little debate and no dissent, it passed by voice \nvote. For those watching at home, here is what voice vote means: They \ndon't even call the roll. They basically ask Members: Is anyone against \nthis? No one said they were. This language was adopted today in a \ncommittee.\n  Here is my second problem. I am glad to hear there are going to be \nhearings with regard to this issue, and I think that is important \nbecause I am not claiming the bill I am asking us to take up today and \npass would solve all of the problems. There are still serious systemic \nproblems within that agency, and a hearing needs to address this and \nfind responsible solutions to those problems. So a hearing is called \nfor.\n  What I am asking for is very simple: Give the Secretary, appointed by \na President of a party different than my own, the power to fire \nemployees underneath him who are not doing their jobs, so they know \nthey are being held accountable. That is all I am asking. That is all \nthis bill does. It is that straightforward. I don't think any of us \nwant to go home for the Memorial Day recess and when we are asked: What \nare you doing on this issue, our answer is: Well, in about 15 days we \nare going to have a hearing on this crisis.\n  Meanwhile, the list goes on and on of the outrages that are coming \nout of this agency. Every single day more cases are coming out about \nveterans who are not being treated fairly and appropriately, and in \nsome cases, in my opinion, criminally, by this incompetence we see out \nof some in the Veterans' Administration. This is a matter of urgency, \nbecause while we are gone on our recess, the President next week is \ngoing to get a preliminary report on what is going on. It may very well \nbe that he wants to see some people fired, and it may very well be the \nSecretary will want to fire some people in senior executive positions \nand he will not be able to do that. All I am asking for is not to give \nus the power to fire them but to give the administration the power to \nfire them and hold them accountable.\n  Regarding the bill the chairman has offered on the floor, this bill \nhas already been debated, and there are problems with this bill, which \nis an extensive piece of legislation with many good elements in it, but \nit also has a cost issue at a time when our Nation owes close to $18 \ntrillion. That was the reason so many on my side of the aisle objected \nto it, and that is why I object to the motion made today by the Senator \nfrom Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, let me reiterate. When I quoted the \nWashington Post and when I talked about politicalization, I wasn't \nsuggesting the Senator from Florida was being political on the floor \ntoday. What I was suggesting about politicizing the VA is if we have a \nsituation, for example, where a new Secretary comes in or a new \nadministration comes in and can fire wholesale hospital administrators, \nwithout the ability to defend themselves, I think that is not the kind \nof system the Senator from Florida would want or certainly I would \nwant.\n  So how we address this issue is important. I would suspect that while \nthis issue may have been taken up in committee today, I doubt very much \nthere were any witnesses who testified about this bill.\n  Second of all, I found it interesting that the Senator from Florida \nsaid--and he is right that other Republicans have raised this point. \nThe legislation I introduced, which again has the support of the \nAmerican Legion, DAV, Vietnam Vets, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Iraq-\nAfghanistan Veterans of America, Paralyzed Veterans of America--he is \nright--it costs money. He is right. This country has a deficit. He \nwould be right if he said that going to war in Iraq and Afghanistan has \ncost us trillions of dollars, which is one of the reasons we have the \ndeficit we have. But I believe from the bottom of my heart that if we \ngo to war, if we spend trillions of dollars on that war, that when our \nmen and women come home from war, some wounded in body, some wounded in \nspirit--I don't want to hear people telling me it is too expensive to \ntake care of those wounded veterans. I don't accept that. If we think \nit is too expensive to take care of veterans, don't send them to war.\n\n  So let me reiterate my view, as the Senator from Florida has raised \nan important issue. We are going to address it as quickly as we can, \nand we are going to address other issues facing our veterans who on \nthis Memorial Day need to know we are there for them and their \nfamilies.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 1:40 \nis reserved for the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Not seeing the Senator from Kentucky, I ask for 1 minute \nof that time to make the following point----\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, who has control of the time right now? \nDo I have the time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senate is controlled by the \nSenator from Kentucky or his designee.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, let me suggest to the Senator from \nFlorida that we divide the remaining time, if he wishes to take a \nminute or two and I will take a minute or two; how is that?\n  Mr. RUBIO. That is fine with me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, a bunch of issues were raised about the \ncost of the war in Iraq, how much money we spent, and how good we are \nat spending that money for the veterans. I think that is a valid debate \nand it is a debate we should have and should continue to have in this \ncountry. If we need to spend more money on these agencies, there are \nplenty of other places in the budget to find it, and we should work to \nmake sure cost is not an issue.\n  But right now the central debate on the issue of what is happening in \nthe VA has not centered around the fact that there are costs getting in \nthe way. The central debate--and my colleagues know the President \nyesterday, in his press conference he held, said the central focus is \non the management, the operations of this agency. Critical to the \neffectiveness of any agency is accountability; the ability to hold \npeople accountable, including by taking away their jobs.\n  Think about this for a moment. The argument that has been made today \nabout a new director can come in and fire the people who work \nunderneath him or her, that argument could be made about virtually any \norganization on the planet. One could make that argument for staffers \nin the Senate, that we want to protect them, so if a new Senator is \nelected from a State, they can't hire their own staff.\n  The point I am trying to make--this is very simple. I get there are a \nlot of other issues we can talk about. There is one issue I want us to \nfocus on, and that is this: We have a chance today, before we leave for \nthe Memorial Day recess, to pass a bill that gives the Secretary that \nPresident Obama appointed the power to fire executives underneath him \nif they haven't done their job--a power he doesn't have right now. We \nhave the chance to pass it on the floor. All we have to do is agree to \nit and it goes to the President to sign. We can then go home and say we \nhave taken an important step in instituting accountability on this \nimportant issue, which the whole country is talking about, and we are \nwalking away from that opportunity.\n\n[[Page S3266]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. We are not going to walk away from anything, but we are \ngoing to do it right. Again, the argument that when you run a health \ncare system which has 151 medical centers, has some 900 community-based \noutreach clinics, has 300,000 employees that a new President can start \nwiping out, without necessarily giving people the right to defend \nthemselves, does not make any sense to me.\n  So we are going to look at the positive provisions in Senator Rubio's \nbill, and I think there are some. I would say to the Senator from \nFlorida, I think we are going to reach an agreement. I think the \nSenator from Florida is going to be happy. I think it will be a good \nbill and we will reach consensus around it and I think we have to do \nthat.\n  On the other hand, I wish to reiterate the point I made about money. \nSenator Rubio is right, that one of the reasons we only had two \nRepublican votes for a comprehensive piece of legislation that \naddresses the issues that the veterans communities brought to us--it is \nnot a Bernie Sanders bill, it is a bill that listened to the needs of \nveterans and we said we hear you.\n  Once again, I would just say to the Senator from Florida, I don't \nthink--I was just literally an hour ago at a function of the Gold Star \nWives organization. These are women who have lost their husbands in \nbattle. I think that under the post-9/11 GI bill, a very good and \nimportant piece of legislation, wives should have the right to use that \nlegislation to go to college, get an education, so they can get better \njobs. If I brought that bill to the floor today, I suspect I would have \nunanimous support, and I think that out of our committee the bill I \nbrought forth, many provisions had unanimous support and many \nprovisions were Republican provisions--good provisions, bipartisan \nprovisions.\n  So what I say to my friend from Florida is thank you. The Senator's \nbill is an important bill and it is going to be dealt with and it will \nbe dealt with in the very near future.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I support the nomination of David \nBarron to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.\n  There is no question that David Barron has the background and \nqualifications for this position.\n  Consider his credentials: over a decade as a Harvard law professor; 3 \nyears at the Office of Legal Counsel, OLC, in the Clinton \nadministration, and another 2 years at OLC under President Obama as the \nActing Assistant Attorney General in charge of that office--during \nwhich time he was awarded the Office of the Secretary of Defense Medal \nfor Exceptional Public Service and the National Intelligence \nExceptional Achievement Medal from the Office of the Director of \nNational Intelligence; he clerked for Justice John Paul Stevens and \nNinth Circuit Judge Stephen Reinhardt; he earned his bachelor's and law \ndegrees from Harvard; and a substantial majority of the ABA Committee \nfound him to be ``well qualified,'' their highest rating.\n  In sum, David Barron's record shows that he will be a jurist of the \nhighest caliber.\n  He also has a strong record of standing up for what is right on many \nissues, whether it is campaign finance or gay rights.\n  Many distinguished individuals in both parties have written to the \nJudiciary Committee to support Professor Barron. Among them are: Jack \nGoldsmith, a Harvard Law professor and former head of OLC under \nPresident George W. Bush, Michael McConnell, conservative law professor \nand former Tenth Circuit judge, who described Barron as ``one of \nPresident Obama's two or three best nominations to the appellate \ncourts;'' Charles Fried, law professor and former Solicitor General \nunder President Reagan; 15 former career attorneys at OLC who served in \nadministrations of both parties; and Ron George, former chief justice \nof California and someone I deeply respect.\n  Chief Justice George wrote:\n\n       As a person who served for 38 years in a state court \n     system, the last 14 years as chief justice of California, I \n     have been particularly impressed by Mr. Barron's \n     understanding and respect for the critical role played by the \n     states and their courts in our federal system.\n\n  I respected the strong desire of some of my colleagues to have access \nto the two OLC memos related to the targeted killing of an American \nnamed Anwar al-Awlaki. Those memos were authored while Barron was \nActing Assistant Attorney General at OLC.\n  However, I regret that even though the administration made those two \nopinions available to all Senators and even though the administration \nhas recently decided to make the OLC analysis public, some still insist \non delaying a vote on Professor Barron's nomination.\n  Let's contrast David Barron's nomination with that of another former \nhead of the Office of Legal Counsel, Jay Bybee, who led the office from \n2001 to 2003.\n  He was in charge of OLC when it produced an opinion saying \nwaterboarding and nine other so-called enhanced interrogation \ntechniques were not torture. On August 1, 2002, Mr. Bybee signed an \nopinion that set an unconscionably high bar for torture by saying that \n``physical pain amounting to torture must be equivalent in intensity to \nthe pain accompanying serious physical injury, such as organ failure, \nimpairment of bodily function, or even death.'' That opinion was \nwithdrawn during the Bush administration by Bybee's successor, Harvard \nLaw Professor Jack Goldsmith.\n  Under Bybee, OLC also produced opinions about President Bush's \nTerrorist Surveillance Program that contain very troubling legal \nanalysis. Because those opinions remain classified, I will not describe \nthem here other than to note that they authorized a secret surveillance \nprogram that involved the collection of the content of communications \nwithout a court order and was in clear violation of the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act. Those OLC opinions also were withdrawn \nby Bybee's successor, Professor Goldsmith.\n  Despite the fact that those opinions were produced when he was head \nof OLC, Jay Bybee was nominated by the Bush administration to a Nevada \nseat on the Ninth Circuit. He was confirmed 74 to 19 in March 2003. I \nwas one of 19 voting no.\n  Why would we confirm the man who approved the so-called ``torture \nmemos'' and led OLC when it approved President Bush's surveillance \nprogram but delay David Barron, who produced superior legal work as \nhead of OLC? The only reason I have heard is that Senators may believe \nthat the two OLC opinions on Anwar al-Awlaki should be made public. Let \nme address that.\n  First, this week the Department of Justice took steps to ensure that \nthe OLC analysis will be made public. The Justice Department has \ndecided not to appeal a court order from the Second Circuit Court of \nAppeals requiring the OLC analysis to be made public. So this will \nhappen in the near future.\n  Second, Professor Barron left OLC in 2010--well before the strike \nkilled Awlaki in Yemen in September 2011. Since 2010, Professor Barron \nhas been in academia.\n  It wasn't Barron's decision to withhold the OLC memos from Congress \nor from the public.\n  Let me quote from Professors Laurence Tribe and Charles Fried, both \nlegal experts often on opposite sides of issues. They wrote an op-ed \ntogether about Barron in the Boston Globe. It reads, in part:\n\n       [Barron] has not advocated, much less ordered, the \n     withholding of any documents. His job as acting head of the \n     Office of Legal Counsel was to provide thorough, accurate, \n     and unvarnished legal opinions to the president and other \n     executive officials, based on the traditional legal \n     authorities of text, history, and precedent. We have every \n     reason to believe that is precisely what he did, and there is \n     absolutely no evidence to the contrary.\n\n  In fact, Professor Barron implemented policies that have made OLC \nmore rigorous, professional, and transparent.\n  First, when he was acting head of OLC, Barron ordered the withdrawal \nof several opinions related to coercive interrogation that had been \nissued during the Bush administration.\n  Second, on July 16, 2010, Professor Barron wrote a memo entitled \n``Re: Best Practices for OLC Legal Advice and Written Opinions'' that \nupdated previous OLC guidance. It said that OLC ``operates from the \npresumption that it should make its significant\n\n[[Page S3267]]\n\nopinions fully and promptly available to the public. This presumption \nfurthers the interests of Executive Branch transparency, thereby \ncontributing to accountability and effective government, and promoting \npublic confidence in the legality of government action.'' This \npresumption did not exist in the Bush administration; David Barron was \nresponsible for establishing it as OLC policy. Given Barron's \nimpressive record and his shift of OLC toward more transparency, it \nsimply is wrong to oppose his nomination because a classified OLC \nopinion on drone strikes has not been made public yet, a decision that \nwas not even his to make.\n  Since the OLC opinions on Anwar al-Awlaki that Professor Barron wrote \nseem to have become the issue holding up this nomination, let me close \nwith a reminder of the specific plotting Awlaki was involved in before \nhe was killed in 2011.\n  True, Awlaki was a dual U.S.-Yemeni citizen, but he served as chief \nof external operations for Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, AQAP. In \nthat position, he planned and directed attacks against the United \nStates, making him an imminent and continuing threat.\n  Awlaki played a significant operational role in AQAP. In 2010, the \nUnited States designated Awlaki a ``Specially Designated Global \nTerrorist'' for ``supporting acts of terrorism and for acting for or on \nbehalf of AQAP.''\n  Awlaki publicly urged attacks against U.S. persons and interests \nworldwide. He worked with another American named Samir Khan to publish \nAQAP's Inspire Magazine to encourage terrorist attacks against innocent \nmen, women, and children in the United States and elsewhere. As a \nreminder, Inspire Magazine provided the Tsarnaev brothers in Boston \nwith the instructions for making the bomb they used at the Boston \nMarathon last year.\n  Let me offer just a few examples of Awlaki's direct involvement in \nterrorist operations:\n  Christmas Day Attack--In December 2009, Awlaki directed operative \nUmar Faruk Abdulmutallab, who attempted to detonate an explosive device \naboard a Northwest Airlines flight to Detroit on Christmas Day. Awlaki \ninstructed Abdulmutallab to detonate the device while over U.S. \nairspace to maximize casualties.\n  Fort Hood Attack--Fort Hood shooter Nidal Hasan attended al-Awlaki's \nsermons in Virginia and corresponded at least 18 times with him through \nemail. After the attack, Awlaki posted on his blog praising Hasan's \nactions and calling him his ``student and brother.''\n  Times Square Bombing Attempt--Faisal Shahzad, who pleaded guilty to \nthe 2010 Times Square car bombing attempt, told interrogators in early \n2010 that he was ``inspired by'' Awlaki and communicated with him.\n  Package Bomb Plot--in October 2010, Awlaki had a direct role in \nsupervising and directing AQAP's failed attempt to bring down two U.S. \ncargo aircraft by detonating explosives concealed inside two packages \nmailed to Chicago-area synagogues.\n  In sum, there is no doubt that Awlaki was chief of external \noperations for Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, AQAP, and a \ncontinuing and imminent threat to the United States.\n  David Barron's legal analysis of whether the United States can target \nAwlaki is cogent, careful legal analysis and reflects the kind of \nconsideration of due process that we should applaud, not punish.\n  Barron certainly should not be disqualified because he was the head \nof OLC when that targeting decision--a targeting decision Barron did \nnot advocate for--was being contemplated and analyzed by the Obama \nadministration.\n  Let me conclude by saying this: David Barron is an impressive lawyer \nand scholar with a strong record. Nobody doubts that. Distinguished \nlawyers on both sides of the aisle have endorsed him wholeheartedly.\n  The reason for this is simple: His qualifications are first rate, and \nhe has under his belt many years of commendable scholarship and service \nto this nation.\n  Simply put, he will be an outstanding jurist for the people of the \nFirst Circuit, and I very much hope my colleagues will support him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/22/senate-section/article/S3267-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3267-S3272]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        WRRDA CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n\n                          Ecosystem Resiliency\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I am joined by the chair and ranking \nmember of the Environment and Public Works Committee to discuss a \nprovision of the Water Resources Reform and Development Act conference \nreport, which we will vote on shortly in the Senate. I thank them for \ntheir leadership on this important legislation, and rise with them \ntoday to discuss one of its provisions.\n  Section 4014 of the conference report, Ocean and Coastal Resiliency, \ncreates a new Army Corps authority to address ocean and coastal \necosystem resiliency.\n  Subject to appropriations, this authority requires the Army Corps of \nEngineers to work with the heads of other Federal agencies, like the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Fish and \nWildlife Service, State governors and other State officials, and \nnonprofit organizations, to conduct a study identifying projects in \ncoastal zones to enhance ocean and coastal ecosystem resiliency. State \nand local leaders often have the best information about the changing \nconditions of their oceans and coastal zones, and participation by them \nin the Army Corps' study process is intended to ensure the most \neffective resiliency projects are identified in the study.\n  In Rhode Island there are numerous entities, from our Coastal Zone \nManagement Agency to our National Estuary Program, the University of \nRhode Island, and Save the Bay that would bring important information \nand expertise to the process for identifying coastal resiliency \nprojects in Rhode Island. In other States I know there will be similar \ninterest.\n  Subject to appropriations, the study and project list will be updated \nevery 5 years, to ensure that best available science and policies are \ninforming project identification and selection.\n  When funding is provided for this program through the appropriations \nprocess, the Army Corps may carry out identified projects in accordance \nwith the criteria for existing Corps Continuing Authority Program \nauthorities.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank Senator Whitehouse. As chair of the conference \ncommittee for WRRDA, a committee on which the Senator from Rhode Island \nand Senator Vitter also served, I agree with the Senator's \nunderstanding of section 4014. Like Rhode Island, California also has \nstrong leadership on coastal and oceans issues and will benefit from \nincreased collaboration with the Corps of Engineers on coastal and \nocean resiliency issues.\n  Mr. VITTER. I share Chairman Boxer's and Senator Whitehouse's \nunderstanding of section 4014, and will address subsection (d) of that \nprovision, ``Request for Projects.'' Subsection (d) is an important \nprovision because it requires approval by the governor or chief \nexecutive officer of a State before the Corps can carry out any project \nidentified under this section.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. The conference committee's deliberations were \ninformed by a legal analysis prepared by the Corps of Engineers Counsel \nregarding the interpretation of Section 4014.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the legal analysis prepared by Scott \nMurphy, Senior Counsel for Project Agreements and Reports in the Office \nof the Chief Counsel of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Headquarters, \nwhich describes how the Corps would implement this provision, be \nprinted in the Record at the end of this colloquy.\n  The legal analysis, dated May 8, 2014, states that Section 4014 \nauthorizes ``an independent coastal zone resiliency study and follow-on \nconstruction authority for projects to the extent they satisfy criteria \nfor projects carried out under four named CAP authorities.'' In other \nwords, Section 4014 relies on the terms and conditions of four \npreexisting authorities but it is not limited by the authorized levels \nin those authorities.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The Army Corps was clear that when a project is \nidentified in the study associated with Section 4014, it may be carried \nout in accordance with the criteria for one of the four existing CAPs \nreferenced in the section, but it will be not funded through or \nauthorized by those CAP authorities. Section 4014 provides its\n\n[[Page S3268]]\n\nown funding authorization, and accordingly any project authorized by \nSection 4014 would be funded by appropriations for that authority.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I thank the chairman. I look forward to supporting \nthis program in the future and during the appropriations process.\n  Resiliency is important in our estuaries, bays, and barrier islands, \nbecause we cannot just restore things the way they were and expect to \nreap the benefits. These systems are changing too much. Resiliency \nrequires planning for future threats from extreme weather, from rising \nsea levels and warming temperatures, from development pressure, and \nfrom pollution. Coastal ecosystems act as filters, improving water \nquality so we can swim and fish off our docks; they act as barriers \nprotecting property and lives from storms and storm surges; and they \nprovide habitat for commercially valuable fish, shellfish, and other \nwildlife.\n  Coastal ecosystems support coastal economies, and I will continue \nlooking for avenues to support restoration and research in this area.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                      Legal Analysis--May 8, 2014\n\n       I've looked at the language and agree that it authorizes an \n     independent coastal zone resiliency study and follow-on \n     construction authority for projects to the extent they \n     satisfy criteria for projects carried out under four named \n     CAP authorities. Like other free standing study and \n     construction authorities, I'd expect us to carry projects \n     following the study to the extent they were separately \n     funded. In other words, to the extent the language cites to \n     CAP authorities, I would read that language as requiring \n     merely that we apply the same rules for those projects for \n     purposes of implementing projects (requiring agreement, cost \n     sharing, etc.) following this study, but not as an actual \n     direct expansion of those particular CAP program authorities \n     themselves that might thereby subject our implementation of \n     coastal zone resiliency projects after the study somehow \n     subject to the Corps discretionary use of its overall CAP \n     funding.\n     N. Scott Murphy,\n       Senior Counsel for Project Agreements and Reports Office of \n     the Chief Counsel Headquarters, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\n\n\n                      port and harbor maintenance\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I am joined by the ranking member of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee to discuss a provision of the \nWater Resources Reform and Development Act conference report, which we \nwill vote on shortly in the Senate.\n  Title II, subtitle B includes a number of important provisions \nrelated to port and harbor maintenance. In addition to setting annual \nspending goals for funds from the harbor maintenance trust fund, HMTF, \nand providing a set-aside for spending on emerging ports, the section \nnow authorizes new expanded uses of the HMTF. The expanded use \nauthority, which includes dredging of berths and disposal of \ncontaminated dredge material, is limited to those ports that collect \nmore HMTF taxes than they receive in HMTF spending.\n  I also want to note that these new uses are prioritized for the ports \nthat collect much larger amounts of the HMTF fees than they receive in \nreturn because the many industries that pay these fees to access \nAmerican ports deserve to have some of those funds used to improve the \nfacilities they depend on for movement of goods.\n  These ports have unmet needs that shippers into these ports expect to \nbe addressed. In my home State, we have two large ports--Los Angeles \nand Long Beach. These two ports collect over a quarter of all revenue \nfor the HMTF, but because of the natural conditions at these ports, \nthey require little to almost no traditional dredging to maintain the \nfederally authorized channels. They do have needs related to berth \ndredging and disposal of some contaminated sediments.\n  These expanded use authorities are new and separate from the \ntraditional uses of the HMTF. These new, expanded uses are not limited \nto the traditional HMTF focus--dredging of the Federal navigation \nchannel. Instead, these are designed to meet additional maintenance \nneeds beyond traditional cost-shared dredging projects.\n  Specifically, the conference agreement authorizes dredging of berths \nthat are accessible to a Federal navigation channel and that benefit \ncommercial navigation at the harbor. This permits expenditure of HMTF \nrevenues for maintenance of non-Federal berthing areas to a depth \nrequired to access the federally authorized channel. The conference \nagreement does not place any other restriction on the use of these \nfunds; therefore, these funds are eligible for maintenance dredging of \nberths to any depths necessary to access the federally authorized \nnavigation channel as long as the berth is in a harbor that is \naccessible to a Federal navigation channel and the dredging benefits \ncommercial navigation.\n  The conference report also authorizes dredging and disposal of \ncontaminated sediments if such activities provide a benefit to \ncommercial navigation and affect navigation of a Federal navigation \nproject or are located in a berth that is accessible to a Federal \nnavigation project. This provision will enable the HMTF to fund the \ndisposal of legacy-contaminated sediment and sediment unsuitable for \nopen water disposal that affect navigation at a Federal navigation \nproject. This could include a range of cost-effective contaminated \nsediment removal and disposal activities as long as they provide a \nbenefit to commercial navigation. No limitation beyond the benefit to \ncommercial navigation and the linkage to a Federal navigation project \nis included.\n  Mr. Vitter. I thank Senator Boxer for the discussion of expanded uses \nof the HMTF. I agree with her understanding of the berth dredging and \ncontaminated sediment disposal eligibilities, which are important to \nmany of our Nation's major commercial ports. Expanding the uses of the \nHMTF is critical to those ports that are major contributors to the \nHMTF, yet receive minimal expenditures; therefore, the conference \nagreement establishes specific criteria for use of this authority. I \nlook forward to working with the Senator more in the future on the \nimplementation of the HMTF provisions in this conference report, \nincluding the expanded use provision we are discussing as well as \nincreased expenditures of harbor maintenance trust fund revenues and \nprioritization of dredging at other key ports, such as the Port of New \nOrleans.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank Senator Vitter for that response. It is important \nthat we are clear on how these new authorities should be implemented.\n  I also want to highlight how these authorities will benefit my home \nState of California. In the case of the Port of Los Angeles, the main \nchannels and turning basins are authorized to at least 53-foot depth \nand have been recently dredged to such depths. Most adjacent container \nberths were also federally authorized at 53 feet and have been dredged \nto that depth. As shoaling/siltation occurs, maintenance dredging must \nbe performed in order to keep adequate depth for the large container \nships. The new expanded use for berth dredging will permit the \nmaintenance dredging of these berth areas, down to the federally \nauthorized depth.\n  This new use for disposal of contaminated sediment is also important \nfor the Port of Los Angeles because legacy sediment contamination from \nthe Consolidated Slip at the port will migrate during storm events down \nthe Dominguez Channel and into the newly deepened Federal turning basin \nand main channel. This new expanded use will now allow the HMTF to fund \nthe removal of this sediment.\n  I am glad that the conference agreement could address this important \nneed for California ports as well as many other ports around the \ncountry. I am also very pleased with all of the other important reforms \nto the harbor maintenance trust fund included in the conference report. \nThe proper and full maintenance of our nation's ports is of vital \nimportance as we seek to compete in the global economy. The HMTF \nprovisions and other important elements in the WRRDA 2014 help support \nAmerican jobs, while maintaining America's ability to compete in the \nglobal economy.\n\n\n                            Dam Optimization\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I am joined by the chair and ranking \nmember of the Environment and Public Works Committee to discuss section \n1046 of the Water Resources Reform and Development Act conference \nreport, which we will vote on shortly in the Senate. I would like to \nthank the chair and ranking member for their\n\n[[Page S3269]]\n\nleadership on this important legislation and rise with them today to \ndiscuss the provision and address my concerns about the effects on Army \nCorps of Engineers' reservoirs in Texas.\n  It is important to remember that the long-term reliability of the \nCorps' multipurpose reservoirs remains a critical economic issue for \nmany regions of our country. Cities, water districts, businesses, and \nother users depend on these reservoirs both for hydropower generation \nand to meet their larger water supply needs. That is especially true in \narid States such as Texas.\n  Indeed, the reservoirs have helped our States--and many others--to \nmitigate the effects of serious droughts. For that matter, Texas \nsuffered the most intense drought in recorded State history just a few \nyears ago, and water levels at a number of reservoirs remain \ndangerously low. Statewide, reservoirs are only at 64 percent of their \ncapacity, according to the Texas Water Development Board.\n  As one of America's fastest growing States, water supply management \nis becoming more and more important to individual Texans and their \ncommunities. Thankfully, local and State leaders have worked hard to \ndevise effective strategies.\n  Similar to other States, Texas has very specific laws on water rights \nand environmental flows. Since 2007, we have had a legal process that \nprovides for a basin-specific scientific assessment, a formal review, \nand then recommendations by interested stakeholders. The State \ngovernment oversees this process by working with stakeholders to \nbalance environmental flow needs with other public interests, such as \nwater needs.\n  It is crucial to understand that the water stored in these reservoirs \nbelongs to Texas and has been allocated to users in accordance with \nFederal and State law. It is also crucial to understand that the non-\nFederal sponsors of the reservoirs pay for storage, operations, and \nmaintenance. Any changes to the operations that affect the authorized \npurposes of the reservoirs should never be made without their \ninvolvement.\n  Section 1046(a) in the conference report requires the Corps to update \nits operations of reservoirs report, and to include a plan for \nreviewing the operations of individual projects, including a detailed \nschedule for future reviews of project operations. In carrying out \nthese reviews, the Corps must coordinate with the appropriate Federal, \nState, and local agencies, along with any public and private entities \nthat could be affected.\n  Going forward, during the deliberations over a project-specific \nreview, the Secretary must carefully weigh the use of limited Federal \noperations and maintenance funding and may accept funds from other \nagencies or non-Federal entities if necessary.\n  Furthermore, the Secretary must ensure that all recommendations \noffered at the conclusion of the review, one, do not impinge on State \nwater rights; two, are consistent with State water plans, and, three, \ndo not affect any authority of a State to manage water resources within \nthat State.\n  The language is explicit: It does not change the authorized purpose \nof any Corps dam or reservoir, and the Secretary may only carry out \nrecommendations and activities pursuant to existing law. Let me repeat: \nThere is no new authority to modify reservoir operations granted to the \nCorps of Engineers.\n  Of course, the Secretary has always had the authority to review the \noperations of these reservoirs and to improve their efficiency. As they \nundertake these reviews and carry out activities, this conference \nreport language is clear that all authorized project purposes are \nmaintained.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I would like to thank my friend from \nTexas, Senator Cornyn. As the top Senate Republican member of the \nconference committee for WRRDA, I agree with his understanding and \ninterpretation of the language in section 1046(a) of the WRRDA \nconference report. Multipurpose dams and reservoirs in Texas are \ncrucial to the well-being and economic viability of Texas, particularly \nin areas that have experienced severe droughts over the past several \nyears. This provision is explicit in that the Secretary shall \ncoordinate with appropriate Federal, State, and local agencies, as well \nas public and private entities that may be affected by those reviews \nand activities. This provision also prohibits any changes to the \nauthorized purposes of any Corps dam or reservoir and only allows the \nSecretary to carry out recommendations or activities pursuant to \nexisting law. As the Corps implements this provision, I will work with \nmy colleague from Texas to monitor the Corps' activities and ensure \nthere are no adverse effects to dams and reservoirs in his State.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I thank Ranking Member Vitter and \nSenator Cornyn for the discussion of section 1046(a) in the WRRDA \nconference report. I agree with their understanding and interpretation \nof this section and wish to address the importance of this provision. \nIn my home State, which is currently facing a historic drought, it is \ncritical that the Corps examine its reservoir operations to increase \nflexibility so that it can better meet all of the State's water needs, \nincluding agriculture, municipal uses, and the environment. \nUnfortunately, in California, the Corps does not look often enough at \nhow it can better operate its reservoirs to meet multiple needs. This \nprovision does not change the authorized purpose of any reservoir and \nparagraph (6), ``Effects of subsection,'' makes this clear. The \nprovision simply creates a more transparent process under existing law \nso that Congress and local communities can work with the Corps to \nimprove management of Federal reservoirs that provide important \nbenefits to local communities.\n\n\n                       ACF and ACT River Systems\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I am joined by the chair and ranking \nmember of the Environment and Public Works Committee to discuss section \n1051 of the Water Resources Reform and Development Act--WRRDA--\nconference report, which we will vote on shortly in the Senate. I thank \nthe chair and ranking member for their leadership on this bipartisan \nand important legislation. I rise today to discuss a provision within \nthe legislation pertaining to a long-running regional dispute in the \nSoutheastern United States over the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' \noperations within the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint, ACF and \nAlabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa, ACT, river systems. At the heart of the \nconflict are concerns from downstream stakeholders about the amount of \nwater withdrawals--and the legal authority for those withdrawals--from \nLake Allatoona and Lake Lanier.\n  A similar provision was included in the Senate-passed version of this \nbill, S. 601, which was reported favorably out of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee after careful consideration. Part of that \nconsideration was a July 22, 2013, hearing focused on this dispute \namong the Army Corps and other stakeholders in the region. That hearing \nexamined issues related to the withdrawal of water from Lake Allatoona \nand Lake Lanier; the authorized purposes of those two reservoirs; the \nCorps' actions in light of the 1958 Water Supply Act; the legislative \nhistory of the reservoirs; and the Corps' management of water storage \ncontracts in the river systems.\n  While it highlighted a number of concerns related to Army Corps of \nEngineers authority under the Water Supply Act, the hearing brought to \nlight a point of agreement that all stakeholders share. The best way to \nresolve the conflict is through a negotiated interstate water compact.\n  Section 1051 highlights Congress's concerns with the Corps' actions \nunder the Water Supply Act related to the allocation of storage at \nCorps projects to local water supply without congressional approval. \nWhile it notes these concerns, it urges the agreed-upon best resolution \nto the conflict: an interstate water compact negotiated by the \nGovernors of Georgia, Alabama, and Florida. The provision adds that the \ncommittees of jurisdiction should consider further legislation on the \nissue absent such an agreement.\n  Mr. VITTER. I thank my friend from Alabama, Senator Sessions, for his \nwork on the WRRDA conference report and on this long-running dispute in \nthe Southeastern United States. As the top Republican on the Committee \non Environment and Public Works and the lead Republican Senate conferee \non the conference committee for WRRDA, I agree with his understanding \nand interpretation of the language in section 1051 of\n\n[[Page S3270]]\n\nthe WRRDA conference report. Senator Sessions' work through the \ndevelopment of the Senate version of this bill to investigate and \ndocument this conflict provided useful clarity throughout the \nconference committee's deliberations. As we await the development of a \nwater compact that is satisfactory to Georgia, Alabama, and Florida, I \nwill work with my friend from Alabama to continue oversight of the \nCorps' implementation of the Water Supply Act.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, today the Senate is considering the \nconference agreement for the Water Resources Reform and Development Act \nof 2014, WRRDA. This bill contains roughly $12.3 billion in additional \nauthorized spending for a variety of water projects that fall under the \njurisdiction of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers civil works division. \nThis bill supports the construction and maintenance of many of our \nNation's dams, levees, harbors, ports, and river ways to name a few.\n  For being such an important bill, the American people may wonder why \nthe last time Congress passed a WRDA law was 7 years ago in 2007.\n  The reason is that it took Congress 7 straight years to finally \nrespond to public pressure demanding Army Corps reform. As my \ncolleagues know, the Corps has long been criticized by government \nauditors, taxpayer watchdogs and environmental groups for employing \nhighly questionable economic models and environmental studies to \njustify its construction projects. A large number of Army Corps \nprojects have been pegged as government boondoggles flush with waste, \nfraud, and abuse due to cost-overruns and cut-corner construction. \nPerhaps the best known example is the flooding of New Orleans during \nthe Hurricane Katrina disaster that was traced back to substandard \nCorps levees, poor planning, and gutted coastal wetlands. Years later \nan independent study by the American Society of Engineers commissioned \nby the Corps concluded that, ``a large portion of the destruction from \nHurricane Katrina was caused by . . . engineering and engineering-\npolicy failures made over many years at almost all levels of \nresponsibility.''\n  But as much as the Corps' bad management practices are to blame, the \ntruth is that we in Congress are not without fault. For decades, \nCongress has used each WRDA bill to pile on construction project on top \nof construction project as a way for members to ``bring home the \nbacon'' in their States. Layers of these pork projects have created a \n$60 billion construction backlog, and the Army Corps simply can not \ncomplete them all with their $2 billion annual construction \nappropriation. Cutting corners and cooking their books is simply one \nway they bend to political priorities set by Congress.\n  I appreciate that the conference agreement implements some modest \nCorps reforms, particularly addressing the agency's $60 billion \nconstruction backlog. This bill requires the the Army Corps to ``de-\nauthorize'' up to $18 billion in Corps projects, most of which have \nnever received construction funding to begin with. This is a step in \nthe right direction, but unfortunately this bill's ``savings'' are \nwashed away by the $12 billion in new authorized spending included in \nthis bill. Additionally, the conference agreement makes it impossible \nto de-authorize $28 billion in projects that were authorized in the \n2007 WRDA law--a bill that was vetoed by President Bush for containing \ntoo much government waste but was subsequently overridden by Congress.\n  This bill also falls short by not giving the Army Corps clear \nparameters on what projects should be treated as national priorities. \nThe conferees even eliminated a law that requires the Corps to send \ntheir most costly and controversial projects to undergo an \n``Independent Peer Review'' process. All of this means there will be \nless transparency and oversight into the Corps decision making process. \nSo I am sorry to say I must question the veracity of ``reform'' in this \nconference agreement.\n  I worry that ultimately this WRRDA conference agreement means that \nArmy Corps projects of lower-priority will continue to supersede \nprojects that address serious, life-threatening issues across the \nNation and in my home State of Arizona. This lack of prioritization \nwith Corps projects comes at a real cost to the American taxpayer. Take \nfor example the Rio de Flag Flood Control Project in Flagstaff, AZ. The \nArmy Corps knows that a single large flood event along the Rio de Flag \nRiver could easily wipe out the city's downtown area and Northern \nArizona University, affecting half their population and causing $93 \nmillion in economic damage. After undergoing the appropriate \nfeasibility studies, Congress authorized $24 million in 2000 to \nconstruct a 1.6-mile flood water channel and a detention basin to \nredirect the water away from the community. For 14 years, this \nproject--- again, just 1.6 miles--has languished partially because of \nthe Corps' $60 billion construction backlog. The Corps spends less than \n$3 million a year on Rio de Flag while Congress plays favorites with \nother projects on their plate. This approach of funding Army Corps \nprojects piecemeal over the years has inflated the total estimated cost \nof Rio de Flag from $24 million to $101.5 million.\n  Rio de Flag is a serious public safety project and yet it is behind \nschedule and way over budget. In fact, the only completed portion of \nthe project is a 4,000-foot levee, which is cracked due to shoddy \nconstruction by an Army Corps contractor. I am told that the Army Corps \nrecently ordered the contractor to repair the broken levee, of course \nat the added expense of the American taxpayer and the City of \nFlagstaff. Now the project faces more delays because the Army Corps has \nbeen slowly dragging out its ``updated economic analysis'' for Rio De \nFlag for the past 3 years, leaving the city unnecessarily vulnerable to \ndisaster and causing the project's price tag to rise even higher.\n  I have a longstanding practice of abstaining from legislating \nprojects to WRDA bills out of principle that each project should be \nprioritized based on national need, but it's hard to argue that \nFlagstaff isn't one of these national priorities, or that the current \npractice of piling on Army Corps projects isn't contributing to the \nmismanagement across the entire agency. Ultimately, this conference \nagreement does little to change the Corps' culture of bad decisions \nthat affect Rio de Flag and similar projects. Congress will not be \nblameless if a flood event larger than what Flagstaff occasionally sees \ninundates the city, destroys property, or claims innocent lives.\n  I appreciate the need to pass a WRDA bill after 7 years, but I am \nconcerned that this bill is just a new coat of paint on the same broken \nsystem. I urge my colleagues to oppose this conference agreement.\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I am here to speak in support of the \nconference report for the Water Resources Reform and Development Act or \nWRRDA. I congratulate Senator Boxer and Senator Vitter for their \ncombined leadership and their working together to send this bill to the \nPresident's desk. The last time Congress passed a WRDA bill was in \n2007.\n  Gridlock and controversy over earmarks have delayed action on the \nWRRDA bill. This inaction puts our ports, beaches, and massive \nenvironmental restoration projects, like the Everglades, in jeopardy.\n  I support WRRDA because it moves forward with port construction, new \nflood protection, navigation, and environmental restoration projects, \nwhile instituting a number of reforms to the Army Corps of Engineers.\n  Our ports provide good jobs and are critical the economy, \nfacilitating trade and commerce. These projects have been vetted, \nstudied, and recommended by the Army Corps. Now, it is time for \nCongress to do its part and pass the WRRDA bill.\n  The WRRDA bill means good news for Florida's beaches, waterways, \nports, and the Everglades. Not only does Florida have nine projects \nwith a chief's report that are ready to go, but we also have several \ncoastal communities anxiously waiting for the reauthorization of beach \nnourishment programs.\n  The WRRDA bill extends the authorization for beach renourishment \nprojects so that the Corps can continue repairing and restoring \nFlorida's coastlines. The WRRDA bill authorizes a 3-year extension of \ncoastal storm damage projects which are scheduled to expire in the next \n5 years. This means that the Treasure Island project in Pinellas County \nwill now be authorized through 2022. In addition, it creates a\n\n[[Page S3271]]\n\nprocess by which projects can be extended by up to 15 years with the \nhelp of Federal funds. Strengthening the coastline by replenishing \neroding sand will help defend against sea-level rise and storm surge.\n  Congress made a promise 14 years ago to restore the Everglades, and \nWRRDA puts us on the path to finally fulfill the promise of Everglades \nrestoration. The Everglades are a national treasure, and together, \nCongress and President Harry Truman recognized it when they dedicated \nEverglades National Park back in 1947. But it took another major act of \nCongress to fund Everglades restoration to repair and restore the \nnatural sheet flow of water into the park and into Florida Bay.\n  The original Everglades Restoration legislation, also known as the \nComprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan, or CERP, was the result of \nyears of work and study, was authorized in 2000 and was written with \nthe intent of frequent WRDA bills.\n  However, only one WRDA bill has been enacted since--in 2007. The \nfirst era of Everglades restoration is underway. We have been able to \nfund construction and make significant progress on three major \nprojects, build a bridge over the Tamiami Trail, create jobs, and \nprovide fresh water for urban and agricultural water supply.\n  As we restore the Everglades, we create jobs and improve the water \nquality for a critical habitat. In fact, a Mather Economics study found \nthat restoring the Everglades will result in the creation of over \n440,000 jobs in sectors like real estate, tourism, fishing, and \nagriculture--many of those permanent jobs. This study also concluded \nthat there is a $4 return on investment for every dollar spent \nrestoring the Everglades.\n  This bill contains four new project authorizations that are part of \nthe Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. For example, the C-43 \nReservoir near La Belle, FL, will help store water during the rainy \nseason along the Caloosahatchee River and protect our coastal areas \nfrom too much freshwater, which can drastically disrupt the delicate \nsalinity balance in the Caloosahatchee Estuary. In addition, the C-111 \nSpreader Canal will redirect water into Everglades National Park that \nwill eventually make its way down to benefit Florida Bay.\n  The first era of Everglades restoration projects, including the \nIndian River Lagoon and the Picayune Strand, increase water quality and \npreserve the natural areas to reverse the draining and bulldozing that \nhappened decades ago. This is one of the last areas of the State where \nthe Florida panther has the land it needs to roam and hunt. In \naddition, Picayune Strand restores habitat and ecological connections \nthat will directly affect the Florida Panthers National Wildlife \nRefuge, the Belle Meade State Conservation and Recreation Lands Project \nArea, and the Fakahatchee Strand State Preserve.\n  All of this works toward the goal of moving water through the \nhistoric River of Grass. But progress has been delayed because the \nsecond era of projects has been waiting for the WRDA bill for several \nyears. I know Florida is not alone with this type of complaint. The \nlack of project authorizations has caused delays and significant cost \noverruns for too long. For this very reason, I have introduced a bill \ncalled the Everglades for the Next Generation Act. This legislation \nprovides a programmatic authorization for 5 years for all projects \nassociated with the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. It \nauthorizes projects that the Army Corps has completed the planning, \nengineering, and design work for and allows the Corps to expedite the \nprocess on other projects that would provide greater ecosystem or water \nsupply benefits when done sooner.\n  The WRRDA bill updates our ports and makes them more economically \ncompetitive. WRRDA authorizes a number of projects for ports in Florida \nand other States. These authorizations are a crucial step forward for \nthe improvements our ports need to attract more ships and cargo and \ntake full advantage of the Panama Canal expansion. For example, WRRDA \nauthorizes $600.9 million for a project to deepen Jacksonville Harbor. \nThis will economically transform Jacksonville into a major port that \ncan receive big ships from Asia through an expanded Panama Canal. \nProjects for Port Canaveral and the Port of Palm Beach that will create \nnew jobs were also included in WRRDA. Overall, I am very pleased that \nthe WRRDA bill accomplishes so much for ports in Florida. Improving and \nupdating our ports will be an economic boon for the country that will \ncreate new jobs and opportunities for people across the country.\n  Mr. President, it is clear that without the WRRDA bill, Florida is in \ntrouble. It is important not just to Florida but for this entire \nNation. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I will support this legislation to \nstrengthen our Nation's water infrastructure. For Michigan, the Water \nResources Reform and Development Act, WRRDA, means that harbors, \nchannels, breakwaters, and locks in the Great Lakes will be better \nmaintained; Federal assistance for wastewater system upgrades will be \nmore flexible and affordable; and the Great Lakes fishery will be \nbetter protected from destructive invasive species. Surrounded by water \non all but one side, Michigan is a water state and our waters fuel our \neconomy, create jobs, offer a vast array of recreational opportunities, \nand provide drinking water to millions. I am pleased this bill will \nhelp protect our waters and improve their navigability.\n  The report makes progress on increasing funding for harbor \nmaintenance, with the goal of aligning revenues collected in the harbor \nmaintenance trust fund with those expended for this purpose. Over 5 \nyears have passed since I led a bipartisan and multiregional group of \nSenators to call to the attention of the Senate Environment and Public \nWorks Committee the imbalance in collections and spending for harbor \nmaintenance. I am pleased the committee worked with us to reduce this \ndisparity. This conference report aims to increase spending on harbor \nmaintenance so that it is more in line with the fees collected for \nmaintaining our Nation's navigation infrastructure. I am also pleased \nthe Great Lakes navigation system is prioritized for the increased \nfunds through a specific set-aside of 10 percent. Also, Great Lakes \nprojects are eligible for other types of prioritized funds, which will \nposition us to compete for this additional assistance.\n  The conference report authorizes the Great Lakes as a single \nnavigational system, recognizing the interconnectedness of its 140 \nharbor projects. During Senate consideration of the water resources \nbill, I entered into a colloquy with Chairman Boxer to discuss the \nsystem's interdependence. I am pleased the conference committee \nincluded this Great Lakes authorization, as it should help allow all of \nour harbors--both large and small--to be recognized for Federal \nassistance.\n  While the harbor maintenance provisions in the report are good, we \nwill still need to continue to fight for appropriations and ensure that \nbudget requests reflect the true needs of the Great Lakes Navigation \nSystem. This vital transportation network carries about 130 million \ntons of critical commodities to supply raw materials to our \nmanufacturing sector, power homes and businesses, build roads and \nbridges, and provide food for people around the world. Surely it should \nbe maintained so that it can carry these critical commodities \neffectively and efficiently.\n  In addition to carrying millions of tons of goods, the Great Lakes \nalso boast a $7 billion fishery. To protect this significant resource, \ndestructive invasive species need to be kept out of the lakes. I am \npleased the conferees retained an important provision I worked with my \ncolleagues to include in the Senate bill, an authorization for the \nCorps of Engineers to implement emergency measures to prevent invasive \nspecies, including the destructive Asian carp, from dispersing into the \nGreat Lakes. This authorization makes clear that such emergency \nauthority can be implemented at any hydrologic connection between the \nGreat Lakes and Mississippi River basins which will provide important \nflexibility to the Corps to respond to emergencies.\n  Our Nation's economy, health, and well-being depend on a strong water \ninfrastructure. WRRDA makes progress in authorizing programs to \nstrengthen our navigation systems, flood control, drinking water and \nwastewater systems, and natural resources. We now\n\n[[Page S3272]]\n\nneed to make sure that appropriations are provided for these \nimprovements to be made real.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, today the Senate will act to make major \nimprovements to our water infrastructure for commercial and \nrecreational navigation while protecting and maintaining many \nenvironmental treasures for future generations.\n  The Water Resources Reform and Development Act--which the House \npassed 412 to 4--is one of the few bipartisan accomplishments of this \nCongress. I wish there were more.\n  Nevertheless, I would like to thank Chairman Barbara Boxer and \nSenator Vitter of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and \nChairman Bill Shuster and Congressman Nick Rahall on the House side for \ntheir hard work in getting this bill to us today.\n  I would also like to thank my Illinois delegation colleagues on both \nsides of the Capitol and on both sides of the aisle for their \nassistance in advancing Illinois priorities in this bill.\n  I am pleased that in the final bill there are many provisions that \nwill benefit our home State.\n  It was just a little over a year ago that we dealt with a major \ndrought in the Midwest that caused record low water levels on the \nMississippi River and threatened to disrupt the crucial transport of \nmillions of dollars in goods and commodities on the river.\n  After the initial threat had passed, thanks to better-than-expected \nrainfall and quick action by the Army Corps of Engineers at the behest \nof Congress, Representative Bill Enyart and I introduced the \nMississippi River Navigation Sustainment Act. The major provisions of \nthis measure are included in the bill we will pass today.\n  These provisions will improve water level and river forecasting \nabilities along the Mississippi and give the Corps greater flexibility \nto respond to low water events that threaten navigation. The bill also \nauthorizes the Corps to conduct, for the first time, a study of the \nentire Mississippi River Basin--which spans 40 percent of the \ncontinental United States--to determine how we can better manage the \nsystem during extreme weather. Finally, we create an environmental \nmanagement program for the middle Mississippi--recognizing the \nimportance of preserving and restoring fish and wildlife habitats while \nundertaking important navigation improvements.\n  River commerce in America's heartland depends on the system of locks \nand dams on the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers.\n  I was pleased to work with my colleagues in the 2007 reauthorization \nof the Water Resources Development Act to authorize modernization and \nexpansion of the locks on these important Illinois waterways.\n  These improvements make commerce more efficient and guard against \ncatastrophic failures of current locks and dams as most of them reach \n80 or so years old. At the same time, with current project delivery \nschedules and the tight Federal budget, these improvements are not \nexpected to be realized until 2090 by some estimates.\n  With that in mind, Senator Mark Kirk and I, along with our colleagues \nRepresentatives Cheri Bustos and Rodney Davis in the House, introduced \nthe Water Infrastructure Now Public Private Partnership Act or WIN-P3. \nA version of our proposal is included in the final conference report.\n  It includes a pilot program that would decentralize project planning, \ndesign, and construction from the Corps and provide an opportunity for \nprivate financing to come to the table. We are hopeful that it will \nspeed project delivery of nationally significant water infrastructure \nprojects like the locks and dams on the Mississippi and Illinois \nRivers.\n  Along with the economic and recreational benefits of the Mississippi \nRiver comes the annual threat of devastating floods for many Illinois \ncommunities.\n  In Illinois' Metro East region the community has stepped up to \nimprove flood protection after their levees were decertified. They have \ntaxed themselves to help pay for this improved protection and have \nendured a long and often frustrating partnership with the Army Corps.\n  My hope is that the provisions we secured in this bill will go a long \nway to improving their situation.\n  The bill would combine several separately authorized levee projects \ninto one. That means that the money Congress appropriates for these \nprojects will be more flexible and can be used where it is most needed.\n  Additionally, the bill would allow the Metro East levee projects to \nqualify for work-in-kind credit with the Army Corps. This will help \nmake the work the locals are doing go farther towards the completion of \nthe final levels of protection.\n  The conference report will also allow much needed restoration of the \nChicago shoreline along Lake Michigan to continue. The project was \nfacing delay as it got closer to hitting its original authorization \ncap. This bill increased that authorization.\n  I would like to thank again all those who worked on this bill. I look \nforward to this bipartisan accomplishment being soon signed into law by \nPresident Obama.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senate will resume legislative session.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I want to speak briefly on three topics \nthis afternoon: human trafficking; the terrorist attack at Fort Hood, \nTX, in 2009; and finally, the way the Senate has become a killing \nground for good ideas because of the practices of the majority leader.\n\n\n                           Human Trafficking\n\n  Starting with human trafficking, we know that while slavery was \nformally abolished in the United States years ago, it continues today \nin the form of human trafficking. Tragically, too many children are \nvictims of modern-day slavery--literally tens of thousands right here \nin America. That is why in recent years I have joined with colleagues \non both sides of the aisle--obviously, this is not a political or \npartisan issue--to work together in a bipartisan way to introduce a \nseries of bills aimed at accomplishing three things: No. 1, shedding \nlight on this tragic reality. Most people in their communities around \nthe country are not even aware of the scourge of human trafficking that \nis happening right under their nose. No. 2, we have tried to do \neverything we can to save children--minors--from the sex trade. And No. \n3, we have tried hard to bring these traffickers to justice.\n  I was proud to be one of the cosponsors of the 2012 Child Protection \nAct, which gave law enforcement agencies better tools with which to \nprotect children and apprehend criminals. More recently, I joined with \nthe senior Senator from Oregon, Mr. Wyden; the senior Senator from \nMinnesota, Ms. Klobuchar; and the junior Senator from Illinois, Mr. \nKirk, to introduce something we call the Justice for Victims of \nTrafficking Act.\n  Our bill would establish a domestic trafficking victims fund that \ndoesn't come from tax dollars but, rather, from fees and fines paid by \npeople who commit law enforcement offenses. It would allocate tens of \nmillions of dollars to both fight human trafficking and, just as \nimportantly, to help victims get the sorts of services they need in \norder to heal and to become productive citizens once again. It would \nalso give law enforcement officials more tools to crack\n\n[[Page S3274]]\n\ndown on human trafficking and the broader criminal networks that \nsupport them.\n  The bill would streamline human trafficking task force investigations \nby giving investigators access to better technologies and enhance \ncooperation between Federal and State law enforcement partnerships. It \nwould also allow law enforcement officials to prosecute each and every \nmember of a human trafficking organization, as opposed to merely the \non-the-ground managers, and it would increase the penalties for \ncriminals who prey on children through sex slavery.\n\n  Finally, it would improve the availability of restitution and witness \nassistance for trafficking victims by allowing for a larger portion of \nforfeited Federal criminal assets to go directly to the victims.\n  To be clear, as I said a moment ago, this bill would be funded by the \nfines imposed on the people who commit the crimes of child pornography, \nchild prostitution, sexual exploitation, human trafficking, and \ncommercial human smuggling offenses at the Federal level, and it would \nnot increase the Federal deficit.\n  Earlier this week, the House of Representatives acted by passing its \nown version of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, and I would \nurge the majority leader and the chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee to bring the Senate version up for a vote in the committee \nand on the floor of the Senate as soon as possible. After all, during a \ntime when politics seems to pervade everything here in Washington, DC, \nand we are approaching a midterm election where it seems so hard to do \nthings that should be easy, this is one thing we ought to be able to do \ntogether.\n\n\n                               Fort Hood\n\n  I would also urge the majority leader to allow a vote on separate \nlegislation that has already been approved by the House Armed Services \nCommittee as an amendment to the national defense authorization bill, \nand is now being introduced as an amendment to the Senate bill by my \ncolleague Senator Cruz of Texas, who sits on the Armed Services \nCommittee.\n  This legislation I am referring to I first introduced several years \nago following the terrorist attack on American soil at Fort Hood, TX, \nwhen MAJ Nidal Hasan killed 13 people and injured dozens more. These \nindividuals who lost their lives deserve the same sort of recognition \non the field of battle as people who lost their lives in other parts of \nthe world--perhaps overseas. The same benefits should be available to \nthe families of those who survive terrorist attacks anywhere in the \nworld.\n  There is no doubt about the fact that what happened at Fort Hood on \nNovember 5, 2009, was a terrorist attack. The shooter happened to be a \nlone-wolf terrorist, happened to be an American citizen, and happened \nto be a member of the U.S. Army, but he was also a radicalized Islamist \nwho reportedly exchanged at least 20 emails with a senior Al-Qaeda \nmember before committing this massacre. The Al-Qaeda leader with whom \nhe corresponded is someone who has since become more notorious and even \nbetter known--a man named Anwar al-Awlaki. This person was also the one \nwho maintained a relationship with a terrorist who tried to blow up \nNorthwest Airlines flight 253 on Christmas day in 2009, less than 2 \nmonths after the Fort Hood attack.\n  We have just had a vote on one of the lawyers who wrote the memo by \nwhich President Obama authorized a drone attack on Anwar al-Awlaki on \nSeptember 2011 overseas, so there is no question the Fort Hood shooter \nbelieved he was acting on behalf of Al-Qaeda. There is no one who can \ndeny he shouted ``Allah akbar'' before opening fire, and no one who can \ndeny he has since described the act as an act of jihad.\n  Yesterday I had the chance to question FBI Director James Comey, and \nI asked him whether he agreed with the assessment that this incident \nwas ``workplace violence,'' which some have amazingly called this, or \nwhether he thought this was an Al-Qaeda-inspired attack of terrorism \nhere on America soil. His response--something I thought would have been \npainfully obvious--was yes, it was a terrorist attack in 2009.\n  Was the shooter a card-carrying member of Al-Qaeda? Well, I am not \nsure exactly what that is, but to me that is the wrong question \nentirely. We have to remember that Al-Qaeda leaders, such as Ayman al-\nZawahiri has called upon his terrorist followers to commit dispersed, \nsmall-scale attacks exactly like the one that occurred at Fort Hood in \n2009. We do know, from the rich evidence that was discovered during the \nprosecution of Major Hasan, that the Fort Hood shooter was most \ncertainly a disciple of Anwar al-Awlaki.\n  The awarding of Purple Hearts should not be contingent on geography. \nIn other words, if an Al-Qaeda-inspired terrorist kills a group of our \nbrave men and women in uniform overseas, it shouldn't be treated any \ndifferently than if one of their inspired terrorists kills one of our \nmembers of the military here at home as well. The soldiers who were \nkilled or wounded at Fort Hood were casualties of a global war on \nterror, period, and they deserve to be treated as such by the U.S. \nGovernment. They deserve the exact same recognition that military \nvictims of Al-Qaeda's terrorist attack in New York on September 11, \n2001, received--the same recognition they received--nothing more and \nnothing less.\n  Awarding them the Purple Heart is a matter of justice, a matter of \nhonor, and a matter of honesty.\n  The House of Representatives has shown great leadership on these \nissues that should unite us both on the huge trafficking front and on \nthe Purple Heart recognition I just mentioned. It is time now for the \nSenate to follow suit, and I hope the majority leader will help us get \nthis legislation up, move it across the floor, pass it, and send it to \nthe President so he can sign it into law.\n\n\n                            Senate Operation\n\n  The third point is that I cannot let the remarks of the majority \nleader this morning pass without comment--the remarks majority leader \nHarry Reid made on the floor this morning about how the Senate is being \noperated.\n  The majority leader came to the floor this morning and called the \nlegislative process a game. He accused Republicans of stalling \nimportant pieces of legislation, such as the 55 provisions of the tax \nextenders bill that died last week in the Senate. But we need to be \nclear about exactly who is responsible and what has happened.\n  This is the third time in 2 weeks the majority leader has killed \nlegislation which enjoys broad bipartisan support.\n  First, it was the energy efficiency bill known as the Shaheen-Portman \nbill. The majority leader killed that piece of legislation when he \nrefused any opportunity--either for Democrats or Republicans--to offer \nany amendments and get votes on those amendments. If he had simply done \nthat, that legislation would be on its way to President Obama today, if \nnot already signed into law.\n  Then last week we saw these 55 expiring tax provisions, some of which \nenjoy broad bipartisan support, such as the research and development \ntax credit and the deduction for State sales tax, which is important to \nmy State because income taxes paid at the State level are deducted from \nthe Federal income tax bill of people who live in those States and pay \nState income tax.\n  As a matter of fairness and parity, I support a number of the \nprovisions in the tax extenders bill. But when the majority leader \nbrought it to the floor and he refused to allow any amendments \nwhatsoever to this legislation, the minority, of which I am a member, \nhad no choice but to stop that legislation in its tracks because that \nis the only leverage we had to wake up the majority leader and say it \nis important for the minority and the people we represent to have a \nvoice in what happens on the Senate floor.\n  Our Founding Fathers decided that each State would get two Senators. \nBut when one or maybe both of those Senators are in the minority party \nand if they are shut out of the legislative process entirely because \nall amendments and even constructive suggestions are denied, then my \nconstituents--the 26 million people I represent in the State of Texas--\nhave been shut out of the process and denied the constitutional \nrepresentation they are guaranteed under our founding documents.\n  There is a theme that resulted in these bills killed by the majority \nleader; that is, since the 113th Congress,\n\n[[Page S3275]]\n\nthe majority leader's utter refusal to allow debate and votes on \namendments by Members of both parties--both parties.\n  While I am not happy about the fact that my constituents have been \nshut out of this process, I would think my Democratic friends' \nconstituents can't be happy about the fact that they have been shut out \nof the process as well.\n  Here is an amazing statistic. Our Democratic Senators have introduced \n676 amendments to bills on the floor since last July. That is 676 \namendments not by the minority party but by the majority party that \ncontrols this body. Do we know how many votes they got on Democratic \namendments? They got 7 votes on Democratic amendments since the \nbeginning of the 113th Congress.\n  During that same period of time, Republicans have filed hundreds of \namendments too. That used to be the way the Senate worked. Both parties \nparticipate, we represent our States, and we have full and open debate \nand an amendment process. Then we vote, the majority rules, and then \nbills get passed and sent to the President for signature. But no more \nunder this majority leader. Now, during this same time frame, while \nDemocrats only got 7 rollcall votes, the minority got 9 rollcall votes \nsince last July.\n  So I find it a little ironic that, both on the energy efficiency bill \nand the tax extenders bill, it was Senate Republicans who stood up--not \nonly for the right of minority party Senators to get votes on \namendments they had filed, but also for the right of our Democratic \ncolleagues in the majority party who have basically been frozen out of \nthe process as well.\n  It might be true that constituents back home in those States where \nDemocratic Senators were elected would be asking the question: Look. My \nSenator who I voted for, whom I support, is a Member of the majority \nparty. But you're telling me that they can't participate in the \nlegislative process by offering good ideas to make legislation better \nand to get votes? How ineffectual can you be?\n  I happen to know from talking to many of my Democratic colleagues \nthat they are not happy about the process either. And it is not just \nabout process. It is not just about the prerogatives of individual \nSenators. This is about the constitutional guarantees of representation \nby two Senators for each State, and the rights of the minority to \nparticipate in the process and the people that I represent back home in \nTexas being shut out of the process altogether.\n  So the Senate has become a virtual killing floor for good bipartisan \nideas because of the way the majority leader has run the Senate.\n  Then there is what happened yesterday on the patent reform bill. I \nhave been a member of the Judiciary Committee since the time I got to \nthe Senate, and we have been working very hard to try to deal with the \nproblem of patent trolls.\n  Patent trolls are big a problem in industries we wouldn't even \nsuspect, including real estate, restaurants--not to mention high tech, \npharmaceutical manufacturers, and the like. But what happens is people \nbuy patents, not for the purpose of making something, not for the \npurpose of being productive, but for the purpose of having a basis upon \nwhich to file a lawsuit. Then they shake down small startups, the \ninnovators, the people who we are depending upon to create new products \nthat will make our lives better, make us healthier and make us all live \nlonger, and help grow our economy to create jobs. These people are \neither being snuffed out altogether or are very much prejudiced in \nterms of their ability to grow because of all of this patent troll \nactivity.\n  I have been working closely with the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Leahy, who has been working hard on this issue; \nSenator Schumer, the Senator from New York, a Democrat; Senator Hatch, \nwho is a senior Member of the Judiciary Committee; and Senator Grassley \nfrom Iowa, who is the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee. We \nwere in a pretty good place yesterday where we thought, as a result of \nhard negotiations and good bipartisan work, we were going to be in the \nposition for the chairman of the Judiciary Committee to mark up and to \nvote on a patent reform bill in the Senate Judiciary Committee this \nmorning, only to be told last night that the majority leader basically \nkilled that bill before it could even be acted on in the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  So this is the third time in 3 weeks the majority leader has \nbasically been responsible for killing good bipartisan legislation--the \nenergy efficiency bill, the tax extenders bill, and now the \npatent reform bill.\n\n  It is the majority leader's imperial leadership, where he is not just \nthe floor leader for his party, he is not just the traffic cop for the \nSenate, but he is the one who wants to pick and choose who gets to \nparticipate in the legislative process. In the process, he has shut out \nnot just Republicans but Democrats too, and he has turned this \ninstitution which used to be known as the world's greatest deliberative \nbody into a pale imitation of what it used to be.\n  I continue to hope, maybe because I am an optimist by nature, that \nthe majority leader will see the error of his ways and realize he is \nnot only hurting my constituents but he is hurting the constituents of \nevery Member of the Senate by denying us an opportunity for an open \nlegislative process where everyone's voice can be heard, where the \nAmerican people can watch and listen, where they can reach their own \nconclusions about the merits of each argument, and where they can hold \nus accountable for how we vote. That is what elections are supposed to \nbe about.\n  So I hope some day the majority leader will change his attitude about \nan open legislative process and will help restore the Senate's status \nas the world's greatest deliberative body. I predict if he does not do \nthat, the voters may well do that in November by changing the hands of \nthe majority from the Democratic party to the current minority party. \nThen things will change, and this body will return to its status as the \nworld's greatest deliberative body.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WALSH. Madam President, I served 33 years in the National Guard. \nWhen I joined the Guard, I swore an oath to support and defend the \nConstitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and \ndomestic. I have taken a similar oath as a Senator.\n  Former Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army Gordon Sullivan famously \nwrote, ``Hope is not a method.''\n  I didn't come to Congress to hope. I approach my work here with the \nlessons I learned in the military: Find solutions and work together to \novercome challenges.\n  Unfortunately, that approach is not how it works in Washington. Too \nmany people here don't care about solutions, and many ignore the \nproblems.\n  There is no greater proof than climate change. Here we are in 2014, \nalmost 50 years after President Johnson warned that ``by burning fossil \nfuels humanity is unwittingly conducting a vast geophysical \nexperiment.''\n  Yet irresponsible leaders in Washington pretend that climate change \nisn't real. They pretend that humans aren't causing it. They hope they \ncan go along with the status quo. But Montanans know better.\n  Here are the facts:\n  Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are now higher than at any \ntime in human history.\n  The 12 hottest years on record have been in the last 15 years.\n  The average temperature in Montana is 2.5 degrees higher than in \n1900.\n  And spring runoff now occurs 1 week to 4 weeks earlier.\n  In Montana, climate change has contributed to the worst mountain pine \nbeetle epidemic in recorded history. The combination of mild weather \nand stressed trees has allowed beetles to spread further and longer. \nTheir legacy is red trees, then dead trees, then wildfires like we have \nnever seen before.\n  Fire season is now 11 weeks longer than when I was a kid. The amount \nof forest that burns in the West has doubled. Fires are burning longer \nand burning more trees each and every year.\n  The best guess from America's scientists is that 3 to 4 times more \nforest will burn each year by the middle of this century, devastating \nrural communities that rely on timber and tourism.\n\n[[Page S3276]]\n\n  In 2000, I led the response of the Montana National Guard to the \nhistoric wildfires in Montana. We activated over 1,800 of Montana's \nsoldiers and airmen. That year, about 1 million acres of Montana were \nburned. Businesses and landowners lost over $3 million a day.\n  Suppressing wildfires now consumes up to 40 percent of the Forest \nService's budget. This is unsustainable. It reduces the agency's \nability to fund other programs like hazardous fuel reduction and trail \nmaintenance.\n  In Montana we have a saying that if you don't like the weather, stick \naround for an hour and it will change. But under climate change, it is \nchanging across a wider range. Rains are falling more intensely, \nincreasing erosion and runoff. The trend of more frequent and more \nintense rainfall is likely to continue. Heat waves and drought have \nalso become more intense. What all of this means for Montana's \nagriculture is hard to predict, but without a doubt our biggest \nindustry faces big uncertainty. The uncertainty in agriculture is \nespecially true for water delivery, both for livestock and irrigated \ncrops. As snow in the winter shifts to rain and extreme weather gets \nworse, it is becoming harder to run irrigation systems that were \ndesigned for the climate of 100 years ago.\n\n  We saw one of the worst droughts in history hit Montana ranchers and \nfarmers in 2012. The year before Montana experienced a 500-year flood \nin the Missouri River Basin. Across the Great Plains the floods caused \n$2 billion in damage. Across the Nation we are paying out of our nose \nfor extreme weather and natural disasters--$110 billion in damage in \n2012 alone.\n  Climate change will also damage our tourism, which is Montana's \nsecond biggest industry. Glacier National Park itself is losing its \nnamesake. Its ecosystem will change. Its cold water, which supports \nunique species and a strong trout fishery, will no longer be fed by \nmelting ice. The communities in the Milk River Basin which receive 70 \npercent of their water from glaciers will also be impacted. Snowpack \nacross the Rockies has already decreased 20 percent on average since \n1980. In parts of Montana it may decrease by 50 percent in my lifetime.\n  Winter tourism in Montana is also big business, generating over $150 \nmillion in income and supporting over 4,500 jobs. But less snow means \nfewer jobs. Skiing and snowmobiling contribute $265 million to the \nMontana economy. During the low snowfall winters of 2002 and 2005, \nMontana ski resorts lost $16 million in revenue compared to heavy snow \nyears.\n  Warmer temperatures also harm hunting, fishing, and our booming \noutdoor industry, which supports more than 64,000 jobs and attracts 11 \nmillion visitors to Montana each year. Warmer streams and fewer trout \ntranslate to direct reduction in Montana jobs. Stream closures in \nrecent years because of warm water are the first proof of this threat. \nNearly 50 percent of habitat for the bull trout and cutthroat trout \ncould be lost in the West this century. Big game species such as moose \nand elk face similar threats with a warmer climate.\n  Rural communities across Montana are especially vulnerable to climate \nchange. Many of them rely on single sectors tied to the land, from \ntimber to grain to outfitting, and are less able to adapt to a changing \neconomy.\n  I know what resource development looks like. My hometown of Butte was \nonce known as ``the Richest Hill on Earth.'' The copper mined on that \nhill helped us win World War II, but today it is part of the largest \nSuperfund site in America, including the Berkeley Pit. Mining continues \nto be an important industry in Montana, and Butte still churns out \ncopper that is used around the world. Fortunately, Butte has also \ndiversified. It now has good paying jobs in manufacturing and \naerospace. One lesson I took from growing up there is we cannot afford \nanother Berkeley Pit anywhere. Climate change is the equivalent of a \nBerkeley Pit: Ignore first; ask questions later.\n  Montanans understand the dilemma we are facing. We are the Treasure \nState. Our history is the history of resource development: from beaver \ntrapping to the gold rush, copper mining to railroads and the open \nrange, the homestead movement to the timber and fossil fuel booms. But \nalong with the booms came a lot of busts.\n  In Montana we had to spend tons of money on fixing our past mistakes. \nOver $1.5 billion has been spent at our Superfund sites alone. Each \nyear we spend another $13 million to clean up abandoned mine lands. If \nonly our resources had been developed the right way the first time, all \nthat money could have been spent on drinking water or better roads or \nlower student loans or researching cures for disease.\n  I know there are no easy solutions to the challenges we face today. \nToday 82 percent of energy used in the United States comes from fossil \nfuels. I am proud to represent a State with more than $1.6 billion in \ninvestment in wind energy since 2005. Renewable energy does have a \nbright future. A 2009 study ranked Montana's wind resources as the \nsecond best in the Nation. Montana also has potential for solar energy \nand is one of only 13 States with the potential to produce commercial \ngeothermal energy. Renewables, including wind, are not always the right \nanswer. Our current power grid has real physical limitations. I will \ncontinue supporting renewable energy and upgrades to the grid because \nwe need to reduce our carbon emissions. But we cannot ignore today's \nreality.\n  Look at me standing here. I flew here on a plane that burns jet fuel. \nI am wearing cotton, and I eat wheat and corn, all of which depend on \nfertilizers, were irrigated using power from coal and natural gas, and \nwere transported by diesel. I am speaking into a microphone and a \ncamera that need electricity. In the United States in the year 2014, we \neither dig up or pipe up five-sixths of our entire energy. I couldn't \ndo my job and visit Montanans without fossil fuel--and I understand \nthat--and many of them wouldn't have jobs either.\n  Montana is one of about a dozen States that is a net exporter of \nenergy. The oil and gas industry directly employs over 4,000 workers. \nOur unemployment rate in Montana is currently at 4.8 percent, in part \nbecause of the good jobs in the Bakken. We have 2,000 workers directly \nin the coal industry, from mining it to burning it to maintaining the \nboilers that burn it. Coal alone is responsible for over $100 million \nof revenue each year in the State and local economy. I don't agree with \nsome people who want to just pull the plug on coal. The United States \nburns only 11 percent of the coal consumed globally each year. The less \nwe invest in cleaning up coal, the less likely we are to make a dent in \nclimate change. We cannot just take our ball and go home. That simply \noutsources our pollution problem to countries such as China.\n  I know firsthand of the value of domestic energy. In 2004 and 2005 I \nled the largest deployment of Montana men and women to war in 60 years, \nmore than 700 of Montana's finest went with me to Iraq. Some of them \ndidn't return home with me; some of them returned severely injured. The \ndebate leading up to the war focused on weapons of mass destruction and \nthe connection of Saddam Hussein to the war on terrorism, but since \nWorld War II our strategic interest in the Middle East has been oil. \nOur dependence on foreign oil should never again be a reason for war. I \ndon't want countries forced to make military decisions or tempted to \nput soldiers on the ground because they are afraid that their economy \nwill freeze up without energy from other countries. That means I want \nmore oil responsibly produced here in the United States from places \nsuch as the Bakken. It means that I support a project like the Keystone \nXL Pipeline, which will make us more energy secure and strengthen the \neconomy of eastern Montana, while ensuring precautions are taken to \nguarantee pipeline safety and reliability and protect private property \nrights. Private industry jump-started by government-funded research and \ndevelopment has already provided part of the solution. The access to \ntight oil and gas has made us more energy secure. The trend is in the \nright direction. Less than half of the oil consumed by Americans now \ncomes from other countries.\n\n  Yet even if we continue to increase domestic production by displacing \nforeign oil, we are still exposed as a country to two risks. First, oil \nremains a necessary ingredient in our economy. Second, the oil market \ncontinues to be a global one, exposing us to price\n\n[[Page S3277]]\n\nswings that can seriously harm our own economy. Therefore, in addition \nto more domestic oil production, we need to diversify our \ntransportation fuels. The growth of advanced biofuels in America is the \nway to do that. I support diversifying our fuel sources by developing \nhomegrown alternatives such as biodiesel, jet fuel from camelina, and \nethanol from wheat and barley to reduce demand for foreign oil.\n  I also support the military's continued investment in renewable \nenergy. The impacts of climate change also have a strong national \nsecurity connection. The Defense Department's Quadrennial Defense \nReview has found a direct link between climate change and national \nsecurity threats like terrorism. Climate change is a threat multiplier. \nHigher sea levels and extreme weather increase poverty, humanitarian \ncrises, and political instability.\n  I know what political instability abroad can mean. It can mean our \nservicemembers, our sons and daughters, will be put in harm's way in \norder to protect our way of life. As a veteran and someone who has \nsworn an oath to this country, these impacts concern me because they \nmake us less safe.\n  Today despite all the evidence that climate change is harming us and \nwill hurt our children and grandchildren even more, we seem stuck. \nCongress is handcuffed by folks who have their heads in the sand. \nInstead of taking responsibility to solve this problem, they are \nchoosing to ignore it. The Clean Air Act has helped Americans tackle \npollution for over 40 years because it was written to last. The Supreme \nCourt has spoken and the law is clear. But using a section of the law \ndrafted when the Beatles were still recording is not the ideal way to \ntackle climate change, given how much our understanding has evolved \nsince then on pollution control. Ninety-seven percent of climate \nscientists agree that climate change is a human-caused problem. In the \nmilitary 97 percent is about as certain as a mission can get. But that \nis not good enough here in Washington.\n  Climate change is another example of why Washington is broken. We \nhave an agency writing regulations with enormous impact on all \nMontanans, using congressional directions written when I was a child. \nWe have an agency trying to put out a fire with a trowel because that \nis the only tool it has. I am committed to putting the fire out because \nwe cannot afford inaction. The benefits of acting are clear, but I \nwould prefer to use the right tool for that job. Yet Washington is so \nbroken that the alternative is to do nothing. Plan B is repeal. Plan B \nignores reality. I cannot accept that.\n  I will be watching the EPA's Clean Air Act regulations closely to \nkeep the agency accountable to Montanans and make any final rules \nworkable for Montana. Members of Congress should be taking \nresponsibility and upholding the oaths we all swore to. We should agree \nthat climate change is a clear enemy and take steps to stop it.\n  I strongly support a bigger investment in securing a responsible \nfuture for coal: tax credits, loans, loan guarantees, and grants for \ncarbon capture as well as sequestration. I have cosponsored bills and \nsigned letters. I have pressed Senators to maintain existing incentives \nfor coal. Coal does have a future, but it needs to lower its emissions. \nMontana is already leading the way with cutting-edge research in carbon \nsequestration. Beyond fossil fuels, our forests are a carbon sink, \nabsorbing about 12 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions each year. \nBut climate change itself threatens this important service provided by \nour forests. More active management, especially under the new farm bill \nauthority to address beetle-killed forests is critical. Getting the \nbiogenic emissions rule right, on the largest possible geographic \nscale, is critical for forests to continue absorbing CO2 \nemissions.\n  I support other energy options to reduce carbon emissions, including \nreduced energy demand overall and retrofitting nonpowered dams. \nWhatever rule the EPA proposes under the Clean Air Act for existing \npower plants, Montana and other States must take the lead role in \nimplementation.\n  The United States has always led the way with innovative technology, \nfrom the first oil wells and nuclear reactors to the first solar cells \nand hydraulic fracturing. In fact, access to tight natural gas \nformations in the last decade has already helped lower our carbon-\nrelated emissions by 10 percent. Despite the serious challenges imposed \nby climate change, I am confident that America can innovate solutions \nwhile creating good paying jobs and new technology. But as a first step \nwe cannot put our heads in the sand and continue with business as \nusual. The reason is simple. If we continue with business as usual, the \npeople left with the mess will be the next generation.\n  The people left taking responsibility for our emissions will be my \ngranddaughter Kennedy and all of our grandchildren. If we don't act \nnow, Kennedy will grow up in a Montana that burns every summer. She \nwon't be able to fly-fish because the rivers are too hot for trout. \nKennedy will have to explain to her kids what glaciers were. When I \ntook office, I swore an oath to make the right choice, and I am \ncommitted to solving climate change for Kennedy and for future \ngenerations.\n\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded, and to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             WRRDA Passage\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, today the Senate passed the Water \nResources Reform and Development Act. It has been too long since \nCongress last addressed our water infrastructure, and I want to applaud \nChairwoman Boxer and Ranking Member Vitter for their diligent work and \nunswerving commitment to making this bill a reality.\n  The fact that an infrastructure bill of this magnitude can be passed \nwithout earmarks and with a balance of reforms and authorizations for \ncritical projects is a testament to good leadership and a desire by \nMembers of Congress on both sides of the Capitol to better our Nation.\n  One of the projects this bill advances is crucial to not only my \nState of Georgia but to the entire country. Passage of this bill, with \nthe enhanced authorization it contains for the Savannah Harbor \nExpansion Project, will be the culmination of years of work for the \nState of Georgia and project stakeholders--and my entire time serving \nin the Georgia congressional delegation.\n  The idea to expand the Port of Savannah was in its infancy when I \nfirst came to Congress in 1994. The Port of Savannah had just been \ndeepened, and we realized then that it was not enough; more and bigger \nships were coming in. In 1996 a reconnaissance study was authorized to \ndetermine whether the port should be deepened even further. While the \nneed to deepen the channel to accommodate larger ships has been a \nconstant issue, the port itself has been able to operate and grow \nthrough its own innovation--Georgia ingenuity at its best. In fact, \nbetween 2000 and 2005, the Port of Savannah was recognized as the \nfastest growing seaport in the country. The port continues to grow and \nis consistently breaking its own records.\n  In 2006, the Panama Canal expansion was approved by a national \nreferendum in Panama, officially kicking off the race in Savannah to \nget this project under construction. The people of Georgia told us this \nproject needed to happen. All levels of the government--local, State, \nand Federal--from all political persuasions agreed and have given their \nutmost to this project. It has been my No. 1 economic priority for \nGeorgia the entire time I have been in office.\n  The WRDA bill in 1999 gave the authorization to expand the port, and \nwhile there were cheers all around from those of us in the \ncongressional delegation, little did we know of the tremendous battles \nyet to come. All the way until the present, every step has been a \nstruggle. We have jumped 15 years of hurdles to bring this project to \nfruition.\n  I even recall one instance where we thought we had things taken care \nof from the standpoint of all the mitigation that needed to be done \nwith the port, which is located on the Savannah River. We then found \nout there was an endangered species that needed to be\n\n[[Page S3278]]\n\nprotected because the city of Augusta, which is 136 miles upstream, is \nalso located on the Savannah River. We then had to go back, have \nanother study done, and after months and months we finally came up with \na fish ladder project that was to be installed in Augusta, 136 miles \nnorth of the Savannah Port, but we got that done.\n  We still may face more obstacles as we guide this project to \ncompletion, but the fact remains that for every $1 invested in the \nproject, the Nation will see a nearly $6 return. For Georgia, the value \nof SHEP is almost immeasurable. The port already supports some 300,000 \njobs across our State, and when post-Panamax vessels start rolling into \nSavannah, the economic benefits will increase dramatically.\n  Georgia has always been a great place to do business, and a big \nreason for that is we have had strong leadership at the State level--\nleaders who understand that making investments in economic development \nprojects can give great returns.\n  In this case the Port of Savannah is an epicenter of worldwide \ncommercial traffic. The imports and exports associated with this port \nexpansion mean that jobs will be created not only in my home State but \nall throughout the country.\n  Congress has once again agreed with us that SHEP is a vital project \nfor our country. Now that we have completed our work, it is imperative \nthat the administration carry through with its commitments.\n  The Project Partnership Agreement, which is a document that details \nthe construction plans for a Corps of Engineers project, needs to be \nfinalized and signed immediately. I have complete faith in the ability \nof the Corps and the Georgia Ports Authority to get that document \nfinished as soon as possible--based on their commitments to me and \nSenator Isakson.\n  We didn't close the book on this project today, but we did jump \nforward by several chapters. Ensuring the appropriate language was \nincluded in this bill to move SHEP forward and voting today for this \nbill have been the highlight of my final year in Congress and represent \nthe culmination of years of work by me, Senator Isakson, as well as \nmany others.\n  I want to state my thanks once more to Chairwoman Boxer and Ranking \nMember Vitter for working with us on this matter. Their tireless \nefforts have done more for this country and for Georgia than they may \nrealize.\n  The work of those Senators and their staffs as well as the work of \nChairman Shuster and Ranking Member Rahall and their staffs on the \nHouse side will be felt by users of waterways on rivers and lakes, by \nbarge operators, commercial and recreational boaters, by cities, \ncounties, and States, and by everyone in this country who uses and \nconsumes water.\n  This bill represents the fulfillment of a commitment I made to my \nconstituents to see the harbor deepening through, and I look forward to \nthe day when I am in Savannah and watch a big shovel go underwater to \nstart deepening that port once again.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum call.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/22/senate-section/article/S3278-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3278-S3284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CHINESE TRADE PRACTICES\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I rise this afternoon to speak about the \nimpact of this week's announcement that members of China's People's \nLiberation Army hacked into the computer systems owned by Pennsylvania \ncompanies to steal trade secrets on our trade policy.\n  As we all know, a grand jury in Pittsburgh indicted five individuals \nfor hacking into several companies' computers and a labor organization, \nUnited Steelworkers, in western Pennsylvania. The companies included \nWestinghouse Electric, Alcoa, U.S. Steel and, as I mentioned, the \nUnited Steelworkers union. According to reports, the individuals in the \nindictment are accused of stealing trade secrets to benefit Chinese \nindustry, which is heavily sponsored by the Chinese Government.\n  This is just the latest example of the unlevel playing field to which \nour domestic firms are subjected. To give an example, Pennsylvania, as \nare many areas around the United States, is experiencing an energy \nrenaissance--Pennsylvania natural gas--which stands to greatly benefit \nthe Commonwealth's economy. For the steel industry, it means the \nopportunity to sell a lot of pipe to natural gas drilling sites. Our \nforeign competitors also see this opportunity and have responded by \naggressively pursuing our market. This competition is expected and \nwould be OK if--if--it was fair. Of course, in this instance it is not.\n  In fact, our domestic steel industry is facing a new crisis. After \nsuccessfully beating back unfair competition from the Chinese, our \ndomestic producers are facing a surge of imports from around the globe. \nAccording to a recent report by the Economic Policy Institute, domestic \nsteel imports increased by almost 13 percent from 2011 to 2013. Without \naction, we stand to lose half a million jobs around the United States \nand some 35,000 in Pennsylvania alone. Just from this action, just from \nthem flooding our markets in a way that is illegal and unfair, half a \nmillion jobs could be lost. We can't afford to send these good-paying \njobs overseas.\n  We should act to level the playing field for our domestic steel \nindustry by aggressively enforcing our trade laws and providing \nessential relief to this critical industry. For too long unfair trade \npractices and economic policies have cost jobs in the Commonwealth of \nPennsylvania and across the country.\n  I will return now to the recent indictment I mentioned at the outset \nof my remarks.\n  This move is further evidence of China's anticompetitive trade \npractices. What I just said is an understatement. These trade practices \nhave taken a dramatic toll on Pennsylvania businesses and pose a threat \nto our national security.\n  The Obama administration has taken steps to crack down on China, but \nwe must also pursue congressional action. We know that currency \nmanipulation continues to take a huge toll on U.S. businesses. Last \nCongress, the Senate passed a tough bill to help level the playing \nfield for our companies by holding countries that undervalue their \ncurrency accountable. The House failed to take up this important bill. \nWe must take action.\n  I am an original cosponsor of the Currency Exchange Rate Oversight \nReform Act of 2013. I call on all Senators to turn our attention to \nthis bill to send a strong message to the Chinese Government that they \ncannot continue to cheat our companies. When China cheats, we lose \njobs. It is that simple. The evidence is overwhelming. Our bipartisan \nbill will help American manufacturers and workers by clarifying that \nour trade enforcement laws can and should be used to address currency \nundervaluation. More broadly, the bill would improve oversight by \nestablishing objective criteria to identify misaligned currencies. \nAlso, it would impose tough consequences for offenders.\n  I believe strongly that before proceeding with our busy trade agenda, \nas some might want to do, and passing additional trade agreements or \nfast-track legislation, we should take a close look at our trade \nenforcement policies first, including aggressively addressing currency \nmanipulation.\n  Pennsylvania companies are some of the best in the world, and I am \ncommitted to cracking down on unfair trade practices that hurt their \nability to compete.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Markey). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted \nto finish this speech.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Religious Liberty\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about our Nation's \nfirst freedom--religious liberty.\n\n[[Page S3279]]\n\n  Last week a court in Sudan sentenced a woman to death for converting \nfrom Islam to Christianity and gave her just days to recant. Sadly, \nthis sort of tragic oppression is common across the globe.\n  The Pew Research Center says that three-quarters of the world's \npeople live where restrictions on religion are high or very high and \nthat religious hostilities have been increasing for years.\n  In the last 10 years the number of countries on the Commission on \nInternational Religious Freedom's watch list has grown by 150 percent. \nSimply put, religious freedom is increasingly in peril around the \nglobe.\n  When compared to the rest of the world, some might think that \nreligious liberty in America is alive and well. But, in truth, basic \nreligious freedom is under attack here at home. Professor Thomas Berg \nwrites that ``establishing freedom of religion as both constitutional \nprinciple and social reality is among America's greatest contributions \nto the world.'' But we have to ask ourselves whether meaningful \nreligious liberty is still such a reality in American society and \nwhether our Nation is still making that essential contribution to a \nworld that needs it now more than ever.\n  Hundreds of books, studies, papers, articles, and court decisions \nhave explored various aspects, nuances, and implications of religious \nfreedom. In the coming days and weeks, I will explore some of these \nissues in greater detail. Today I wish to speak about the definition \nand importance of religious freedom in America as seen both in history \nand in four important documents.\n  For 170 years before Thomas Jefferson penned the Declaration of \nIndependence, one religious society after another came to America so \nthat they could live their faith. Puritans, Congregationalists, Roman \nCatholics, Jews, Quakers, Baptists, Presbyterians, and Methodists had \nall found refuge in the British Colonies by the time the United States \nwas born. Roger Williams founded Rhode Island as a haven for religious \ndissenters. William Penn established religious liberty in the colony \nthat bears his name.\n  From its earliest days, religious freedom in America has been freedom \nnot only of belief but also of behavior. In addition to our Nation's \nearly heritage, four key documents establish the same understanding of \nreligious freedom as encompassing both belief and behavior in both \nprivate and public spheres.\n  The first document is the U.S. Constitution. The First Amendment \nprotects the free exercise of religion, a phrase that on its face \nplainly includes conduct as well as belief. It is a phrase that had \nbeen in use for more than a century when America's Founders placed it \nin the First Amendment. The plain meaning of this phrase, as well as \nits history, is simply incompatible with the view that our \nconstitutional freedom of religion is limited to the profession of \nbelief and somehow excludes religious conduct.\n  As Professor Michael McConnell, director of the Constitutional Law \nCenter at Stanford and perhaps America's leading scholar of religious \nliberty has shown, such an artificial and cramped view is \nunsupportable. By its own terms our First Amendment protects both \nreligious faith and action.\n  The second document is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, \nwhich the United States signed in 1984. Article 18 states that every \nperson has the fundamental ``right to freedom of thought, conscience \nand religion,'' and that ``this right includes . . . freedom, either \nalone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest \nhis religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance.''\n  Plainly stated, religious liberty by its very nature encompasses both \nbelief and behavior. In articulating broad principles of basic human \nrights, the authors of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights \nacknowledge that it is meaningless to have one without the other.\n  The third document is the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. In 1990, \nthe U.S. Supreme Court held that government needs only a rational basis \nfor laws that burden but do not target the free exercise of religion. \nThat decision changed decades of Supreme Court precedent that had \nrequired a compelling reason for laws that burden the exercise of \nreligion.\n  This shift was not just some legalistic or semantic exercise. If \ngovernment needs only a rational justification for burdening the \nexercise of religion, it could do so essentially at will, but if \ngovernment must have a compelling reason, it must respect the \nfundamental liberty and may burden it only when absolutely necessary.\n  By shifting from one standard to the other, the Supreme Court made it \ndramatically easier for government to burden the free exercise of \nreligion. Congress responded to the Supreme Court's decision with the \nReligious Freedom Restoration Act, or RFRA, which established the \ncompelling standard. It passed the House unanimously by voice vote and \nthe Senate by a vote of 97 to 3.\n  I was the primary Republican cosponsor of the Religious Freedom \nRestoration Act in the Senate. In all of our discussions about RFRA, \nboth Democrats and Republicans were united on one fundamental \nprinciple, the right of all Americans to the free exercise of religion \nshould be equally protected.\n  I remember when I went to Ted Kennedy, I said: You are going to be on \nthis bill with me.\n  He said: No, I am not.\n  I said: Yes, you are.\n  To his credit, he came on the bill. By the time we articulated on the \nfloor and afterward when it was signed by President Clinton at the \nWhite House, on the White House south lawn, one of the biggest boosters \nwas my friend Ted Kennedy.\n  The fact is I will make that point again. As the primary sponsor of \nthe Religious Freedom Restoration Act in the Senate, in all of our \ndiscussions about RFRA, both Democrats and Republicans were united on \none fundamental principle: the right of all Americans to the free \nexercise of religion should be equally protected.\n  Each religious claim should be judged by the same standard as every \nother, a standard that reflects the true importance of religious \nfreedom. We rejected amendments that would have excluded some religious \nclaims or favored others.\n  In October 1993 I spoke in favor of RFRA on the Senate floor, \nexplaining that the bill would restore to all Americans protections of \nthe free exercise of their religious conviction. In fact, I stated \ndirectly that exempting anyone from the basic principle of free \nexercise would set a dangerous precedent.\n  The fourth and final document is the International Religious Freedom \nAct enacted in 1998. The House passed it by an overwhelming bipartisan \nmajority. The Senate followed suit by a vote of 98 to 0. This law \nestablished the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, and \ndeclared that ``the right to freedom of religion undergirds the very \norigin and existence of the United States.''\n  It cited the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and reaffirmed yet \nagain that religious freedom necessarily includes both belief and \npractice, individually or collectively, in public or in private. As the \nU.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom has explained, by \nits very nature religious liberty is ``a broad, inclusive right, \nsweeping in scope, embracing the full range of thought, belief, and \nbehavior.''\n  It is central to human identity and dignity. It is essential to \nindividual and social well-being. It is beneficial to political, \neconomic, and civic life. Religious freedom is a fundamental \nconstitutional liberty as well as a universal human right.\n  In America religious liberty has always included both the freedom to \nbelieve and the freedom to act on that belief, the protection to do so \ncollectively as well as individually, and the right to do so publicly \nas well as privately. Those basic tenets form the only proper standard \nby which to assess the state of religious freedom in America today.\n  Unfortunately, there is much cause for concern. Let me share a few \ndisturbing examples. The equal and universal application of religious \nliberty is now in doubt. Congress was united when enacting the \nReligious Freedom Restoration Act that the right to exercise religion \nfreely belongs to everyone and should be protected by the same rigorous \nstandard in each case.\n  When balanced against important government interests, some religious \nclaims would win and others would lose, but a rigorous legal standard \nthat\n\n[[Page S3280]]\n\ncreates a high hurdle for government action that burdens religion must \nbe applied universally, since the free exercise of religion is a \nfundamental right of all Americans.\n  That conviction, however, is unraveling. This year marks the 50th \nanniversary of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Title VII of that landmark \nlaw prohibits workplace discrimination based on religion and requires \nthat employers reasonably accommodate the religious practices of \nemployees. The Supreme Court, however, interpreted the ``reasonably'' \nso broadly that the exception swallowed the rule and workers have been \nwithout this legal protection ever since.\n\n  Legislation called the Workplace Religious Freedom Act was introduced \nto reestablish legal protection and accommodation for religious \nworkers. Originally, it applied this protection to all religious \nclaims, just as RFRA required. It would balance the right to religious \nexercise with the legitimate needs of employers, but the most recent \nversion of this legislation introduced in the 112th Congress abandoned \nuniversal applicability and instead would protect some religious claims \nbut not others.\n  Rather than allowing religious claims of all varieties to stand or \nfall under the same standard, some claims were covered and others were \nexcluded from that standard altogether. This is not the only example of \nreligious liberty under attack. Among its many other maladies, \nObamaCare likewise struck a blow to the free religious exercise of \nreligion.\n  Although President Obama has called religious freedom a universal \nhuman right, his administration apparently paid that fundamental \nliberty no regard when drafting ObamaCare. Likewise, the Religious \nFreedom Restoration Act plainly states that its basic religious \nprotections apply to every future Federal statute. Yet the Obama \nadministration gave no consideration whatsoever to such religious \nfreedom in formulating the President's signature law, ObamaCare.\n  As a result, dozens of lawsuits have challenged ObamaCare's \nrequirement that employers provided no-cost health insurance coverage \nfor abortifacient drugs and devices as a violation of RFRA's plain \nprotections. Two of those cases are before the Supreme Court, one from \nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit and one from the Third \nCircuit.\n  In the face of its clearly universal requirement, the Obama \nadministration nevertheless argued that the Religious Freedom \nRestoration Act does not apply to these plaintiffs. Despite the \nstatute's plain text, Obama officials insist that the law does not \napply to all cases after all. One step at a time, they seek to exclude \nclasses of citizens from the basic protections of religious liberty.\n  My final two examples involve recent Supreme Court decisions. In \nHosanna-Tabor v. EEOC, the Supreme Court unanimously held that the \nFirst Amendment's protection for the free exercise of religion allows a \nchurch to choose its own ministers. The Obama administration argued \ninstead that civil rights statutes trump the Constitution and allow \njudges to dictate to churches who may serve as ministers.\n  In fact, as the Supreme Court described it, Obama administration \nlawyers were so dismissive of religious freedom that they argued \nchurches were no different in this regard than labor unions or social \nclubs. Can you imagine that? To the Obama administration, the First \nAmendment and its protection for the free exercise of religion \napparently offers no real protection at all. Thankfully, the Supreme \nCourt responded this way: ``We cannot accept the remarkable view that \nthe Religion Clauses have nothing to say about a religious \norganization's freedom to select its own ministers.''\n  Finally, just 2 weeks ago, the Supreme Court held that allowing \ncitizens to offer a prayer of their choice to open a town meeting is \nnot an establishment of religion, but four Justices joined a dissenting \nopinion arguing that only certain prayers, using certain language, in a \ncertain pattern, would achieve a certain level of diversity and \ntherefore be permissible. Four Justices actually believe Federal judges \nmay dictate the content and presentation of prayers offered by private \ncitizens.\n  I can offer many more examples of how our Nation's cherished \nreligious freedom is under attack, with forces seeking to limit, \nregulate, manipulate, and undermine the most basic natural and \nconstitutional rights we possess.\n  I mentioned at the outset that three-quarters of the world's \npopulation lives under substantial religious restriction. Here at home, \nthe same percentage of Americans believes that religion is losing its \ninfluence in American life. Liberal politicians, secular activists, and \neven some judges are seeking to reduce religion to what Justice Antonin \nScalia described as ``a purely personal avocation that can be indulged \nentirely in secret, like pornography, in the privacy of one's room.''\n  It is no wonder that nearly one-quarter of Americans say religious \nfreedom is more threatened than any other First Amendment freedom. \nThese recent efforts mark a radical departure from the religious \nfreedom that took root in our colonial experience, was nourished by the \nDeclaration of Independence, earned a primary place among our \nconstitutional liberties, and has been generously applied by \ngenerations of Americans.\n  The notion that religious freedom belongs only to some, even then \nonly in private, stands in direct opposition to our traditions, our \nlaws, and our beloved Constitution. Some peoples throughout the world \nmay be bound by oppressive governments that strictly regulate who may \nexpress their religious faith, when they may practice the tenets of \ntheir faith, and where they may act according to their religious \nconvictions.\n  But that is not America's heritage, and it must not be our future. \nInstead, America must once again be a beacon of religious freedom for \nall--protecting rights of conscience at home and promoting religious \nliberty throughout the world--and I expect it to be that.\n  I am hopeful our courts will come to their senses--the ones that \naren't there--and realize this was listed as the first freedom in the \nBill of Rights for a very good reason; that is, because our Founding \nFathers knew how important religion is to a nation that wants to be \nfree.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n             Unanimous Consent Request--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. REID. There have been a number of inquiries and statements made \ntoday, one by the Chamber of Commerce, saying the reason that Stanley \nFischer, the Vice Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal \nReserve System, hasn't been done is because of me. Try that one on for \nsize.\n  That is what happens around here. Here is a man who has been approved \nwith a very strong vote, a strong vote, bipartisan vote, to be a member \nof the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. He is \neminently qualified, nationally and internationally. You can't become \nvice chair until you become a member of the board.\n  Janet Yellen has called, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, and \nsaid: It would really be important. He has administrative duties that \nwe need his help with.\n  So I have made inquiry with my Republican colleagues: Why don't we do \nhim? We have already approved him. But we have a situation around here \nwhere no one gets approved. We will eat up time, this will take hours--\nwasted time--and then we will approve him. In the meantime, all we do \nis eat up the taxpayers' time.\n  Anyway, without further dialog from me, I would simply say that the \nChamber of Commerce and others should understand every person on this \nside of the aisle would approve him in a second. I would do it by \nunanimous consent. I would have a vote as soon as we can, which, \nwithout having filed cloture, wouldn't be until we get back a week from \nMonday.\n\n\n              Unanimous Consent Request--Calendar No. 767\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session to consider Calendar No. 767, the nomination of \nStanley Fischer\n\n[[Page S3281]]\n\nto be Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve \nSystem for a term of 4 years; that the nomination be confirmed, the \nmotion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, with \nno intervening action or debate; that no further motions be in order to \nthe nomination; that any related statements be printed in the Record; \nand that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action \nand the Senate then resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Paul, I will have to \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. May the Record be spread that Harry Reid, who is being \nblamed for this nomination not being put forward, is not at fault. I \ndon't mind taking the fall for some things--and I probably have \ndeserved a few things--but not this.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I note for the record that I support Mr. \nFischer for this position, but there is a legitimate objection by a \nSenator on our side that I had to advance. I hope we can resolve these \nproblems, but I appreciate the distinguished majority leader's attempt \nto do this today.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                        The Affordable Care Act\n\n  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, I want to tell my colleagues a story \nabout Charlene Dill.\n  On March 21 Charlene Dill was supposed to bring her three children \nover to the South Orlando home of her best friend Kathleen. The two \nfriends had cultivated a really close relationship since 2008. They \nshared every resource they had from debit card pins to transportation \nto babysitting to house keys. They helped one another out. They \nessentially had become each other's safety net.\n  As Kathleen described it, they hustled. They picked up short-term \nwork. They went to every event they could get free tickets to for their \nkids. They lived the high life on the lowdown. They cleaned houses for \nfriends just so they could afford the daily necessities of life. They \nwere the quintessential working poor, and they existed in the shadows \nof this economic recovery that is yet to reach a lot of average people \nout there.\n  On March 21, when Dill never showed up with her three kids, who often \ncame over to play with Kathleen's 9-year-old daughter, Kathleen was \nsurprised she didn't even get a phone call from her friend Charlene. \nShe shot her a text message--something along the lines of ``thanks for \nditching me''--without knowing what had really happened.\n  Charlene, who was estranged from her husband, had been raising her 3 \nchildren alone--ages, 3, 7, and 9. She had picked up another odd job to \ntry to pay the bills. She was selling vacuums on commission for Rainbow \nVacuums.\n  On that day, in order to make enough money to survive and--as you \nwill understand--keep herself alive, she made two last-minute \nappointments. At one of those appointments in Kissimmee, she collapsed \nand died on a stranger's floor.\n  Charlene had a documented heart condition for which she took \nmedication, but she often could not afford the medication, and her \nfriend Kathleen often had to turn to crowd-funding Web sites to help \nraise the money that her friend Charlene needed to pay for her heart \nmedication. Charlene was the working poor, but she was also among the \nuninsured. After her death, her friend Kathleen used that same crowd-\nfunding method that she used to occasionally pay for her friend's \nmedication to pay for Charlene's funeral.\n  Florida has made the decision not to expand Medicaid coverage under \nthe Affordable Care Act. They have made a decision--for political \nreasons--to keep hundreds of thousands of people such as Charlene among \nthe ranks of the uninsured. The consequences are for many such as \nCharlene absolutely deadly.\n  Charlene died because she was on the outside of our health care \nsystem. Occasionally she would get to see a doctor and occasionally she \nwould get the medication she needed for her condition--in part--because \nshe had one good friend who went out of her way to try to help \nCharlene.\n  The reality is that there are 5.7 million people all across this \ncountry who have been denied the chance to get health care through \nMedicaid simply because their Governors or their State legislatures \nhave decided to score a political point against a President whom they \ndon't like by refusing Federal dollars in order to expand Medicaid, and \nthat is what this is all about. This is not about good policy, this is \nnot about health care, and this certainly is not about finances. This \nis just about a bunch of really angry Republicans that don't want to \nparticipate in a health care reform law passed by Democrats even though \nthey are essentially giving away the money of their constituents.\n  The first reason you should do this is because it keeps people such \nas Charlene alive. A 2002 Harvard study of 3 States that expanded \nMedicaid--Arizona, Maine, and New York--showed that the expansion of \nMedicaid in those States was responsible for a 6-percent reduction in \nmortality as compared to other States. It found that for every 500,000 \nadults that gained Medicaid coverage, we prevent 3,000 deaths a year.\n  I am not really good with quick math, but that is 3,000 deaths \nprevented for 500,000 people covered by Medicaid. We are talking about \n5.7 million adults that are being denied Medicaid because of these \npolitical decisions; that is a lot of people who are dying needlessly \nevery year. That is the first reason you should do it, because it is \nthe right and compassionate thing to do.\n  The second reason you should do it is because people in States such \nas Virginia or Texas--there are 1.2 million people in Texas alone. \nThere are 1.2 million people who could have health care insurance but \ndon't have health insurance in one State because the Governor and \nlegislature don't like President Obama.\n  This is also about those constituents essentially giving their money \naway to other States. The message to people in States such as Florida, \nVirginia, and Texas is that you are funding people getting insurance in \nother States because the Federal Government is contributing almost the \nentire cost of this Medicaid expansion. Texas and Florida's dollars are \ngoing to Washington and being spent to subsidize the health care of \nsomebody else. It does not make any sense from a health care standpoint \nand it certainly doesn't make any sense from a fiscal standpoint. It is \nnot just the taxpayers and patients who are getting hurt, but it is all \nthe health care providers as well.\n  An Urban Institute study found that hospitals across the country are \nbeing denied $294 billion because of this refusal to expand Medicaid. \nThe Presiding Officer knows this because she has worked in and around \nhealth care policy her entire life. This idea that denying people \nhealth care insurance denies them health care is patently false. They \nget health care. They just don't get it until they are so sick they \nshow up at the emergency room door and their condition is at a crisis \npoint, and then that costs infinitely more. All of this money we are \nspending could be spent in a different place, such as on preventive \ncare, instead of on crisis care.\n  With a new Secretary of HHS, there is an opportunity for these States \nto think differently. From the beginning, HHS has been incredibly \nwilling to be flexible with Governors who are not quite sure of the \npolitics of joining in the ACA but know it is the right thing to do. \nStates such as Arkansas, Iowa, and Pennsylvania have come up with \ninnovative programs in which they take the Medicaid expansion dollars \nand instead of using them to expand State-based Medicaid, they use \nthose\n\n[[Page S3282]]\n\ndollars to help people buy private coverage. It seems to make a lot of \nsense to me.\n  At her confirmation hearing, Ms. Burwell said she was willing to \ncontinue to be as flexible as she possibly could with States that want \nto explore these innovative methods. Hopefully, with a new Secretary \ncoming through the doors at HHS, maybe this is a new moment for these \nStates to take another look at Medicaid expansion because this is just \na matter of conscience.\n  Madam President, 5.7 million people are going without health care and \npotentially dying, as Charlene Dill did, simply because of politics.\n  David from Virginia wrote:\n\n       I am the coverage gap. I am a single 41-year-old male. I \n     save Medicaid thousands of dollars per month by caring for my \n     99-year-old grandmother at home without pay, rather than \n     place her in a nursing home at Medicaid's expense. I do not \n     qualify for Medicaid even though I have a zero income. I have \n     to cross the state line, into Kentucky to receive potentially \n     lifesaving cancer screenings and hopefully receive treatment \n     if I get bad news. Virginia Republicans hate the president \n     and governor so much, they are willing to let thousands of us \n     die. It is high time that these delegates place human lives \n     ahead of party politics and do what is right, for a change!\n\n  Eight million people have signed up through the exchanges. Despite \nthese decisions by Governors and Republican State legislatures, 5 to 6 \nmillion more have been added to Medicaid, and 3 million young adults \nhave coverage for the first time.\n  Prices to the Federal Government are falling. We are spending \ntrillions less than we thought we would spend on health care because of \nthe Affordable Care Act. Quality is increasing. The number of \nreadmissions to hospitals and hospital-acquired infections are \ndecreasing because we are starting to pay for outcomes instead of \npaying for performance.\n  People are figuring out that the Affordable Care Act works, and that \nis why there are fewer Republicans coming to the floor of the Senate \nand the House complaining about it, and that is why the Koch brothers \nand others have stopped running all of these ads about the Affordable \nCare Act.\n  The Affordable Care Act works, but it only works if leaders actually \ntry to implement it. It doesn't work if you ignore it for political \nspite, and that is what is happening in State legislatures and \nGovernors' mansions all across the country.\n  We have a new Secretary of HHS and a new willingness of a lot of \nRepublican Governors, including Mike Pence in Indiana, to take a look \nat trying to reverse this reality for 5\\1/2\\ million people who--if not \nfor the political actions of their State leaders--could also figure \nout, as millions and millions of others are doing on a daily basis \nacross the country, that the Affordable Care Act works.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I come to the floor after having just \nheard my friend and colleague from Connecticut talk about the health \ncare law. As a doctor, I am always happy to hear about people who are \ngetting better care. My concern is that there are so many people across \nthis country who have been hurt as a result of this health care law \nthat I feel compelled to speak about so many of the side effects of the \nPresident's health care law and families who are seeing the government \nwaste massive amounts of money that is not going for care. It is not \nhelping people actually get better. It is not giving them the care they \nneed from a doctor they choose at lower costs, which is what the \nPresident promised when he said premiums would drop by $2,500.\n  I heard the President, as well as my colleague here today, say that \nthis law will help keep people out of emergency rooms and they will go \nto primary care doctors instead. So I feel compelled to come to the \nfloor to share with my colleagues a study that just came out on \nWednesday, and perhaps some Members of the Senate who weren't aware of \nit will be made aware that the emergency room visits actually have been \ngoing up, not down, despite the law. This was the headline in the Wall \nStreet Journal this past Wednesday, May 21: ``ER Visits Rise Despite \nLaw. Health Act Isn't Cutting Volume.''\n  I will point out a couple of things mentioned in this article. It \nstarts off:\n\n       Early evidence suggests that emergency rooms have become \n     busier since the Affordable Care Act expanded insurance \n     coverage this year, despite the law's goal of reducing \n     unnecessary care in ERs.\n\n  My colleague said emergency rooms aren't going to be needed as much. \nWell, despite the law's goal of reducing unnecessary care in ERs, what \nwe see is an expensive side effect of the President's health care law.\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       Democrats who designed the 2010 health law hoped it would \n     do the opposite. They wanted to give the uninsured better \n     access to primary-care doctors who could treat routine \n     ailments and prevent chronic diseases, with the intent of \n     keeping patients out of the ER. The median ER charge was more \n     than $1,200 for the most frequent outpatient diagnoses in a \n     study of over 8,000 ER visits in the years 2006-08, said a \n     2013 report funded in part by the National Institutes of \n     Health.\n\n  This is a report by the NIH.\n\n       Instead, the ER doctor group's research and several other \n     recent studies suggest that people who gain private insurance \n     are more likely to seek emergency care.\n\n  Not more likely to go to a family physician, not more likely to go to \ntheir own internist or pediatrician; more likely to go to the emergency \nroom--the most expensive place for care--despite what the President \ntold the American people.\n\n       Among the reasons is that a shortage of primary-care \n     providers in some regions has made it difficult for patients \n     to get appointments.\n\n  So why is there a shortage? Well, if the President's health care law \nactually focused on training physicians, putting money into educating \nand training more providers, instead of putting all of this money into \nhiring IRS agents to examine Americans' tax returns to make sure they \ncheck the box that says they have insurance and can provide proof of \nthat, perhaps we wouldn't have these problems. But now we are seeing a \nvery expensive side effect of the President's health care law.\n  While we can celebrate people who are helped by the law, there are so \nmany people being hurt by the law in every State around this great \ncountry. We heard about a family from Connecticut who has benefited \nfrom the law. There are many who have been hurt.\n  There is a couple in Sharon, CT, according to NBC Connecticut. They \nwere dropped, according to the headline, from their health care plan. \nIt says:\n\n       A Sharon couple says they are running out of options after \n     being dropped from their ObamaCare insurance plan. John and \n     Dawn DiMarco signed up for an Affordable Care Act plan \n     through the state health insurance exchange during open \n     enrollment. They received their insurance card and were \n     covered but their bill was thousands of dollars more than \n     advertised.\n\n  What could happen there?\n  It says:\n\n       They spent weeks going back and forth with various State \n     agencies and the insurance company to try to get answers.\n\n  This is dated May 13 of this year.\n\n       Then, this month, their carrier, Anthem BlueCross \n     BlueShield, sent them a cancellation notice. The DiMarcos \n     have been so frustrated with trying to get answers that they \n     posted a sign outside their home that reads--\n\n  This is in Connecticut--\n\n       ``We have no insurance because Access Health has a computer \n     glitch.''\n\n  It's stressful, says Mr. DiMarco. It's overwhelming.\n  So why did this happen?\n  Well, NBC Connecticut contacted Access Health Connecticut, and they \ntold them that it had to do with a computer issue with a vendor, and \nwhen this gentleman went back to change information during the \nenrollment process, a new form was sent to the insurance company, but \nthat form didn't include the couple's subsidy. So the form paperwork \nwas wrong.\n\n  How could this happen? Is it just this one DiMarco couple whom this \nhas\n\n[[Page S3283]]\n\nhappened to in Connecticut? Not according to a front-page story in the \nWashington Post the other day. The headline is ``Federal health-care \nsubsidies may be too high or too low for more than 1 Million \nAmericans''--paying incorrect subsidies to more than 1 million \nAmericans for their health plans, and the government has been unable so \nfar to fix the errors.\n  The President of the United States goes on TV and says to the \nDemocrats: Forcefully defend and be proud.\n  Who in America can be proud of the mess the President and his \nadministration have made of the Web site and this health care bill? \nOnce again, we see, as the Washington Post points out, important \naspects of the Web site remain defective. They cannot fix this. \nActually, I am not even sure how hard they are trying. People have been \nsending in paperwork. They are expecting, perhaps, by the end of the \nsummer to be able to address the problem that there are 1 million \nAmericans whose Federal health care subsidies may be either too high or \ntoo low.\n  ``Forcefully defend and be proud.'' Where are they? Where are these \ndefenders? It is sad because the idea is this is to actually help \npeople get care. What people have gotten is headaches and heartaches \nand one problem after another.\n  It is also interesting, as a doctor who has been very involved with \npreventive care and working on early detection of problems and as \nsomebody who has been the medical director of the Wyoming health \nfairs--I think it is important to screen people for problems. It is \ninteresting. The New York Times even reported in an article written on \nApril 30 on the problem with the health care law that it favors \nscreening over diagnosis. So here is one of the issues that come into \nplay.\n  My wife is a breast cancer survivor. She has been through three \noperations, chemotherapy twice, radiation, the whole thing. She is now \ncancer free. We are delighted. So I think screening tests are \nimportant. But this is the problem with this law that I believe very \nfew Democrats read--very few of the people who voted for it read. I \nbelieve that about Members of the House and Members of the Senate. I \nread it cover to cover, but I believe many Members who voted for it \nnever read it.\n  They say: Diagnosis is what we offer to those who have no signs or \nsymptoms of disease. Because diagnosis isn't prevention, it is subject \nto deductibles and copays.\n  So if somebody actually has a diagnosis of something, there are \ndeductibles and copays, but if it is just a screening test, no signs or \nsymptoms, then it is covered.\n  The New York Times goes on:\n\n       In other words: A woman over 40 can have a free screening \n     mammogram.\n\n  She shows up and says: I want a free screening mammogram. But if she \nnotices a breast lump and goes to her doctor to have it evaluated, \nwell, then it is not a screening mammogram. Then it is not a free test. \nSo she will pay for the diagnostic mammogram that costs $300.\n  This goes on:\n\n       So the woman at lower risk for cancer--the one with no \n     signs or symptoms of the disease--has an incentive to be \n     tested, while the woman at higher risk--the one with the \n     lump--faces a disincentive.\n\n  So she goes to the doctor. This goes on and says that the problem is \nthey are now pressuring doctors to fraudulently change the paperwork so \nit complies with the screening test and not a diagnostic test. Doctors \ndon't want to do that because they want to be honest. Yet the \nincentives set up in this program are to discourage the woman who finds \na lump from actually going in to have the test, while encouraging \nsomebody off the street to go in and have a similar test. It is a great \nconcern.\n  So when I see a colleague come to the floor to say that the health \ncare law, in his opinion, works--I will tell my colleagues, this is an \nAssociated Press story that says: ``Consumers frustrated by new health \nplans as they find their doctors are not included.'' They can't go to \ntheir doctor.\n  This is a story out of California. Michelle Pool is one of those \ncustomers. Before enrolling in a new health plan on California's \nexchange, she checked whether her longtime primary care doctor was \ncovered. This woman, Michelle Pool--60 years of age, a diabetic; she \nhas had back surgery and a hip replacement--purchased the plan only to \nfind that the insurer was mistaken; the doctor wasn't included. So her \n$352-a-month gold plan, she said, was cheaper than what she had paid \nunder her husband's insurance and it seemed like a good deal because of \nher numerous preexisting conditions.\n  I understand preexisting conditions as the husband of a woman who has \nbeen through breast cancer treatment. This goes on to say:\n\n       But after her insurance card came in the mail, the Vista, \n     California resident learned her doctor wasn't taking her new \n     insurance.\n\n  It goes on to say, quoting this woman:\n\n       ``It's not fun when you've had a doctor for years and years \n     that you can confide in and he knows you,'' Pool said. ``I'm \n     extremely discouraged. I'm stuck.''\n\n  This is an American who is stuck and hurt by the health care law. It \ngoes on to say:\n\n       The dilemma undercuts President Obama's--\n\n  This is an Associated Press article--\n\n       The dilemma undercuts President Obama's 2009 pledge that: \n     ``If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your \n     doctor, period.''\n\n  The President said: ``period.'' But one of the side effects of the \nPresident's health care law is that people are continuing to lose their \ndoctors.\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       Consumer frustration over losing doctors comes as the Obama \n     administration is still celebrating a victory with more than \n     8 million enrollees in its first year.\n\n  There are astronomical concerns that people across the country are \nexpressing about this health care law. And yet--and yet--we see one \nMember of the other party coming to the floor and saying: Oh, it is \nworking.\n  The American people do not believe it is.\n  People get insurance through work. The laws are interesting. This is \na story from Ohio about the cost because that is what really people \nwere concerned about when we wanted to do health care reform; it was to \nsay let's get the cost down. The President promised families would see \na $2,500 reduction in the cost of their insurance policies in a year \nonce all of this was implemented. But one of the side effects is \nactually higher premiums. This article talks about a man who owns a \npopular brew pub in Cleveland. He has fewer than 50 full-time \nemployees. So he is classified under the health care law as a small \nbusiness, which means he does not actually have to provide health \ninsurance to his employees. But he has been doing so. He has been doing \nso since he opened this pub a number of years ago, and he has done it \nin spite of some fairly significant jumps in the cost of the insurance.\n  He said: ``They just seemed to keep going up every year.''\n  He opened this pub in 2009. One year he got an increase of 38 \npercent; another it was 11 percent.\n  The article says: ``This year, under the Affordable Care Act, he saw \nanother hike--this one about 20 percent.'' So he is seeing higher \npremiums. He said: ``It just seems odd that we get such a drastic price \nincrease when nothing has really changed with us as far as our \nemployees and health issues.''\n\n       Most of the workers at [his place] are in their 20s and \n     30s. They are healthy, enthusiastic about their jobs. . . .\n\n  They like the fact that they get insurance, but they are getting \npriced out of the market. That is the concern about this: the health \ncare law is making premiums go up.\n  From today, Thursday, May 22, The Hill newspaper, right here in \nWashington, DC: ``Premium hike drumbeat before Nov. Election Day.''\n  People continue to be shocked by the increases in the cost of their \ninsurance, and they are going to go up again across the country. There \nare a number of reasons for that. We have seen it in North Carolina, \nwhere I expect this is going to be discussed and debated over the next \nmonths.\n\n       Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina. . . .\n\n  This comes from the Herald-Sun in North Carolina: ObamaCare enrollees \nolder, sicker than insurer forecast--older and sicker than what the \nPresident told--actually it was not the President; it was Kathleen \nSebelius, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, when she \ndescribed what she\n\n[[Page S3284]]\n\nthought success would look like in terms of the number of young healthy \npeople who would sign up. It says:\n\n       Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina officials \n     said--\n\n  This is dated May 8--\n\n       . . . that they found that the people who enrolled in the \n     individual Affordable Care Act plans it sold on the online \n     health exchanges were older and sicker than expected.\n       That may mean higher rates--\n\n  Higher premiums--\n\n     for Affordable Care Act plans in the future. . . .\n\n  The insurer's vice president of health policy said: ``[It's] a \nconcern when we think about future premiums.''\n  They have great concerns about the amount things are going to go up. \nThat is not what people want. People wanted affordable care. They \nwanted access to care. They wanted to get the care they need from a \ndoctor they choose at lower cost. What they see is waste--money not \ngoing to help people get care, but money being wasted.\n  I found it interesting coming out of Missouri, a story about how an \nObamaCare contractor pays employees to spend their days doing nothing--\ndoing nothing--paying their employees to do nothing.\n\n       ``A billion dollar government contract involving hundreds \n     of local workers at an ObamaCare processing center. . . . ''\n\n  So these are people hired by the government or a contractor to work \nat an ObamaCare processing center--hundreds of local workers.\n\n       ``But now employees on the inside are stepping forward, \n     asking, Is this why we're broke? Some of them claim to spend \n     most of their day doing nothing,''. . . .\n\n  This is reported in St. Louis.\n\n       The contractor is called Serco and local reporters \n     discovered that, despite there not being any work to be done, \n     the government contractor is still hiring.\n\n  Why would they be hiring? Because they get a percent of the action. \nThat is why they are hiring. They are hiring people to not do anything, \nto take the paycheck. The article continues:\n\n       ``The company is still hiring,'' says a local reporter. ``A \n     current employee wonders why. . . . After providing proof of \n     employment, this . . . employee agreed to speak through the \n     phone with their voice altered. The employee says hundreds of \n     employees spend much of the day staring at computer screens, \n     with little or no work to do.''\n       The reporter asks the employee, ``Are there some days where \n     a data entry person may not process a single application?''\n\n  Not a single application? The person who works there said: ``There \nare weeks''--weeks--``when a data entry person would not process an \napplication.''\n\n       The anonymous employee says the contract gets paid by the \n     federal government per employee hired.\n\n  That is why they are continuing to hire--because the company gets \npaid by the Federal Government per employee hired, which is why it is \nin their interest to have a bunch of employees sitting around all day \ndoing nothing.\n  So I have to feel an obligation, when I hear a statement on the floor \nbeing made that says: Well, a lot fewer people are going to go to the \nemergency room; it is going to save money--that has not happened. \nStudies from emergency room doctors, work from the NIH said it is not \nhappening. The exact opposite has happened--a side effect of the health \ncare law, when we see that people are not able to keep their doctors, \nin spite of the President promising people that if you like your \ndoctor, you can keep your doctor. I feel compelled to come to the floor \nand share that story with those of us who care about care for patients, \nwho care about finding a way to make sure patients get the care they \nneed from a doctor they choose at lower cost. That is what people want. \nThey know what they want. They want access to care. They want \naffordable care. They want care, they want choices, and they want \nquality care.\n  I believe this health care law is turning out to be bad for patients, \nbad for providers--the doctors, the nurses, the paramedics, the nurse \npractitioners--who take care of those patients, and terrible for the \ntaxpayers when we hear stories like this one out of Missouri, which \nsays the employees are being paid to sit around and do nothing, when we \nhear there are a million people who are just waiting to try to get the \ngovernment to correct something that should have been fixed in the \nbeginning, when the President, 4 days before the Web site opened up in \nOctober, said: easier to use than Amazon, cheaper than your cell phone; \nkeep your doctor if you like your doctor--there was so much misleading \nof the American public--and then when he says stand and forcefully \ndefend and be proud of this health care law.\n  I think it is very hard to defend what the President and the \nDemocrats have forced down the throats of the American public, and it \nis very hard to be proud of the kind of abuse and waste in a system \nthat--whatever the intentions--has proven to the American public to be \nsomething they do not want, that they want to have replaced with an \nopportunity to have access, affordability, choice, and quality. By \nadopting proposals in a step-by-step fashion that Republicans have been \npromoting--to deal with those sorts of things of access, affordability, \nchoice, and quality--we can try to ultimately get the American public \nwhat they need and what they asked for in the beginning: the care they \nneed from a doctor they choose at lower costs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, fans of the popular reality television \nseries ``Wild Kingdom'' may recall watching Stan Brock wrestle giant \nanacondas in the Amazon and corral wildebeests in the Serengeti, but \nfor the past three decades, he has been engaged in a very different \nkind of struggle. In 1985, he founded a nonprofit organization known as \nRemote Area Medical, RAM, with the stated goal of ``addressing the \nneedless pain and suffering caused by the lack of healthcare in \nimpoverished, underserved, and isolated areas.'' Since its inception, \nRAM has hosted 724 free medical events in which over 80,000 volunteers \nhave delivered $75 million in free medical, dental and vision care. It \nis not uncommon for patients to travel hundreds of miles to attend one \nof these events or to sleep in their cars while they wait for the free \nclinics to open.\n  Last month, I had the opportunity to witness RAM in action when they \nheld a 3-day medical event at Hug High School in Reno, NV. In the short \ntime I was there, I saw hundreds of Nevadans filter through the clinic \nto receive much needed dental work, vaccinations, eye exams, free \nglasses, mental health screenings, and general medical work ups--all \nwith short waits and at no cost to the patients. The patients attending \nthe clinic were so grateful to finally receive a much needed x ray, \npair of glasses, and many other services. I spoke with many of the \nvolunteers--doctors, nurses, dentists--and they were all thrilled to be \na part something so meaningful that fills a void for individuals who \nhave no other way to access some of these critical services. A similar \nscene played out in Las Vegas earlier in the month, where RAM held a 2-\nday event at Bonanza High School. In total, the RAM team of 597 \nvolunteers served 1,712 patients and provided almost one-half million \ndollars in care during their two expeditions in Nevada last month.\n  RAM was able to bring these events to Nevada because it is one of \nonly a few States that allows licensed medical professionals from other \nStates to volunteer at free medical services events. I have witnessed \nfirsthand the value of these events--both for the patients they serve \nand for those volunteers who want to find a way to donate their \nprofessional expertise in a meaningful way. That is why I am convinced \nthat we need Federal legislation that will allow medical practitioners \nto cross State lines to provide free volunteer care. Senator Boxer has \nbeen working to craft such legislation, and I look forward to \nsupporting her in this effort.\n  Stan Brock's work has been exemplary. Through his efforts, hundreds \nof thousands of people in need of have received proper healthcare--some \nfor the first time in their lives. My own appreciation for RAM was \ncemented as I personally witnessed this noble work. Watching Stan and \nhis team work together to help so many unfortunate Nevadans was a \nmoving experience for me. I thank Stan Brock, RAM, and all of the \nselfless volunteers for giving so much of themselves to those with so \nlittle.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/22/senate-section/article/S3286-4", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3286]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          VETERANS HEALTH CARE\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I come to the floor today in \nrecognition of the approaching Memorial Day holiday to express my \ndeepest gratitude, respect, and appreciation for the men and women of \nour Armed Forces and for our veterans. In order to commemorate our \nvets, the first bill to be marked up and passed out of my \nAppropriations Committee was the Fiscal Year 2015 Military \nConstruction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies bill. I wanted to \nmake sure that there is no question in anyone's mind that veterans are \nmy No. 1 priority.\n  As the chairwoman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I have put \nmoney in the Federal checkbook to improve the veterans health care \nsystem so that wounded and disabled warriors get the care and benefits \nthey need. I have worked to ensure veterans suffering from post-\ntraumatic stress disorder, PTSD, or a traumatic brain injury, TBI, \nreceive better diagnosis and treatment through the Defense Department \nand the VA.\n  In the bill that passed out of my committee today, we established \neven more checks on the VA by including an additional $5 million to \ninvestigate the wait time practices at all VA medical treatment \nfacilities nationwide. Our committee must invoke even more oversight to \nensure that the tragedy that occurred at the Phoenix, AZ VA hospital is \nnot repeated again in other hospitals. The greatest power my committee \nhas is holding the VA accountable by closing the purse strings of their \nbudget. One way we are doing this is by restricting performance bonuses \nfor medical directors, assistant directors, and senior executive \nservices staff until after the inspector general completes its audit on \nwait times at nationwide veterans treatment facilities. We need to \ncontinue to ensure that the VA is being held accountable. That is why \nI, along with a number of my colleagues, sent a letter to President \nObama demanding an investigation by the VA's IG to evaluate the secret \nlists being kept at the Phoenix VA hospital.\n  I have also led the charge to reduce the backlog in processing \nveterans' disability claims. I brought Secretary Shinseki to Baltimore \nto create a sense of urgency to end the backlog by 2015. I used my \npower as chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee to convene a \nhearing with the top brass in the military, VA, and members of the \ncommittee to identify challenges and get moving on solutions. I cut \nacross agencies to break down smokestacks and developed a 10-point \nChecklist for Change enacted as part of the fiscal year 2014 Omnibus \nappropriations bill. This plan includes better funding, better \ntechnology, better training, and better oversight of the VA.\n  I believe we must keep the promises we have made to our veterans. We \ncan do this by giving them the same quality of service they gave us and \nby providing them with the care they deserve.\n  We made a sacred commitment to honor those who served by giving them \nthe benefits they have earned. I will continue to fight for better \nbenefits and treatment for our vets. And I am committed to holding the \nVA accountable through the powers provided to me through the \nAppropriations Committee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/22/senate-section/article/S3286-5", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3286-S3287]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              MEMORIAL DAY\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, on Memorial Day 2014, I will join a \ngrateful nation in paying homage to the men and women of our Armed \nForces\n\n[[Page S3287]]\n\nwho have given their lives to defend this Nation.\n  The people of Mississippi are proud and supportive of those in \nmilitary service. On Memorial Day, citizens all across our State will \njoin other Americans to remember, honor, and say a prayer of \nthanksgiving for those who gave their lives in service to their \ncountry. We will also remember and comfort their families, who mourn \nthe loss of loved ones. We will enjoy the fellowship of our friends and \nneighbors with whom we enjoy the liberty that has been so preciously \nguarded by the fallen.\n  The national day of commemoration that we observe today evolved from \na practice first started in the aftermath of the Civil War. In April \n1866, citizens of Columbus, MS, started what became Decoration Day, \ntime set aside to decorate the graves of Confederate and Union soldiers \nalike. That tradition of honoring all those who have paid the ultimate \nsacrifice continues to this day. It is the right thing to do.\n  While we naturally look back to battles now consigned to history, we \nwill also honor those brave men and women who, in more recent times, \nhave died for their country. This Memorial Day 2014, my State will \nremember Army SPC Terry K.D. Gordon of Shubuta, MS, who lost his life \nin a helicopter accident in Now Bahar, Afghanistan, on December 18, \n2013. We will mourn his loss and honor him for his courage, dedication \nand sacrifice.\n  This Memorial Day should also prompt us to recommit ourselves to \nmeeting our obligations to the men and women who take up arms to \nprotect this great Nation. The serious problems that surround the \ndelivery of benefits and services we owe to our veterans are \nunacceptable. The Department of Veterans Affairs has an important and \nsacred mission to uphold the full faith and trust of our government's \ncommitment to our veterans.\n  As I observe Memorial Day and honor those who have given their lives \nto their country, I will also be mindful of our commitment to protect \nand support veterans and their families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/22/senate-section/article/S3287-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3287]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           SKI AREA RECREATIONAL OPPORTUNITY ENHANCEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I wish to highlight an \nimportant milestone in our work in Congress. I speak of my legislation \nto create year-round, sustainable jobs in mountain communities around \nthe country while expanding opportunities for Americans to enjoy the \ngreat outdoors through the expansion of summer recreational \nopportunities at ski areas. On April 17, 2014, the U.S. Forest Service \nissued its final directives for implementing my Ski Area Recreational \nOpportunity Act, a law that allows and encourages ski areas on national \nforests to offer new activities for all seasons, such as expanded \nhiking and mountain biking, Frisbee golf, climbing walls, mountain \ncoasters, zip lines, ropes courses, special events, and other popular \nactivities.\n  I am proud to have led this bipartisan effort, from my time in the \nHouse, where I first introduced the Ski Area Recreational Opportunity \nEnhancement Act, to here in the Senate, where we saw the president sign \nit into law in 2011. After its passage, I worked with stakeholders and \nthe U.S. Forest Service to make sure that the law's implementation \nempowers site-specific decisions that are appropriate for ski areas and \nlocal communities. This allows for the greatest opportunity for success \nin achieving the bill's main goals: boosting rural economies and \npromoting outdoor recreation. I would like to thank my colleagues \nSenators Feinstein, Heller, and Barrasso for working with me to ensure \nthis would happen.\n  Ski areas across the country and especially in my home State of \nColorado have embraced the new flexibility provided by the Ski Area \nRecreational Opportunity Enhancement Act. Since its passage, they have \nbeen proposing projects to create activities for all seasons. I \nencourage the U.S. Forest Service to quickly review these proposals and \nto reach the best decision for each local project and community. That \nincludes allowing for public input as prescribed by the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act. The local U.S. Forest Service land managers \nhave a strong record of successfully working with ski areas to manage \nthese long-running partnerships and that record is one of the reasons I \nadvocated for a flexible directive empowering local decisionmaking.\n  I want to thank the U.S. Forest Service for finalizing a directive \nthat provides that flexibility.\n  The U.S. Forest Service estimates that expanded recreational \nopportunities at ski areas will increase summer visits to national \nforests by 600,000 people each year, create 600 full or part-time jobs \nand inject nearly $40 million into mountain communities. I think we all \ncan agree these are substantial gains for rural economies and a \ntestament to the importance of these ski areas to the recreation \ncommunity and the American public at large.\n  I also would like to recognize the important support of our other \ncosponsors: Senators Murray, Bennet, Risch, Shaheen, Enzi, Cantwell, \nAyotte, Sanders, Reid, Leahy, and Stabenow. It was a strong bipartisan \neffort and I know we are all eager to see projects get underway to \nbenefit rural economies and the recreating public.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/22/senate-section/article/S3287-2", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3287]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         COOKS FROM THE VALLEY\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I want to commend the \nextraordinary work of Cooks from the Valley, a volunteer organization \ndedicated to supporting our Nation's servicemembers, veterans and their \nfamilies.\n  Cooks from the Valley was established in Bakersfield, CA, by local \nresident Tom Anton, to bring the taste of home cooking to military \nmembers stationed all over the world.\n  What first began with one person in Bakersfield has grown to a \ndiverse group of service-minded volunteers from coast to coast bound by \none common goal: to say thank you to the men and women who serve in the \nU.S. Armed Forces.\n  Our military members and their families have made tremendous \nsacrifices and they deserve nothing less than the full and enduring \nsupport of a grateful nation. As co-chair of the Senate Military Family \nCaucus, I want to express my deepest gratitude to everyone at Cooks \nfrom the Valley--Mr. Anton, the volunteers, and many community \nsupporters for their steadfast support of our servicemembers, veterans, \nand their families.\n  These dedicated Americans generously volunteer their time and \nresources to travel to all corners of the globe, providing our \nservicemembers with a taste of home that has boosted the spirits and \nfilled the stomachs of those who put their lives on the line each and \nevery day in service to our Nation. Cooks from the Valley's unique way \nof giving back to our military men and women should be an inspiration \nto us all.\n  As Americans, we have an obligation to give back to those who give so \nmuch for us. For many years, Cooks from the Valley has worked to \nfulfill this responsibility and I know they will continue to make a \ndifference in the lives of our military families for many years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/22/senate-section/article/S3287-3", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3287-S3288]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MILITARY APPRECIATION MONTH\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I wish to recognize our military \nservicemembers, their families, and all veterans who have sacrificed in \nthe service of this great country. After a long winter, Americans are \nfinally enjoying the outdoors and spending precious time with their \nloved ones this month. But we should always remember that we enjoy \nthese freedoms because the Guard, Reserve, and Active members of the \nU.S. military remain diligent, ready and willing to serve and \nsacrifice.\n  We celebrate our 15th annual National Military Appreciation Month \nthis year, thanks to the leadership of my colleague Senator McCain, who \nsponsored legislation in 1999 that set aside an entire month to honor, \nremember, and appreciate the patriotism and dedication of the military \nand their families. Military Appreciation Month includes specific \nrecognition of Loyalty Day on May 1, Victory in Europe Day on May 8, \nMilitary Spouse Appreciation Day on May 9, Armed Forces Day on May 17, \nand, most importantly, Memorial Day on May 26.\n  From the American Revolution to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, \nmilitary men and women have always made\n\n[[Page S3288]]\n\nenormous sacrifices in order to defend our Nation. I am inspired by \ntheir patriotism, their courage, and their dedication to freedom. \nMilitary Appreciation Month also recognizes the more than 90 million \nAmericans who have family members serving in the military. Military \nfamilies are also making tremendous sacrifices on behalf of the \nAmerican people, and they are equally deserving of recognition during \nNational Military Appreciation Month.\n  Recent events have provided another reminder of the constant guard \nour brave servicemembers provide. Earlier this year, 24-year-old PO2 \nMark Mayo of Hagerstown, MD, gave his life, without hesitation, to \nprotect his fellow shipmate. As a civilian assaulted a fellow sailor \nand grabbed her gun, Petty Officer Mayo stepped into harm's way, \nshielded his shipmate, and died so that she could live. Petty Officer \nMayo was laid to rest in Arlington National Cemetery on April 25, 2014, \nand posthumously awarded The Navy and Marine Corps Medal, the highest \nnoncombat decoration for heroism awarded by the U.S. Department of the \nNavy.\n  Petty Officer Mayo is just one example of the heroism of our \nservicemembers; heroism that has been displayed countless times, both \nat home and abroad, throughout our Nation's history.\n  Young military men and women represent the best of our country. They \nchoose to serve our communities, fight for their fellow Americans and \ndefend our liberties with the fullest measure of devotion. Similar to \ngenerations before them, they have committed themselves to the defense \nof our Constitution against all enemies. Their devotion to their fellow \nAmericans makes our Nation exceptional.\n  Not all those who support our national defense have worn a uniform or \nhave been called away to distant battlefields. World War II's ``Rosie \nthe Riveter'' saying ``We can do it'' sounds an awful lot like today's \nyoung people saying ``Yes, we can.'' I urge my colleagues to keep this \nspirit of our ``Rosies'' in mind today as we commit ourselves to \nanswering the challenges that face our Nation.\n  We are fortunate to have so many women still living in Maryland who \nevoke the spirit of Rosie the Riveter. Crena Anderson riveted airplanes \nin Hagerstown, MD, during World War II. Ruth Staples of Brunswick, MD, \nworked on the railroad in support of allied efforts during the war. \nEven today, Crena and Ruth are both actively helping their local \ncommunities create replicable projects that teach and preserve World \nWar II-era history and advance positive roles that women can play in \nour changing world.\n  This Memorial Day should be a time when all Americans can reconnect \nwith our history and core values by honoring those who gave their lives \nfor the ideals we cherish. In addition to remembering the \nservicemembers who fought and died in our Nation's wars, I believe that \nwe must also take care of the servicemembers and veterans who are still \nwith us, especially when they return home. There are serious issues \nthat need to be addressed in the military and veteran communities. \nActive-Duty military and veteran suicide rates are at record high, \nVeterans' Administration disability claims continue to face \nunacceptable delays, and many programs that help discharged \nservicemembers make the transition to civilian life are inadequate. It \nis unacceptable that many of our servicemembers, veterans, and their \ncaregivers lack the health care they need after a decade of war. Too \nmany of these men and women are suffering from not only visible \ninjuries but invisible ones too. We must do better. In these \nchallenging times, let us pledge to redouble our efforts to provide for \nour veterans, not just on this Memorial Day but every day.\n  Military Appreciation Month is a time we should hold close to our \nhearts. In our hectic daily lives, let us not forget why our country \nendures. Throughout this month we will see many American flags and \nflowers adorning the graves of those who have made the ultimate \nsacrifice for our Nation. We honor them and remember their families, \nwho wear the Gold Star Pin, because they bear the greatest burden of \nsacrifice. I remember in particular the 114 Marylanders who have been \nkilled in our most recent conflicts and am reminded that our freedom \nisn't free. The best way to honor their sacrifice is to ensure that we \nare unwavering in our support for those who return to us wounded, ill, \nand injured. Let us affirm our commitment to them today and every \nday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/22/senate-section/article/S3288-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3288-S3289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JASPER COUNTY, IOWA\n\n Mr. HARKIN.

And it has been \ndeeply gratifying to see how my work in Congress has supported these \nlocal efforts.\n  I have always believed in accountability for public officials, and \nthis, my final year in the Senate, is an appropriate time to give an \naccounting of my work across four decades representing Iowa in \nCongress. I take pride in accomplishments that have been national in \nscope--for instance, passing the Americans with Disabilities Act and \nspearheading successful farm bills. But I take a very special pride in \nprojects that have made a big difference in local communities across my \nState.\n  Today, I would like to give an accounting of my work with leaders and \nresidents of Jasper County to build a legacy of a stronger local \neconomy, better schools and educational opportunities, and a healthier, \nsafer community.\n  Between 2001 and 2013, the creative leadership in your community has \nworked with me to secure funding in Jasper County worth over $3.2 \nmillion and successfully acquired financial assistance from programs I \nhave fought hard to support, which have provided more than $22 million \nto the local economy.\n  Of course my favorite memory of working together has to be working to \nfund the Neal Smith Wildlife National Wildlife Refuge. Congressman \nSmith's dedication to protecting Iowa's local wildlife, fragile \necosystems, and beautiful natural scenery was a legacy that was truly a \nprivilege to carry on. This refuge is not just a state natural \nresource, but a national treasure. It is home to grazing buffalo herds, \nwhite-tailed deer, badgers and pheasants, and more than 200 types of \nnative prairie flowers and grasses. The hundreds of thousands of Iowans \nwho visit the refuge every year experience the beauty and fragility of \nour natural environment. I hope that as I worked to carry on \nCongressman Smith's legacy in providing over $1.3 million since 2000 to \nthe refuge, Iowans will help take up the mantle to continue to support \nthis tremendous local resource.\n  Among the highlights: Main Street Iowa: One of the greatest \nchallenges we face--in Iowa and all across America--is preserving the \ncharacter and vitality of our small towns and rural communities. This \nisn't just about economics. It is also about maintaining our identity \nas Iowans. Main Street Iowa helps preserve Iowa's heart and soul by \nproviding funds to revitalize downtown business districts. This program \nhas allowed towns like Colfax to use that money to leverage other \ninvestments to jumpstart change and renewal. I am so pleased that \nJasper County has earned $43,000 through this program. These grants \nbuild much more than buildings. They build up the spirit and morale of \npeople in our small towns and local communities.\n  School grants: Every child in Iowa deserves to be educated in a \nclassroom that is safe, accessible, and modern. That is why, for the \npast decade and a half, I have secured funding for the innovative Iowa \nDemonstration Construction Grant Program--better known among educators \nin Iowa as Harkin grants for public schools construction and \nrenovation. Across 15 years, Harkin grants worth more than $132 million \nhave helped school districts to fund a range of renovation and repair \nefforts--everything from updating fire safety systems to building new \nschools. In many cases, these Federal dollars have served as the needed \nincentive to leverage local public and private dollars, so it often has \na tremendous multiplier effect within a school district. Over the \nyears, Jasper\n\n[[Page S3289]]\n\nCounty has received $618,741 in Harkin grants. Similarly, schools in \nJasper County have received funds that I designated for Iowa Star \nSchools for technology totaling $132,888.\n  Disaster mitigation and prevention: In 1993, when historic floods \nripped through Iowa, it became clear to me that the national emergency-\nresponse infrastructure was woefully inadequate to meet the needs of \nIowans in flood-ravaged communities. I went to work dramatically \nexpanding the Federal Emergency Management Agency's hazard mitigation \nprogram, which helps communities reduce the loss of life and property \ndue to natural disasters and enables mitigation measures to be \nimplemented during the immediate recovery period. Disaster relief means \nmore than helping people and businesses get back on their feet after a \ndisaster, it means doing our best to prevent the same predictable flood \nor other catastrophe from recurring in the future. The hazard \nmitigation program that I helped create in 1993 has provided critical \nsupport to Iowa communities impacted by the devastating floods of 2008. \nJasper County has received over $72,000 to remediate and prevent \nwidespread destruction from natural disasters.\n  Agricultural and rural development: Because I grew up in a small town \nin rural Iowa, I have always been a loyal friend and fierce advocate \nfor family farmers and rural communities. I have been a member of the \nHouse or Senate Agriculture Committee for 40 years--including more than \n10 years as chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. Across the \ndecades, I have championed farm policies for Iowans that include \neffective farm income protection and commodity programs; strong, \nprogressive conservation assistance for agricultural producers; \nrenewable energy opportunities; and robust economic development in our \nrural communities. Since 1991, through various programs authorized \nthrough the farm bill, Jasper County has received more than $7.8 \nmillion from a variety of farm bill programs.\n  Keeping Iowa communities safe: I also firmly believe that our first \nresponders need to be appropriately trained and equipped, able to \nrespond to both local emergencies and to statewide challenges such as, \nfor instance, the methamphetamine epidemic. Since 2001, Jasper County's \nfire departments have received over $1.2 million for firefighter safety \nand operations equipment.\n  Wellness and health care: Improving the health and wellness of all \nAmericans has been something I have been passionate about for decades. \nThat is why I fought to dramatically increase funding for disease \nprevention, innovative medical research, and a whole range of \ninitiatives to improve the health of individuals and families not only \nat the doctor's office but also in our communities, schools, and \nworkplaces. I am so proud that Americans have better access to clinical \npreventive services, nutritious food, smoke-free environments, safe \nplaces to engage in physical activity, and information to make healthy \ndecisions for themselves and their families. These efforts not only \nsave lives, they will also save money for generations to come thanks to \nthe prevention of costly chronic diseases, which account for a whopping \n75 percent of annual health care costs. I am pleased that Jasper County \nhas recognized this important issue by securing $264,000 for community \nwellness activities.\n  Disability Rights: Growing up, I loved and admired my brother Frank, \nwho was deaf. But I was deeply disturbed by the discrimination and \nobstacles he faced every day. That is why I have always been a \npassionate advocate for full equality for people with disabilities. As \nthe primary author of the Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA, and the \nADA Amendments Act, I have had four guiding goals for our fellow \ncitizens with disabilities: equal opportunity, full participation, \nindependent living and economic self-sufficiency. Nearly a quarter \ncentury since passage of the ADA, I see remarkable changes in \ncommunities everywhere I go in Iowa not just in curb cuts or closed \ncaptioned television, but in the full participation of people with \ndisabilities in our society and economy, folks who at long last have \nthe opportunity to contribute their talents and to be fully included. \nThese changes have increased economic opportunities for all citizens of \nJasper County, both those with and without disabilities. And they make \nus proud to be a part of a community and country that respects the \nworth and civil rights of all of our citizens.\n  This is at least a partial accounting of my work on behalf of Iowa, \nand specifically Jasper County, during my time in Congress. In every \ncase, this work has been about partnerships, cooperation, and \nempowering folks at the State and local level, including in Jasper \nCounty, to fulfill their own dreams and initiatives. And, of course, \nthis work is never complete. Even after I retire from the Senate, I \nhave no intention of retiring from the fight for a better, fairer, \nricher Iowa. I will always be profoundly grateful for the opportunity \nto serve the people of Iowa as their Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/22/senate-section/article/S3289-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3289-S3290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MARSHALL COUNTY, IOWA\n\n Mr. HARKIN.

In many cases, I have secured Federal funding that has \nleveraged local investments and served as a catalyst for a whole ripple \neffect of positive, creative changes. For example, I have fought to \nsecure over $15 million for Mechdyne, a Marshalltown company which is a \nworld leader in 3D and virtual reality visualization technology, \nhelping to create jobs and expand economic opportunities.\n  Main Street Iowa: One of the greatest challenges we face--in Iowa and \nall across America--is preserving the character and vitality of our \nsmall towns and rural communities. This isn't just about economics. It \nis also about maintaining our identity as Iowans.

Madam President, today I wish to recognize and \ncongratulate the Las Vegas-Clark County Library District for receiving \nthe National Medal for Museum and Library Service, the highest \ncommunity service honor a museum or library can earn. Nevada is proud \nto have one of its institutions dedicated to the education and \nbetterment of the community be chosen for such a prestigious award.\n  In its 20th-anniversary year, the National Medal is celebrating \ninstitutions that have made a significant impact on individuals, \nfamilies, and communities across the Nation. Nevada is honored to have \nthe Las Vegas-Clark County Library District selected as one of only 10 \ninstitutions to receive this award. The library has long served as a \nhome to community members looking to further their education and \nentertain themselves through the joys of reading. More recently, \nrecognizing the growing needs within the community, the library has \nbecome a haven for those who need a retreat from their homes or as a \ndestination for Internet that they cannot afford.\n  As Nevada's unemployment rate remains one of highest in the Nation \nand as our national economy continues to struggle, I recognize the \nunique role the Las Vegas-Clark County Library has played in working to \naddress the needs of its local community by carefully crafting a \nstrategic plan to address the unemployment problems in Nevada. By \nadding more computers so users could fill out job applications online \nand creating programs about managing stress and dealing with \nbankruptcy, the library is able to assist Nevadans during this tough \ntime. While our economy continues to recover, vulnerable Nevadan's rely \non a variety of resources to help them find employment, especially \nthose provided by the Las Vegas-Clark County Library District.\n  The importance of libraries is exemplified through their community \nengagement, support for afterschool programs, and ability to act as \nlearning tools for students. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the \nLas Vegas-Clark County District. As a father of four children who \nattended Nevada's public schools and the husband of a lifelong teacher, \nI understand the important role that libraries play in educating \nNevada's students. Ensuring that America's youth are prepared to \ncompete in the 21st century is critical for the future of our country. \nThe State of Nevada is fortunate to be home to a library district that \noffers a large variety of assistance to the members of the community.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the Las Vegas-Clark \nCounty Library District and know that they serve as an example for the \nrest of the Silver State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/22/senate-section/article/S3290-2", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/22/senate-section/article/S3290-3", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/22/senate-section/article/S3290-4", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:38 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 4031.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Hawaii urging the United States Congress to \n     adopt legislation to ease a transition to a new type of \n     identity theft-resistant credit card; to the Committee on \n     Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 32\n\n       Whereas, credit card data theft is one of the fastest-\n     growing crimes in the nation, increasing 50 percent from 2005 \n     to 2010, according to a recent report from the United States \n     Department of Justice; and\n       Whereas, credit card data theft is often included in the \n     general definition of identity theft, a crime that occurs \n     when a thief steals an individual's personal information and \n     uses it without the individual's permission; and\n       Whereas, identity theft is a serious crime that can \n     devastate an individual's finances, credit history, and \n     reputation, and can take time, money, and patience to \n     resolve; and\n       Whereas, the number of malicious programs written to steal \n     an individual's personal information has grown exponentially \n     from about 1,000,000 in 2007 to an estimated 130,000,000 in \n     2013; and\n       Whereas, identity theft is expected to surpass traditional \n     theft as the leading form of property crime, and security \n     analysts have reported that everyone should prepare to become \n     an identity theft victim at some point; and\n       Whereas, most Americans have a greater chance of having \n     their personal identity information stolen than being \n     actually held up at gunpoint; and\n       Whereas, a company has recently introduced a new type of \n     identity theft-resistant credit card that is designed to \n     reduce the chances of consumers being hit with fraudulent \n     credit card debt; and\n       Whereas, in designing this new type of credit card, the \n     company has developed small, digital, internal components \n     that will allow a consumer to enter a personal unlocking code \n     that will generate a unique credit card number for every \n     transaction, making the card more difficult to use by thieves \n     if it is lost or stolen; and\n       Whereas, at least one major bank is testing this new type \n     of credit card in a number of small pilot programs, and more \n     lenders may adopt the technology in the near future: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-\n     seventh Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session \n     of 2014, the Senate concurring, that the Congress of the \n     United States, Hawaii financial institutions, and Hawaii \n     businesses are urged to adopt legislation, policies, and \n     procedures to use identity theft-resistant credit cards; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That the Congress of the United States is urged \n     to adopt legislation that would ease a transition to a new \n     type of identity theft-resistant credit card; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That Hawaii financial institutions and Hawaii \n     businesses that offer credit cards are urged to use the new \n     identity theft-resistant credit card technology to reduce the \n     chances of consumers being victimized by identity thieves; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That certified copies of this Concurrent \n     Resolution be transmitted to the President Pro Tempore of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives, the members of Hawaii's congressional \n     delegation, the President of the Hawaii Bankers Association, \n     the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Chamber of \n     Commerce of Hawaii, and the Chairperson of the Board of \n     Directors of the Retail Merchants of Hawaii.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-237. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania urging \n     the Congress of the United States to pass and the President \n     of the United States to sign the Blue Water Navy Vietnam \n     Veterans Act of 2013; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 663\n\n       Whereas, During the Vietnam Conflict, the United States \n     military sprayed more than 19 million gallons of Agent Orange \n     and other herbicides over Vietnam to reduce forest cover and \n     crops used by the enemy; these herbicides contained dioxin, \n     which has since been identified as carcinogenic and has been \n     linked with a number of serious and disabling illnesses now \n     affecting thousands of veterans; and\n       Whereas, The Congress of the United States passed the Agent \n     Orange Act of 1991 to address the plight of veterans exposed \n     to herbicides while serving in Vietnam; and\n       Whereas, The act amended Title 38 of the United States Code \n     to presumptively recognize as service-connected, certain \n     diseases among military personnel who served in the Vietnam \n     Conflict between 1962 and 1975; and\n       Whereas, This presumption has provided access to \n     appropriate disability compensation and medical care for \n     Vietnam veterans diagnosed with such illnesses as Type II \n     diabetes, Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, chronic \n     lymphocytic leukemia, multiple myeloma, prostate cancer, \n     respiratory cancers and soft-tissue sarcomas; and\n       Whereas, Pursuant to a 2001 directive, the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs policy has denied the presumption of a \n     service connection for herbicide-related illnesses to Vietnam \n     veterans who could not furnish written documentation that \n     they had ``boots on the ground'' in-country, making it \n     virtually impossible for countless United States Navy and Air \n     Force veterans to pursue their claims for benefits; and\n       Whereas, Many who had landed on Vietnamese soil could not \n     produce proof due to incomplete or missing military records, \n     moreover, personnel who had served on ships in the ``Blue \n     Water Navy'' in Vietnamese territorial waters were, in fact, \n     exposed to dangerous airborne toxins, which not only drifted \n     offshore but also washed into streams and\n\n[[Page S3292]]\n\n     rivers draining into the South China Sea; and\n       Whereas, Warships positioned off the Vietnamese shore \n     routinely distilled seawater to obtain potable water; and\n       Whereas, A 2002 Australian study found that the \n     distillation process, rather than removing toxins, in fact, \n     concentrated dioxin in water used for drinking, cooking and \n     washing; and\n       Whereas, This study was conducted by the Australian \n     Department of Veteran Affairs after it found that Vietnam \n     veterans of the Royal Australian Navy had a higher rate of \n     mortality from Agent Orange-associated diseases than did \n     Vietnam veterans from other branches of the military; and\n       Whereas, When the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention studied specific cancers among Vietnam veterans, \n     it found a higher risk of cancer among Navy veterans; and\n       Whereas, Agent Orange did not discriminate between soldiers \n     on the ground and sailors on ships offshore, and legislation \n     to recognize this tragic fact and restore eligibility for \n     compensation and medical care to Navy and Air Force veterans \n     who sacrificed their health for their country is critical; \n     and\n       Whereas, When the Agent Orange Act passed in 1991 with no \n     dissenting votes, Congressional leaders stressed the \n     importance of responding to the health concerns of Vietnam \n     veterans and ending the bitterness and anxiety that had \n     surrounded the issue of herbicide exposure; and\n       Whereas, Congress should reaffirm the nation's commitment \n     to the well-being of all of its veterans and direct the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs to administer the Agent Orange \n     Act under the presumption that herbicide exposure in Vietnam \n     includes the country's inland waterways, offshore waters and \n     airspace: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives respectfully \n     urge the Congress and President of the United States to \n     restore the presumption of a service connection for Agent \n     Orange exposure for United States Navy and Air Force veterans \n     who served on the inland waterways, territorial waters and in \n     the airspace of Vietnam, Thailand, Laos and Cambodia; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of State of the Commonwealth \n     of Pennsylvania forward official copies of this resolution to \n     the President of the United States, to the President of the \n     Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives of the \n     United States, and to all the members of the Pennsylvania \n     delegation to the 113th Congress urging the members of the \n     delegation to support and fund the Blue Water Navy Vietnam \n     Veterans Act of 2013 and with the request that this \n     resolution be officially entered in the Congressional Record \n     as a memorial to the Congress of the United States of \n     America.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-238. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Hawaii urging the President of the United \n     States and the United States Congress to support the \n     authorization of the issuance of general obligation bonds for \n     the construction of a long-term care facility for veterans \n     contingent upon the receipt of federal funds; to the \n     Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 68\n\n       Whereas, Hawaii's acute shortage of long-term care beds has \n     the potential to directly impact the growing number of our \n     veterans who are reaching a point in their lives where long-\n     term care may become necessary; and\n       Whereas, the shortage of long-term care facilities will be \n     felt in communities across Hawaii; and\n       Whereas, veterans have stood up for America in times of \n     need, thereby earning the highest degree of respect and \n     support the nation is able to give; and\n       Whereas, the men and women who have served our country are \n     owed a special duty; and\n       Whereas, veterans of the armed services deserve safety, \n     comfort, and dignified care in their later years; and\n       Whereas, providing safe and reliable care falls squarely \n     within our commitment as a state and a nation; Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-\n     seventh Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session \n     of 2014, the Senate concurring, that the President of the \n     United States and the United States Congress are urged to \n     support House Bill No. 2074, Regular Session of 2014, which \n     authorizes the issuance of general obligation bonds for the \n     construction of a long-term care facility for veterans \n     contingent upon the receipt of federal funds; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That certified copies of this Concurrent \n     Resolution be transmitted to the President of the United \n     States, President Pro Tempore of the United States Senate, \n     and Speaker of the House of the United States House of \n     Representatives.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-239. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Hawaii urging the President \n     of the United States and the United States Congress to grant \n     veterans benefits to Filipino veterans who fought in World \n     War II; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 22\n\n       Whereas, during World War II, the Philippines was a United \n     States commonwealth; and\n       Whereas, Filipino soldiers volunteered their services after \n     being promised full veterans benefits to volunteer to fight \n     for the United States against the potential threat of Japan; \n     and\n       Whereas, thousands of Filipino men and women risked their \n     lives against the invading Japanese forces and assisted our \n     nation in its efforts to liberate the Philippines; and\n       Whereas, Filipino soldiers fought bravely beside American \n     troops to restore liberty and democracy to their homeland; \n     and\n       Whereas, exhibiting great courage at the battles of \n     Corregidor and Bataan, Filipino soldiers contributed to the \n     Allied victory that ended Word War II; and\n       Whereas, in 1941, by executive order, Filipinos who \n     Volunteered for the Philippine Commonwealth Army and \n     Philippine Scouts were made eligible for full United States \n     veterans benefits for their active service during the war; \n     and\n       Whereas, in 1946, by congressional act and upon the \n     independence of the Philippines, these same Filipino veterans \n     were denied eligibility for United States veterans benefits, \n     such as health care, disability pensions, and burial \n     expenses; and\n       Whereas, over the years, Congress has considered \n     legislation to restore the benefits denied to Filipino \n     veterans; and\n       Whereas, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 \n     included a provision that called for the release of funding \n     for lump sum payments to Filipino veterans in lieu of \n     pensions; and\n       Whereas, restoring benefits denied to Filipino veterans and \n     fulfilling and expediting any claims that are still pending \n     honors those Filipino veterans who served our nation so \n     courageously; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-\n     seventh Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session \n     of 2014, that the President of the United States and the \n     United States Congress are urged to grant veterans benefits \n     to Filipino veterans who fought in World War II but were \n     subsequently denied the benefits to which they were entitled; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That providing these benefits does not correct \n     the injustice and discrimination done over 60 years ago, but \n     is a small step in making reparations; and be it further\n       Resolved, That certified copies of this Resolution be \n     transmitted to the President of the United States, President \n     Pro Tempore of the United States Senate, Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, Hawaii's \n     Congressional delegation, Secretary of the United States \n     Department of Veterans Affairs, Director of the Hawaii Office \n     of Veterans Services, President of the Republic of the \n     Philippines, and Philippine Consul General in Hawaii.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-240. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Hawaii urging the United \n     States Congress to restore the presumption of a service \n     connection for Agent Orange exposure to the United States \n     veterans who served in the waters defined by the Combat Zone \n     and in the airspace over the Combat Zone in Vietnam; to the \n     Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 19\n\n       Whereas, during the Vietnam War, the United States military \n     sprayed 22,000,000 gallons of Agent Orange and other \n     herbicides over Vietnam to reduce forest cover and crops used \n     by the enemy; and\n       Whereas, these herbicides contained dioxin, which has since \n     been identified as carcinogenic and has been linked with a \n     number of serious and disabling illnesses affecting thousands \n     of veterans;

and\n       Whereas, pursuant to a directive in 2001, it has been the \n     policy of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs to \n     deny the presumption of a service connection for herbicide-\n     related illnesses to Vietnam veterans who cannot furnish \n     written documentation that they had ``boots on the ground'' \n     in-country, making it virtually impossible for countless \n     United States Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force veterans to \n     pursue their claims for benefits; and\n       Whereas, personnel who served on ships in the ``Blue Water \n     Navy'' in Vietnamese territorial waters were, in fact, \n     exposed to dangerous airborne toxins, which not only drifted \n     offshore but also washed into streams and rivers draining \n     into the South China Sea; and\n       Whereas, Agent Orange has been verified, through various \n     studies and reports, as a wide-spreading chemical that was \n     able to reach United States Navy ships through the air and \n     waterborne distribution routes; and\n       Whereas, warships positioned off the Vietnamese shore \n     routinely distilled seawater to obtain potable water; and\n       Whereas, an Australian study in 2002 found that the \n     distillation process, instead of removing toxins, actually \n     concentrated dioxin\n\n[[Page S3293]]\n\n     in water used for drinking, cooking, and washing;

and\n       Whereas, herbicides containing tetrachlorodibenzodioxin \n     (TCDD), a contaminant in Agent Orange, did not discriminate \n     between soldiers on the ground and sailors on ships offshore; \n     and\n       Whereas, more than 30 veterans' service organizations \n     support the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act of 2013 \n     (H.R. 543); and\n       Whereas, by not passing H.R. 543, a precedent could be set \n     to selectively provide certain categories of veterans with \n     injury-related medical care while denying such care to other \n     categories of veterans, without any financial, scientific, or \n     consistent reasoning; and\n       Whereas, when the Agent Orange Act passed in 1991 with no \n     dissenting votes, congressional leaders stressed the \n     importance of responding to the health concerns of Vietnam \n     veterans and ending the bitterness and anxiety that had \n     surrounded the issue of herbicide exposure;

A bill to require the President to develop a watch list and \na priority watch list of foreign countries that engage in economic or \nindustrial espionage in cyberspace with respect to United States trade \nsecrets or proprietary information, to provide for the imposition of \nsanctions with respect to foreign persons that knowingly benefit from \nsuch espionage, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am joined today by Senators McCain, \nRockefeller and Coburn in introducing a bill to respond to overwhelming \nand indisputable evidence of large scale cyber intrusions by the \nGovernment of China into the computer networks of private U.S. \ncompanies for the purpose of stealing valuable intellectual property \nand proprietary information. Such illegal and damaging behavior demands \nstrong and immediate action.\n  American companies invest hundreds of billions of dollars every year \nin research and development. The innovation that results from those \ninvestments drives the growth of American companies and the U.S. \neconomy. Unfortunately, our companies are having their intellectual \nproperty stolen right out from underneath them through cyberspace. \nAccording to a 2013 Center for Strategic and International Studies \nstudy, cyber theft costs American companies $100 billion annually--a \nstaggering amount that threatens to undermine America's global \ncompetitiveness.\n  General Keith B. Alexander, former head of the National Security \nAgency and U.S. Cyber Command, has called the cyber theft of U.S. \nintellectual property ``the greatest transfer of wealth in history.''\n  Monday's Department of Justice indictment of 5 Chinese military \nofficials for computer hacking, economic espionage and other offenses \ndirected at 6 American companies confirms what earlier U.S. Government \nreports have documented: the culprits of cyber theft are frequently \nforeign governments and China is the worst offender. The indictment \nalleges that the defendants, members of China's People's Liberation \nArmy, conspired to hack into the computers of U.S. companies to steal \ninformation useful to those American companies' Chinese competitors, \nincluding state-owned enterprises.\n  The indictments demonstrate the administration's willingness to take \non cybercrime through the aggressive use of the criminal justice \nsystem. The legislation we are introducing today, a revised version of \na bill we introduced last year, gives our Government another tool to \nimpose costs on those who steal and profit from the cyber theft of \nAmerican technology, trade secrets and proprietary information.\n  Our bill would authorize the President to direct the Treasury \nDepartment to freeze the assets of any foreign person or company, \nincluding a state owned enterprise, determined to have benefitted from \nthe theft of U.S. technology or proprietary information stolen in \ncyberspace.\n  The Deter Cyber Theft Act would also require the Director of National \nIntelligence to compile an annual report on foreign economic and \nindustrial espionage that includes: a list of foreign countries that \nengage in economic or industrial espionage in cyberspace against U.S. \nfirms or individuals, including a priority watch list of the worst \noffenders; a list of U.S. technologies or proprietary information \ntargeted by such espionage, and, to the extent possible, a list of such \ninformation that has been stolen; a list of items manufactured or \nproduced or services or services provided using such stolen \ntechnologies or proprietary information; a list of foreign companies, \nincluding state-owned firms, that benefit from such theft; details of \nthe espionage activities of foreign countries; and actions taken by the \nDNI and other Federal agencies to combat industrial or economic \nespionage in cyberspace.\n  As Dennis C. Blair, former director of national intelligence and co-\nchair of the IP Commission report has said, ``Jawboning alone won't \nwork. Something has to change China's calculus.'' We need to call out \nthose who are responsible for cyber theft and empower the President to \nhit the thieves where it hurts most--in their wallets.\n  If foreign governments, like the Chinese government, want to continue \nto deny their involvement in cyber theft despite the proof, that is one \nthing. We can't stop the denials. But we aren't without remedies. We \ncan make sure that the companies that benefit from cyber theft, \nincluding state-owned companies, pay the price. Blocking these \ncompanies from doing business in the United States will send the \nmessage that we have had enough.\n  We worked closely with the administration in developing this bill. I \nbelieve it is an important complement to their recent aggressive \nefforts to respond to economic espionage by members of the Chinese \nmilitary.\n  In light of the Snowden leaks, some have charged that it is \ninconsistent of the U.S. to criticize China's campaign to steal our \nintellectual property\n\n[[Page S3298]]\n\nthrough cyberspace. Let's be clear. Attempts to equate China's actions \nand our own are false. The United States economy is built on the hard \nwork and innovation of American entrepreneurs who are free to think for \nthemselves, develop new products and deliver them to the world. China's \nactions, on the other hand, reveal a country that is satisfied with \ntheft as a means of economic growth while ironically, suppressing the \nfreedoms that encourage new ideas and innovation. The Snowden \nrevelations are about espionage; the United States does not steal \nintellectual property for economic gain.\n  I urge the speedy enactment of the Deter Cyber Theft Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. HEITKAMP (for herself and Mr. Kaine):\n  S. 2390. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to create \na tax credit for foster families; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the important \nissue of foster care and the need to recruit, retain and support foster \nfamilies. What better time than during National Foster Care Month. \nFoster parents make a significant and meaningful difference in the \nlives of so many vulnerable children by opening their hearts and homes. \nBut we continue to struggle to recruit and retain enough foster \nfamilies to ensure each child is placed in a family-like setting. This \nis particularly true for Native American kids who are in foster care at \nrates dramatically higher than others.\n  Caring for a child in foster care can be more expensive than caring \nfor one's own biological children. Children placed into foster care \noften have experienced significant emotional and physical trauma and \nhave higher incidences of medical and behavioral health issues, \nresulting in additional costs to parents. Unfortunately, too many \ncaring foster parents struggle financially because Federal and State \nprograms that reimburse parents for a child's daily living costs do not \nprovide for the real cost of caring for the child. A 2007 study of \nState foster care programs, conducted by the University of Maryland \nSchool of Social Work, Children's Rights, and the National Foster \nParent Association, found that current foster care rates would have to \nincrease on average 36 percent nationwide to provide for basic care.\n  A 2002 report by the Department of Health and Human Services' \nInspector General found that foster parents' expenses often exceed \nfoster care reimbursement rates, leading foster parents to pay out-of-\npocket to meet foster children's basic needs. Some benefits already \nexist in the current tax code to support these families, but few are \naware of their existence or utilize them.\n  Today I am introducing the Foster Care Tax Credit Act to provide \nadditional tax relief for foster families to help cover the actual \ncosts of caring for a foster child. This legislation also requests \nadditional outreach and education by the Department of Health and Human \nServices to better equip State and Tribal foster agencies and foster \nfamilies to take advantage of all tax benefits available. I thank my \ncolleague, Senator Kaine, for joining me in this effort.\n  As we continue working towards the goals of improving child welfare, \nI hope more of my colleagues will join me in seeking to provide \nadditional support for families caring for foster children.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Kirk, Mrs. Murray, and Mr. \n        Isakson):\n  S. 2405. A bill to amend title XII of the Public Health Service Act \nto reauthorize certain trauma care programs, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the Trauma \nSystems and Regionalization of Emergency Care Reauthorization Act along \nwith Senators Kirk, Murray, and Isakson, and also the Improving Trauma \nCare Act, which includes burn injuries in the definition of trauma.\n  These two bills, S. 2405 and S. 2406, build on my previous efforts to \nimprove trauma care, which is an essential component of our care \nsystem. Timely and effective trauma care is critical to ensuring \nlifesaving interventions for those who have serious unintentional \ninjuries. Such injuries are the leading cause of death for children and \nadults under 44, according to the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, CDC.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle toward expeditious passage of these bills.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 2408. A bill to authorize the exploration, leasing, development, \nand production of oil and gas in and from the western portion of the \nCoastal Plain of the State of Alaska without surface occupancy, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce two separate \nbills to open a small portion of the Arctic coastal plain, in my home \nState of Alaska, to oil and gas development. I am introducing these \nbills because new production in northern Alaska is vital to my State's \nfuture and global energy security.\n  The 1.5 million acres of the Arctic coastal plain that lie within the \nnon-wilderness portion of the 19 million acre Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge are North America's greatest prospect for conventional onshore \nproduction. The U.S. Geological Survey continues to estimate that this \npart of the coastal plain has a mean likelihood of containing 10.4 \nbillion barrels of oil and 8.6 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, as \nwell as a reasonable chance of economically producing 16 billion \nbarrels of oil. If produced at a rate of 1 million barrels per day, \nthat supply could last for more than 40 years--bringing us jobs, \nrevenues, and security in every one of them.\n  Today, Alaska supplies about 7 percent of U.S. crude oil. This is a 4 \npercent decline since I last introduced similar bills in 2011. It is an \neven more substantial loss compared to what we have provided in past \ndecades, and what we could be providing today. Importantly, despite the \nFederal Government owning almost 70 percent of the lands in Alaska, \nalmost all of our oil production is from State lands. The only \nproduction on Federal lands is from the Northstar project, a small man-\nmade island that straddles state and federal waters in the Beaufort \nSea.\n  For more than 30 years, my State has successfully balanced resource \ndevelopment with environmental protection. Alaskans have proven, over \nand over again, that these endeavors are not mutually exclusive, and \nwith advances in technology, the footprint of development projects is \nonly getting smaller. Yet at the Federal level, there is an astonishing \nrefusal to acknowledge that record.\n  As a result, production on the North Slope continues to decline by \nabout 6 percent annually. With new exploration and development projects \non Federal lands blocked or delayed at every turn, Alaska faces a \ntipping point. Declining production is now threatening the continued \noperation of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System. A closure of TAPS would \nshut down all northern Alaska oil production, devastating Alaska's \neconomy, causing global oil prices to rise, and deepening our \ndependence on unstable petrostates throughout the world. Exploration \nand development in the Arctic offshore and National Petroleum Reserve-\nAlaska are moving forward, but these resources will not be developed \nwithout a viable way to transport them to market.\n  The bills I introduce today, S. 2408 and S. 2409, would disturb no \nmore than 2,000 acres of the vast coastal plain, and one bill would not \nallow surface occupancy of the coastal plain, only directional drilling \nfrom outside the refuge to access the oil and gas resources. To put \nthis in perspective, 2,000 acres is less than the size of the local \nDulles Airport, or about \\1/10\\ of 1 percent of the refuge. Since these \nareas are less than 60 miles from TAPS, development in the coastal \nplain is the quickest, most environmentally-sound way to increase oil \nproduction in Alaska and ensure the pipeline will operate well into the \nfuture, providing jobs and supporting the economies of both Alaska and \nthe United States.\n  The terms of both bills include strong protections for fish and \nwildlife, fish and wildlife habitat, subsistence resources, and the \nenvironment. Development could not move forward if it would cause \nsignificant adverse impacts to the coastal plain. Both bills\n\n[[Page S3299]]\n\nalso return 50 percent of all revenues to the Federal Government, \nrather than the 10 percent allowed under current law. At approximately \n$100 per barrel, and given the Coastal Plain's estimate of over 10 \nbillion barrels, there is a trillion dollars' worth of oil locked up \nbeneath this small area in northern Alaska.\n  As we continue to struggle with high long-term unemployment and \nunsustainable national debt, we need to pursue development \nopportunities more than ever. The shale oil and gas boom on state and \nprivate lands in the Lower 48 has been the one shining light as our \neconomy struggles to recover from the recession. My bills offer us a \nchance to produce more of our own energy, for the good of the American \npeople, in an environmentally-friendly way. With oil hovering near $100 \na barrel, with so many of our fellow citizens out of work, and with the \nU.S. nation still about 40 percent dependent on foreign oil--it would \nbe foolish to once again ignore our most promising prospect for new \ndevelopment.\n  For decades, Alaskans, whom polls show overwhelmingly support \ndevelopment of the coastal plain, have been asking permission to \nexplore and develop the resources located there. Technology has \nadvanced so that it is possible to develop oil and gas from the refuge \nwith little or no impact on the area and its wildlife.\n  I hope this Congress will have the common sense to allow America to \nhelp itself by developing the coastal plain's substantial resources. \nThis is critical to my State and the nation as a whole. With this in \nmind, I will work to educate the members of this chamber about the \nopportunity we have and the tremendous benefits it would provide. I \nwill show why such development should occur--why it must occur--and how \nit can benefit all of us at a time when we so desperately need good \neconomic news.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/22/senate-section/article/S3299-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3299]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 455--DESIGNATING MAY 2014 AS ``OLDER AMERICANS \n                                MONTH''\n\n  Mr. NELSON (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Sanders, and Mr. Cardin) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 455\n\n       Whereas President John F.

Res. 456\n\n       Whereas National Foster Care Month was established more \n     than 20 years ago to--\n       (1) bring foster care issues to the forefront;\n       (2) highlight the importance of permanency for every child; \n     and\n       (3) recognize the essential role that foster parents, \n     social workers, and advocates have in the lives of children \n     in foster care throughout the United States;\n       Whereas all children deserve a safe, loving, and permanent \n     home;\n       Whereas the primary goal of the foster care system is to \n     ensure the safety and well-being of children while working to \n     provide a safe, loving, and permanent home for each child;\n       Whereas there are approximately 400,000 children living in \n     foster care;\n       Whereas there were approximately 252,000 youth that entered \n     the foster care system in 2012, while nearly 102,000 youth \n     were eligible and awaiting adoption at the end of 2012;\n       Whereas foster care is intended to be a temporary \n     placement, but children remain in the foster care system for \n     an average of 2 years;\n       Whereas ethnic minority children are more likely to stay in \n     the foster care system for longer periods of time and are \n     less likely to be reunited with their biological families;\n       Whereas foster parents are the front-line caregivers for \n     children who cannot safely remain with their biological \n     parents and provide physical care, emotional support, \n     education advocacy, and are the largest single source of \n     families providing permanent homes for children leaving \n     foster care to adoption;\n       Whereas children in foster care who are placed with \n     relatives, compared to children placed with nonrelatives, \n     have more stability, including fewer changes in placements, \n     have more positive perceptions of their placements, are more \n     likely to be placed with their siblings, and demonstrate \n     fewer behavioral problems;\n       Whereas some relative caregivers receive less financial \n     assistance and support services than do foster caregivers;\n       Whereas recent studies show children in foster care are \n     prescribed psychotropic medication at rates up to 11 times \n     higher than other children on Medicaid and in amounts that \n     exceed the Food and Drug Administration's guidelines;\n       Whereas youth in foster care are much more likely to face \n     educational instability with 34 percent of foster youth ages \n     17 to 18 experiencing at least 5 changes while in care;\n       Whereas youth in foster care are often cut off from other \n     youth and face hurdles in participating in activities common \n     to their peers, such as sports or extracurricular activities;\n       Whereas youth in foster care are more susceptible to being \n     trafficked, and more needs to be done to prevent, identify, \n     and intervene when a child becomes a victim of the crime;\n       Whereas an increased emphasis on prevention and \n     reunification services is necessary to reduce the number of \n     children that are forced to remain in the foster care system;\n       Whereas more than 23,400 youth ``age out'' of foster care \n     annually without a legal permanent connection to an adult or \n     family;\n       Whereas children who age out of foster care lack the \n     security or support of a biological or adoptive family and \n     frequently struggle to secure affordable housing, obtain \n     health insurance, pursue higher education, and acquire \n     adequate employment;\n       Whereas nearly half of children in foster care for five or \n     more years experience 7 or more different foster care \n     placements, which often leads to disruption of routines and \n     the need to change schools and move away from siblings, \n     extended families, and familiar surroundings;\n       Whereas children entering foster care often confront the \n     widespread misperception that children in foster care are \n     disruptive, unruly, and dangerous, even though placement in\n\n[[Page S3300]]\n\n     foster care is based on the actions of a parent or guardian, \n     not the child;\n       Whereas States, localities, and communities should be \n     encouraged to invest resources in preventative and \n     reunification services and post-permanency programs to ensure \n     that more children in foster care are provided with safe, \n     loving, and permanent placements;\n       Whereas Federal legislation over the past three decades, \n     including the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of \n     1980 (Public Law 96-272), the Adoption and Safe Families Act \n     of 1997 (Public Law 105-89), the Fostering Connections to \n     Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-\n     351), the Child and Family Services Improvement and \n     Innovation Act (Public Law 112-34), and the Uninterrupted \n     Scholars Act (Public Law 112-278) provided new investments \n     and services to improve the outcomes of children in the \n     foster care system;\n       Whereas the Children's Bureau of the Department of Health \n     and Human Services has designated May as National Foster Care \n     Month under the theme ``to help build blocks toward permanent \n     families for foster youth'';\n       Whereas May would be an appropriate month to designate as \n     National Foster Care Month to provide an opportunity to \n     acknowledge the accomplishments of the child-welfare \n     workforce, foster parents, advocacy community, and mentors \n     for their dedication, accomplishments, and positive impact \n     they have on the lives of children; and\n       Whereas much remains to be done to ensure that all children \n     have a safe, loving, nurturing, and permanent family, \n     regardless of age or special needs: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes National Foster Care Month as an opportunity \n     to raise awareness about the challenges that children face in \n     the foster-care system;\n       (2) encourages Congress to implement policy to improve the \n     lives of children in the foster care system and maximize the \n     number children exiting foster care to the protection of \n     safe, loving, and permanent families;\n       (3) supports the designation of National Foster Care Month;\n       (4) acknowledges the unique needs of children in the \n     foster-care system;\n       (5) recognizes foster youth throughout the United States \n     for their ongoing tenacity, courage, and resilience while \n     facing life challenges;\n       (6) acknowledges the exceptional alumni of the foster-care \n     system who serve as advocates and role models for youth who \n     remain in care;\n       (7) honors the commitment and dedication of the individuals \n     who work tirelessly to provide assistance and services to \n     children in the foster-care system; and\n       (8) reaffirms the need to continue working to improve the \n     outcomes of all children in the foster-care system through \n     parts B and E of title IV of the Social Security Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 601 et seq.) and other programs designed to--\n       (A) support vulnerable families;\n       (B) invest in prevention and reunification services;\n       (C) promote guardianship, adoption, and other permanent \n     placement opportunities in cases where reunification is not \n     in the best interests of the child;\n       (D) adequately serve those children brought into the \n     foster-care system; and\n       (E) facilitate the successful transition into adulthood for \n     children that ``age out'' of the foster-care system.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url":

Res. 463\n\n       Whereas in the 1850s, the United States Government signed a \n     series of treaties with Washington State tribes under which \n     the tribes granted millions of acres of land to the United \n     States in exchange for the establishment of reservations and \n     the recognition of traditional hunting and fishing rights;\n       Whereas Billy Frank, Jr. was born to Willie Frank, Sr. and \n     Angeline Frank on March 9, 1931, at Frank's Landing on the \n     banks of the Nisqually River in Washington State;\n       Whereas the tireless efforts and dedication of Billy Frank, \n     Jr. led to a historic legal victory that ensured that the \n     United States would honor promises made in treaties with the \n     Washington tribes;\n       Whereas Billy Frank, Jr. was first arrested in December of \n     1945, at the age of 14, for fishing for salmon in the \n     Nisqually River;\n       Whereas Billy Frank, Jr. was subsequently arrested more \n     than 50 times for exercising his treaty-protected right to \n     fish for salmon;\n       Whereas over the years, Billy Frank, Jr. and other tribal \n     members staged ``fish-ins'' that often placed the protestors \n     in danger of being arrested or attacked;\n       Whereas during these fish-ins, Billy Frank, Jr. and others \n     demanded that they be allowed to fish in historically tribal \n     waters, a right the Nisqually had reserved in the Treaty of \n     Medicine Creek;\n       Whereas declining salmon runs in Washington waters resulted \n     in increased arrests of tribal members exercising their \n     fishing rights under the Treaty;\n       Whereas on February 12, 1974, in the case of United States \n     v. Washington, Judge George Hugo Boldt of the United States \n     District Court for the Western District of Washington issued \n     a decision that affirmed the right of Washington treaty \n     tribes to take up to half of the harvestable fish in tribal \n     fishing waters and reaffirmed that the United States must \n     honor treaties made with Native American tribes;\n       Whereas the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and the Supreme \n     Court of the United States upheld the Boldt decision, and the \n     treaty tribes became co-managers of the salmon resource in \n     the State of Washington;\n       Whereas after the Boldt decision, Billy Frank, Jr. \n     continued his fight to protect natural resources, salmon, and \n     a healthy environment;\n       Whereas the Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission, where \n     Billy Frank, Jr. served as chairman, works to establish \n     working relationships with State agencies and non-Indian \n     groups to manage fisheries, restore and protect habitats, and \n     protect tribal treaty rights;\n       Whereas Billy Frank, Jr. refused to be bitter in the face \n     of jail, racism, and abuse, and his influence was felt not \n     just in Washington State but around the world;\n       Whereas Billy Frank, Jr. was awarded the Albert Schweitzer \n     Prize for Humanitarianism, the Common Cause Award for Human \n     Rights Efforts, the American Indian Distinguished Service \n     Award, the Washington State Environmental Excellence Award, \n     and the Wallace Stegner Award for his years of service and \n     dedication to his battle;\n       Whereas the legacy of Billy Frank, Jr. will live on in \n     stories, in memories, and every time a tribal member \n     exercises his or her right to harvest salmon in Washington \n     State; and\n       Whereas the legacy of Billy Frank, Jr. transcends his 83 \n     years and will provide inspiration to those still around \n     today and those still to come: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) honors the life, legacy, and many accomplishments of \n     Billy Frank, Jr.; and\n       (2) extends its heartfelt sympathies and condolences to the \n     family of Billy Frank,\n\n[[Page S3303]]\n\n     Jr., the Nisqually Tribe, all Native Americans, and all \n     people around the world who were inspired by his example.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/22/senate-section/article/S3303-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 36--PERMITTING THE USE OF THE ROTUNDA OF \nTHE CAPITOL FOR A CEREMONY TO AWARD THE CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL TO THE \n       NEXT OF KIN OR PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE OF RAOUL WALLENBERG\n\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND submitted the following concurrent resolution; which \nwas considered and agreed to:\n\n                            S.

Effect on State laws.\nSec. 8. Termination of authorities.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) as established in the Proclamation of a State of \n     Emergency issued by the Governor of the State on January 17, \n     2014, the State is experiencing record dry conditions;\n       (2) extremely dry conditions have persisted in the State \n     since 2012, and the drought conditions are likely to persist \n     into the future;\n       (3) the water supplies of the State are at record-low \n     levels, as indicated by a statewide average snowpack of 12 \n     percent of the normal average for winter as of February 1, \n     2014, and the fact that all major Central Valley Project \n     reservoir levels are at or below 50 percent of the capacity \n     of the reservoirs as of April 1, 2014;\n       (4) the 2013-2014 drought constitutes a serious emergency \n     posing immediate and severe risks to human life and safety \n     and to the environment throughout the State;\n       (5) the emergency requires--\n       (A) immediate and credible action that respects the \n     complexity of the water system of the State and the \n     importance of the water system to the entire State; and\n       (B) policies that do not pit stakeholders against one \n     another, which history has shown only leads to costly \n     litigation that benefits no one and prevents any real \n     solutions;\n       (6) Federal law (including regulations) directly authorizes \n     expedited decisionmaking procedures and environmental and \n     public review procedures to enable timely and appropriate \n     implementation of actions to respond to such a type and \n     severity of emergency; and\n       (7) the serious emergency posed by the 2013-2014 drought in \n     the State fully satisfies the conditions necessary for the \n     exercise of emergency decisionmaking, analytical, and public \n     review requirements under--\n       (A) the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et \n     seq.);\n       (B) the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 \n     U.S.C. 4321 et seq.);\n       (C) water control management procedures of the Corps of \n     Engineers described in section 222.5 of title 33, Code of \n     Federal Regulations (including successor regulations); and\n       (D) the Reclamation States Emergency Drought Relief Act of \n     1991 (Public Law 102-250; 106 Stat. 53).\n\n     SEC. 3.

and\n       (B) manage reverse flow in the Old and Middle Rivers as \n     prescribed by the biological opinions issued by the United \n     States Fish and Wildlife Service on December 15, 2008, for \n     Delta smelt and by the National Marine Fisheries Service on \n     June 4, 2009, for salmonids, to minimize water supply \n     reductions for the Central Valley Project and the State Water \n     Project;\n       (4) adopt a 1:1 inflow to export ratio for the increased \n     flow of the San Joaquin River, as measured as a 3-day running \n     average at Vernalis during the period from April 1 through \n     May 31, resulting from voluntary transfers and exchanges of \n     water supplies, among other purposes;\n\n[[Page S3304]]\n\n       (5) issue all necessary permit decisions under the \n     authority of the Secretaries within 30 days of receiving a \n     completed application by the State to place and use temporary \n     barriers or operable gates in Delta channels to improve water \n     quantity and quality for State Water Project and Central \n     Valley Project South of Delta water contractors and other \n     water users, which barriers or gates should provide benefits \n     for species protection and in-Delta water user water quality \n     and shall be designed such that formal consultations under \n     section 7 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. \n     1536) would not be necessary;\n       (6)(A) require the Director of the United States Fish and \n     Wildlife Service and the Commissioner of the Bureau of \n     Reclamation to complete all requirements under the National \n     Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) and \n     the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) \n     necessary to make final permit decisions on water transfer \n     requests associated with voluntarily fallowing nonpermanent \n     crops in the State, within 30 days of receiving such a \n     request; and\n       (B) require the Director of the United States Fish and \n     Wildlife Service to allow any water transfer request \n     associated with fallowing to maximize the quantity of water \n     supplies available for nonhabitat uses as long as the \n     fallowing and associated water transfer are in compliance \n     with applicable Federal laws (including regulations);\n       (7) participate in, issue grants, or otherwise provide \n     funding for, as soon as practicable after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, under existing authority available to \n     the Secretary of the Interior, pilot projects to increase \n     water in reservoirs in regional river basins experiencing \n     extreme, exceptional, or sustained drought that have a direct \n     impact on the water supply of the State, including the \n     Colorado River Basin, provided that any participation, grant, \n     or funding by the Secretary with respect to the Upper \n     Division shall be with or to the respective State;\n       (8) maintain all rescheduled water supplies held in the San \n     Luis Reservoir and Millerton Reservoir for all water users \n     for delivery in the immediately following contract water year \n     unless precluded by reservoir storage capacity limitations;\n       (9) to the maximum extent possible based on the \n     availability of water and without causing land subsidence or \n     violating water quality standards--\n       (A) meet the contract water supply needs of Central Valley \n     Project refuges through the improvement or installation of \n     water conservation measures, water conveyance facilities, and \n     wells to use groundwater resources, which activities may be \n     accomplished by using funding made available under the Water \n     Assistance Program or the WaterSMART program of the \n     Department of the Interior;

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed \nto Calendar No. 342.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 724) to amend the Clean Air Act to remove the \n     requirement for dealer certification of new light-duty motor \n     vehicles.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I am pleased the Senate is considering \nH.R. 724, a bill to remove a redundant paperwork requirement whenever a \ncustomer buys a new car.\n  Every new vehicle must comply with the Clean Air Act when it is \nmanufactured and H.R. 724 will not change this. H.R. 724 simply \neliminates an out-of-date requirement that auto dealers provide a piece \nof paper to each customer to certify that a new car or truck complies \nwith the Clean Air Act's emissions requirements. Information confirming \nthat the vehicle complies with all applicable emission requirements is \nalready available under the hood of the vehicle and on the EPA's \nwebsite, so providing the certification on a piece of paper is \nredundant. In addition to removing an unnecessary requirement, H.R. 724 \neliminates 15 million pieces of paper that would otherwise be handed \nout each year with every new vehicle sold.\n  The bill was authored by Representative Gary Peters and \nRepresentative Bob Latta and was passed by the House of Representatives \non January 8 by a vote of 405-0. I was glad to lead the effort to pass \nthis bill in the Senate. I thank Senator Boxer, who helped ensure \ntimely consideration and unanimous passage of the bill by the Senate \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works. I urge my fellow Senators to \npass H.R. 724 so we can send this commonsense bill to the President to \nbecome law.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask that H.R. 724 be read a third time \nand passed, the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon \nthe table, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 724) was ordered to a third reading, was read the \nthird time, and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/22/senate-section/article/S3307-3", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3307-S3308]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              COLLINSVILLE RENEWABLE ENERGY PRODUCTION ACT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                COCONINO NATIONAL FOREST LAND CONVEYANCE\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of the following items en bloc: Calendar \nNo. 360, H.R. 862; and Calendar No. 123, H.R. 316.\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bills \nen bloc.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Madam President, I thank my colleagues for their prompt \nconsideration and passage of H.R. 862, a bill that would authorize the \nconveyance of 2.67 acres within the Coconino National Forest to \nlandowners who built on those parcels in reliance on an erroneous \nsurvey.\n  On Tuesday, a relatively small 4-acre wildfire started just north of \nSedona, AZ, near the Slide Rock State Park. It took less than 24 hours \nfor the Slide Fire, as it is being called, to explode through the \novergrown and dry vegetation and make its way up Oak Creek Canyon. In \nless than 2 days, estimates put the fire at 4,800 acres. Unfortunately, \nit appears poised to grow larger.\n  Some areas have already been evacuated and an estimated 3,200 people \nin the Kachina Village and Forest Highland communities were put on pre-\nevacuation notice last night. Nearby, the Mountainaire community sits \napproximately five miles from the fire line. As they watch smoke fill \nthe sky near their homes, residents are preparing for the possibility \nof having to evacuate. For some of those residents, the imminent fire \nthreat brings added uncertainly due to a longstanding boundary dispute.\n  The problem stems from an incorrect survey that was completed in \n1960. Unbeknownst to the landowners, homes and other improvements were \nbuilt based on that errant work. In 2007, a subsequent survey revealed \nthe error and a number of landowners were alerted to the fact that \nportions of their property are within the Coconino National Forest \nboundary. As a result, these parcels have a cloud on their title that \nneeds to be resolved through a land conveyance.\n  The Slide Fire has brought the impact of this survey error into \nfurther focus. Some of those homeowners have apparently been told by \ntheir insurance companies that if the Slide Fire destroys their homes, \nthey will be compensated. However, it is unlikely they will be able to \nrebuild on the property because of the boundary dispute.\n  In my view, the least we can do during this difficult time is remove \nthe boundary issue from the litany of concerns these families in the \nMountainaire community are dealing with right now. That is why Senator \nMcCain and I sought expedited consideration of H.R. 862 today through \nthe unanimous consent process. This bill, which was introduced by \nRepresentatives Kirkpatrick and Gosar in the House, would enable the \nconveyance of the 2.67 acres that are tied up in this longstanding \nboundary issue to the private landowners.\n  The House passed this measure in June of last year by a vote of 395-\n1, and it was favorably reported out of the Senate Energy and Natural \nResources Committee by voice vote late last year. The Forest Service \nhas also issued a statement signaling its support for this measure.\n  I am grateful to my colleagues in the Senate, in particular Senators \nMcCain, Landrieu, and Murkowski, for their\n\n[[Page S3308]]\n\nsupport in moving this bill through the Senate today. It provides a \nmuch needed sliver of good news for families that are dealing with a \nsignificant threat. Likewise, I look forward to working my colleagues \nto find a path forward to proactively address the catastrophic wildfire \nsituation that continues to plague the West.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the committee-reported \nsubstitute amendment to H.R. 316 be agreed to; that the bills, as \namended, where amended, be read a third time and passed en bloc; and \nthe motions to reconsider be laid upon the table with no intervening \naction or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute to H.R. 316 was \nagreed to, as follows:\n\n                                H.R. 316\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, May is Older Americans Month, and I am \npleased to submit a resolution recognizing the importance of our \nseniors with my colleagues, Senators Collins and Sanders. As of 2012, \nthere were more than 43 million Americans aged 65 and older. By 2060, \nAmericans in this age group are projected to be as many as 92 million, \nor over 1 in 5 U.S. residents.\n\n[[Page S3309]]\n\n  In 1963, President John F. Kennedy recognized the first Older \nAmericans Month. By continuing to observe the month of May as Older \nAmericans Month, we remind ourselves not only of our duty to provide \nfor the needs of this population, but also of their ongoing \ncontributions to our communities and to our country.\n  As chairman of the Senate Aging Committee and the senior Senator from \nFlorida, the State with the largest 65-and-older population in the \nNation, I have heard many stories of the enduring contributions made by \nthe aging population. For example, during an Aging Committee hearing \nearlier this year, we learned that the fastest growth of new \nentrepreneurs is among Americans ages 55 to 64. For example, Conchy \nBretos, from my home State of Florida, leveraged a lifetime of work \nexperience to begin a second career by starting a new business. Not \nonly does her business contribute to the economy and provide a valuable \nservice to seniors in public housing, but it also provides a cost-\nsavings to taxpayers.\n  As one witness during this hearing noted, we should think about the \nbaby boom generation not as a ``silver tsunami'' but our society's \n``silver lining that will be yielding golden dividends.'' Our \nobligation to them is to ensure their ability to live independently and \ncontinue to make these significant impressions on and contributions to \nour Nation. Our aging Americans can teach younger generations valuable \nlessons.\n  In honor of Ms. Bretos and all older Americans, I am pleased to \nrecognize May as Older Americans Month and celebrate the influences and \nachievements of seniors nationwide.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolutions be agreed to; the preambles, where applicable, be agreed \nto; and the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table en bloc, with \nno intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The resolutions, with their preambles, are printed in today's Record \nunder ``Submitted Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/22/senate-section/article/S3309-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3309]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     PERMITTING USE OF THE ROTUNDA\n\n  Mr. REID.
