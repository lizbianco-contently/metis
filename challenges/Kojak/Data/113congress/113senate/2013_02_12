Following leader remarks, the Senate will resume \nconsideration of S. 47, the Violence Against Women Act. Time until 11 \na.m. will be equally divided and controlled between the two leaders or \ntheir designees.\n  At 11 a.m. there will be up to six rollcall votes in order to \ncomplete action on this legislation. Following disposition of VAWA, the \nViolence Against Women Act, we will recess until 2:15 p.m. to allow for \nthe weekly caucus meetings.\n  The State of the Union Address is this evening. Senators will gather \nat 8:20 p.m. tonight in this Chamber in order to proceed as a body to \nthe House of Representatives, where the speech will be given.\n  There are up to six rollcall votes remaining: the Leahy amendment \ndealing with sex trafficking, the Portman amendment dealing with sex \ntrafficking, the Murkowski amendment dealing with tribal protections, \nthe Coburn amendment dealing with consolidation of DOJ rape programs, \nthe Coburn amendment dealing with notice to victims and, most \nimportantly, final passage of this legislation.\n  We are still working on some committee hearings that are creating \nsome conflict, and we are going to see if we can work something out. At \nthis stage we have not done that. Unless we ask the Senate to change \nthe voting order, we will have those votes starting at 11 o'clock \ntoday.\n\n\n                           State of the Union\n\n  Four years ago, as newly elected President of the United States, \nBarack Obama prepared to deliver his first address to a joint session \nof Congress. The country at that time was in the midst of a grave \ncrisis. Our economy had been shaken to its core by a financial crisis \nsparked by Wall Street greed. Millions of Americans had lost their \njobs, their homes, and their hope.\n  President Obama predicted America would rise to meet the challenges \nof the day. He said:\n\n       We will rebuild, we will recover, and the United States of \n     America will emerge stronger than before. The weight of this \n     crisis will not determine the destiny of this Nation.\n\n  Four years later we can say with certainty he was right. Over the \nlast 35 months, American businesses have created more than 6.1 million \njobs--6.1 million jobs--including hundreds of thousands of jobs in \nmanufacturing in the auto industry. As a matter of fact, the figures \nare staggering. Five hundred thousand manufacturing jobs have been \nadded, and 1 million jobs have been saved due to the President's auto \nrescue program. That is a fairly significant change.\n  We still have a long way to go to get back to full strength, and \nthere are still too many Americans out of work. We made solid progress \nin the last 4 years, but we have a long way to go. The depth of the \ncrisis did not determine our destiny. Instead, determination drove us \nto prosper again. We are faced with an opportunity disguised as a \nchallenge. We must build on this progress, fostering a lasting recovery \nthat ensures Americans' success is determined by the strength of their \nwill, not the size of their wallet.\n  Tonight, President Obama will chart a course to maintain the economic \nprogress we made and revitalize the still struggling middle class. I \nlook forward to hearing his vision. I expect the President will call \nfor commonsense investments in our future. Investments have been \ndeferred for far too long because of economic turmoil. When times are \nhard, these investments are easy to put off. If America hopes to \ncompete in a changing world, we must prepare today's students for \ntomorrow's jobs. We must give small businesses and American \nmanufacturers the support they need to thrive. We must stop relying on \nforeign oil and start investing in renewable energy. It is better for \nour environment and for our economy.\n  If we hope to rebuild and maintain a world-class economy, we must \nbuild a 21st century infrastructure to support that economy. Renewing \nthese investments is not only the right thing to do for our country, it \nis the right thing to do for our economy.\n  In the last 4 years the President has repeatedly reached across the \naisle to Republicans, suggesting we find common ground for the sake of \nrecovery. Tonight will be no different. He will\n\n[[Page S598]]\n\nreach across that aisle. I expect the President's proposal will include \nideas supported by both Democrats and, in the past, Republicans. I hope \nmy Republican colleagues will give his vision the consideration it \ndeserves.\n  Tonight President Obama will also propose a balanced alternative to \nthe devastating automatic spending cuts which take effect next month. \nDemocrats believe we should prevent these harmful arbitrary cuts, cuts \nto both military and, initiatives to help middle-class families \nprosper. Remember, Republicans in the Senate and in the House voted for \nthese harsh measures. We could easily avert these job-destroying cuts \nwhich would hinder the economic recovery by ending wasteful tax breaks \nfor corporations and giveaways to companies that ship jobs overseas. A \nbalanced approach to pare senseless spending reduction with a modest \ncontribution from the wealthiest Americans would limit the damage of \nthe so-called sequestration.\n\n  I was disappointed to learn yesterday the Republican leaders in the \nHouse have no intention of bringing legislation to the floor to replace \nthe sequester with a more sensible approach. They are going to do \nnothing.\n  Senate Democrats will offer their own solution to the sequester later \nthis week. If Republicans truly agree that these across-the-board cuts \nwould be damaging to our economy and to national security, they should \nwork to help us pass an alternative.\n  During his first State of the Union Address a long time ago, the \nfirst President of the United States, George Washington, told Congress \nthis:\n\n       The welfare of our country is the great object to which our \n     cares and efforts ought to be directed.\n\n  As Republicans and Democrats from both Chambers come together, I \nrepeat, the welfare of our country is the great object to which our \ncares and efforts ought to be directed.\n  Democrats and Republicans should hear the message that George \nWashington gave a long time ago. It is important to listen to the State \nof the Union tonight, which we will, and we should all keep in mind the \nwords of George Washington. Despite our differences, if there is the \nwill to work together, the power to build an economy works for every \nAmerican, and we will succeed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/12/senate-section/article/S598-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schatz).

The Republican leader is recognized.\n\n\n                       State of the Union Address\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, tonight we will welcome the President \nto the Capitol to deliver his State of the Union Address.\n  As I mentioned yesterday, Republicans will be listening with great \ninterest to see where the President plans to take the country over the \ncoming year. Some media outlets are already reporting we will be \nsubjected to another litany of leftwing proposals, with plenty of red \nmeat for the President's base. I sure hope not. The campaign is over, \nand the fact is that if the President plans to accomplish anything good \nfor the country in the coming months, he is going to have to go through \na Republican-controlled House.\n  So this morning I would like to humbly suggest once again that it is \ntime for the President to reach out to Congress, including Republicans, \nand make divided government work. That is how he will actually address \nthe issues Americans are most concerned about right now, and it is the \nonly way.\n  The first issue many of us will be listening for tonight is the \nPresident's plan for controlling spending and replacing the Obama \nsequester. The record is clear that the President and his aides came up \nwith that sequester, and they got it. It is a little puzzling to see \nthem now trying to pass it off like a hot potato.\n  Republicans have been very clear about the fact that we would rather \nenact smarter spending cuts. House Republicans even voted on the plan--\nnot once but twice--to do just that. But Washington Democrats so far \nhave failed to put forward a serious proposal of their own. They \nignored the issue for more than 1 year before finally showing up to the \ndebate last week with the usual gimmicks.\n  This is the President's chance to rally the American people around a \nreal set of spending cuts and reforms. I will be interested to see what \nhe plans to offer because what we have been hearing so far, frankly, \nisn't very encouraging. He needs to understand the American people will \nnot accept attempts to replace deficit reduction both parties have \nalready agreed to with tax hikes. We already agreed to reduce spending \nin the amount the sequester would reduce spending when we voted for the \nBudget Control Act back in August of 2011 and the President signed it.\n  What we expect the President will be offering are tax hikes we all \nknow would be used to finance even more spending, when we promised the \nAmerican people we would spend less. If the President does try to do \nthat, then he shouldn't expect anyone else to go along, least of all \nthe American people.\n  Many on both sides of the aisle support eliminating tax loopholes in \nthe context of fundamental bipartisan tax simplification that lowers \ntax rates, and we hope to have a chance to do that in the months ahead. \nBut it is bad policy to punish this industry or that one so Washington \ncan fund 1 more week of government spending and cause more Americans to \nlose their jobs.\n  Remember, due to the operation of law, the President already got the \ntax increases he wanted back on January 1. Because the law expired, the \nPresident got the tax increases he wanted--not with any votes, but he \ngot it by the operation of law. So we are done with that part of the \nequation. The tax issue is over.\n  If the President wants a balanced approach, now is the time to show \nhis hand on the spending cuts and reforms he will accept. That is how \ncompromise works. But when we hear the White House suggest the \nchallenge of controlling spending is essentially complete or when we \nhear the House Democratic leader echo the President's claim that we \ndon't have a spending problem, it is hard to know where to start after \na ridiculous suggestion such as that.\n  Over the weekend I spent some time in Nelson County, KY, and I can \nassure everyone the folks I spoke with there strongly disagree with the \nPresident's assessment.\n  The truth is the President knows better than that himself. Deep down \nhe knows spending is completely out of control. He knows the debt has \nalready grown by $6 trillion over his 4 years in office. He knows that \nwithout spending reform, the national debt will increase to double the \nsize of our economy in just a few decades. He knows something must be \ndone now to save Medicare and Social Security before they go broke. \nTonight is a chance to show it, to be straight with the American \npeople, and to reveal what he plans to do about all this.\n  The good news is that many of the things we need to do to control \nspending and many of the things we need to\n\n[[Page S599]]\n\ndo to get the economy moving again are all one and the same. So I was \npleased to read the President might pivot to jobs again. Unfortunately, \nwe have seen that headline so many times before. We will have to wait \nto see how serious it actually is. I have lost count of how many times \nthe President has made one of those pivots. He has pivoted so many \ntimes, reporters covering the White House must be getting completely \ndizzy.\n  I also hope the President doesn't call for more Washington spending \ntonight. Not only is that an ineffective way to create jobs, but it is \nalso the very reason our debt continues to climb to such completely \nunsustainable levels.\n  If the President does want to do something about job creation for a \nchange, he should leave aside the things we know haven't worked and try \nsome things that will, such as getting the government out of the way. \nNot only will that help jump-start the private economy, it will help us \nget spending under control at the same time. It would be a twofer. \nJump-start the private economy and get spending under control at the \nsame time is the best way to inprove this economy.\n  I also hope the President will use the big stage he will have tonight \nto finally level with the American people about the consequences of \nObamaCare. They deserve to know what is about to hit them--the cost \nincreases, the premium hikes, the taxes. They deserve to know that not \nonly may they not be able to keep the health plan they have and like \nbut that CBO tells us there will also be fewer jobs. I know these \nthings will not be easy for him to say, but that is what it means to be \na statesman; to be honest with the people you represent, to admit when \nsomething doesn't turn out the way you said it would.\n  Even if we don't hear the President speak directly to the issues \nAmericans are most concerned about tonight, I am confident the man who \nis set to follow him with the Republican's response will do just that. \nIn some ways, Senator Rubio embodies the American dream. As the child \nof immigrants, he is uniquely positioned to speak to the aspirations of \nthe middle class. Unlike our rather easily distracted President, \nSenator Rubio has never had to pivot to jobs. He has kept a laser focus \non job creation and the economy ever since he got here.\n  I have laid out the issues the President needs to address if he is \ninterested in working with Republicans to get some good things done for \nthe country in the days and months ahead. I sure hope he is listening.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, as President Obama gets ready to deliver \nhis State of the Union Address tonight, I would like to remind the \nAmerican people of what he said 4 years ago during his first speech to \na joint session of Congress. Four years ago President Obama said he did \nnot believe in big government.\n  Since then he has given us four consecutive trillion-dollar deficits, \nhe has nationalized our health care sector, and he has used Federal \nagencies to impose Draconian regulations. If we add the cost of all \nthese proposed or final regulations the Obama administration published \nlast year, the total economic burden comes to more than $236 billion. \nThat is a wet blanket on the American economy and economic growth and \njob creation. If anyone out there still thinks President Obama opposes \nbig government, as the song goes, ``I've got some oceanfront property \nin Arizona'' I'd like to sell you.\n  Four year ago the President told us he was concerned about our \nmassive national debt. Since then our gross national debt has increased \nby nearly $6 trillion and has grown larger than the entire U.S. \neconomy.\n  Four year ago the President said we could not ignore our long-term \nchallenges. Since then he has ignored the recommendations of his own \nbipartisan fiscal commission known as Simpson-Bowles, and his own \nTreasury Secretary has acknowledged that the Obama administration does \nnot have a serious plan for long-term debt reduction.\n  Four years ago the President told us his trillion-dollar debt-\nfinanced stimulus package would feature unprecedented oversight. Then \nwe learned the stimulus package wasted money on boondoggles such as \nSolyndra.\n  Four years ago the President promised us his plan for health care \nreform would reduce the cost of health care for American families. \nSince then the cost of employer-provided family health insurance has \nincreased by more than $2,300 per family.\n  Four years ago the President said he viewed the Federal budget as a \nblueprint for our future. Since then two of the President's budget \nproposals have been unanimously rejected by this Chamber--by \nRepublicans and Democrats alike--and America's credit rating has been \ndowngraded.\n  If you buy these unfulfilled promises the President has made over the \nlast 4 years, as the song goes, not only will I sell you some \noceanfront property in Arizona, ``I'll throw the Golden Gate in for \nfree.''\n  In short, much of what the President has said in February of 2009 has \nbeen hollow rhetoric, unmet with action and followup. I can only hope \nthe President's speech tonight will seriously address our biggest \nfiscal challenges: a debt burden larger than our economy, $37 trillion \nin unfunded Medicare liabilities, and more than $100 trillion in total \nunfunded liabilities.\n  In addition, I can only hope the President will offer a serious plan \nfor boosting economic growth and reducing unemployment. Amid the \nlongest period of high unemployment since the Great Depression, with \nthe national rate still hovering near 8 percent, Americans deserve a \nPresident who is focused intensely on the right policies for job \ncreation.\n  A second term offers a second chance. If the President wants to \nregain the credibility he has lost over the last 4 years on each of \nthese issues, he will start tonight.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is considering S. 47.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, before I go on to that, I would note that \nmany have come to this floor to talk about the deficit and things of \nthat nature. I ask anybody who is decrying our deficit if they voted \nfor a needless war in Iraq and then voted to put it on the credit card.\n  The war in Iraq has cost this Nation nearly $1 trillion so far, and \nwith all the wounded who have come back from this unnecessary war, we \nwill, beyond the lifetime of most of us, still be paying for that.\n  The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are the only wars in America's \nhistory we did not have a special tax to pay for--both were put on a \ncredit card. They were begun at a time when the last administration had \ninherited a large surplus from the Democratic administration before it. \nSince I have been old enough to vote, only Democratic administrations \nhave left surpluses. But they took that surplus, wasted it on the war \nin Iraq, and because they were unwilling to pay for this war--a war \nthat was paid for only by the men and women who served and their \nfamilies; we don't have a draft--most people can say: It didn't affect \nme. Well, it affected those families enormously, and it will affect \nevery single taxpayer for the rest of their lives because it will take \nthat long to pay for a war that so many in this body and the other body \nvoted for but then stood up and said: We cannot possibly have taxes to \npay for things we are spending money on. That is one thing they voted \nfor--for the first time in the history of this country, they voted to \nnot pay for a war.\n  I urge everybody not to lose sight of the fact that a major part of \nour deficit was caused by the House and Senate voting for a war we \nnever should have been in, one I voted against. In fact, everybody who \nactually read the intelligence material voted against it. Now our \nchildren and our grandchildren will have to pay for our mistakes.\n  I don't want to hear lectures about our deficit from people who voted \nto help create that deficit by voting for an unnecessary war.\n  On the subject we are on, S. 47, after more than a week of \nconsideration, the Senate will finally vote on the Violence Against \nWomen Reauthorization Act. This is a good bill that makes needed \nchanges recommended by victims and those who work with them\n\n[[Page S600]]\n\nevery day. I urge all those Senators who have opposed reauthorizing \nVAWA to end their opposition and join with us. Despite the predictions \nby some that the Republican House of Representatives will refuse to \nconsider the Senate bill, as it did last year, I see reason for hope.\n  Just yesterday 17 Republican members of the House wrote to their own \nleadership urging immediate reauthorization of VAWA. They rejected the \nideological opposition of Heritage and the Family Research Council. \nThey recognize that VAWA is effective, efficient and successful ``in \ncurbing domestic violence and supporting victims,'' and that ``VAWA \nprograms save lives.'' They also note, as I have said repeatedly on \nthis floor: ``VAWA must reach all victims and perpetrators of domestic \nviolence, dating violence, sexual assault and stalking in every \ncommunity in the country.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the Republican members' letter \nto Speaker Boehner be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  The Senate has rejected the Republican substitute and defeated the \nCoburn amendment to strip the tribal jurisdiction provisions that have \nbeen included in the Senate bill for the past two years. Those \namendments would have greatly narrowed VAWA's ability to prevent crime \nand help victims and would have undercut our commitment to all victims \nof rape and domestic violence. I hope Senators will continue to vote \nagainst amendments that weaken this important legislation.\n  This morning the Senate has the opportunity to vote for an amendment \nthat goes in the opposite direction from the Coburn amendments by \nallowing us to help more victims of serious crime in the United States \nand around the world. This morning the Senate is to vote on the \nTrafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act. That is another \nbipartisan bill that was written with the input of victims and service \nproviders to make critical improvements to existing law. Last year, \nthis legislation had 57 cosponsors--including 15 Republicans. In \nparticular, I thank Senator Rubio who has been a strong cosponsor of \nthis important measure.\n  Today is February 12, the day on which Abraham Lincoln was born. It \nwas 150 years ago that he delivered the Emancipation Proclamation and \nit would be fitting that the Senate pass the Trafficking Victims \nProtection Reauthorization Act on his birthday. Although the 13th \namendment to our Constitution was ratified long ago, making slavery \nillegal, we continue to fight human trafficking, which can amount to \nmodern day slavery. This terrible crime still occurs throughout the \nworld--including in the United States of America. The Polaris Project \nestimates that there are more than 27 million victims of human \ntrafficking worldwide today.\n  The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act will help us \ncontinue to make real progress on this issue. It is a parallel effort \nto our reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. Our effort is \nto stop human trafficking at its roots by supporting both domestic and \ninternational efforts to fight against trafficking and to punish its \nperpetrators. We provide critical resources to help support victims as \nthey rebuild their lives.\n  This measure strengthens criminal anti-trafficking statutes to ensure \nthat law enforcement agencies have the tools they need to effectively \ncombat all forms of trafficking. It ensures better coordination among \nFederal agencies, between law enforcement and victim service providers, \nand with foreign countries to work on every facet of this complicated \nproblem. It includes measures to encourage victims to come forward and \nreport this terrible crime, which leads to more prosecutions and help \nfor more victims.\n  We have included accountability measures to ensure that Federal funds \nare used for their intended purposes, and we have streamlined programs \nto focus scarce resources on the approaches that have been the most \nsuccessful. A Senator asserted yesterday that trafficking programs have \nbeen wasteful and duplicative. In fact, the programs supported by this \namendment have been carefully tracked and shown to be effective. \nNonetheless, the amendment reduces authorization levels by almost a \nthird from the levels in the last reauthorization because we are \ndetermined to ensure efficiency and respond to concerns. We have made \nsimilar efforts to streamline VAWA.\n  The United States remains a beacon of hope for so many who face human \nrights abuses. We know that young women and girls often just 11, 12, or \n13 years old are being bought and sold. We know that workers are being \nheld and forced into labor against their will. I urge all Senators to \njoin in passing the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act. \nPeople in this country and millions around the world are counting on \nus.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 11, 2013.\n     Speaker John Boehner,\n     Majority Leader Eric Cantor.\n       Dear Speaker Boehner and Leader Cantor: We are writing to \n     urge you to immediately reauthorize the Violence Against \n     Women Act (VAWA). As you know, we are long overdue in passing \n     a reauthorization of this landmark piece of legislation which \n     seeks to reduce instances of domestic violence and protect \n     women who are victims of such violence.\n       Over the course of the past several years, we have met with \n     constituents in our districts who agree that VAWA programs \n     are an important part of a larger criminal justice framework \n     that seeks to reduce abuse against women and children. We \n     appreciate the need to make efficient and effective use of \n     federal dollars, and believe that VAWA programs in our \n     districts have met that threshold and have been a success in \n     curbing domestic violence and supporting victims. Now is the \n     time to seek bipartisan compromise on the reauthorization of \n     these programs. VAWA programs save lives, and we must allow \n     states and communities the opportunity to build upon the \n     successes of current VAWA programs so that we can help even \n     more people.\n       It is unfortunate that states are already preparing for \n     Congress's inaction. In New Jersey, for example, the state \n     legislature recently passed a bridge fund bill to fill the \n     void left by a lack of federal funds in the event VAWA is not \n     reauthorized.\n       We believe a bipartisan plan to reauthorize VAWA is more \n     important than ever. Last year, in a bipartisan letter many \n     of us in the Republican Conference wrote to the Judiciary \n     Committee, we said: ``VAWA must reach all victims and \n     perpetrators of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual \n     assault, and stalking in every community in the country.'' \n     This statement still holds true, and underscores the need to \n     reauthorize this critical legislation. If you have any \n     questions, or if we can be of additional assistance, your \n     staff may contact Joe Heaton with Rep. Runyan.\n           Sincerely,\n         Jon Runyan, Charlie Dent, Dave Reichert, Richard Hanna, \n           David Joyce, Shelley Moore-Capito, Frank LoBiondo, \n           Michael Fitzpatrick, Jim Gerlach, Chris Gibson, Rodney \n           Frelinghuysen, Leonard Lance, Patrick Meehan, Rodney \n           Davis, Tom Reed, Lee Terry, Michael Grimm, Members of \n           Congress.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nletters from human rights and civil rights organizations in support of \nS. 47, the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      National Association for the\n\n\n                                Advancement of Colored People,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 1, 2013.\n     Re NAACP Strong Support for S. 47, to Reauthorize the 1994 \n         Violence Against Women Act\n\n     Senator Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy: On behalf of the NAACP, our nation's \n     oldest, largest and most widely-recognized grassroots-based \n     civil rights organization, I would like to sincerely thank \n     you for your leadership in introducing S. 47, legislation \n     strengthening and reauthorizing the 1994 Violence Against \n     Women Act (VAWA). As strong and consistent supporters of \n     VAWA, the NAACP recognizes that this important legislation \n     would improve criminal justice and community-based responses \n     to domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault and \n     stalking in the United States.\n       As you know, the NAACP supported the passage of VAWA in \n     1994, and its reauthorization in 2000 and 2005. We have \n     witnessed VAWA change the landscape for victims of violence \n     in the United States who once suffered in silence. Victims of \n     domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault and \n     stalking have now been able to access services, and a new \n     generation of families and justice system professionals has \n     come to understand that domestic violence, dating violence, \n     sexual assault and stalking are crimes that our society will \n     no longer tolerate.\n\n[[Page S601]]\n\n     Your bill will not only continue proven effective programs, \n     but that it will make key changes to streamline VAWA and make \n     sure that even more people have access to safety, stability \n     and justice.\n       Thank you again for your continued leadership in this \n     endeavor. Your thoughtfulness and tenacity in this area over \n     the years has improved the lives of millions of Americans. \n     Should you have any questions or comments, please do not \n     hesitate to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n     Hilary O.

Gwen Moore \n     introduced the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of \n     2013 (H.R. 11) in the House of Representatives, which is \n     identical to the Senate bill; and\n       Whereas, protections against sexual assault and domestic \n     violence for Native Americans, immigrants, and LGBTQ \n     communities are required in order to guarantee the human \n     rights of equality, safety, liberty, integrity and dignity \n     which are enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human \n     Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of \n     Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), the International \n     Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial \n     Discrimination, the International Covenant on Civil and \n     Political Rights, and the American Declaration on Human \n     Rights among others;\n       Whereas, in 2011 the United Nations Special Rapporteur on \n     Violence Against Women recommended that the U.S. reassess its \n     laws and policies protecting domestic violence survivors and \n     punishing abusers, including the recognition of tribal \n     authority to prosecute offenders contained in the current \n     Senate bill (S. 47); and\n       Whereas, in 2011 the Inter-American Commission of Human \n     Rights (ICHR) ordered the United States to comply with its \n     international duty to prevent violence against women in the \n     case of Jessica Lenahan (Gonzales) v. the United States, \n     through the enactment of legislation and policy reforms that \n     do not discriminate and provide for equal protection before \n     the law to victims of domestic violence and their children, \n     under Article 2 of the American Declaration on Human Rights; \n     and\n       Whereas, in 2012 the Commission joined with the Seattle \n     Women's Commission to call for the U.S. House to pass the \n     Senate version of VAWA and on June 27, 2012, the Commission \n     co-sponsored a public rally with the Seattle Women's \n     Commission to support the Senate version of VAWA; and\n       Whereas, on September 6, 2012 the Commission adopted \n     Resolution 12-03 urging the House to pass the Senate version \n     of VAWA,\n       Now therefore be it resolved, that the Seattle Human Rights \n     Commission hereby calls upon the United States Congress to \n     reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act by passing \n     legislation which does not leave out fundamental protections \n     for Native Americans, immigrants, and LGBTQ communities in \n     recognition of the principle that safety is a fundamental \n     human right and violence against women is a violation of \n     human rights; and\n       Now therefore be it further resolved, that the Seattle \n     Human Rights Commission urges the Senate to pass S. 47 and \n     the House to pass H.R. 11; and\n       Now therefore be it finally resolved, that should the House \n     leadership decide against advancing H.R. 11, then in that \n     case the Seattle Human Rights Commission urges the House to \n     pass legislation that still contains protection for Native \n     Americans, immigrants, and LGBTQ communities.\n       Adopted by the Seattle Human Rights Commission on February \n     1, 2013\n                                              Christopher Stearns,\n                                                         Chairman,\n                                                    Jennifer Yogi,\n                                                        Secretary.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have already spoken about this, and I \nwant to reiterate what I said earlier. Our country, justifiably so, is \na beacon of hope for so many who face human rights abuses. I think of \nwhat is written on the iconic Statue of Liberty; so many people come to \nour shores for freedom. We also know there are many who are being held \nin these despicable trafficking schemes around the world. There are \nchildren who are 11, 12, 13 years old being held, and we have to speak \nfor them.\n  I hope all Senators will join me in voting for this amendment. There \nare protections for victims of trafficking in the reauthorization act. \nIt is a bipartisan bill written with the input of victims and service \nproviders. It helps us to more effectively fight human trafficking, \nwhich is really modern-day slavery. Whether people are trafficked in \nthe sex trade--especially children--or in forced labor, it is slavery. \nIt is not isolated. There are 27 million victims worldwide today \naccording to the Polaris Project. This amendment will help us to stop \nit by supporting both domestic and international efforts to fight \nagainst trafficking.\n  Just as important as it is to help us punish the perpetrators, the \namendment will help us rebuild the lives of those caught up in it. We \nknow funds are always limited. We put in accountability measures to \nensure the Federal funds are used for their intended purposes.\n  Let us continue to have the United States as a beacon of hope to \npeople around the world.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters in \nsupport of amendment 21, the Trafficking Victims Protection \nReauthorization Act, to S. 47, the Violence Against Women \nReauthorization Act of 2013.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              Americans for Immigrant Justice,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 11, 2013.\n     Hon.

We have assisted thousands of immigrant \n     survivors, and we understand firsthand why this important \n     legislation and amendment are needed.\n       The authorization in the Trafficking Victims Protection Act \n     (TVPA) expired on September 30, 2011. We ask all Senators to \n     support amendment #21, which reauthorizes the TVPA and \n     provides additional tools necessary to combat trafficking and \n     modern-day slavery at home and abroad. We urge all Senators \n     to oppose any attempt to weaken the bill and oppose any \n     attempts to attach non-germane amendments to S. 47.\n       The United States can and should do more to help protect \n     all victims and fight domestic violence and human \n     trafficking. We urge all Senators to vote for final passage \n     of the Violence Against Women Act and for amendment #21, \n     which reauthorizes the Trafficking Victims Protection Act.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Cory W.

Patrick Leahy,\n     Russell Senate Bldg, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy, The Alliance to End Slavery and \n     Trafficking (ATEST), a diverse alliance of U.S.-based human \n     rights organizations, acting with a shared agenda to end \n     modern-day slavery and human trafficking around the world, is \n     writing to express our strong support for amendment (#21) to \n     the Violence Against Women Act (S. 47). This critical \n     amendment includes the text of S. 1301, the Trafficking \n     Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA), and \n     additional grant reporting requirements.\n       As of September 30, 2011, the authorizations contained in \n     the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA) expired. We \n     urge Senators to support amendment #21, which reauthorizes \n     the TVPA, provides additional tools necessary to combat \n     trafficking and modern-day slavery at home and abroad, and \n     continues the fight to end modern-day slavery and human \n     trafficking in our generation.\n       Although the United States has taken significant steps to \n     combat human trafficking through a comprehensive approach, \n     much more needs to be done. The scope of human trafficking \n     and slavery has come into sharp focus over the past years \n     with an estimated 27 million slaves worldwide. Combined, \n     human trafficking and slavery are the world's third largest \n     criminal enterprises, after drugs and weapons. The United \n     States can and should do more to help fight human trafficking \n     both domestically and internationally. We urge passage of the \n     amendment to continue U.S. leadership and further the victim-\n     centered approach that has been crucial to combating human \n     trafficking around the world.\n           Sincerely,\n         Coalition to Abolish Slavery and Trafficking (CAST), \n           Coalition of Immokalee Workers (CIW), ECPAT-USA, Free \n           the Slaves, International Justice Mission, Not for Sale \n           Campaign, Polaris Project, Safe Horizon, Solidarity \n           Center, Verite, Vital Voices Global Partnership, World \n           Vision.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                          Freedom Network USA,\n\n                                                February 11, 2013.\n     Re Amendment #21 (Trafficking Victims Protection \n         Reauthorization Act) to S. 47 (Violence Against Women \n         Act)\n\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Russell \n         Senate Bldg., U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman, The Freedom Network (USA), which was \n     established in 2001, is a coalition of 35 nongovernmental \n     organizations and individual experts that provide services \n     to, and advocate for the rights of, trafficking survivors in \n     the United States. The Trafficking Victims Protection \n     Reauthorization Act (TVPRA), groundbreaking legislation which \n     increased the U.S. government's efforts to protect victims, \n     authorized the government to strengthen efforts to prosecute \n     traffickers, and allowed for increased prevention measures, \n     funds some of the Freedom Network's most vital programs, \n     including comprehensive case management, shelter, and legal \n     services. The Freedom Network enthusiastically commends and \n     supports you for introducing this vital legislation as an \n     amendment (Amendment #21) to the bill to reauthorize the \n     Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) (Senate Bill 47).\n       With an estimated 27 million victims of human trafficking \n     worldwide, the United States should continue to lead the \n     charge to end this human rights abuse. Throughout the course \n     of the 112th Congress, the Freedom Network worked fervently \n     in support of the TVPRA (S. 1301), which ultimately \n     culminated in 57 co-sponsors from both sides of the aisle by \n     the end of 2012. Today, the Senate will resume consideration \n     of S. 47, and they will debate Amendment #21 to authorize \n     appropriations for fiscal years 2014 through 2017 for the \n     TVPRA, to enhance\n\n[[Page S609]]\n\n     measures to combat trafficking in persons, and for other \n     purposes. Both the TVPRA and VAWA are critical to survivors \n     of human trafficking, domestic violence, and sexual assault.\n       Thank you for your continued attention to this issue. \n     Please contact Freedom Network Policy Co-Chairs Keeli \n     Sorensen (keeli.sorensen@safehorizon.org) and Ivy Suriyopas \n     (isuriyopas@aaldef.org) if you have any questions.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Bill Bernstein,\n       Co-Chair.\n     Patricia Medige,\n       Co-Chair.\n     Suzanne Tomatore,\n       Co-Chair.\n\n\n                  MEMBERS OF THE FREEDOM NETWORK (USA)\n\n       American Gateways (TX); Americans for Immigrant Justice \n     (FL); API Safety Center & Chaya (WA); Arizona League to End \n     Regional Human Trafficking (AZ); Asian American Legal Defense \n     and Education Fund (NY); Asian Pacific Islander Legal \n     Outreach (CA); Ayuda, Inc.

Let's pass this.\n  Mr. President, I am going to suggest the absence of a quorum unless \nsomebody else seeks recognition. I see the distinguished Senator from \nFlorida on the floor, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I wish to echo my support for this \namendment which is, basically, the Trafficking Victims Protection Act.\n  Human trafficking is an issue which is shocking to people in its \nprevalence, both in our country and around the world. The idea of human \nslavery is something people think about as a historical issue, \nsomething that happened a long time ago. The fact is it is happening \ntoday all over the world, and it is happening in the United States. It \nis a tragic issue.\n  There is not just sex trafficking, which gets all the attention and, \nobviously, is something that is very bad, but there is also labor \ntrafficking. There are people in this country who are brought here \nunder false pretenses, and when they get here they don't get paid, they \nare mistreated, and on many occasions they are threatened that their \nfamily back home is going to be hurt if they go to the authorities.\n  We have had cases of this happening in Florida. We have seen horrible \ncases that have been documented in Florida. This is one of the issues I \nhave become passionate about, and anyone could become passionate about, \nif ever a person meets any of these survivors, these young men and \nwomen who have survived some of the most brutal treatment one can \nimagine. So this is a great step forward in reauthorizing not just this \nbill but America's example to the world that we take this issue \nseriously.\n  I also think this is an issue of awareness. In the years to come, I \nhope we will continue to talk about this issue because there is still a \nlack of awareness in this country among many people about how serious \nthis problem truly is. I am grateful we will, hopefully, be able to \nmove forward, and I wish to thank the Senator from Vermont for offering \nthis amendment.\n  Should I yield the floor?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, before the Senator from Florida yields, I \nappreciate the strong support of Senator Rubio. He has been the voice \nof reason and consistency in this area and I appreciate it.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum with the time equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask permission to speak as in morning \nbusiness for 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Senator Grassley pertaining to the introduction of S. \n281 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 21, as Modified\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we are going to vote in a couple minutes, \nbut I would reiterate what I said earlier. This is going to be a vote \non the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act. It is a bill \nthat was written with the input of victims and service providers. Last \nyear, we had 57 cosponsors, including 15 Republicans.\n  I do want to thank Senator Rubio, who was on the floor a few minutes \nago speaking about it.\n  I could not help but think, as I said earlier, when I looked at the \ncalendar today, February 12--the day on which Abraham Lincoln was born; \nand 150 years ago, he delivered the Emancipation Proclamation--wouldn't \nit be great if the Senate passed the Trafficking Victims Protection \nReauthorization Act on President Lincoln's birthday?\n  I also said earlier today that the Senate should be--often is--the \nconscience of the Nation. I have to imagine that the conscience of the \nvast majority of our 300 million Americans--whether they are \nRepublicans or Democrats; liberals, moderates, or conservatives; \nIndependents--their conscience would rebel against the idea of, really, \nslave trafficking, whether it is people trapped in the sex trade or in \nfactories where they face the possibility, if there is a fire, they are \nall going to die because they are forced to be there.\n  Let's speak. Let's speak to the conscience of this country.\n  Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been ordered on my amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield back all time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 21, as modified.\n  The yeas and nays were previously ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New York (Mrs. \nGillibrand) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. CORNYN. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Arizona (Mr. McCain).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, this is a commonsense amendment. We just \nvoted on the Violence Against Women Act amendment for trafficking \noffered by Senator Leahy. This is an amendment that actually deals with \nthe underlying legislation. It is really a clarifying amendment.\n  I am pleased to be joined by Senators Blumenthal, Ayotte, Collins, \nBrown, Cochran, Rubio, Alexander, and Gillibrand. It has to do with \noffering protection and services to victims of sex trafficking under \nVAWA. This simply says under section 302 of VAWA that we ensure sex \ntrafficking is covered.\n  Right now youth and children who are exposed to domestic violence, \ndating violence, or sexual assault or stalking are covered but not sex \ntrafficking. I think it is consistent with the amendment we just \npassed. It is also an important clarification of the underlying bill.\n  There are about 300,000 young Americans the FBI says are at risk \ntoday. This is a commonsense approach, and I would hope that all \nSenators on both sides of the aisle would agree that sex trafficking \nshould be covered by this act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I agree with the Senator from Ohio. I am perfectly willing \nto accept this amendment by a voice vote, and I do support it.\n  I am encouraged that the Senate has voted to pass the Trafficking \nVictims Protection Reauthorization Act, which will let us make real \nprogress in helping victims of human trafficking. I worked with Senator \nRubio last Congress to reauthorize and improve our antitrafficking law \nand needed programs. We were stymied by an anonymous Republican \nobjection. Today we achieved a breakthrough when the Senate voted to \napprove the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act.\n  I thank Senators from both sides of the aisle who have rejected the \ncramped view of the Heritage Foundation and joined with us to make \nprogress on this important issue, to help victims and to help prevent \nhuman trafficking. The vote the Senate just took to approve vital \nantitrafficking legislation will ensure that resources and services get \nto trafficking victims in ways shown to work. By our action, we are \nimproving and strengthening antitrafficking programs.\n  I do not wish to conflate or confuse the two issues. The Violence \nAgainst Women Act provides programs for victims of sexual assault and \ndomestic violence. Trafficking is different, a unique form of abuse \nwith separate programs designed to address it in the Trafficking \nVictims Protection Act.\n  When trafficking victims also experience sexual assault, they can \nalso access programs funded through VAWA for sexual assault victims. \nThe Leahy-Crapo Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act explicitly \nprovides that VAWA programs are to help victims of domestic violence, \ndating violence, sexual assault, or stalking. That includes trafficking \nvictims. That language was carefully crafted with advocates for victims \nof those crimes.\n  Accordingly, I believe that amendment 10 is unnecessary. It \nduplicates and reiterates what the bill already provides. So long as it \ndoes not harm and does not create confusion, I support it. The Senator \nfrom Oklahoma may accuse us of providing duplicative programs, but no \none is going to subject themselves to sexual assault just because they \nmight be eligible for a VAWA program or help from a trafficking \nprogram. No individual victim is going to somehow profit at taxpayers' \nexpense. The amendment is accepted merely as further clarification of \nthe availability of VAWA programs to children who are both victims of \ntrafficking and sexual assault. Sex trafficking victims are by \ndefinition also sexual assault victims.\n  I am not in favor of confusing program administrators or taking \nprogram funds away from victims of rape and domestic violence. I have \nworked hard not to pit victims against each other. Instead, I have \ntried to provide for the needs of all victims.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I want to again thank the chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee, Patrick Leahy, for his leadership on this \nbill and on the issue of human trafficking. He has led this Chamber.\n  I want to thank my colleague, Senator Portman, for truly a \ncommonsense amendment that aims to combat one of the great scourges in \nthe United States and around the world, sex trafficking involving young \npeople. We can take a strong step and send a strong message by \nproviding the kinds of services to young victims as we do to other \nvictims who receive aid under VAWA. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  If there is no further debate, the question is on agreeing to the \namendment.\n  The amendment (No. 11) was agreed to.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 15\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate, equally divided, prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 15, offered by the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Coburn.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, this is an amendment that follows GAO \nrecommendations with which the Justice Department agreed in terms of an \naudit on the duplication within their program. As a matter of fact, I \nhave the data where the Justice Department actually concurred with the \nGAO on it. The purpose of the amendment is to eliminate the backlog in \nDNA testing, both in terms of rape kits and CODIS. The Cornyn amendment \nimproved the bill but does not direct the money necessary. It is a \nsmall percentage, less than 2 percent over 10 years out of that bill, \nless than 2 percent of 1 year's spending. We spent $40 million for 10 \nyears on these grants and what we are asking for is .4 of 1 percent to \nhelp solve the backlog on all the DNA cases.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The bipartisan Leahy-Crapo Violence Against Women \nReauthorization Act already reduces authorization levels and adds \nimportant accountability measures. These are careful, appropriate, and \neffective steps. The Coburn amendment would mandate sweeping cuts which \nwould decimate programs. The amendment is opposed by law enforcement, \nincluding the National Association of Police Organizations, and by the \nNational Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence Against Women.\n  Of course we all want to combat fraud, waste, and abuse. But this \namendment is not the way to do it. The amendment purports to be based \non findings by the U.S. Government Accountability Office, GAO, but it \nmisconstrues those findings. The amendment states that the GAO \nidentified $3.9 billion in ``duplicative'' grants programs. That is \nsimply not the case. The July 2012 GAO report states that the total \namount of grants awarded by the Justice Department in fiscal year 2010 \nwas only $3.6 billion. You cannot have $3.9 billion in duplication when \nthe total amount of grant money awarded was less than that.\n  More importantly, the GAO report did not actually conclude that there \nwas duplication. The July report said there was ``the potential risk of \nunnecessary duplication'' and recommended that the Justice Department \nconduct an assessment to determine if grant programs could be \nconsolidated to mitigate that risk. The GAO did not recommend any \nfunding cuts and certainly did not recommend the $780 million cut that \nthis amendment would require. As I have noted, our bill already \nincludes a 17-percent cut in authorizations.\n  The amendment offered by Senator Coburn requires the Department of \nJustice to gut key grant programs. It would mandate that the Department \ncut at least $780 million from its grant programs, many of which \nprovide critical funding to law enforcement and victim service \nproviders. This would have devastating effects on victims of rape and \ndomestic violence, and I urge Senators to vote against it.\n  The amendment tries to sugarcoat the damage it will do by reference \nto untested rape kits. In fact, it is the amendment that is \nduplicative. We have established the Debbie Smith Act to reduce the \nbacklog of untested rape kits and the Leahy-Crapo bill already includes \nmeasures to reduce the backlog through core VAWA programs and through \nthe inclusion of the SAFER Act.\n  By gutting grant programs to law enforcement and victims, the Coburn \namendment does not help victims of rape, who rely on victim service \nproviders funded with these grants and on law enforcement who count on \nFederal support. Mandating vast cuts in programs for victims and law \nenforcement at a time when those programs are already being squeezed is \nbad policy. These grant programs save lives. The amendment is bad for \nvictims and bad for law enforcement. I urge Senators to oppose it.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters in \nopposition to amendment No. 15 to S. 47, the Violence Against Women \nReauthorization Act of 2013.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              National Association\n\n\n                                of Police Organizations, Inc.,\n\n                          Alexandria, Virginia, February 11, 2013.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy: On behalf of the National Association \n     of Police Organizations (NAPO), representing 241,000 rank-\n     and-file officers from across the United States, I write to \n     you to inform you that we strongly oppose proposed Amendment \n     15, offered by Senator Coburn, to the Violence Against Women \n     Act Reauthorization of 2013 (S. 47).\n       This amendment would mandate cuts of $780 million or more \n     from Department of Justice grant programs. Those cuts would \n     have to come from programs that help victims of crime, like \n     the Violence Against Women Act, or from aid to state and \n     local law enforcement, among other important grant programs.\n       Mandating vast cuts in programs for victims and law \n     enforcement at a time when those programs are already being \n     squeezed is bad policy. State and local governments rely on \n     vital federal assistance, including for bullet proof vests \n     and other life-saving equipment.\n       This VAWA reauthorization already reduces authorization \n     levels and adds important accountability measures. These are \n     careful, appropriate, and effective steps. The Coburn \n     amendment would add sweeping and unprincipled mandated cuts \n     which would decimate programs. For these reasons, we must \n     strongly oppose it.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               William J. Johnson,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n         National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence \n           Against Women,\n                                 Washington, DC, February 8, 2013.\n     Senator Patrick Leahy,\n     Chair, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: The National Task Force to End Sexual \n     and Domestic Violence represents thousands of national, \n     tribal, state, territorial and local organizations, as well \n     as survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual \n     assault, and stalking. We are committed to securing an end to \n     violence against women. National Task Force to End Sexual and \n     Domestic Violence agrees that more funding should be made \n     available for the rape kit backlog and other critical victim \n     services and notes that significant provisions to do this and \n     address the crime of rape are already included in S. 47.\n       On the other hand, the National Task Force to End Sexual \n     and Domestic Violence is opposed to Amendment No. 15 to S. \n     47, proposed by Senator Coburn. Senator Coburn's amendment \n     has the ostensible goal of saving money on administrative \n     costs in order to redirect those funds to address the \n     nation's rape kit backlog. But the amendment's mandates would \n     ultimately cost so much money themselves--that they could not \n     generate the proposed savings promised to alleviate the rape \n     kit backlog.\n       This amendment would mandate cuts of more than $700 million \n     to Department of Justice grant programs, eviscerating \n     services to victims of all crimes and decimating justice \n     system responses to crime.\n       This amendment also requires a top to bottom review of \n     every program in the Department of Justice, every staff \n     position in the Department of Justice, and every staff person \n     hired by every contractor engaged by the Department of \n     Justice. An audit of this scope is simply unworkable and \n     would drain valuable resources that would otherwise support \n     law enforcement agencies, courts, prosecutors' office, and \n     victim services, leaving\n\n[[Page S613]]\n\n     victims of all forms of crime vulnerable to great harm.\n       The audit proposed in Amendment No. 15 would require the \n     Department of Justice to investigate every one of its \n     approximately 110,000 employees, including U.S. Attorneys, \n     FBI agents, federal marshals, ATF employees, federal prison \n     employees, in search of supposed duplications and waste. The \n     U.S. Department of Justice has 38 agencies and is the largest \n     law enforcement agency in this country; to hamper its \n     incredibly important work fighting crime every day with an \n     audit that may or may not yield proof of duplication or \n     waste, is an injustice to all of the people the Justice \n     Department is bound to protect and serve. A review of this \n     size and scope would clearly cost hundreds of millions of \n     dollars, a growth of government functions that is \n     unconscionable in a time of fiscal crisis.\n       There is an easier and much less expensive way to reduce \n     administrative costs in order to dedicate more funding to \n     direct services--and that is accomplished in S. 47. S. 47 \n     consolidates 13 existing programs in the Office on Violence \n     Against Women into 4 programs. S. 47 already addresses \n     duplication and potential waste in Violence Against Women \n     Act-funded programs through these consolidations. S. 47 will \n     free up more funds for direct services by consolidating \n     administrative functions--and will preserve desperately \n     needed services.\n       Amendment No. 15 will require the Department of Justice to \n     spend hundreds of millions of dollars that could otherwise go \n     toward direct services, meaning fewer victims served and more \n     programs closing. We ask you and your fellow Senators to vote \n     NO on Amendment No. 15.\n           Sincerely,\n     The Member Programs of the National Task Force to End Sexual \n                                            and Domestic Violence.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.

Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 16 offered by the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Coburn.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, this is simply an amendment that says if \na woman is raped and there is an article of indictment against the \nrapist, she ought to have a right to know the sexually transmitted \ndiseases that rapist carries.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senator from Oklahoma was a member of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee when the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act \nwas considered and approved. He was a member for many years and never \ncame to me to raise this issue. It has not been considered and its \npotential consequences of cutting 20 percent of Federal assistance \ngrants to states that help law enforcement and encourage arrests in \nsexual assault and domestic violence cases could be disastrous. It is \nthe wrong way to go.\n  I think we all agree that victims of sexual assault should receive \ntesting and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases. The Leahy-\nCrapo bill already adds new coverage for HIV testing and services for \nsexual assault victims. There is also already a five percent penalty in \nthe law for those who don't provide HIV testing.\n  However, the amendment would mandate that states force tests on \ndefendants, those accused of crimes but not tried or convicted. To \nrequire such testing within 48 hours of information or indictment is \npractically difficult or impossible for many states and violates the \nstate constitution in others. This amendment sets up requirements that \nmany state and local governments cannot comply with and will cause \nstates to lose millions in assistance that helps victims of rape and \ndomestic violence.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma has consistently voted against VAWA. That \nis his right. But we should not make the programs more difficult for \nlaw enforcement and victims because he does not support them. This is \nnot the right way to reduce government--by setting up government \nmandates that law enforcement cannot meet and then cutting their \nassistance funding when they cannot. I do not believe this one-size-\nfits-all mandate from Washington to our states is the right way to go.\n  A large majority of states are not in compliance with this provision \nand would lose crucial funds for preventing rape and domestic violence \nand helping victims. These funds are particularly important in \ndifficult economic times, and cutting them would be devastating for \nvictims. The amendment's mandate is overly proscriptive and intrusive \nand would result in a loss of crucial services to many victims. That is \nwhy the National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence Against \nWomen strongly opposes this amendment.\n  I am willing to work on even more ways to ensure that rape victims \nreceive all needed treatment. But doing so with measures that will \npunish the rape victims themselves by denying them access to needed \nservices is inhumane and counter-productive. I urge Senators to oppose \nthis amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters in \nopposition to amendment No. 16 to S. 47, the Violence Against Women \nReauthorization Act of 2013.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence \n           Against Women\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy: The National Task Force to End Sexual \n     and Domestic Violence is comprised of national, tribal, \n     state, territorial and local organizations, as well as \n     individuals, committed to securing an end to violence against \n     women, and we are urging Senators to oppose Amendment No. 16 \n     to S. 47, proposed by Senator Coburn. The National Task Force \n     strongly supports the increased availability of treatment \n     options for victims of sexual violence who have acquired a \n     sexually transmitted infection as a result\n\n[[Page S614]]\n\n     of an assault. While ostensibly this amendment addresses that \n     issue, it in fact fundamentally alters the purpose and \n     approach of one of VAWA's key grant programs and severely \n     penalizes grant recipients for compliance failures that may \n     be impossible for them to meet.\n       The National Task Force would welcome the addition of \n     treatment to the existing language in S. 47 related to victim \n     testing and counseling and the expansion of this purpose area \n     to include all sexually transmitted infections.\n       However, amendment 16 goes well beyond this recommendation. \n     The amendment would require all recipients one of VAWA's \n     grant programs to pay for sexual assault victims' treatment \n     for sexually transmitted infections. Amendment 16 is overly \n     prescriptive and fails to allow states and local governments \n     to address other pressing violence against women priorities \n     in their communities. Additionally, it is administratively \n     unworkable because grantees will have no way to budget for \n     unanticipated costs of treatment.\n       Additionally, amendment 16 goes far beyond current law to \n     require grantees to certify that state law requires testing \n     offenders for all sexually transmitted infections or risk \n     lose 20% of their grant funding. Many states are already \n     losing 5% of certain grants for failure to comply with \n     existing law requiring HIV testing of offenders. Amendment 16 \n     would result in 20% grant penalties for many local \n     governments who would have no way to comply. It is a one size \n     fits all approach to a grant program that was designed \n     specifically to meet critical community priorities as \n     identified by those communities.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                    National Task Force to End\n\n                                      Sexual and Domestic Violence\n                                                    Against Women.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. The people who oppose it oppose it on the grounds they \nmight not get as much money unless they actually keep a woman from \ngetting raped twice--once by the system we set up and once by their \nattacker.\n  If Senators vote against this, what they are saying is they don't \nhave any compassion for the women who don't know the status of the \nperson who raped them. Therefore, they go under treatment; they go \nthrough unknown and severe psychological stress, having to be \nrepeatedly tested.\n  We put this in the bill the last time at 5 percent. All we did this \ntime is raise it to 20 percent to try to reduce this behavior in the \nStates.\n  The chairman of the Judiciary Committee voted for this last time. So \nto say what we are doing is not in the best interests of women is \nwrong. If someone really thinks women ought to get raped twice, vote \nagainst this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, would that it were so simple. The \namendment is simply going to take protections away from thousands of \nwomen, and that is why I oppose it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, today I would like to address a provision \nof the Violence Against Women Act, S. 47, that is of great concern. \nTitle IX of VAWA provides tribal courts with special jurisdiction over \nnon-Indians who are charged with crimes of domestic violence. While \ntitle IX requires tribal courts availing themselves of this special \njurisdiction to provide the non-Indian defendant ``all other rights \nwhose protection is necessary under the Constitution,'' I am concerned \nthat such proceedings have the potential to deprive U.S. citizens of \ncrucial due process rights, especially without further connection to \nthe existing Federal court system.\n  First, title IX currently requires a defendant to be tried by an \nimpartial jury drawn from sources that ``reflect a fair cross section \nof the community.'' We are always concerned that the population from \nwhich a jury is drawn not result in bias against a defendant who may \nnot be part of the same race, culture, or religion as the jurors. While \nthe population of many Indian lands consists of a wide variety of both \nIndians and non-Indians, many parts of Indian country are populated by \nIndians who have close ties to one another but limited interaction with \nnon-Indians. I believe we must seek to minimize the potential for bias \nagainst non-Indian defendants under such circumstances.\n  Second, in State and Federal courts, the defendant has several \noptions with which to challenge the validity of the court's rulings. \nUnder the special jurisdiction laid out in title IX, the defendant \nlacks both the ability to remove his case to Federal court when \nappropriate and the ability to appeal a decision to a Federal appeals \ncourt. While many tribal courts have proven to be as consistent and \nfair as traditional courts, the possibility of removal and appeal is \nkey to the oversight that U.S. citizens rightfully expect in criminal \nproceedings.\n  For these reasons I respectfully urge my colleagues to oppose S. 47.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I recognize the concerns of the \nSenator from Oklahoma. His amendment has good intentions by seeking to \nfind ways to reduce duplication for all Department of Justice, DOJ, \ngrants to State and local governments and nonprofit organizations. I \nagree with the Senator from Oklahoma that we need to pinch every penny.\n  However, as chairwoman of both the Appropriations Committee and the \nSubcommittee on Commerce, Justice and Science, CJS, I must oppose the \namendment. It directs the Justice Department to develop and implement a \nplan that eliminates, consolidates or streamlines seemingly similar \nexisting grant programs to find at least $780 million in savings. Then, \nregardless of whether or not duplication in grant programs is \nidentified, $780 million would be automatically rescinded for deficit \nreduction, unless DOJ chooses to redirect a portion for DNA backlog \nreduction grants.\n  I oppose this amendment for two reasons. First, the fiscal year 2013 \nSenate CJS bill already rescinds over $61 million from DOJ grants, \ncoming on top of $93 million rescinded in the fiscal year 2012 enacted \nbill. The Justice Department's grant components are already struggling \nto meet those mandatory rescissions. In order to meet an additional \n$780 million, this amendment would give the Department enormous power \nto unilaterally terminate programs with no input from Congress.\n  Second, Justice grants have already been slashed, and are likely to \ntake more cuts in the coming months and years. Since fiscal year 2010, \nDOJ grants have been cut by more than $1.5 billion, a 41 percent \nreduction, from $3.6 billion in fiscal year 2010 to $2.1 billion in \nfiscal year 2012, shifting the burden of crime fighting to State and \nlocal governments where budgets are also stressed. Should sequestration \nkick in, grants will be cut by at least $110 million, or another 5 \npercent reduction. This amendment would cut another $780 million from \nprograms like Byrne Justice Assistance Grants, COPS Hiring, youth \nmentoring, bulletproof vests, and the Violence Against Women Act. \nAltogether, this would be an astounding cut of $2.4 billion, or 64 \npercent, since fiscal year 2010.\n\n[[Page S615]]\n\n  The Senator from Oklahoma and I agree that we need to be strong \nsentries over taxpayers' funds. I have encouraged the Attorney General \nto follow GAO's recommendations, and he has responded by directing the \nDepartment to assess and consolidate grant programs when possible in \norder to prevent unnecessary duplication. But the Coburn amendment \nimplements sweeping cuts, which will impact every Justice grant \nprogram. It will hurt our law enforcement and community partners at \nhome, who are already struggling with limited tools to keep our \nfamilies and neighborhoods safe and help victims of crime.\n  I oppose this amendment and urge my colleagues to vote no.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, as a cosponsor of the Violence Against \nWomen Reauthorization Act of 2013, I urge my colleagues to adopt this \nimportant measure.\n  The issue before us is not partisan. It is not of importance to just \none State or region, or to a single group or interest. It is manifestly \nin the interest of every American to reauthorize these important \nprograms that have made such a difference in the lives of women and \nfamilies across this country.\n  Since its passage, the Violence Against Women Act has provided \ncomprehensive support to survivors of domestic and sexual violence and \nto the Federal, State and local agencies that confront this scourge \nevery day. The original legislation passed in 1994 laid a strong \nfoundation that helped establish a coordinated response to violence \nagainst women. Reauthorizations in 2000 and 2005 strengthened that \nfoundation. Today, through violence prevention grants, services to \nsurvivors of sexual assault, legal assistance, transitional housing \ngrants, assistance to law enforcement agencies and prosecutors and \nother efforts, VAWA has made an enormous difference.\n  Deaths due to violent acts by intimate partners have decreased \nsignificantly. And according to a cost-benefit analysis, VAWA saved \nnearly $15 billion in its first 6 years of existence by avoiding the \nhigh social costs violence against women exacts on our Nation. William \nT. Robinson, the president of the American Bar Association, calls VAWA \n``the single most effective federal effort to respond to the epidemic \nof domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault and stalking in \nthis country.''\n  I had hoped the Congress would act to reauthorize VAWA last year. \nThere is no reason that today we cannot pass this legislation with \noverwhelming bipartisan support. Doing so will make an enormous \ndifference in protecting women from domestic abuse and other forms of \nviolence. And it will make a strong statement that the Senate is united \nin our desire to ensure that our mothers, wives, sisters, and daughters \nwill continue to receive that protection.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote on passage of S. 47, \nas amended.\n  Mr. LEAHY. As the Senate now votes on the Violence Against Women \nReauthorization Act, I hope we will join together in a strong \nbipartisan majority to pass this important legislation. Enactment of \nour bill to help all victims of domestic and sexual violence is \noverdue. Together we can finally finish what we started last year. We \nare deeply indebted to the women and men around the country who have \nbeen working with us and have been steadfast in their commitment to the \nvictims and to our efforts to combat domestic violence, dating \nviolence, stalking, and sexual assault.\n  The Violence Against Women Act has been effective at preventing \ncrimes and protecting victims. But there is so much more to be done. \nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's recent survey found \nthat one in four women has been the victim of severe physical domestic \nviolence, and one in five women has been raped in her lifetime. More \nthan half of the homicides in my state of Vermont are related to \ndomestic violence. This is simply unacceptable. We can and we must do \nbetter.\n  The Senate overwhelmingly passed the Leahy-Crapo bill last April. In \nthe nearly 10 months since then, thousands of women around the country \nhave been victimized. We have heard of too many cases, yet the vast \nmajority of these crimes are never reported at all. I cannot help but \nfeel that some of those crimes could have been prevented. Some of those \nvictims could have gotten more assistance. Congress should not delay \nany longer.\n  Our bill offers support for those techniques already proven in the \nfield that help identify high-risk cases and prevent domestic violence \nhomicides. It will increase VAWA's focus on rape victims and push \ncolleges to strengthen their efforts to protect students from domestic \nand sexual violence. This reauthorization will allow us to make real \nprogress in addressing the horrifying epidemic of domestic violence in \ntribal communities. This bipartisan bill will allow services to get to \nthose in the LGBT community who have had trouble accessing services in \nthe past. The bill also includes key improvements for immigrant victims \nof domestic and sexual violence.\n  All of these provisions were included because victims and the people \nwho work with them every day told us they were needed to prevent crimes \nand provide better assistance to victims. We are trying to help victims \nand prevent crime. We have been working to get this bill through the \nSenate and to the House so we can quickly get a good bill to the \nPresident for his signature. We cannot afford further delay while more \nvictims suffer unnecessarily.\n  I, again, thank the Majority Leader for making violence against women \na priority for the Senate. We have been debating this measure since \nlast Monday. We have considered a number of amendments. In the \nlegislative process we have been able to make additional progress by \nadopting the bipartisan Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization \nAct, as well.\n  I noted at the outset of this debate that by providing new tools and \nresources to communities all around the country, we have helped bring \nthe crimes of rape and domestic violence out of the shadows. The \nFederal Government is standing with the women of this country and sent \nthe message that we would no longer tolerate their treatment as second \nclass citizens. Our bill renews and reinforces that commitment.\n  Ending violence against women is not an easy problem to solve, but \nthere are simple and significant steps we can take right now, without \ndelay, by passing this legislation. We have worked hard to make this \nbill bipartisan and I am proud that it has more than 60 Senate \ncosponsors. It also has the support of more than 1400 local, state and \nnational organizations from around the country that work with victims \nevery day and know just how critical this law has been. I included \ntheir most recent letter of support with my remarks last Monday. I, \nagain, thank them for their tireless efforts.\n  There remain some special interest lobbies and some Senators who do \nnot appreciate the role of the Federal Government in helping improve \nthe lives of Americans. It is disappointed that Heritage Action and the \nFamily Research Council are urging opposition to our bipartisan bill. I \nhope that Senators will listen, instead, to the victims and to law \nenforcement and to the more than 1400 national, state, and local \norganizations that strongly support our Violence Against Women \nReauthorization Act.\n  If anyone needs a reminder of how important government help can be, \njust think about the way that Federal and local law enforcement worked \ntogether last week to rescue Ethan, a 5-year-old kidnapped boy, from an \nunderground bunker in Alabama, where he had been held hostage for \nalmost a week. Ask the family and local law enforcement if they \nappreciated the help of the FBI, the Defense Department and so many who \ncontributed to the safe return of that innocent victim.\n  Every day across this nation we are reminded of the importance of \nprograms like the Violence Against Women Act. Our bipartisan bill does \nmore than protect victims of domestic violence. It also contains \nprovisions to protect victims of stalking. This morning the Washington \nPost reported that a ``man stalking one of his victims shot and killed \ntwo women waiting to pass through metal detectors at a courthouse . . . \nTwo male police officers also were struck by bullets . . . but were\n\n[[Page S616]]\n\nsaved by their bullet-proof vests.'' This episode should remind us all \nthat after working to reauthorize and reinvigorate the Violence Against \nWomen Act, we must also reauthorize the Bullet Proof Vest program so \nthat more of our law enforcement officials can be protected.\n\n  I spent years in local law enforcement and have great respect for the \nmen and women who protect us every day. When I hear Senators say that \nwe should not provide Federal assistance, we should not help officers \nget the protection they need with bulletproof vests, or that we should \nnot help the families of fallen public safety officers, I strongly \ndisagree. In our Federal system, we can help and when we can, we should \nhelp. And that is exactly the opportunity that is before us today. We \nhave the power to help improve the lives of millions of people in this \ncountry by renewing and expanding our commitment to end domestic and \nsexual violence and strengthen our commitment against human \ntrafficking. A recent study from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) \nfound that more than 24 people per minute are the victims of rape, \ndomestic violence and stalking in this country. We can take action to \nchange that and we must.\n  I am proud that our bill seeks to support all victims, regardless of \ntheir immigration status, their sexual orientation or their membership \nin an Indian tribe. As I have said countless times on the floor of this \nchamber, ``a victim is a victim is a victim.'' The Violence Against \nWomen Act is an example of how the Federal Government can help solve \nproblems in cooperation with state and local communities. The fact is \nthat women are safer today because of this law and there is no excuse \nnot to improve upon it and reauthorize it without delay. We are working \nto protect victims--all victims--of domestic and sexual violence. I \nurge all Senators to look past the narrow, ideological opposition of \nsome and join with us. That is what the former senior Senator from \nTexas, Senator Hutchison, did last year when her Republican substitute \nwas rejected by the Senate.\n  I hope that despite 14 Republican Senators not voting to proceed to \nconsider the bill and 35 Republican Senators supporting what was a poor \nsubstitute offered and rejected early in this debate, we will have a \nstrong bipartisan vote for final passage. I urge those who previously \nopposed our efforts to improve the Violence Against Women Act to join \nwith us and help the Senate send our strong bill to the House of \nRepresentatives so that we can get it enacted. Despite the predictions \nby some that the Republican House of Representatives will refuse to \nconsider the Senate bill, as it did last year, I see reason for hope. \nJust yesterday 17 Republican members of the House wrote to their own \nleadership urging immediate reauthorization of VAWA.\n  I thank the many Senators who have helped shape this bill and have \nspoken is such strong support of it, including Senator Crapo, Senator \nMikulski, Senator Murkowski, Senator Murray, Senator Klobuchar, Senator \nCoons, Senator Collins, Senator Shaheen, Senator Franken, Senator \nHagan, Senator Casey, and so many others. I also thank their staffs and \nmy own, including Kristine Lucius, Noah Bookbinder, Anya McMurray, \nChris Leopold, Bryan Seeley, and Clark Flynt, for their countless hours \nof work away from their own families as we try to make all families \nsafer and more secure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

If you are someone who has \nseen firsthand the results of violence against women, it would be \nalmost impossible to vote no on this bill. Will this stop all violence? \nNo. But will it stop a lot of it? Yes; and it will also make possible \nfor those who are caught in violence a chance for support, a chance for \nsomeplace to go, a chance to be protected from future attacks.\n  This is the kind of legislation that speaks to the conscience of our \nNation. It speaks to the conscience of the Senate. It tells everybody, \nusually the most defenseless in our society, this body stands with you. \nI would urge our friends on the other side of the Capitol to move \nquickly with similar legislation. This is something we should not hold \nup. This is a way we can say: We oppose violence against women. We \noppose it today. We oppose it tomorrow. We will oppose it forever.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/12/senate-section/article/S645-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S645]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, I was concerned when I saw a number of my \ncolleagues are again trying to block the appointment of Ohioan Richard \nCordray to the consumer agency. That agency has already played a \nsignificant role in saving tens of millions of dollars for consumers \nwho have been wronged in a checking account transaction, who have been \nnickel-and-dimed, and then some by bank fees.\n  Former Ohio Attorney General Cordray has done an excellent job as the \nDirector of that consumer bureau. But what troubles me is this is only \nthe second time in the history of the Senate, at least as far as the \nSenate Historian can figure, when a group of Senators from one party \nhas blocked the nomination of a Presidential appointee because they do \nnot like the agency, because they oppose the construct of the agency \nitself.\n  The first time that ever happened was just a couple of years ago with \nRichard Cordray in this position. The creation of the consumer bureau \nwent through regular order. It was passed by the Senate Banking \nCommittee, on which I sit. It was part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street \nreform bill, and it went to the House of Representatives. It went to \nconference committee. All that happened was regular order to create \nthis agency.\n  Many people didn't like the agency. I submit I agree with that. I \nunderstand that. I don't agree that it is not a good agency. They don't \nlike the agency in large part because it stood up to Wall Street, and \nit stood up to some of the bank abuses that put us in this financial \nsituation as a country with the damage it did to our economy.\n  Even with that, if you don't like the agency, as I said, never before \nin history except these two times--with the same appointment process, \nthe same appointee, the same designee, the same nominee of the \nPresident--has this happened whereby my colleagues said: Even though he \nis qualified, we are not going to vote to confirm Richard Cordray \nbecause we don't like the agency. If you are not willing to change the \nagency, we are not willing to support a director.\n  Imagine the kind of precedent that sets where if you don't like an \nagency, you are never going to let the President confirm a leader of \nthat agency--in any agency of the Federal Government. If you don't like \nfood safety, then you are going to block the appointment. If you don't \nlike transportation, something in the Transportation Department, you \ndon't like something else, you are going to vote against somebody \ntaking the job to run the agency.\n  Government can't run that way. The government will be dysfunctional \nif this precedent is set and is ongoing, in addition to the fact that \nCordray is right for the job. Also, this agency is important for the \nmiddle class, for working-class people, and for low-income people who \nneed these consumer protections.\n  It sets a very bad precedent for this body. I am hopeful some of my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle will think clearly about this \nand move ahead on the nomination and confirmation process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/12/senate-section/article/S645-3", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S645-S646]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DENNIS MEYERS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I stand before you today to honor and \nrecognize a man whose legacy of service to the community, both as a \nphysician and a citizen, is completely deserving of such recognition. I \nam speaking of Mr. Dennis Meyers of Clay County, KY. The Clay County \nDays Hall of Fame has chosen to induct Mr. Meyers for his excellent \nleadership of Manchester Memorial Hospital over the past 12 years.\n  Mr. Meyers' record of service can be traced back to 1969, when he \nserved as a pastor in the Nebraska and Illinois conferences. After \nclose to two decades of pastoral service, he pursued an occupational \nchange that allowed him to aid others in the field of recreational \ntherapy. He continued to pursue opportunities in medicine, moving into \na registered nurse position at Hanford Hospital in 1986. Mr. Meyers \nthen accepted the role of vice president of nursing at San Joaquin \nCommunity Hospital in 1990 and continued success brought him to \nManchester Memorial, where he eventually served as president and chief \nexecutive officer.\n  Dennis Meyers' involvement in and care for his community have been \nimmeasurable, especially when one considers the many community outreach \ninitiatives he fostered. He helped the community by initiating Mission \nin Motion, public health screenings, Live It UP, and mission outreach \nprograms.\n  Mr. Meyers' family shares his devotion to helping others, as his wife \nSusan also works for the hospital and his three children hold nursing \ndegrees. He has recently retired from his lead role at Manchester \nMemorial Hospital but plans to stay involved through outreach and \nchurch programs.\n  At this time, I would like to ask my fellow Senators to join me in \nhonoring Mr. Dennis Meyers for his induction into the Clay County Days \nHall of Fame. The Commonwealth of Kentucky is all the richer because of \nhis tireless spirit and his willingness to work, heal, and serve.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that an article in praise of Mr. Meyers \nthat appeared in the Bell County-area publication The Manchester \nEnterprise be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S646]]\n\n\n\n           [From the Manchester Enterprise, August 30, 2012]\n\n            Dennis Meyers Led Manchester Memorial to Growth\n\n       Clay County Days Hall of Fame inductee Dennis Meyers \n     retired from the lead role of Manchester Memorial Hospital \n     recently after 12 years in the position.\n       Meyers began as a pastor in 1969 in Nebraska and Illinois. \n     In 1980, his career took a dramatic shift when he began \n     working as a recreational therapist at the Battle Creek \n     Sanitarium. In 1986 he transitioned to Hanford Hospital, \n     where he worked as a registered nurse.\n       Four years later, Meyers accepted a position as vice \n     president of nursing at San Joaquin Community Hospital.\n       From there, he became chief operating officer and vice \n     president of nursing at Manchester Memorial, and then \n     president and chief executive officer.\n       Several community outreach initiatives began under Meyer's \n     direction, including Mission in Motion, public health \n     screenings, Live It UP, and mission outreach programs that \n     enrich the community.\n       Meyers holds a bachelor of arts in religion, a bachelor of \n     science in nursing, and a master of divinity from Andrews \n     University.\n       He is married to Susan Meyers, who works for the hospital, \n     and all three of his children hold nursing degrees.\n       Meyers plans to continue helping the community that the \n     hospital serves through community outreach and church \n     programs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/12/senate-section/article/S646-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S646-S647]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. WYDEN.

BOWERS\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Bishop Paul \nAlexander Bowers, who has served as the presiding Bishop of Greater \nEmanuel Apostolic Temple since 1957. Bishop Bowers celebrated his 55th \npastoral anniversary on February 1, 2013, in my hometown of Cincinnati, \nOH.\n  Bishop Bowers was born and raised in Oxford, PA. After his high \nschool graduation he moved to Columbus, OH, where he attended Aenon \nBible College. He graduated in 1951 with a bachelor of theology and \nlater received a bachelor of science from the University of Cincinnati \nin 1964. Bowers also taught in the Cincinnati public school system for \n5 years and retired in 1968 before dedicating his life to ministry.\n  Bishop Bowers served as chairman of the Ohio District Council of the \nPentecostal Assemblies of the World, Inc., PAW, from 1976 to 1992. \nDuring his tenure, he built a 100-bed nursing home, a 1,200 seat \nworship center with a fully-equipped cafeteria which seats 500 people, \nand a dormitory that has the capacity to house over 100 people at the \nODC Campground in Zanesville, OH.\n  Bishop Bowers also served as the diocesan of the Carolina State \nCouncil, assistant general secretary, general secretary, and assistant \npresiding Bishop of PAW. In 1992, he was promoted to the Office of the \nPresiding Bishop, where he served for 6 years. While in this position, \nBishop Bowers was responsible for leading a $2.2 million project to \nrenovate PAW's international headquarters located in Indianapolis, IN.\n  Today, Bishop Bowers serves as the diocesan bishop of the Ohio \nDistrict Council, where he has had the opportunity to further develop \nthe campground in Zanesville, OH.\n  Bishop Bowers has made many contributions through his civic \ninvolvement throughout the southwestern region of Ohio, but I would \nlike to highlight his outreach in prison ministries and his recent \npartnership with reentry organizations in Cincinnati, OH.\n  In August 2011, Bishop Bowers graciously opened the doors of Greater \nEmanuel Apostolic Temple to host my first reentry summit, following my \nelection to the U.S. Senate. While there, I was greeted by many kind \nfaces and witnessed people come in from off the street to take a moment \nto pray in the beautiful sanctuary.\n  Over the years, I have spoken many times about the importance of \nreducing recidivism in our communities and the need for faith-based \nleaders to continue their engagement with those reentering society from \njails and prisons. I first got involved with prisoner reentry issues \nthrough my work on drug prevention and treatment more than 10 years \nago, when I came to understand the close connection between substance \nabuse and recidivism, considering three quarters of those returning \nfrom prison have a history of substance abuse.\n  Faith-based groups are the first line of defense, as well as service, \nto vulnerable and high-risk populations. Faith leaders can use their \ninfluence as an opportunity to direct those in need to proper \nprogramming, and I commend the Greater Emanuel congregation for playing \nan active role in the community and continuing their work to reduce \nrecidivism and change the lives of those in need. Houses of worship \nserve as beacons of hope to guide the lost and help restore their \nlives, which is why I believe the ecumenical community can play an \nimportant role as a partner in recidivism reduction.\n  Mr. President, I would like to congratulate Bishop Bowers on his 55th \nanniversary of pastoral service and recognize him for his continued \nwork on recidivism reduction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/12/senate-section/article/S647-3", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S647-S648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      ALASKA MARINE HIGHWAY SYSTEM\n\n Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the 50th \nanniversary of the Alaska Marine Highway System. Alaskans celebrate \nthis critical and necessary water transportation system\n\n[[Page S648]]\n\nwhich links rural and urban hub communities along the coast of our vast \nState. Unlike the lower 48, many of our communities are not accessible \nby road, so in many areas the primary means of travel is by air or sea. \nTherefore, the Alaska Marine Highway makes up a large part of our \nhighway system and is a route so special it has been designated a \nNational Scenic Byway and an All American Road, the only marine route \nin the United States with this designation.\n  My family and I share special memories of taking the ferries to many \ncommunities throughout Alaska. The Marine Highway was even part of our \ntrip here to Washington for my first year in the Senate. A ferry ride \nbrings Alaskans together while on their way to visit family, play in \nbasketball tournaments, or bring new cars and boats home from the lower \n48.\n  Although the 50-year anniversary commemorates the formal \nestablishment of the Alaska Division of Marine Transportation in 1963, \nthe Alaska Marine Highway System was begun in 1948, initiated by three \nmen with a dream to provide dependable marine transportation among \nAlaska's coastal communities. Haines resident Steve Homer joined forces \nwith brothers Ray and Gustav Gelotte to purchase the M/V Chilkoot and \nset up Chilkoot Motorship Lines. The vessel, formerly a U.S. Navy \nlanding craft, required work to remove its military features and ensure \nit could pass U.S. Coast Guard inspection, but within a few months of \nits purchase, it was deemed ready for service as a civilian passenger \nvessel. The M/V Chilkoot could carry a maximum of only 14 cars and by \nall accounts had ``poor accommodations'' due to retaining many of its \noriginal Navy features. No matter the M/V Chilkoot ferried its first \ntwo cars from Haines to Juneau in August of 1948.\n  As fate would have it, one of those cars belonged to Ernest Gruening, \nthen the Territorial Governor of Alaska. Governor Gruening became an \nardent supporter of the new transportation system and with two other \ncommissioners from the Board of Roads authorized the construction of \nferry ramps in Juneau, Haines, and Skagway. Thus, service to these \nthree small southeast communities was born.\n  In 1988 Steve Homer wrote a letter about his experience starting the \nAlaska Marine Highway System. In that letter he wrote that his initial \nidea of bringing a landing craft to Southeast Alaska was spawned in \n1944 when he commanded such a craft in World War II. He said he signed \npartnership papers to form Chilkoot Motorship Lines in 1949 and that \nthe total required equity capital was $9,177 in 1948 dollars. A few \nyears later the business ran into financial difficulties, and the \nAlaska Territorial Government offered to purchase it. Ownership \ntransferred to the territory in 1951.\n  By 1957 the M/V Chilkoot was too small to meet demand and was \nreplaced by the M/V Chilkat. The M/V Chilkat could carry 59 passengers \nand 15 vehicles. It began daily service between Juneau, Haines, and \nSkagway in April of that year.\n  Two years later, on January 3, 1959, Alaska became the 49th State and \nthe M/V Chilkat became the first State-owned ferry. That same year, the \nFirst Alaska Legislature approved the Alaska Ferry Transportation Act, \nand voters approved bond issues totaling $18 million to expand the \nferry fleet. These bonds enabled the State to commission four new \nvessels and build docks throughout southeast Alaska and the Kenai \nPeninsula. In 1963, with the establishment of the Division of Marine \nTransportation, the Alaska Marine Highway System was officially \nlaunched.\n  Over the past 50 years the Alaska Marine Highway has grown to include \n11 vessels which serve 35 communities. From the southern terminus in \nBellingham, WA, the system stretches more than 3,500 miles to Dutch \nHarbor, AK. It makes port calls in Prince Rupert, BC, and throughout \nAlaska's Inside Passage. It travels across the Gulf of Alaska to Prince \nWilliam Sound and along the Aleutian Chain, all to carry the Nation's \ncommerce to distant destinations and Alaska's passengers to home ports. \nThrough this scenic highway, Alaskans share their incredible natural \nbeauty with visitors from around the world and connect with each other \nthrough a transportation system which has served safely and reliably \nfor 50 years.\n  Thank you for allowing me to celebrate this milestone 50th \nanniversary of the unique Alaska treasure known as the Alaska Marine \nHighway System.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/12/senate-section/article/S648-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S648-S649]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  OBSERVING ELIZABETH PERATROVICH DAY\n\n Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, every year on February 16, Alaskans \ntake time to remember and celebrate Elizabeth Peratrovich, a Tlingit \nwoman who demonstrated courage in her convictions--a courage which \nchanged the course of civil rights treatment for Alaska Natives.\n  Almost 25 years ago, the Alaska State Legislature designated this \ndate as Elizabeth Peratrovich Day to commemorate the signing of the \nAlaska Anti-Discrimination Act of 1945 and to honor Ms. Peratrovich.\n  Elizabeth Wanamaker was born on July 4, 1911. Her family traveled \nextensively on missionary trips throughout southeast Alaska, providing \nElizabeth with broad educational experiences and connecting her with \npeople throughout the region--an extraordinary opportunity for a Native \ngirl of that era.\n  After leaving the State to attend Western College in Bellingham, WA, \nshe returned to Alaska with her new husband, Roy Peratrovich, who was \nhalf Tlingit, to work in the canneries in Klawock. Both were educated \nand interested in Native issues, and Roy joined the Alaska Native \nBrotherhood, ANB, and Elizabeth joined the Alaska Native Sisterhood, \nANS. Both ANB and ANS were working to gain land claims and civil rights \nfor Alaska's Native people. Their interests turned to activism, and \nElizabeth and Roy began to get more involved in their community. Roy \nwas elected as mayor of Klawock.\n  Eventually, the couple decided to move to Alaska's territorial \ncapital, Juneau, in search of more opportunities and a better education \nfor their children. Their dreams quickly dissolved when they discovered \nNatives were not welcome in many places in Juneau. There were signs \nreading ``No dogs, No Natives or Filipinos'' and others that simply \nsaid ``No Natives Allowed.'' They found separate drinking fountains and \nseparate entryways in public buildings for non-Whites. They learned \nthey could only purchase property in Native neighborhoods, could only \nbe seated in a segregated portion of the local theater, and could only \nsend their children to missionary schools--not the public schools for \nwhich they paid a school tax.\n  In 1941, Elizabeth and Roy wrote a joint letter to Territorial \nGovernor Ernest Gruening about their concerns. Many legislators were \nentrenched with the idea that Alaska Natives were second class citizens \nand despite the fact they paid taxes and bore arms in defense of the \nNation, they were not endowed with the same rights as others.\n  However, 1945 brought some hope. Antidiscrimination legislation had \npassed the Alaska State House but was stalled in the Senate. One \nsenator made a speech stating that Natives had only recently emerged \nfrom savagery and they were not fit for society. He argued they had not \nhad the experience of 5,000 years of civilization.\n  With great courage and composure, Elizabeth Peratrovich stood during \npublic testimony and confronted the senator who had just belittled her \nand her people. Not only was she a Native addressing the mostly White \nsenate, she was also the first woman ever to address the body.\n  Elizabeth Peratrovich opened her testimony with, ``I would not have \nexpected that I, who am barely out of savagery, would have to remind \ngentlemen with five thousand years of recorded civilization behind them \nof our Bill of Rights.''\n  The senate gallery and floor exploded in applause. The opposition \nthat had been so absolute and emphatic shrank to a mere whisper.\n  On February 8, 1945, a bill to end discrimination in Alaska passed \nthe senate by a vote of 11 to 5. The bill was signed into law on \nFebruary 16--the day we celebrate Elizabeth Peratrovich Day.\n  Elizabeth Peratrovich was instrumental in making Alaska the first \norganized government under the U.S. flag to condemn discrimination. \nToday in Alaska, we celebrate Elizabeth\n\n[[Page S649]]\n\nPeratrovich Day and affirm our beliefs in equality.\n  Thank you for allowing me to embrace the memory of one woman who \nfought for equality for all, Alaskan Elizabeth Peratrovich.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/12/senate-section/article/S649-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S649]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REMEMBERING KEVIN TONN\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

Officer Tonn lost his life serving \nthe Galt Police Department on January 15, 2013. He was 35 years old.\n  Kevin Tonn was raised in the Sacramento region. He graduated from \nRoseville High School and the Roseville Police Explorers program before \nserving in the U.S. Army as a military police officer at Fort Drum and \nlater as a firefighter in New York. In January 2009, he returned home \nto California and graduated from the Sacramento County Sheriff's \nAcademy.\n  For the past 3\\1/2\\ years, Officer Kevin Tonn was a member of the \nGalt Police Department, where he was known for his hard work, sense of \nhumor, and dedication to the community and its people. In his short \ntime with the department, he was promoted to the K-9 unit, where he \nproudly served with his devoted German Shepherd partner, Yaro.\n  Officer Kevin Tonn, like all those who serve in law enforcement, put \nhis life on the line to protect and serve his community. His commitment \nto public safety and to the citizens he served will never be forgotten.\n  On behalf of the people of California, whom he served so well, I send \nmy gratitude and deep sympathy to his friends and family, including his \nbeloved parents Will and Mary Ann Tonn. We are forever indebted to \nOfficer Tonn for his courage, service, and sacrifice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/12/senate-section/article/S649-2", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S649]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING GORDON H. MANSFIELD\n\n Mr. BURR. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Sanders and \nmyself, as the ranking member and chairman of the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs, I wish to pay tribute to Gordon H. Mansfield, a \ngreat American hero, a distinguished public servant, and a boundless \nadvocate and friend of veterans, who died on January 29, 2013, \nconcluding a life of exceptional service to America.\n  On February 4, 1968, Gordon, then a young Army captain, was leading \ntroops in battle in Quang Tri province, Vietnam, during the Tet \nOffensive when he was shot twice in the spine by the enemy.\n  Without the use of his legs, he made sure all his men were safe and \nall other wounded troops were evacuated before he allowed himself to be \nmedevac'd. Gordon received the Distinguished Service Cross for his \nactions on that day--a day that marked a new beginning, not an end, to \nhis service to our Nation.\n  The wounds Gordon suffered required him to use a wheelchair for \nmobility for the remainder of his life, but after 5 years of \nrehabilitation and thanks to his amazing determination, he graduated \nfrom law school and started a new chapter in his life.\n  In 1981, he joined the staff of the Paralyzed Veterans of America, \nand he later became its executive director. His passion for public \nservice led him to become the Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and \nEqual Opportunity at the Department of Housing and Urban Development. \nAnd in 2001, he joined the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, first as \nAssistant Secretary for Congressional and Legislative Affairs, then as \nDeputy Secretary, and briefly, in 2007, as Acting Secretary.\n  At VA, Gordon brought his unique perspective on the needs of \nparalyzed veterans to the day-to-day management of the Department. He \nspoke out regularly on the need to improve access for paralyzed \nveterans to VA services; to ensure that disabled veterans were properly \ncompensated for their services; and to provide opportunity for every \nparalyzed veteran to live a full, barrier-free, and productive life.\n  In 2009, Gordon retired from VA, but he did not conclude his service \nto veterans and their families. He became a member of the board of \ndirectors of the Wounded Warrior Project, serving a new generation of \nveterans from Iraq and Afghanistan. He also joined the board of \ndirectors of the Disabled Veterans' Life Memorial Foundation.\n  Gordon's lifetime contributions to our country and its citizens were \nwell recognized. In addition to the Distinguished Service Cross, his \nmilitary decorations included the Bronze Star, two Purple Hearts, the \nCombat Infantry Badge, and the Presidential Unit Citation. He was \ninducted into the Army Ranger Hall of Fame in 2007 and the U.S. Army \nOfficer Candidate School Hall of Fame in 1997.\n  He received the Department of Defense Medal for Distinguished Public \nService, the Presidential Distinguished Service Award, the Robert Dole \nService to Our Nation Award, the Disabled American Veterans Outstanding \nDisabled Veteran of the Year Award, and the Paralyzed Veterans of \nAmerica Outstanding Service to Veterans Award.\n  We offer his wife Linda; his children, Gordon and Leon; and his \nentire family our deepest condolences. They, and all Americans, have \nlost a remarkable leader, a courageous hero, and a role model to all \nindividuals with disabilities. He will be sorely missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/12/senate-section/article/S649-3", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S649-S650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         VERMONT ESSAY WINNERS\n\n Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask to have printed in the \nRecord winning essays written by Vermont High School students as part \nof the Third Annual ``What is the State of the Union?'' Essay contest \nconducted by my office.\n  The essays follow.\n\n      Caroline Braun, Champlain Valley Union High School (Winner)\n\n       There is no simple cure for the abundant issues plaguing \n     our nation. Not only are we recovering from a recession, but \n     we also are confronting challenges related to climate change, \n     healthcare, and education. While our efforts to address these \n     issues are noble, our failure to solve them reflects a more \n     concerning societal problem.\n       On December 14, 2012, twenty children and six faculty \n     members were fatally shot in Sandy Hook Elementary School in \n     Newtown, Connecticut. Not only did this devastating tragedy \n     leave close friends, family, and the local community in \n     shock, but also the nation. Though it is remarkable that our \n     country embraced the friends and families of those killed, we \n     only seem to value such a strong sense of community after a \n     crisis. The dramatic increase in violence in the past decade \n     raises new questions about our current societal values and \n     priorities: have we forgotten what's truly important in this \n     new age? While we enjoy the many luxuries that accompany \n     technology and contemporary life, has the lure of modern \n     convenience eclipsed our fundamental human need to take care \n     of and support each other, our families, and our communities?\n       Perhaps it is time we recalibrate who we are and who we \n     want to be as a country so that the fundamental values on \n     which our country was founded can once again flourish. How \n     can one pursue happiness without access to basic healthcare, \n     food, or the ability to spend time with the ones we love? \n     Certainly when our forefathers declared our right to bear \n     arms, their intent was not for corporations and special \n     interest groups to profit from its citizens being armed with \n     assault weapons intended for war. Instead of unbridled greed \n     and big business dominating our economy, it is imperative we \n     support small businesses so they can thrive once again. \n     Environmentally, we have yet to replace our dependence on oil \n     with renewable energy resources and reduce our effects on \n     climate change. And while we all agree educating our children \n     is a requisite investment in our future, teachers continue to \n     earn, on average, 12 percent less than other workers with \n     similar education and work experience.\n       As a world leader and role model for democracy and peace, \n     we need initiatives that not only connect people and \n     communities, but also ones that will act as catalysts for \n     change. Increasing awareness of issues related to social \n     justice will spark larger movements for societal change; \n     whether it is reducing community violence, practicing \n     business ethics, implementing renewable energy sources, \n     advocating for mental health care, or investing in our \n     teachers and schools. Instead of businesses and special \n     interest groups being the sole influence on policies and the \n     direction of our country, now is the time, once again, for \n     all citizens to be heard, cared for, and respected. Although \n     as a nation we have made and continue to make advances that \n     were inconceivable just a century ago, our penchant for the \n     new shouldn't trump our commitment to older values and \n     fundamental human rights.\n\n          Emily Ellsworth, Colchester High School (2nd Place)\n\n       Social mobility is essential to the development of the \n     American character. The ability to overcome class \n     distinctions and succeed economically through hard work \n     equates to opportunity. Yet current U.S. taxation policies \n     are harming the middle-class and widening the gaps of income \n     inequality, thus narrowing the window of opportunity for \n     Americans. Federally enforced legislation such as the Bush \n     Tax Cuts and the income\n\n[[Page S650]]\n\n     tax on capital gains provide a disproportionate amount of \n     benefits to the wealthiest Americans. This leaves a majority \n     of citizens possessing less means to increase their income, \n     obtain education for higher paying occupations and provisions \n     for the next generation.\n       It is necessary to consider the purchasing function and the \n     insurance function of wealth. The quality of a child's \n     education and neighborhood is dependent upon the volume of \n     wealth the parent has access to. Children also receive a very \n     different set of choices and opportunities upon entering the \n     adult world depending on their family's economic status. To \n     combat the further detriment to future generations, taxes \n     must be raised in areas which will inflict minimal harm, and \n     produce the most beneficial results. America is experiencing \n     the largest disproportion of wealth since 1928, and current \n     taxation policy not only aids in widening the income gap, but \n     harms the accumulation of government tax revenue.\n       The sale of stocks and bonds are called ``capital gains.'' \n     Until the 1990's, the capital gains tax was at 28%. Today its \n     current level is 15% which enables less revenue gained from \n     any individuals whose main source of income comes from stocks \n     and bonds, such as wealthy businessmen. In 2006, for \n     instance, Warren Buffett paid 17.7 percent in taxes on the \n     $46 million he booked that year, while his secretary paid 30 \n     percent of her $60,000 salary to the government. Simple \n     practices such as restoring tax rates to past levels are \n     essential to the aid of our country's recovery and to improve \n     the state of the Union.\n\n        Gena Chiola, Mount Abraham Union High School (3rd Place)\n\n       Today, we face problems concerning the environment, war and \n     conflict, as well as lack of resources. In these times, more \n     than ever before, the solution to these problems lies in \n     global communication. If we put our heads together, and help \n     each other, we can create a plan to reduce climate change. If \n     we increase our efforts to work out conflicts between \n     countries, through effective communication, less people will \n     lose their lives through unnecessary wars. Sharing of \n     resources can occur when we effectively communicate between \n     countries, which will reduce poverty worldwide. All it takes \n     is effective global communication to resolve global issues.\n       One major global problem is conflict between nations. There \n     will always be conflicts between people, it is part of being \n     human, but how we deal with these conflicts is what makes the \n     difference. Today, approximately 60 countries are involved in \n     a war. Millions of people die each year from these conflicts. \n     This fighting and killing is indeed a form of communication, \n     but it is not effective in solving world problems. We \n     accomplish nothing by killing people. We need to stop \n     thinking of ourselves as being separated by national \n     boundaries and focus on how to break down these walls. By \n     communicating and working towards the same common goal, we \n     will improve the planet. If we think globally, we will have \n     more of a chance of communicating globally, and resolving \n     conflicts through peaceful means, rather than war.\n       Enter Climate Change conundrum. Climate Change is the \n     increased temperature of the atmosphere due to human carbon \n     emissions. Our use of gasoline to run cars, and oil to heat \n     our homes contributes to the heating of the climate. We are \n     slowly destroying our environment, and creating an \n     increasingly dangerous habitat for all living thing. It is no \n     question that this is a dangerous issue that needs \n     addressing. And in order to address it, we must work \n     together. Bill Mckibben, of Vermont, helps us do this. He \n     organized 350.org, which is a global campaign to solve \n     climate change. The mission of 350.org is ``building a global \n     grassroots movement to solve the climate crisis.'' He \n     organizes global rallies and projects to bring the world \n     together in the face of this crisis. He helps us communicate \n     as a world to get the job done, since it can be done no other \n     way.\n       Earth's lack of resources needs to be addressed and solved \n     through global communication. 25,000 people die from hunger \n     every day. Other poverty induced diseases, like AIDs, cause \n     millions of deaths worldwide. However, by globally \n     communicating, we can reduce poverty. Global communication \n     can help us redistribute the resources. Some places are \n     brimming over with resources, such as fresh food, water, and \n     technology while others suffer. The U.S.A. has an abundance \n     of resources. If we use global communication to be at peace \n     with one another, we can share what we have, so that less \n     people suffer. If the United States were to share resources \n     with poverty stricken countries of Africa, people in Africa \n     would have happier lives, while people in the United States \n     would still have enough to live comfortably. This can all be \n     achieved through effective global communication.\n       Global communication is the answer. If we all put our \n     hearts and heads together, and forget our differences, we can \n     change the world for the better, which is always the ultimate \n     goal. Whether it's to prevent wars, bring the temperature of \n     the atmosphere down, or to redistribute resources, it's \n     undebatable that communication is what we need. Let us come \n     together, and work together and never forget the importance \n     of global communication.\n\n\n                              Bibliography\n\n       Mckibben, B. 350.org.

Mr. President, on March 1, 2013, one of Oregon's \nmost dedicated leaders will retire. I want to take a few minutes to pay \ntribute to a public servant and one of Oregon's foremost advocates for \nveterans, Jim Willis.\n  Jim has worked selflessly to better the State and the nation. For 48 \nyears, he has been helping others, from his two enlistments in the U.S. \nAir Force, including a tour of wartime service in South Vietnam, to a \ncareer with the Oregon State Police, to his time with the American \nLegion, and finally his leadership at the Oregon Department of Veterans \nAffairs, ODVA.\n  After his service in Vietnam, Jim knew what it felt like to return \nhome to a country where veterans were not always welcomed and at times \nforgotten. He understood the words of George Washington when he said, \n``The willingness with which our young people are likely to serve in \nany war, no matter how justified, is directly proportional to how they \nperceive the veterans of earlier wars were treated and appreciated by \ntheir nation.''\n  This is why Jim championed funding for the Oregon Veterans' Home, \npressed for veteran health care funding under the Federal VA system, \nincreased financing limits on veterans' home loans, supported the \nconstruction of the Oregon Medal of Honor Memorial and Afghan-Iraqi \nFreedom Memorial, and initiated the construction of a second veterans \nhome in Lebanon, Oregon.\n  I cannot say enough about the distinguished efforts Jim has made over \nthe last 23 years at ODVA on behalf of servicemembers and their \nfamilies. With his direction, our heroes knew there were trained \nservice officers in their county ready to assist them with benefits, \nhome loans, and countless other issues. The trained professionals and \nthe team he built at ODVA were always willing to help a veteran in a \ntime of need. As President of the National Association of State \nDirectors of Veterans Affairs, Jim coordinated these efforts nationally \nto assure veterans received what they worked so hard for.\n  I am grateful to have had Jim as a partner in several endeavors at \nthe Federal level, including the effort to put a halt to pension \npoachers who were stealing money and benefits from veterans under the \nguise of veterans' assistance.\n  Even in retirement, Jim will continue to find ways to give back to \nthe community. He will continue to serve on the American Legion \nNational Cemetery Committee, on the Veteran of Foreign Wars National \nResolutions Committee, and as Vice President of the Oregon World War II \nMemorial Foundation.\n  I could not be prouder of Jim and his life's work. He embodies the \nbest of Oregon and the best of a grateful nation. As our servicemembers \ncontinue to come home and reintegrate into society, I am confident the \nbenefits and services they have earned will be available to them \nbecause of Jim and people like him. His dedication to veterans will \ncontinue to have a lasting impact on ODVA for years to come.\n  Mr. President, I know Senator Merkley will be speaking after me to \nexpress his gratitude for Jim's many years of hard work. I'm proud to \njoin my fellow Oregonians in recognizing the great service of Jim \nWillis and wishing him the best as he begins this new chapter in his \nlife.\n Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to echo what my \ncolleague Senator Wyden said in recognition of Jim Willis, a native \nOregonian and one of Oregon's greatest champions for veterans and their \nfamilies.\n  As an airman during the Vietnam War, and as an officer for the Oregon \nState Police, Jim has dedicated his life to serving and protecting the \ncitizens of the United States and the State of Oregon.\n\n[[Page S651]]\n\n  Jim saw his work as fulfilling a sacred obligation: we all have the \nresponsibility to honor and care for our veterans. For the past decade, \nunder Jim's leadership, the Oregon Department of Veterans' Affairs, \nODVA, has stayed true to its mission and recognized and honored \nOregon's veterans and their families by providing the highest quality \nprograms, services and benefits.\n  Jim's dedication to providing quality programs and resources to all \nveterans and their families has lead ODVA--a relatively small agency--\nto accomplish a lot during his service. His decision to retire comes on \nthe heels of some major accomplishments over the last few years, \nincluding beginning construction of a new veterans' home and the \ncompletion of a community center, both to serve Oregon's elderly \nveterans. Jim's legacy will be the impact that these projects will have \non the lives of Oregon's veterans and their families.\n  With his service to the American Legion National Cemetery Committee \nand Veterans of Foreign Wars, and his current tenure as President of \nthe National Association of State Directors of Veterans Affairs, Jim \nworks from a national platform to promote and advocate for veterans \nbenefits. For Jim, every day is Veterans Day.\n  It has been a pleasure to work with Jim, both as a member of the \nOregon State Legislature and as a U.S. Senator.\n  Jim will be retiring to his home in Albany, where he will spend time \nwith his family. He plans to ``continue to be concerned for my fellow \nveterans as long as I am able to assist in serving them in the \nfuture,'' and in that regard will continue to be active in the American \nLegion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars and with the committee overseeing \nOregon's World War II Memorial, currently under construction on the \ngrounds of the Oregon Capitol.\n  Oregon is proud of and grateful for all of the hard work and \nleadership displayed by Jim Willis over his long and decorated career. \nI am especially proud of his many achievements and I thank him for his \nmany years of outstanding public service. We wish him a happy and \nhealthy retirement, and thank him for his continued dedication to \nOregon's veterans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/12/senate-section/article/S651-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S651-S655]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   REPORT ON THE STATE OF THE UNION DELIVERED TO A JOINT SESSION OF \n                  CONGRESS ON FEBRUARY 12, 2013--PM 2\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States which was ordered to lie on the \ntable:\n\nTo The Congress of the United States:\n  Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, fellow \ncitizens:\n  Fifty-one years ago, John F. Kennedy declared to this Chamber that \n``the Constitution makes us not rivals for power but partners for \nprogress. . . It is my task,'' he said, ``to report the State of the \nUnion--to improve it is the task of us all.''\n  Tonight, thanks to the grit and determination of the American people, \nthere is much progress to report. After a decade of grinding war, our \nbrave men and women in uniform are coming home. After years of grueling \nrecession, our businesses have created over six million new jobs. We \nbuy more American cars than we have in five years, and less foreign oil \nthan we have in twenty. Our housing market is healing, our stock market \nis rebounding, and consumers, patients, and homeowners enjoy stronger \nprotections than ever before.\n  Together, we have cleared away the rubble of crisis, and can say with \nrenewed confidence that the State of our Union is stronger.\n  But we gather here knowing that there are millions of Americans whose \nhard work and dedication have not yet been rewarded. Our economy is \nadding jobs--but too many people still can't find full-time employment. \nCorporate profits have rocketed to all-time highs--but for more than a \ndecade, wages and incomes have barely budged.\n  It is our generation's task, then, to reignite the true engine of \nAmerica's economic growth--a rising, thriving middle class.\n  It is our unfinished task to restore the basic bargain that built \nthis country--the idea that if you work hard and meet your \nresponsibilities, you can get ahead, no matter where you come from, \nwhat you look like, or who you love.\n  It is our unfinished task to make sure that this Government works on \nbehalf of the many, and not just the few; that it encourages free \nenterprise, rewards individual initiative, and opens the doors of \nopportunity to every child across this great Nation.\n  The American people don't expect Government to solve every problem. \nThey don't expect those of us in this chamber to agree on every issue. \nBut they do expect us to put the Nation's interests before party. They \ndo expect us to forge reasonable compromise where we can. For they know \nthat America moves forward only when we do so together; and that the \nresponsibility of improving this Union remains the task of us all.\n  Our work must begin by making some basic decisions about our budget--\ndecisions that will have a huge impact on the strength of our recovery.\n  Over the last few years, both parties have worked together to reduce \nthe deficit by more than $2.5 trillion--mostly through spending cuts, \nbut also by raising tax rates on the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans. \nAs a result, we are more than halfway towards the goal of $4 trillion \nin deficit reduction that economists say we need to stabilize our \nfinances.\n  Now we need to finish the job. And the question is, how?\n  In 2011, Congress passed a law saying that if both parties couldn't \nagree on a plan to reach our deficit goal, about a trillion dollars' \nworth of budget cuts would automatically go into effect this year. \nThese sudden, harsh, arbitrary cuts would jeopardize our military \nreadiness. They'd devastate priorities like education, energy, and \nmedical research. They would certainly slow our recovery, and cost us \nhundreds of thousands of jobs. That's why Democrats, Republicans, \nbusiness leaders, and economists have already said that these cuts, \nknown here in Washington as ``the sequester,'' are a really bad idea.\n  Now, some in this Congress have proposed preventing only the defense \ncuts by making even bigger cuts to things like education and job \ntraining; Medicare and Social Security benefits.\n  That idea is even worse. Yes, the biggest driver of our long-term \ndebt is the rising cost of health care for an aging population. And \nthose of us who care deeply about programs like Medicare must embrace \nthe need for modest reforms--otherwise, our retirement programs will \ncrowd out the investments we need for our children, and jeopardize the \npromise of a secure retirement for future generations.\n  But we can't ask senior citizens and working families to shoulder the \nentire burden of deficit reduction while asking nothing more from the \nwealthiest and most powerful. We won't grow the middle class simply by \nshifting the cost of health care or college onto families that are \nalready struggling, or by forcing communities to lay off more teachers, \ncops, and firefighters. Most Americans--Democrats, Republicans, and \nIndependents--understand that we can't just cut our way to prosperity. \nThey know that broad-based economic growth requires a balanced approach \nto deficit reduction, with spending cuts and revenue, and with \neverybody doing their fair share. And that's the approach I offer \ntonight.\n  On Medicare, I'm prepared to enact reforms that will achieve the same \namount of health care savings by the beginning of the next decade as \nthe reforms proposed by the bipartisan Simpson-Bowles commission. \nAlready, the Affordable Care Act is helping to slow the growth of \nhealth care costs. The reforms I'm proposing go even further. We'll \nreduce taxpayer subsidies to prescription drug companies and ask more \nfrom the wealthiest seniors. We'll bring down costs by changing the way \nour Government pays for Medicare, because our medical bills shouldn't \nbe based on the number of tests ordered or days spent in the hospital--\nthey should be based on the quality of care that our seniors receive. \nAnd I am open to additional reforms from both parties, so\n\n[[Page S652]]\n\nlong as they don't violate the guarantee of a secure retirement. Our \nGovernment shouldn't make promises we can't keep--but we must keep the \npromises we've already made.\n\n  To hit the rest of our deficit reduction target, we should do what \nleaders in both parties have already suggested, and save hundreds of \nbillions of dollars by getting rid of tax loopholes and deductions for \nthe well-off and well-connected. After all, why would we choose to make \ndeeper cuts to education and Medicare just to protect special interest \ntax breaks? How is that fair? How does that promote growth?\n  Now is our best chance for bipartisan, comprehensive tax reform that \nencourages job creation and helps bring down the deficit. The American \npeople deserve a tax code that helps small businesses spend less time \nfilling out complicated forms, and more time expanding and hiring; a \ntax code that ensures billionaires with high-powered accountants can't \npay a lower rate than their hard-working secretaries; a tax code that \nlowers incentives to move jobs overseas, and lowers tax rates for \nbusinesses and manufacturers that create jobs right here in America. \nThat's what tax reform can deliver. That's what we can do together.\n  I realize that tax reform and entitlement reform won't be easy. The \npolitics will be hard for both sides. None of us will get 100 percent \nof what we want. But the alternative will cost us jobs, hurt our \neconomy, and visit hardship on millions of hardworking Americans. So \nlet's set party interests aside, and work to pass a budget that \nreplaces reckless cuts with smart savings and wise investments in our \nfuture. And let's do it without the brinksmanship that stresses \nconsumers and scares off investors. The greatest Nation on Earth cannot \nkeep conducting its business by drifting from one manufactured crisis \nto the next. Let's agree, right here, right now, to keep the people's \nGovernment open, pay our bills on time, and always uphold the full \nfaith and credit of the United States of America. The American people \nhave worked too hard, for too long, rebuilding from one crisis to see \ntheir elected officials cause another.\n  Now, most of us agree that a plan to reduce the deficit must be part \nof our agenda. But let's be clear: deficit reduction alone is not an \neconomic plan. A growing economy that creates good, middle-class jobs--\nthat must be the North Star that guides our efforts. Every day, we \nshould ask ourselves three questions as a Nation: How do we attract \nmore jobs to our shores? How do we equip our people with the skills \nneeded to do those jobs? And how do we make sure that hard work leads \nto a decent living?\n  A year and a half ago, I put forward an American Jobs Act that \nindependent economists said would create more than one million new \njobs. I thank the last Congress for passing some of that agenda, and I \nurge this Congress to pass the rest. Tonight, I'll lay out additional \nproposals that are fully paid for and fully consistent with the budget \nframework both parties agreed to just 18 months ago. Let me repeat--\nnothing I'm proposing tonight should increase our deficit by a single \ndime. It's not a bigger Government we need, but a smarter Government \nthat sets priorities and invests in broad-based growth.\n  Our first priority is making America a magnet for new jobs and \nmanufacturing.\n  After shedding jobs for more than 10 years, our manufacturers have \nadded about 500,000 jobs over the past three. Caterpillar is bringing \njobs back from Japan. Ford is bringing jobs back from Mexico. After \nlocating plants in other countries like China, Intel is opening its \nmost advanced plant right here at home. And this year, Apple will start \nmaking Macs in America again.\n  There are things we can do, right now, to accelerate this trend. Last \nyear, we created our first manufacturing innovation institute in \nYoungstown, Ohio. A once-shuttered warehouse is now a state-of-the art \nlab where new workers are mastering the 3D printing that has the \npotential to revolutionize the way we make almost everything. There's \nno reason this can't happen in other towns. So tonight, I'm announcing \nthe launch of three more of these manufacturing hubs, where businesses \nwill partner with the Departments of Defense and Energy to turn regions \nleft behind by globalization into global centers of high-tech jobs. And \nI ask this Congress to help create a network of fifteen of these hubs \nand guarantee that the next revolution in manufacturing is Made in \nAmerica.\n  If we want to make the best products, we also have to invest in the \nbest ideas. Every dollar we invested to map the human genome returned \n$140 to our economy. Today, our scientists are mapping the human brain \nto unlock the answers to Alzheimer's; developing drugs to regenerate \ndamaged organs; devising new material to make batteries ten times more \npowerful. Now is not the time to gut these job-creating investments in \nscience and innovation. Now is the time to reach a level of research \nand development not seen since the height of the Space Race. And today, \nno area holds more promise than our investments in American energy.\n  After years of talking about it, we are finally poised to control our \nown energy future. We produce more oil at home than we have in 15 \nyears. We have doubled the distance our cars will go on a gallon of \ngas, and the amount of renewable energy we generate from sources like \nwind and solar--with tens of thousands of good, American jobs to show \nfor it. We produce more natural gas than ever before--and nearly \neveryone's energy bill is lower because of it. And over the last four \nyears, our emissions of the dangerous carbon pollution that threatens \nour planet have actually fallen.\n\n  But for the sake of our children and our future, we must do more to \ncombat climate change. Yes, it's true that no single event makes a \ntrend. But the fact is, the 12 hottest years on record have all come in \nthe last 15. Heat waves, droughts, wildfires, and floods--all are now \nmore frequent and intense. We can choose to believe that Superstorm \nSandy, and the most severe drought in decades, and the worst wildfires \nsome states have ever seen were all just a freak coincidence. Or we can \nchoose to believe in the overwhelming judgment of science--and act \nbefore it's too late.\n  The good news is, we can make meaningful progress on this issue while \ndriving strong economic growth. I urge this Congress to pursue a \nbipartisan, market-based solution to climate change, like the one John \nMcCain and Joe Lieberman worked on together a few years ago. But if \nCongress won't act soon to protect future generations, I will. I will \ndirect my Cabinet to come up with executive actions we can take, now \nand in the future, to reduce pollution, prepare our communities for the \nconsequences of climate change, and speed the transition to more \nsustainable sources of energy.\n  Four years ago, other countries dominated the clean energy market and \nthe jobs that came with it. We've begun to change that. Last year, wind \nenergy added nearly half of all new power capacity in America. So let's \ngenerate even more. Solar energy gets cheaper by the year--so let's \ndrive costs down even further. As long as countries like China keep \ngoing all-in on clean energy, so must we.\n  In the meantime, the natural gas boom has led to cleaner power and \ngreater energy independence. That's why my Administration will keep \ncutting red tape and speeding up new oil and gas permits. But I also \nwant to work with this Congress to encourage the research and \ntechnology that helps natural gas burn even cleaner and protects our \nair and water.\n  Indeed, much of our new-found energy is drawn from lands and waters \nthat we, the public, own together. So tonight, I propose we use some of \nour oil and gas revenues to fund an Energy Security Trust that will \ndrive new research and technology to shift our cars and trucks off oil \nfor good. If a non-partisan coalition of CEOs and retired generals and \nadmirals can get behind this idea, then so can we. Let's take their \nadvice and free our families and businesses from the painful spikes in \ngas prices we've put up with for far too long. I'm also issuing a new \ngoal for America: let's cut in half the energy wasted by our homes and \nbusinesses over the next twenty years. The States with the best ideas \nto create jobs and lower energy bills by constructing more efficient \nbuildings will receive Federal support to help make it happen.\n\n[[Page S653]]\n\n  America's energy sector is just one part of an aging infrastructure \nbadly in need of repair. Ask any CEO where they'd rather locate and \nhire: a country with deteriorating roads and bridges, or one with high-\nspeed rail and internet; high-tech schools and self-healing power \ngrids. The CEO of Siemens America--a company that brought hundreds of \nnew jobs to North Carolina--has said that if we upgrade our \ninfrastructure, they'll bring even more jobs. And I know that you want \nthese job-creating projects in your districts. I've seen you all at the \nribbon-cuttings.\n  Tonight, I propose a ``Fix-It-First'' program to put people to work \nas soon as possible on our most urgent repairs, like the nearly 70,000 \nstructurally deficient bridges across the country. And to make sure \ntaxpayers don't shoulder the whole burden, I'm also proposing a \nPartnership to Rebuild America that attracts private capital to upgrade \nwhat our businesses need most: modern ports to move our goods; modern \npipelines to withstand a storm; modern schools worthy of our children. \nLet's prove that there is no better place to do business than the \nUnited States of America. And let's start right away.\n  Part of our rebuilding effort must also involve our housing sector. \nToday, our housing market is finally healing from the collapse of 2007. \nHome prices are rising at the fastest pace in six years, home purchases \nare up nearly 50 percent, and construction is expanding again.\n  But even with mortgage rates near a 50-year low, too many families \nwith solid credit who want to buy a home are being rejected. Too many \nfamilies who have never missed a payment and want to refinance are \nbeing told no. That's holding our entire economy back, and we need to \nfix it. Right now, there's a bill in this Congress that would give \nevery responsible homeowner in America the chance to save $3,000 a year \nby refinancing at today's rates. Democrats and Republicans have \nsupported it before. What are we waiting for? Take a vote, and send me \nthat bill. Right now, overlapping regulations keep responsible young \nfamilies from buying their first home. What's holding us back? Let's \nstreamline the process, and help our economy grow.\n  These initiatives in manufacturing, energy, infrastructure, and \nhousing will help entrepreneurs and small business owners expand and \ncreate new jobs. But none of it will matter unless we also equip our \ncitizens with the skills and training to fill those jobs. And that has \nto start at the earliest possible age.\n  Study after study shows that the sooner a child begins learning, the \nbetter he or she does down the road. But today, fewer than 3 in 10 \nfour-year-olds are enrolled in a high-quality preschool program. Most \nmiddle-class parents can't afford a few hundred bucks a week for \nprivate preschool. And for poor kids who need help the most, this lack \nof access to preschool education can shadow them for the rest of their \nlives.\n  Tonight, I propose working with states to make high-quality preschool \navailable to every child in America. Every dollar we invest in high-\nquality early education can save more than seven dollars later on--by \nboosting graduation rates, reducing teen pregnancy, even reducing \nviolent crime. In States that make it a priority to educate our \nyoungest children, like Georgia or Oklahoma, studies show students grow \nup more likely to read and do math at grade level, graduate high \nschool, hold a job, and form more stable families of their own. So \nlet's do what works, and make sure none of our children start the race \nof life already behind. Let's give our kids that chance.\n  Let's also make sure that a high school diploma puts our kids on a \npath to a good job. Right now, countries like Germany focus on \ngraduating their high-school students with the equivalent of a \ntechnical degree from one of our community colleges, so that they're \nready for a job. At schools like P-Tech in Brooklyn, a collaboration \nbetween New York Public Schools, the City University of New York, and \nIBM, students will graduate with a high school diploma and an \nassociate's degree in computers or engineering.\n  We need to give every American student opportunities like this. Four \nyears ago, we started Race to the Top--a competition that convinced \nalmost every state to develop smarter curricula and higher standards, \nfor about 1 percent of what we spend on education each year. Tonight, \nI'm announcing a new challenge to redesign America's high schools so \nthey better equip graduates for the demands of a high-tech economy. \nWe'll reward schools that develop new partnerships with colleges and \nemployers, and create classes that focus on science, technology, \nengineering, and math--the skills today's employers are looking for to \nfill jobs right now and in the future.\n  Now, even with better high schools, most young people will need some \nhigher education. It's a simple fact: the more education you have, the \nmore likely you are to have a job and work your way into the middle \nclass. But today, skyrocketing costs price way too many young people \nout of a higher education, or saddle them with unsustainable debt.\n  Through tax credits, grants, and better loans, we have made college \nmore affordable for millions of students and families over the last few \nyears. But taxpayers cannot continue to subsidize the soaring cost of \nhigher education. Colleges must do their part to keep costs down, and \nit's our job to make sure they do. Tonight, I ask Congress to change \nthe Higher Education Act, so that affordability and value are included \nin determining which colleges receive certain types of Federal aid. And \ntomorrow, my Administration will release a new ``College Scorecard'' \nthat parents and students can use to compare schools based on a simple \ncriterion: where you can get the most bang for your educational buck.\n  To grow our middle class, our citizens must have access to the \neducation and training that today's jobs require. But we also have to \nmake sure that America remains a place where everyone who's willing to \nwork hard has the chance to get ahead.\n  Our economy is stronger when we harness the talents and ingenuity of \nstriving, hopeful immigrants. And right now, leaders from the business, \nlabor, law enforcement, and faith communities all agree that the time \nhas come to pass immigration reform.\n  Real reform means strong border security, and we can build on the \nprogress my Administration has already made--putting more boots on the \nsouther border than at any time in our history, and reducing illegal \ncrossings to their lowest levels in 40 years.\n  Real reform means establishing a responsible pathway to earned \ncitizenship--a path that includes passing a background check, paying \ntaxes and a meaningful penalty, learning English, and going to the back \nof the line behind the folks trying to come here legally.\n  And real reform means fixing the legal immigration system to cut \nwaiting periods, reduce bureaucracy, and attract the highly skilled \nentrepreneurs and engineers that will help create jobs and grow our \neconomy.\n  In other words, we know what needs to be done. As we speak, \nbipartisan groups in both chambers and working diligently to draft a \nbill, and I applaud their efforts. Now let's get this done. Send me a \ncomprehensive immigration reform bill in the next few months, and I \nwill sign it right away.\n  But we can't stop there. We know our economy is stronger when our \nwives, mothers, and daughters can live their lives free from \ndiscrimination in the workplace, and free from the fear of domestic \nviolence. Today, the Senate passed the Violence Against Women Act that \nJoe Biden originally wrote almost 20 years ago. I urge the House to do \nthe same. And I ask this Congress to declare that women should earn a \nliving equal to their efforts, and finally pass the Paycheck Fairness \nAct this year.\n  We know our economy is stronger when we reward an honest day's work \nwith honest wages. But today, a full-time worker making the minimum \nwage earns $14,500 a year. Even with the tax relief we've put in place, \na family with two kids that earns the minimum wage still lives below \nthe poverty line. That's wrong. That's why, since the last time this \nCongress raised the minimum wage, nineteen states have chosen to bump \ntheirs even higher.\n\n  Tonight, let's declare that in the wealthiest Nation on Earth, no one \nwho works full-time should have to live\n\n[[Page S654]]\n\nin poverty, and raise the Federal minimum wage to $9.00 an hour. This \nsingle step would raise the incomes of millions of working families. It \ncould mean the difference between groceries or the food bank; rent or \neviction; scraping by or finally getting ahead. For businesses across \nthe country, it would mean customers with more money in their pockets. \nIn fact, working folks shouldn't have to wait year after year for the \nminimum wage to go up while CEO pay has never been higher. So here's an \nidea that Governor Romney and I actually agreed on last year: let's tie \nthe minimum wage to the cost of living, so that it finally becomes a \nwage you can live on.\n  Tonight, let's also recognize that there are communities in this \ncountry where no matter how hard you work, it's virtually impossible to \nget ahead. Factory towns decimated from years of plants packing up. \nInescapable pockets of poverty, urban and rural, where young adults are \nstill fighting for their first job. America is not a place where chance \nof birth or circumstance should decide our destiny. And that is why we \nneed to build new ladders of opportunity into the middle class for all \nwho are willing to climb them.\n  Let's offer incentives to companies that hire Americans who've got \nwhat it takes to fill that job opening, but have been out of work so \nlong that no one will give them a chance. Let's put people back to work \nrebuilding vacant homes in run-down neighborhoods. And this year, my \nAdministration will begin to partner with 20 of the hardest-hit towns \nin America to get these communities back on their feet. We'll work with \nlocal leaders to target resources at public safety, education, and \nhousing. We'll give new tax credits to businesses that hire and invest. \nAnd we'll work to strengthen families by removing the financial \ndeterrents to marriage for low-income couples, and doing more to \nencourage fatherhood--because what makes you a man isn't the ability to \nconceive a child; it's having the courage to raise one.\n  Stronger families. Stronger communities. A stronger America. It is \nthis kind of prosperity--broad, shared, and built on a thriving middle \nclass--that has always been the source of our progress at home. It is \nalso the foundation of our power and influence throughout the world.\n  Tonight, we stand united in saluting the troops and civilians who \nsacrifice every day to protect us. Because of them, we can say with \nconfidence that America will complete its mission in Afghanistan, and \nachieve our objective of defeating the core of al Qaeda. Already, we \nhave brought home 33,000 of our brave servicemen and women. This \nspring, our forces will move into a support role, while Afghan Security \nforces take the lead. Tonight, I can announce that over the next year, \nanother 34,000 American troops will come home from Afghanistan. This \ndrawdown will continue. And by the end of next year, our war in \nAfghanistan will be over.\n  Beyond 2014, America's commitment to a unified and sovereign \nAfghanistan will endure, but the nature of our commitment will change. \nWe are negotiating an agreement with the Afghan government that focuses \non two missions: training and equipping Afghan forces so that the \ncountry does not again slip into chaos, and counter-terrorism efforts \nthat allow us to pursue the remnants of al Qaeda and their affiliates.\n  Today, the organization that attacked us on 9/11 is a shadow of its \nformer self. Different al Qaeda affiliates and extremist groups have \nemerged--from the Arabian Peninsula to Africa. The threat these groups \npose is evolving. But to meet this threat, we don't need to send tens \nof thousands of our sons and daughters abroad, or occupy other nations. \nInstead, we will need to help countries like Yemen, Libya, and Somalia \nprovide for their own security, and help allies who take the fight to \nterrorists, as we have in Mali. And, where necessary, through a range \nof capabilities, we will continue to take direct action against those \nterrorists who pose the gravest threat to Americans.\n  As we do, we must enlist our values in the fight. That is why my \nAdministration has worked tirelessly to forge a durable legal and \npolicy framework to guide our counterterrorism operations. Throughout, \nwe have kept Congress fully informed of our efforts. I recognize that \nin our democracy, no one should just take my word that we're doing \nthings the right way. So, in the months ahead, I will continue to \nengage with Congress to ensure not only that our targeting, detention, \nand prosecution of terrorists remains consistent with our laws and \nsystem of checks and balances, but that our efforts are even more \ntransparent to the American people and to the world.\n  Of course, our challenges don't end with al Qaeda. America will \ncontinue to lead the effort to prevent the spread of the world's most \ndangerous weapons. The regime in North Korea must know that they will \nonly achieve security and prosperity by meeting their international \nobligations. Provocations of the sort we saw last night will only \nisolate them further, as we stand by our allies, strengthen our own \nmissile defense, and lead the world in taking firm action in response \nto these threats.\n  Likewise, the leaders of Iran must recognize that now is the time for \na diplomatic solution, because a coalition stands united in demanding \nthat they meet their obligations, and we will do what is necessary to \nprevent them from getting a nuclear weapon. At the same time, we will \nengage Russia to seek further reductions in our nuclear arsenals, and \ncontinue leading the global effort to secure nuclear materials that \ncould fall into the wrong hands--because our ability to influence \nothers depends on our willingness to lead.\n  America must also face the rapidly growing threat from cyber-attacks. \nWe know hackers steal people's identities and infiltrate private e-\nmail. We know foreign countries and companies swipe our corporate \nsecrets. Now our enemies are also seeking the ability to sabotage our \npower grid, our financial institutions, and our air traffic control \nsystems. We cannot look back years from now and wonder why we did \nnothing in the face of real threats to our security and our economy.\n  That's why, earlier today, I signed a new Executive Order that will \nstrengthen our cyber defenses by increasing information sharing, and \ndeveloping standards to protect our national security, our jobs, and \nour privacy. Now, Congress must act as well, by passing legislation to \ngive our government a greater capacity to secure our networks and deter \nattacks.\n  Even as we protect our people, we should remember that today's world \npresents not only dangers, but opportunities. To boost American \nexports, support American jobs, and level the playing field in the \ngrowing markets of Asia, we intend to complete negotiations on a Trans-\nPacific Partnership. And tonight, I am announcing that we will launch \ntalks on a comprehensive Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership \nwith the European Union--because trade that is free and fair across the \nAtlantic supports millions of good-paying American jobs.\n  We also know that progress in the most impoverished parts of our \nworld enriches us all. In many places, people live on little more than \na dollar a day. So the United States will join with our allies to \neradicate such extreme poverty in the next two decades: by connecting \nmore people to the global economy and empowering women; by giving our \nyoung and brightest minds new opportunities to serve and helping \ncommunities to feed, power, and educate themselves; by saving the \nworld's children from preventable deaths; and by realizing the promise \nof an AIDS-free generation.\n  Above all America must remain a beacon to all who seek freedom during \nthis period of historic change. I saw the power of hope last year in \nRangoon--when Aung San Suu Kyi welcomed an American President into the \nhome where she had been imprisoned for years; when thousands of Burmese \nlined the streets, waving American flags, including a man who said, \n``There is justice and law in the United States. I want our country to \nbe like that.''\n  In defense of freedom, we will remain the anchor of strong alliances \nfrom the Americas to Africa; from Europe to Asia. In the Middle East, \nwe will stand with citizens as they demand their universal rights, and \nsupport stable transitions to democracy. The process will be messy, and \nwe cannot presume to dictate the course of change in countries like \nEgypt; but we can--and will--insist on respect for the fundamental\n\n[[Page S655]]\n\nrights of all people. will keep the pressure on a Syrian regime that \nhas murdered its own people, and support opposition leaders that \nrespect the rights of every Syrian. And we will stand steadfast with \nIsrael in pursuit of security and a lasting peace. These are the \nmessages I will deliver when I travel to the Middle East next month.\n  All this work depends on the courage and sacrifice of those who serve \nin dangerous places at great personal risk--our diplomats, our \nintelligence officers, and the men and women of the United States Armed \nForces. As long as I'm Commander in Chief, we will do whatever we must \nto protect those who serve their country abroad, and we will maintain \nthe best military in the world. We will invest in new capabilities, \neven as we reduce waste and wartime spending. We will ensure equal \ntreatment for all service members, and equal benefits for their \nfamilies--gay and straight. We will draw upon the courage and skills of \nour sisters and daughters, because women have proven under fire that \nthey are ready for combat. We will keep faith with our veterans--\ninvesting in world-class care, including mental health care, for our \nwounded warriors; supporting our military families; and giving our \nveterans the benefits, education, and job opportunities they have \nearned. And I want to thank my wife Michelle and Dr. Jill Biden for \ntheir continued dedication to serving our military families as well as \nthey serve us.\n  But defending our freedom is not the job of our military alone. We \nmust all do our part to make sure our God-given rights are protected \nhere at home. That includes our most fundamental right as citizens: the \nright to vote. When any Americans--no matter where they live or what \ntheir party--are denied that right simply because they can't wait for \nfive, six, or seven hours just to cast their ballot, we are betraying \nour ideals. That's why, tonight, I'm announcing a non-partisan \ncommission to improve the voting experience in America. And I'm asking \ntwo long-time experts in the field, who've recently served as the top \nattorneys for my campaign and for Governor Romney's campaign, to lead \nit. We can fix this, and we will. The American people demand it. And so \ndoes our democracy.\n  Of course, what I've said tonight matters little if we don't come \ntogether to protect our most precious resource--our children.\n  It has been two months since Newtown. I know this is not the first \ntime this country has debated how to reduce gun violence. But this time \nis different. Overwhelming majorities of Americans--Americans who \nbelieve in the 2nd Amendment--have come together around commonsense \nreform--like background checks that will make it harder for criminals \nto get their hands on a gun. Senators of both parties are working \ntogether on tough new laws to prevent anyone from buying guns for \nresale to criminals. Police chiefs are asking our help to get weapons \nof war and massive ammunition magazines off our streets, because they \nare tired of being outgunned.\n  Each of these proposals deserves a vote in Congress. If you want to \nvote no, that's your choice. But these proposals deserve a vote. \nBecause in the two months since Newtown, more than a thousand \nbirthdays, graduations, and anniversaries have been stolen from our \nlives by a bullet from a gun.\n  One of those we lost was a young girl named Hadiya Pendleton. She was \n15 years old. She loved Fig Newtons and lip gloss. She was a majorette. \nShe was so good to her friends, they all thought they were her best \nfriend. Just three weeks ago, she was here, in Washington, with her \nclassmates, performing for her country at my inauguration. And a week \nlater, she was shot and killed in a Chicago park after school, just a \nmile away from my house.\n  Hadiya's parents, Nate and Cleo, are in this chamber tonight, along \nwith more than two dozen Americans whose lives have been torn apart by \ngun violence. They deserve a vote.\n  Gabby Giffords deserves a vote.\n  The families of Newtown deserve a vote.\n  The families of Aurora deserve a vote.\n  The families of Oak Creek, and Tucson, and Blacksburg, and the \ncountless other communities ripped open by gun violence--they deserve a \nsimple vote.\n  Our actions will not prevent every senseless act of violence in this \ncountry. Indeed, no laws, no initiatives, no administrative acts will \nperfectly solve all the challenges I've outlined tonight. But we were \nnever sent here to be perfect. We were sent here to make what \ndifference we can, to secure this Nation, expand opportunity, and \nuphold our ideals through the hard, often frustrating, but absolutely \nnecessary work of self-government.\n  We were sent here to look out for our fellow Americans the same way \nthey look out for one another, every single day, usually without \nfanfare, all across this country. We should follow their example.\n  We should follow the example of a New York City nurse named Menchu \nSanchez. When Hurricane Sandy plunged her hospital into darkness, her \nthoughts were not with how her own home was faring--they were with the \ntwenty precious newborns in her care and the rescue plan she devised \nthat kept them all safe.\n  We should follow the example of a North Miami woman named Desiline \nVictor. When she arrived at her polling place, she was told the wait to \nvote might be six hours. And as time ticked by, her concern was not \nwith her tired body or aching feet, but whether folks like her would \nget to have their say. Hour after hour, a throng of people stayed in \nline in support of her. Because Desiline is 102 years old. And they \nerupted in cheers when she finally put on a sticker that read ``I \nVoted.''\n  We should follow the example of a police officer named Brian Murphy. \nWhen a gunman opened fire on a Sikh temple in Wisconsin, and Brian was \nthe first to arrive, he did not consider his own safety. He fought back \nuntil help arrived and ordered his fellow officers to protect the \nsafety of the Americans worshipping inside--even as he lay bleeding \nfrom twelve bullet wounds.\n  When asked how he did that, Brian said, ``That's just the way we're \nmade.''\n  That's just the way we're made.\n  We may do different jobs, and wear different uniforms, and hold \ndifferent views than the person beside us. But as Americans, we all \nshare the same proud title:\n  We are citizens. It's a word that doesn't just describe our \nnationality or legal status. It describes the way we're made. It \ndescribes what we believe. It captures the enduring idea that this \ncountry only works when we accept certain obligations to one another \nand to future generations; that our rights are wrapped up in the rights \nof others; and that well into our third century as a Nation, it remains \nthe task of us all, as citizens of these United States, to be the \nauthors of the next great chapter in our American story.\n  Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, February 12, 2013.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/12/senate-section/article/S655-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S655-S657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-331.

JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Johnson of South Dakota, Mr. \n        Enzi, and Mr. Brown):\n  S. 281. A bill to amend the Food Security Act of 1985 to restore \nintegrity to and strengthen payment limitation rules for commodity \npayments and benefits; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the farm bill \nand then specifically about reforming payment limits for farm programs.\n  As one looks back to the fall of 2011 and the failure of what was \nreferred to as the ``supercommittee,'' we saw many committees continue \non with business as usual afterwards. However, one committee's members \ntook it upon themselves to continue efforts to tackle spending and \npropose meaningful cuts--the Senate Agriculture Committee.\n  For that matter, the House Agriculture Committee worked towards that \nend as well. I commend Chairman Stabenow and then Ranking Member \nRoberts for corralling the many ideas of the members of the committee \nto write a bill that cut $23 billion.\n  We were able to work in committee to get the bill done. We were able \nto work in a bipartisan manner to get the bill across the Senate floor. \nIt is how legislation is supposed to be considered and debated in the \nSenate.\n  One of the measures in last year's farm bill was my proposal \nreforming payment limitations in the farm program.\n  Adopting reforms to payment limitations contributed to the $23 \nbillion in savings. Beyond just being a part of saving money, these \nreforms help ensure farm payments go to those who they were originally \nintended--small and medium-size farmers.\n  In addition, the reforms include closing off loopholes so nonfarmers \ncan't game the system. I will come back to my proposed reforms in a \nminute after I say just a few words about the overall farm bill \npicture.\n  As we all know, Congress was not able to complete work on the farm \nbill last year. But that is not for a lack of desire by either the \nSenate nor the House Agriculture Committees. There remains a desire to \nget a 5-year bill passed.\n  Supporters of the farm bill need to take a hard look at what \nchallenges were presented last year to getting the bill done. We need \nto forge ahead knowing some tough decisions need to be made.\n  For the Senate, we need to consider whether it is realistic that we \nonly reduce $4 billion out of the nearly $800 billion nutrition title. \nMore can and should be done. The nutrition title comprised by far and \naway the largest expenditure in the bill.\n  There are more reforms we can make to programs such as food stamps, \nand they are reforms that cut down on waste, fraud, and abuse in the \nprogram but also safeguard assistance for people who need it.\n  There are other programs we need to take a fresh look at. Should we \naccept the status quo on the sugar program? How do we handle dairy \npolicy? What policy can we implement in the commodity program that \nwon't distort planting decisions but maintains an effective safety net?\n  These are some of the many issues we need to debate again and decide. \nI, for one, hope we are able to start soon and work together to get a \n5-year bill completed this year. Our farmers and rural communities \ndeserve to have certainty.\n  When we do move forward on drafting a new farm bill, I will again be \npushing for the reforms to payment limitations. That is why today I am \nintroducing the Farm Program Integrity Act of 2013 with Senators \nJohnson of South Dakota, Senator Enzi, and Senator Brown.\n  The proposed legislation strikes a needed balance of recognizing the \nneed for a farm safety net while making sure we have a defensible and \nresponsible safety net.\n  In case there is any doubt, we do need a farm program safety net. For \nthose who argue we do not need a safety net for our farmers, I argue \nthey do not understand the danger of a nation which does not produce \nits own food.\n  Take Germany and Japan during World War II, for instance. There came \na point where their soldiers had difficulty fighting because they \ndidn't have food to eat. So today their respective governments maintain \nvigorous support for their farmers.\n  It is a matter of social cohesion as well. Without a secure source of \nfood, we jeopardize our very way of life. Look around the world where \nthere is hunger and you see rioting, stealing, and other acts of \nviolence. We need our farmers to keep producing our food.\n  For all the advances in modern agriculture, farmers are still subject \nto\n\n[[Page S659]]\n\nconditions out of their control. Just look at the drought that still \ngrips much of the U.S.\n  Without an adequate safety net, some farmers would be left with no \nability to make it the following year. That would mean potentially less \nfood being produced for an ever-increasing world population. That is a \nscary prospect.\n  While farmers need a safety net, there does come a point where a \nfarmer gets big enough and financially secure so that he can weather \ntough times without much assistance from the government.\n  Somehow, though, over the years there has developed this perverse \nscenario where big farmers are receiving the lion's share of farm \nprogram payments. We now have the largest 10 percent of farmers \nreceiving nearly 70 percent of farm payments.\n  There is nothing wrong with a farmer growing his operation, but the \ntaxpayer should not be subsidizing large farming operations to grow \neven larger. By having reasonable caps on the amount of farm program \npayments any one farmer can receive, it helps ensure the program meets \nthe intent of assisting small and medium-size farmers through tough \ntimes.\n  My proposed caps on payments will also help encourage the next \ngeneration of rural Americans to take up farming.\n  I am approached time and again about how to help young people get \ninto farming. When large farmers are able to use farm program payments \nto drive up the cost of land and rental rates, our farm programs end up \nhurting those they are meant to help.\n  It is simply good policy to have a hard cap on the amount a farmer \ncan receive in farm program payments. We will keep in place a much \nneeded safety net for the farmers who need it most. And it will help \nreduce the negative impact farm payments have on land prices.\n  Our bill sets the overall cap at $250,000 for a married couple. In my \nState, many people would say this is still too high.\n  But I recognize that agriculture can look different around the \ncountry, and so this is a compromise.\n  Just as important to setting a hard cap on payments is closing off \nloopholes that have allowed nonfarmers to game the farm program.\n  The bill being introduced today will do this by cutting off the \nability of these nonfarmers from abusing what is referred to as the \n``actively engaged'' test.\n  In essence, the law says one has to be actively engaged in farming to \nqualify for farm payments. However, this has been exploited by people \nwho have virtually nothing to do with the farming operation yet receive \npayments from the farm program.\n  Our Nation has over $16 trillion in debt. We cannot afford to simply \nlook the other way and let people abuse the farm program.\n  The Farm Program Integrity Act of 2013 is the same in purpose as what \nit states in the name. This is about increasing the integrity of the \nprogram.\n  My colleagues here in the Senate agreed with me last year as we \nincluded these pivotal reforms in the farm bill. I am confident these \nreforms will garner similar approval in the 113th Congress.\n  I mentioned earlier how we need to assess some of the challenging \nareas of farm policy as we look to pass a 5-year farm bill, and some \ntough decisions need to be made.\n  However, my proposed reforms regarding payment limits do not pose a \ntough decision. They are common sense and necessary reforms.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I rise today to join with \nmy friend and colleague from Iowa, Chuck Grassley, in introducing the \nFarm Program Integrity Act of 2013, which would establish commonsense, \nmeaningful farm program payment limitations. I am pleased that Senator \nSherrod Brown and Senator Mike Enzi are also joining us in this effort. \nAt a time when our country faces significant budgetary constraints, it \nis important that we look for bipartisan and commonsense approaches to \nrestructuring programs in such a way that improves their effectiveness \nwhile also reducing the deficit. Our legislation will do that, and our \napproach has already garnered widespread support.\n  The current structure of our farm support program has, in a number of \nways, failed rural America. In 2008, the largest 12.4 percent of farms \nreceived 62.4 percent of farm program payments, according to the United \nStates Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service, USDA ERS. \nWith such a disproportionate share of the program going to the largest, \nmost capitalized operations, the small and medium-sized family farmers \nare squeezed out of the business. The farm bill is intended to provide \nprograms that function as a safety net for farmers, but it has instead \nbecome a cash cow for the few large producers. We must maintain a \nsafety net for producers, but the system must be targeted to family \nfarmers instead of large agribusinesses.\n  The 2008 farm bill took some important steps to strengthen the \nintegrity of our farm support system. The bill established an income \nthreshold for program eligibility in which payments are limited to \nproducers with less than $500,000 in non-farm Adjusted Gross Income, \nAGI, and $750,000 in on-farm AGI, for a total limit of $1.25 million \nAGI. Additionally, the law eliminated the triple-entity loophole and \nrequired that payments go to a specific individual through direct \nattribution. These were important first steps. However, there is much \nmore we must do to restore integrity to our farm programs.\n  Under the current law, we have a system of support for producers in \nthe form of direct and counter-cyclical payments. Direct payments are \ncapped at $40,000 and counter-cyclical payments are capped at $65,000; \nadditionally, there is no cap on marketing loan gains and loan \ndeficiency payments, and thus, there is effectively no total \nlimitation. This is unacceptable. Without a cap on payments, the \nFederal Government is subsidizing producers to get bigger, which in \nturn makes it more difficult for the smaller family farmers, and \nparticularly young and beginning producers, to survive.\n  Last June, we took some meaningful steps in the Senate to address the \nstructure of our farm support system. Senators from both sides of the \naisle came together to pass the Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act, \nS. 3240, commonly referred to as the farm bill, with broad support. The \nbill, as passed out of the Senate Agriculture Committee, contained a \nhard cap of $50,000 on payments under the new Agriculture Risk \nCoverage, ARC, program, a program developed to replace the antiquated \ndirect and counter-cyclical programs.\n  The committee-reported bill also contained important language to \nclose loopholes that have allowed ``paper-partners,'' or individuals \nnot directly engaged in the farming operation, to receive farm program \npayments. The bill created an important new standard for determining \nwho qualifies as a farm manager. In addition to the language \nincorporated into the underlying bill, Senator Grassley and I also \noffered an amendment during floor consideration to cap marketing loan \ngains and loan deficiency payments at $75,000. Our amendment passed \noverwhelmingly with 75 votes.\n  The House Agriculture Committee marked up and reported its own \nversion of the farm bill reauthorization. Unfortunately, the House \nleadership refused to bring the bill to the floor before the end of \n2012. As a result, Congress was left in the position of having to pass \nan extension of the 2008 farm bill, and push off work on a full \nreauthorization, including the important reforms we included in the \nSenate-passed bill, until the 113th Congress.\n  The legislation we are offering today combines the cap on farm \nprogram payments and language to close loopholes from the Senate-passed \nbill. As Congress proceeds with reauthorizing our farm programs, I will \ncontinue pushing to ensure that we finally provide for meaningful \npayment limitations and target assistance to small and medium-sized \nfamily farms.\n  As the most important industry in South Dakota, agriculture is the \neconomic engine that drives our rural communities. Without viable \nfamily farmers and ranchers, our small towns and Main Street businesses \nwould face significant financial hardships. I have worked with Senator \nGrassley on this issue for a number of years, and I'm proud to once \nagain join with him today to continue this important fight.\n\n[[Page S660]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Grassley, and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 286. A bill to enhance civil penalties under the Federal \nsecurities laws, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the Strengthening \nEnforcement of Civil Penalties Act or the SEC Penalties Act with my \ncolleague, Senator Grassley. I am pleased that Senator Leahy has joined \nus in introducing the bill this year.\n  The SEC Penalties Act will enhance the ability of securities \nregulators to protect investors and demand greater accountability from \nmarket players. Unfortunately, even after the financial crisis that \ncrippled the economy, some on Wall Street continue to pursue profits at \nall costs, making the calculated decision to do wrong and move on. \nWithout the consequence of meaningful penalties to impact decision-\nmaking, I fear we will continue to witness a disturbing culture of \nmisconduct by some on Wall Street.\n  The current regime for securities law violations limits by statute \nthe amount of penalties the Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, \ncan fine an institution or individual. During hearings I held in 2011 \nin the Securities, Insurance, and Investment Banking Subcommittee, I \nfound out how this limitation significantly ties the hands of the SEC \nin performing its enforcement duties. At that time, the agency had been \ncriticized by a Federal judge for not obtaining a larger settlement \nagainst Citigroup, a major player in the financial crisis that ended up \nsettling with the SEC in an amount that was a fraction of the cost the \nbank had inflicted on investors and the profits the bank had ultimately \npocketed. The SEC explained that the low settlement amount was because \nit was statutorily prohibited from levying a larger penalty.\n  The bill we are introducing seeks to substantially update and \nstrengthen the SEC's civil penalties statute. This legislation should \ncause potential and current offenders to think twice before engaging in \nmisconduct by increasing the statutory limits on civil monetary \npenalties, directly linking the size of these penalties to the scope of \nharm and associated investor losses, and substantially raising the \nfinancial stakes for repeat offenders of our nation's securities laws.\n  Specifically, our bill would increase the per violation cap for the \nmost egregious securities laws violations to $1 million per offense for \nindividuals and $10 million per offense for entities. This will help \nensure that the SEC's most severe, or ``tier three,'' penalties will \nhelp deter people from engaging in the most serious offenses, rather \nthan have such wrongdoing be viewed as just the cost of doing business. \nUnder existing law, the SEC can only penalize individual securities law \nviolators a maximum of $150,000 per offense and institutions $725,000 \nper offense.\n  Our bill also would allow penalties equal to three times the economic \ngain of the violator. It provides a new calculation method that \nincludes the amount of associated investor losses as part of the \npenalty determination. This should allow the SEC to address situations \nwhere the actual economic gain to the violator is relatively small \ncompared to the extent of the wrongdoing or the harm caused to \ninvestors.\n  The SEC Penalties Act also addresses the disconcerting trend of \nrepeat offenders on Wall Street. Our bill includes two statutory \nchanges to substantially improve the ability of the SEC's enforcement \nprogram to ratchet up penalties for recidivists.\n  One provision would allow the SEC to triple the applicable penalty \ncap for recidivists who, within the preceding five years, have been \ncriminally convicted of securities fraud or been the subject of a \njudgment or order imposing monetary, equitable, or administrative \nrelief in any action alleging SEC fraud.\n  The other provision would allow the SEC to seek a civil penalty if an \nindividual or entity has violated an existing federal court injunction \nor bar imposed by the SEC. Many believe this approach would be more \nefficient, effective, and flexible than the current civil contempt \nremedy.\n  Finally, under the SEC Penalties Act, the penalty relief available in \nadministrative proceedings would be the same as it is in district \ncourt.\n  The nearly one-half of all U.S. households that own securities \ndeserve a strong cop on the beat that has the tools it needs to go \nafter fraudsters and the difficult cases arising from our increasingly \ncomplex financial markets. The SEC Penalties Act will help by giving \nthe SEC more tools to demand meaningful accountability from Wall Street \nand protect investors, which in turn will improve transparency and \nincrease confidence in our financial system. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this important bipartisan legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself and Mrs. Shaheen):\n  S. 289. A bill to extend the low-interest refinancing provisions \nunder the Local Development Business Loan Program of the Small Business \nAdministration; to the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss the \nimportance of small businesses in the United States. It cannot be \nstated enough that small businesses are the economic engines of our \ncountry. Small businesses also represent the essence of the American \nDream. They are creators of new jobs and innovative technologies. In \nfact, over the last 15 years, businesses employing less than 500 people \nhave created 93 percent of all new jobs and employed 58.6 million \nworkers. Businesses employing less than 20 people alone employed 21.3 \nmillion workers. In my home state of Louisiana, small businesses make \nup about 98 percent of businesses. As Chair of the Senate Committee on \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship, I remain focused on the needs of \nthese small businesses. That is why I am here today to introduce a bill \nthat I believe will help spur job creation among small businesses.\n  As you know, right now our country is only slowly recovering from the \nworst economic downturn since the Great Depression. This economic \ndownturn disproportionately affected small businesses and, in turn, \nstifled their ability to generate growth for the country. Sadly, since \nNovember 2008, 80 percent of the job losses have come from small \nbusinesses. An estimated 2.16 million jobs were lost in the private \nsector from November 2008 through February 2009--nearly 40 percent from \nbusinesses with less than 50 employees. Ten jobs lost here and five \njobs there add up. These are the job losses that hurt our economy, our \ncommunities and our families.\n  With this in mind, I was proud to lead Congressional efforts to enact \nthe Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, Public Law 111-240. President \nObama signed this legislation into law on September 27, 2010. This \nlegislation focused on the three ``C's'' important to small businesses: \nCapital, Contracting, and Counseling. Today I would like to focus on \nCapital and more specifically, on the Small Business Administration's \n504 Loan Refinancing Program, which unfortunately expired in September \n2012.\n  The 504 loan program is a long-term financing tool for economic \ndevelopment that provides small businesses with long-term, fixed-rate \nloans to help them acquire major fixed assets and real estate for \nexpansion or modernization. The Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 allowed \nsmall businesses to use the 504 loan program to refinance certain \nqualifying existing debt for 2 years. While loan volumes were \nrelatively low in the program's first year, the SBA made a number of \nprogram modifications to encourage and allow more small businesses to \ntake advantage of the long terms and low interest rates offered by the \nprogram. In fiscal year 2012, the program's second and final year, the \nSBA approved over 2,400 refinancings for over $2.2 billion to small \nbusinesses.\n  Unfortunately, on September 27, 2012, the program expired just as it \nwas gaining traction in the small business community. Over the past \nyear, in my conversations with small business owners and in testimonies \ngiven in roundtables and hearings before the Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship, I have consistently heard the need to \nextend this portion of the 504 loan program. The bill that I am \nintroducing today would extend for 5 years the provision allowing small \nbusiness owners to use Small Business Administration, SBA, 504 loans to \nrefinance existing commercial mortgages. Extending the 504 refinancing \nprogram is a commonsense way to help small\n\n[[Page S661]]\n\nbusinesses and create jobs. By allowing small businesses to refinance \nqualified commercial real estate debt, this program lowers their \nmonthly mortgage payments at no cost to taxpayers. At a time when we \nare still facing high unemployment, this extension is one of many \nthings that we should be doing to put more capital in the hands of \nAmerica's job creators.\n  I would like to reiterate that this is not a new proposal, and it has \nconsistently received bipartisan support. In total, last year I filed \nthis extension either as a bill or an amendment four times. The 504 \nrefinance provision extension was originally introduced as S. 2364 by \nSenators Snowe, Landrieu, Isakson, and Shaheen. Title II of the SUCCESS \nAct, which I introduced during the 112th Congress, also included the \nrefinance provision. On July 12, 2012, the Senate voted on the SUCCESS \nAct as part of Senate Amendment 2521 to S. 2237, the Small Business \nJobs and Tax Relief Act of 2012. Although the amendment came up short \nof the 60 votes needed to end debate, the SUCCESS Act amendment \nreceived a strong 57 bipartisan votes, including five of my Republican \ncolleagues. Finally, I included the provision in a substitute amendment \nthat I cosponsored to the JOBS Act of 2012 and offered the 504 \nrefinancing language as an amendment to the Veterans Jobs Bill. I urge \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle to come together in support of \nthis common-sense, cost effective program.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 289\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
