Mr. President, when President Obama proposed a plan \nyesterday\n\n[[Page S6084]]\n\nto simplify our corporate Tax Code and lower rates for businesses, I \nexpected Republicans all over the country but especially here in \nCongress to jump for joy. I think there are many people around the \ncountry who were satisfied and happy, but the Republican leadership in \nthe Congress surprised me and I think a lot of people by their \nreaction. Just a few months ago Leader McConnell signaled he would be \nopen to a plan to reform the Tax Code. This is what he said:\n\n       I'm told President Obama is going to come out for lowering \n     the corporate tax rate. To the extent he wants to do some of \n     these things, our answer is going to be yes.\n\n  It is amazing how quickly his answer went from yes to no, no. \nRepublicans have favored corporate tax reform for decades. We have \nheard them say so. This was one of the mantras during the Presidential \ncampaign. But now that President Obama is proposing it, Republicans are \nopposing it.\n  The President's thoughtful approach would couple lower tax rates, \ncorporate tax rates, with investments in job-creating measures, such as \nroads and bridges and dams, worker training programs, and manufacturing \nincentives.\n  He was in the State of Tennessee when he made this announcement. They \nare a picture book as to how corporate interests there can really move \non. They have done a great job in Tennessee, and I would bet that at \nevery corporation in Tennessee they were elated to hear what President \nObama had to say yesterday.\n  It is going to take a balanced approach and include smart spending \ncuts, closing wasteful loopholes and asking corporations that will \nbenefit from lower tax rates to contribute their fair share. Even \nSpeaker Boehner supported this approach in the past. This is what he \nsaid just a short time ago:\n\n       If we want to put Americans back to work, I think lowering \n     the corporate tax rate is critically important. And to do \n     that, I think we have to look at the tax-expenditure side, \n     the deductions, credits, and other gimmicks that may be in \n     the tax code and that have accumulated over the last 30 \n     years.\n\n  I do not say this very often, but Speaker Boehner was right.\n  This is the kind of balanced approach to deficit reduction the \nAmerican people favor--a simpler tax code that lowers rates, makes our \nbusinesses more competitive, but also raises new revenue to invest in \njob creation. We have learned that the sequestration has already cut \n1.6 million jobs, so we need job creation. We need to help the middle \nclass by creating jobs. As President Obama said, if we are going to \ngive businesses a better deal, we need to give workers a better deal \nalso. We can use the money we save by simplifying the Tax Code to \ncreate jobs now, right away, jobs that can never be outsourced. Both \nDemocrats and Republicans can get something they want, and the economy \ngets the shot in the arm it needs.\n  We have already cut the deficit in half over the last 3 years--that \nis the yearly deficit--and we have already saved $2.6 trillion from the \naccumulated debt. Democrats know there is more to be done. We certainly \ndo. But we will not agree to any plan that balances the budget by \nkilling jobs even more than already and whacking the middle class, and \nthat is while holding the richest individuals and corporations \nharmless.\n  Democrats believe we must offset the harsh spending cuts of the last \nfew years with job creation that puts the middle class back on track. \nTo get the economy back to full steam, we should be making targeted \ninvestments in areas such as infrastructure and education--things that \nhave always helped America grow and succeed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/31/senate-section/article/S6084-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, you know there is not much to say about \nthe President's speech yesterday other than that he actually retreated \nfrom previous commitments to a more bipartisan, revenue-neutral \ncorporate tax reform and then tried to sell that rejection of \nbipartisanship as some ``grand bargain''--I mean, only in Washington. \nBut let me say this: It really would be nice to see the President work \nwith Congress for a change to get some important work done for the \nAmerican people. Republicans have been eager to do this all along, but, \nreally, it is almost as if there is a ``Gone Campaignin' '' sign \noutside the Oval Office--a ``Gone Campaignin''' sign outside the Oval \nOffice. On the rarest of occasions when he does come to the Hill, as he \nwill today, you find out it is basically just for another internal \ncampaign rally with Democrats.\n  I hope he will finally get serious and make one of his famous \npivots--this time in a new direction toward effective policy and away \nfrom the never-ending political sideshow. But it is hard to see, \nespecially when you consider that the President's party is now \nattempting to blow up one of the most genuinely bipartisan \naccomplishments of the Obama era.\n  The Budget Control Act that was agreed upon two summers ago \nrepresented a commitment from Washington to America, a bipartisan \npromise to enact $2.1 trillion in spending control. Last year the \nslightest hint of fiddling with the spending caps led to a furious \nresponse from senior Washington Democrats. It even led to a veto threat \nfrom the White House. But now Washington Democrats are tired of \nbipartisanship. The commitments they made have become an inconvenience \nto their special interest agenda, so now they are threatening to shut \nthe government down if they are not allowed to break their word. That \nis what this appropriations debate we are having is all about. It is \nabout an attempt to blow up an important bipartisan achievement by \nbusting the spending caps to which both parties already agreed.\n  Republicans do not believe we should be breaking our commitments to \nthe American people, and breaking commitments in order to overspend, as \nDemocrats propose, seems like an even worse reason for them to shut \ndown the government. So I hope they will not. I hope they will think \nabout the ``third way'' offer we have made to them too--that we would \nhappily discuss exchanging some of the particular cuts they do not like \nfor government reforms, the kinds of innovative ideas that can get our \neconomy back on track and our government back in the black not just in \nthe immediate term but over the long haul. This policy discussion has \nnever been more relevant, especially when we look at what is happening \nin Detroit and what is happening in Europe, when we realize that the \nreal-world consequences of putting off reform are no longer just \nabstract or hypothetical, they are here, they are real, and they are \nnow.\n  The experts tell us that the United States is already on a completely \nunsustainable fiscal trajectory and that we need to make some big \nchanges today if we want to avoid a similar fate. They also tell us \nthat, unlike Detroit or Greece, America still has some time to chart \nits own future--but not long. That is why the choices we make today are \nso important. We can follow the Democratic path to austerity--the path \nof breaking spending caps wide open and borrowing more money we do not \nhave, of callously rejecting reform and blissfully denying the future. \nThat path inevitably leads to European-style austerity, to the \ndecimation of the middle class, to desperation for the least among \nus, or we can follow the Republican path to reform and growth, a path \nof smart choices, innovative reforms, and orienting our economy toward \nthe future. The Republican path not only prevents austerity tomorrow \nbut leads to more jobs and a better economy today. The Democratic path \nto austerity or a Republican path to reform and growth, these are the \nchoices.\n\n  Voting for appropriations legislation that blatantly violates budget \nreforms already agreed to by both parties moves our country in exactly \nthe wrong direction. It puts us on the Democratic path to austerity. \nThat is one of the many reasons I will be voting against this spending \nbill, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. It is time to get \nserious about the challenges we face. It is time to work together to \nreposition America for growth and prosperity and sustainability in the \n21st century.\n  If the President is willing to get off the campaign trail and show \nsome leadership with his party--convince them\n\n[[Page S6085]]\n\nof the positive reforms and the need to actually stick to them--I am \nconfident we can create a better economy today and leave a better \nfuture for our children tomorrow. But it is up to him, and his visit \ntoday offers a great chance to convey this message to his fellow \nDemocrats.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/31/senate-section/article/S6085-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6085]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO ROHIT KUMAR\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about \nmy departing deputy chief of staff Rohit Kumar, who announced a few \nweeks back he would be leaving the Senate at the end of this week.\n  Many of the Members of the Senate know Rohit pretty well. He has been \ntrolling the floor out here for a long time, telling us on the \nRepublican side what to do and how to do it. He has been a constant \npresence at my side at just about every legislative battle we have had \nhere in the Senate for the past 6\\1/2\\ years; actually, even before \nthat, when he was working for Leader Frist, and I was over in the \nwhip's office.\n  So many of us could recount Rohit's many talents, but as his boss it \nfalls on me to do it, and I am happy to do it because we have been \nthrough a lot. The first thing to say about Rohit is that his mind is \nlike a trap. He has the answer to literally every question the moment \nyou ask him, and he has usually thought through the politics of it too. \nThat might not sound terribly unusual, but I assure you it is rare in \nthis business to come across somebody who combines a brilliant mind for \npolicy and a brilliant mind for politics in one package, but that is \nRohit. He is remarkable that way. It is one of the reasons he has been \nindispensable to me, not only in the day-to-day stuff but especially on \nthe three major deals I helped broker with Vice President Biden, \nstarting with the 2-year extension of the Bush tax cuts in late 2010, \nthe debt limit deal we arrived at in the summer of 2011, and then, of \ncourse, the fiscal cliff agreement at the end of last year in which we \nlocked in the Bush tax rates permanently for 99 percent of Americans. \nThat is something we couldn't even do, by the way, when we had a \nRepublican House, a Republican Senate, and a Republican President.\n  Every one of those agreements involved a lot of work, a lot of nights \nand weekends, and tremendous focus. We couldn't have done any of them \nwithout Rohit. Anything that ever came up in those discussions, Rohit \ncan tell us the upsides and the downsides, where the other side was \nwilling to go and where they weren't. He knew where all the tripwires \nwere, and it is because of these same skills as well as his grasp of \nSenate rules and procedure that he has become sort of an informal \nadviser to the entire Republican conference over the years.\n  It is not at all unusual for me to walk back to Rohit's desk and see \nhim talking to another Senator in my office--either in person or on the \nphone. He knows how things work, and folks who are smart know they can \ncall him or swing by if they want to know what is going on or what is \npossible or what is not on absolutely anything. A lot of other Senators \nwill miss him every bit as much as I will.\n  Rohit says he was drawn to public service by the example of his \nparents, both of whom are doctors, and viewed their work as more of a \ncalling than a source of income. His dad is a widely respected and \nwell-known teacher at the university level, and his mom worked at a VA \nhospital.\n  Rohit wasn't drawn to medicine, but like his folks he wanted to make \na difference, and that is what drew him to politics. He got his start \nby answering phones for the mayor of Dallas, and then translated that \ninto an internship for Phil Gramm's State office after his sophomore \nyear at Duke. After graduating in just 3 years, he took a job in \nSenator Gramm's Washington office as an LA, and did that for a couple \nof years before heading off to law school.\n  The plan was to become a Federal prosecutor. So he moved down to \nCharlottesville, stayed there for a clerkship on the Fourth Circuit, \nand then saw his plan go up in smoke when he called Senator Gramm for \ncareer advice. Rohit told him what he was thinking, and Senator Gramm \nlistened. Senator Gramm then told him he thought it would be a much \nbetter idea if he came back to the Senate and worked for him instead. \nSenator Gramm can be pretty persuasive. Rohit agreed, and he has been \nhere ever since.\n  It wasn't a straight line. About a month after Rohit got here, Gramm \nannounced he wasn't running for reelection. Over the year that \nfollowed, Rohit impressed a lot of folks. It wasn't long before Senator \nLott picked up the phone and asked him if he would join him in the \nleader's office. Rohit accepted, and then spent pretty much his entire \ntime there figuring out how to get the Department of Homeland Security \nup and running in such a way that it wouldn't be hamstrung by union \nrules.\n  Over a holiday weekend in late 2002, he got a taste of things to \ncome. President Bush wanted DHS approved, so Rohit and a few other key \nstaffers had a holiday weekend to do it. They started writing the bill \non a Thursday night and wrapped it up by Tuesday morning.\n  Rohit stuck around during the Frist years, gaining even more \nexperience and impressing even more people--including me. When Leader \nFrist left at the end of 2006, I brought him onto my leadership team, \nand it has been one of the best hiring decisions I have ever made. As I \nsaid, he has been an extraordinary help to me and a great guy to have \naround. He is not only whip smart, but he has a fantastic sense of \nhumor and work ethic like I have never seen.\n  I thank Rohit for his dedication and service to me and to the Senate. \nSince this is the only opportunity I have ever had to do this, I want \nto thank Hilary for letting us have him for this long. I think she is \nhere today. I know how supportive she has been of Rohit staying here \nfor so long, and so I want to thank her for that and apologize for all \nthe canceled trips and lost weekends. I know it wasn't always easy to \nsee it in the moment, but he has made an enormous difference not just \nto me but our country.\n  I can't promise the transition will be easy. He might want to find a \ngood 10-step BlackBerry recovery program when we finally take it away \nfrom him, but I am sure he will figure it out.\n  With that, I wish Rohit all the best in the future. I know he has a \nbright one. I understand he will be unemployed after the weekend, but I \nexpect that won't last long.\n  Rohit, if you ever want to come back, we always have a place for you. \nThanks, buddy.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/31/senate-section/article/S6085-2", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6085]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To redirect certain foreign assistance to the Government of \n      Egypt as a result of the July 3, 2013, military coup d'etat)\n\n       At the end of title I, insert the following:\n       Sec. _____. (a) Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On June 30, 2012, Mohamed Morsi was elected President \n     of Egypt in elections that were certified as free and fair by \n     the Egyptian Presidential Election Commission and the United \n     Nations.\n       (2) On July 3, 2013, the military of Egypt removed the \n     democratically elected President of Egypt, arrested his \n     supporters, and suspended the Constitution of Egypt. These \n     actions fit the definition of a military coup d'etat.\n       (3) Pursuant to section 7008 of the Department of State, \n     Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Act, 2012 (division \n     I of Public Law 112-74; 125 Stat. 1195), the United States is \n     legally prohibited from providing foreign assistance to any \n     country whose duly elected head of government is deposed by a \n     military coup d'etat, or removed in such a way that the \n     military plays a decisive role.\n       (4) The United States has suspended aid to countries that \n     have undergone military coups d'etat in the past, including \n     the Ivory Coast, the Central African Republic, Thailand, \n     Mali, Fiji, and Honduras.\n       (b)(1) In accordance with section 7008 of the Department of \n     State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Act, 2012 \n     (division I of Public Law 112-74; 125 Stat. 1195), the United \n     States Government, including the Department of State, shall \n     refrain from providing to the Government of Egypt the \n     assistance restricted under such section.\n       (2) In addition to the restrictions referred to in \n     paragraph (1), the following restrictions shall be in effect \n     with respect to United States assistance to the Government of \n     Egypt:\n       (A) Deliveries of defense articles currently slated for \n     transfer to Egyptian Ministry of Defense (MOD) and Ministry \n     of Interior (MOI) shall be suspended until the President \n     certifies to Congress that democratic national elections have \n     taken place in Egypt followed by a peaceful transfer of \n     power.\n       (B) Provision of defense services to Egyptian MOD and MOI \n     shall be halted immediately until the President certifies to \n     Congress that democratic national elections have taken place \n     in Egypt followed by a peaceful transfer of power.\n       (C) Processing of draft Letters of Offer and Acceptance \n     (LOAs) for future arms sales to Egyptian MOD and MOI entities \n     shall be halted until the President certifies to Congress \n     that democratic national elections have taken place in Egypt \n     followed by a peaceful transfer of power.\n       (D) All costs associated with the delays in deliveries and \n     provision of services required under subparagraphs (A) \n     through (C) shall be borne by the Government of Egypt.\n       (c) Any amounts retained by the United States as a result \n     of implementing subsection (b) shall be made available to the \n     Secretary of Transportation to carry out activities under the \n     heading ``bridges in critical corridors''.\n\n  Mr. PAUL. A once great city, Detroit, lies in ruins with 50,000 feral \ndogs roaming the city, and abandoned houses litter the landscape. It is \na bleak and forlorn future that awaits Detroit. Creditors clamor for \nnearly $20 billion in debt. City employees wonder if they will be paid. \nThere is not enough money to even replace the street lights in Detroit. \nGod forbid that a major fire should break out.\n  At some level I think the President does care about Detroit, but \ntoday all I can see is the billions of dollars--the billions of \nAmerican tax dollars--that he chooses to send overseas. I see the shiny \nnew technology, America's best, going to arm people who are indifferent \nto us, and, at worst, hate us. The President sends billions of dollars \nto Egypt in the form of advanced fighter planes and tanks. Meanwhile, \nDetroit crumbles.\n  Chicago is a war zone. More people died in Chicago this year than in \nAfghanistan. Yet the President insists on building a $34 million fort \nin Afghanistan. Hillary Clinton insists on spending $80 million on a \nconsulate in Afghanistan that will never be used. As Detroit decays, \nChicago is a maelstrom of violence, yet no one questions sending \nbillions of the taxpayers' dollars to Egypt, to despots, to dictators \nin foreign countries.\n  Our Nation's bridges are crumbling and few politicians from either \nparty will question the billions of dollars that are being sent \noverseas while our Nation's infrastructure is crumbling. The law is \nvery clear. Everyone here in Congress can read. They recognize that the \nlaw says when there is a military coup, the aid must end.\n  Today we will vote on whether they will obey the law or whether they \nwill openly flout the law and disobey. When a military coup overturns a \ndemocratically elected government, all military aid must end; that is \nthe law. There is no Presidential waiver. The law states unequivocally \nthat the aid must end.\n  When the military coup occurred in Egypt, how did the President \nrespond? How did Congress respond? The President and his cohorts in \nCongress responded by shoveling good money after bad into the failed \nstate of Egypt. The President is intent on building nations abroad and \nnot taking care of our Nation here at home. I propose that we take the \nbillion dollars that is now being illegally given to Egypt and spend it \nat home.\n  We have bridges crumbling at home. Can't we fix some of our problems \nat home? We have had a bridge collapse this year in Washington State. \nWe had one collapse in Minnesota a few years ago. We have a bridge in \nnorthern Kentucky that is becoming increasingly unsafe. Yet there is \nnot enough money to repair our bridges because our politicians are \nsending the money overseas. It is unwise, and right now it is illegal.\n  Countries such as Egypt are getting billions of dollars in aid. \nMeanwhile, they recently let a mob advance and climb atop our Embassy \nand then burn our flag. I say not one penny more to these countries \nthat allow mobs to burn our flag.\n  In between cashing our checks, Egypt finds time to convict 16 \nAmericans on trumped-up political charges. Fortunately, the Americans \nwere able to escape. If they hadn't left the country, we would have 16 \nAmericans in prison in Egypt. Luckily these Americans were able to get \nout of the country.\n  How do these establishment politicians respond? How will the other \nside respond today when they get up and plead we should break the \nlaw? What will they say about Detroit? What will they say about \nChicago? What will they say about the bridges in northern Kentucky that \nwill not be built because we are sending the money to countries that \nare burning our flag?\n\n  I think it is unwise to send arms--particularly advanced arms--into \nthe chaos of Egypt. I fear one day someone may arise in Egypt who says: \nLet's attack Israel with these planes. Let's attack Israel with these \ntanks. I fear these weapons we are giving to Egypt may someday be used \nagainst America and our allies.\n  Even the Egyptians don't want our aid. There was a Gallup poll last \nyear which showed that 70 percent of Egyptians don't even want the \nmoney we are sending them. To understand why we have to understand that \nAmerican aid doesn't go to the Egyptian people; it goes to the despots \nand the dictators who run the place. We have to realize that when \nprotesters gather in Tahrir Square in Cairo by the hundreds of \nthousands--and even millions--why they are unhappy with America. They \nare unhappy with America because they are being sprayed with tear gas \nbought with American tax dollars, manufactured in Pennsylvania, and \ngiven to the Mubarak family or given to the military. Why are they \nunhappy? Foreign aid doesn't go to foreign people; it goes to foreign \ndespots and foreign dictators. Foreign aid is more likely to buy a \nlavish chateau in Paris than it is to buy bread in Egypt.\n  We send money to Egypt and it buys private jets for the Mubarak \nfamily to fly to Europe. The Mubarak family is said to have stolen \nbillions of dollars of American aid. Over the past 30 years, Americans \nhave been forced to finance the Mubarak family living large. So when we \nsee pictures of depression in Detroit, when we see abandoned housing in \nDetroit, when we see boarded up housing, when we see 50,000 feral dogs \nrunning through the streets of Detroit, when we see a once great \ncountry, a once great nation, a once great city lying in decay, we \nthink of our politicians who chose to send that money to Egypt and not \nkeep it here at home.\n  As the money is stolen and squandered around the world and as Detroit \ndecays, as Chicago is overrun with violence, as Americans struggle to \nput\n\n[[Page S6087]]\n\nfood on the table, Mubarak and his family dine on caviar and champagne. \nAs Mubarak flew to Europe for weekends on his jet and lived the life of \na king, his people rotted in jail indefinitely, without charge, without \ntrial. They have been living under martial law for 30 years. We wonder \nwhy they are unhappy with us. We have been financing the guy who has \nbeen giving them martial law and indefinite detention without trial for \n30 years. To add insult to injury, when they protest against their \ngovernment, they are doused with tear gas made in our country.\n  Foreign aid doesn't go to foreign people; it goes to foreign despots \nand dictators.\n  The President claims he feels our pain. The President says he can \nfeel the pain and he wants to help the middle class. But it seems as \nthough he wants and intends to help foreign people, foreign countries \nmore than he wants to help America. The President promised us hope and \nchange, but the more he claims that things change, I think the more \nthey stay the same.\n  I wanted to believe the President would be different. I wanted to \nbelieve he would bring change. I wanted to believe he would stand up to \nthe arms race, to the military industrial complex; that he would stop \nthe flow of arms to despots and dictators across the planet. But hope \nand change just turned out to be a slogan. In Detroit and in Chicago \nand in the once great cities of America, no change came. Hope and \nchange was just a slogan. The poverty, the murders, the abysmal \nschools, they continue.\n  Where are you, Mr. President? In our hour of need in our country, why \nare you sending our money to people who hate us? Why are you sending \narms to countries that don't like us or our allies? Why would we do \nthat?\n  The President maintains he will end the war in Afghanistan, and I \nsupport him. But he insists on fighting new wars, secretly, without \ncongressional approval, in Libya and Syria. While Detroit decays and \ndescends into bankruptcy, the President, as did so many Republicans \nbefore him, continues to send American tax dollars overseas to \ncountries that persecute and kill Christians. Hope and change--I guess \nit was just a slogan.\n  The law clearly states that when there is a military coup overturning \nelected government, the military aid must end. Even the President \ndoesn't dispute the law. He doesn't even dispute it is a coup. He just \nsays, I am not going to say it is not a coup or it is a coup; you can't \nmake me. It is ridiculous to any intelligent person or country--and I \nwonder if anyone on the other side will stand and say it is not a coup. \nHow do we say, when the military takes over a country and boots out a \ngovernment, that it is not a coup? Only a fool or a demagog would \nattempt to argue that the military junta in Egypt is not a coup; that \nthe military takeover that actually installed the lead general as \nDeputy Primary Minister is somehow not a coup.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mr. PAUL. Not yet.\n  In a remarkable bit of sophistry, the President admits the law does \nnot mandate an end to military aid when a coup takes place--he says it \ndoes, but he says it can't make him decide, so he is not going to \ndecide whether there was a coup. What it is, is brazen and open \nflouting of the law.\n  The President's argument reminds me of a third grader at recess. A \nthird grader says he will not call it a coup and you can't make him. \nThat is absurd. We passed a law. It is the law of the land. It says if \na coup happens, if the military takes over or participates in a \nsubstantial way in removing an elected government, the military aid \nends. We are either a nation of laws or we are not.\n  When the President refuses to acknowledge it is a coup or that it is \nnot yet an acknowledged coup, he says the aid is going on indefinitely \nand he will go on indefinitely flouting the law.\n  Americans should be outraged and insulted by such blatant shirking of \nthe law. Either we are a nation of laws or we are not. Will we obey the \nlaw?\n  We have the presumption to tell the world how to behave, to criticize \nEgypt for not obeying the rule of law--all legitimate concerns. Yet the \nPresident blithely ignores our own law. If we choose to ignore our own \nlaws, can we, with a straight face, preach to the rest of the world \nabout the rule of law? I think by openly flouting our own laws we take \naway from our ability to lead the world, we take away from our moral \nauthority to show the right way. America has always been the leader by \nexample. But how do we lead by example when we are not willing to obey \nour own laws?\n  There is a question: Are we a monarchy or a republic? Are we to be \nruled by caprice? If we pick and choose which laws to obey, what \nmessage does that send?\n  I say to all Americans--Democrats, Independents, and Republicans--\nenough is enough. We aren't going to take it anymore. We should call \nour representatives and tell them enough already. Tell them to take \ncare of our country. Tell them not one penny more to countries that are \nburning our flag.\n  I suggest today we do something historic and listen to the American \npeople. The American people don't want good money after bad shoveled \nand sent overseas; they want to fix some of the problems we have at \nhome. They want to do some Nation building here at home.\n  My amendment will give our representatives a chance to vote. We are \ngoing to say: Yes, we will obey the law. We are not sending any more \nweapons to Egypt and we are going to take the money and we are going to \nbuild some bridges in our country. We are going to repair some roads. \nWe are going to work on some infrastructure here at home.\n  Everybody seems to say they are for it. In fact, the President has \nnow come out and said he wants some grand bargain to take some new \nmoney and actually work on infrastructure. Mr. President, it is right \nhere. I am offering it today.\n  I have another amendment that would say all foreign profit can come \nhome at 5 percent. We can take that revenue and build new bridges. They \nwill not even let me vote on that one. So the President's grand bargain \nto increase infrastructure spending--I have it. It is on the floor.\n  Mr. President, call the leadership of the Senate. Tell them it is on \nthe floor and you support this; that you want infrastructure spending. \nI have a bill that would do precisely that. This amendment will do a \nlittle bit in that direction. Take the $1 billion we spend in Egypt and \nspend it in America.\n  When we see the pictures on the news of what is going on in Detroit--\nif you live in Detroit and you are suffering through the bankruptcy of \nyour city; if you see around you the chaos and poverty of Detroit, you \ncall the President and say: Mr. President, why are you sending that \nmoney to Egypt? Why are you sending money overseas when our Nation is \ncrumbling, our cities are crumbling, our infrastructure is crumbling, \nour bridges are crumbling? The President says: I am going to send that \nto Egypt. I am going to send that overseas.\n  This amendment will give everyone a chance to put their money where \ntheir mouth is, to say: Do you care about America? Do you care about \nrepairing American infrastructure or do you care more about sending \nmoney to a dictatorship in Egypt? I think the choice is clear. I think, \nif we ask the American people, three-fourths or more of them--I think \nmaybe nearly 100 percent of the American people--are with me. Let's \nspend that money at home. Let's not send that money overseas to people \nwho hate us, to people who burn our flag. Keep it at home.\n  There is a finite amount of money. We can't do everything. We can't \nfix everything if we have to fix everybody else's problems first. Let's \naddress some of the needs we have at home.\n  I encourage a ``yes'' vote, to vote to keep the money at home and not \nto send it overseas.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, regretfully, I am going to oppose this \namendment. I am going to have to cover some points which my good friend \nfrom Kentucky made that I think are totally wrong.\n  First of all, I don't agree we need to be going up there with Federal \ndollars bailing out cities that are having problems. Of course, that is \na decision that\n\n[[Page S6088]]\n\nis going to be made, I suppose, by a lot of people.\n  Also, the Senator from Kentucky talks about sending billions of \ndollars overseas. I agree with my colleague from Kentucky about some of \nthe foreign aid and I would join with him but certainly not in this \ncase. Before I tell my colleagues why, let me clarify something. There \nare Members of this body and people outside this body who are \nconservatives believing this is some kind of a conservative program to \ndefund the military in Egypt. Let me assure my colleagues it is not. \nThis is coming from a person who is probably--in fact, I am certain of \nit. I have been ranked as the most conservative Member of this body \nmore than any other single person. So this is coming from a \nconservative, not from a liberal and not from a Democrat.\n  We have a unique situation. I wish to respond to a couple of things \nmy friend from Kentucky said. First of all, yes, it probably fits the \ndescription of a coup. I know what the law is. The law says we can't \nsend foreign aid after a coup. I have a bill drawn up right now that if \nthis is determined to be a coup, it could pass the House and the Senate \nand be signed by the President in 1 day. So that is something that can \nbe done. I have the best of intentions of obeying the law to the \nletter.\n  As far as the situation in Egypt, Morsi is gone. Let's face that \nreality. There are a lot of things we don't like about this. But I will \nsay this: If you have any feelings at all toward our good friends, our \nbest friends in the Middle East--that is Israel--then you cannot \nconsider this amendment. Israel has all of the interests at stake.\n\n  It goes back to 1979, the Camp David accords. I remember that very \nwell. The Camp David accords put together something between Israel and \nEgypt. But keep in mind, it is not Egypt. It is the military, the \nEgyptian military. They have been our friends. They have been Israel's \nfriends for years and years and years--since 1979. If we turn our backs \non the military now, there are others who would love to fill that \nvacuum.\n  Should they have F-16s? I am glad they have F-16s. They ought to have \nmore F-16s. Some have been purchased and not delivered yet. They should \nbe delivered. But if it is not going to be F-16s, if we should pass an \namendment like this, you are going to find yourself with a bunch of \nMiG-29s coming over from Russia instead of our F-16s.\n  If this were 10 years ago, if this were 15 years ago, I might agree \nwith my friend from Kentucky. But that was before we realized the \nthreats we have in the Middle East. We have some friends in the Middle \nEast. We have Israel. We have Jordan. We have Kuwait, U.A.E., Qatar, \nSaudi Arabia. If that coalition of friends in the Middle East breaks \nup, what can happen to us here in America? Our intelligence has said--\nand it is unclassified since 2007--that Iran will have the capability \nof a weapon and a delivery system by 2015. If we do not have our \nfriends in the Middle East to keep that from happening, we could pass \nan amendment like this, turn our backs on Israel, and that is exactly \nthe thing that could happen.\n  I know a lot of people want to talk on this who are a lot more \narticulate than I am. But I can say from a conservative--from this \nconservative--we cannot do this to our friends in Israel and our other \nallies in the Middle East.\n  Mr. CORKER addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee is----\n  Mr. CORKER. I want to go in the appropriate order. I see the chairman \nof the committee. I would like 5 minutes at some point. But does the \nSenator want to go ahead?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation? I \nunderstand the opponents of this amendment have 30 minutes; is that \ncorrect?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct. The Senator \nfrom Oklahoma has used 5 minutes of the time in opposition.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Then I ask unanimous consent that as the chair of the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee I control the remainder of the time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I----\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, will the Senator respond to a question? \nHow is the time going to be allocated?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Yes. It is my intention to consume about 8 minutes \napproximately, to yield Senator McCain 6 minutes, Senator Graham 6 \nminutes, and Senator Corker 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CORKER. Perfect.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. That should take the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. President, this amendment may be good politics but it is bad \npolicy. I appreciate the concern of the Senator from Kentucky for \nDetroit. He and others in this Chamber have had plenty of times to vote \nfor America's cities, but I have not seen those votes be there.\n  Nothing in this amendment, notwithstanding what we heard, suggests \nthat cutting all aid to Egypt ultimately means putting that money into \nthe cities of America, such as Detroit. So let's not be mistaken about \nthat.\n  I share many of the concerns that have been raised by my colleague \ntoday about the situation in Egypt. I believe, however, halting all \nmilitary assistance to Egypt at this time is misguided and it is \nshortsighted. It would drastically reduce U.S. influence with both the \ninterim government of Egypt and the military at an incredibly delicate \ntime for Egypt and its people. And in so doing, it may in fact \nundermine our shared goals and desire to see elections and a \ndemocratically elected government reestablished in Egypt as quickly as \npossible.\n  It has been just a little more than 2 years since the onset of the \nArab spring and a revolution in Egypt that unseated Hosni Mubarak after \ntwo decades in power. During these tumultuous 2 years, Egypt has \nstruggled as a society with the transition to democracy that its people \nclearly want, and with efforts to create the economic opportunities \nthat its people clearly need. That struggle is real and ongoing.\n  The demonstrations that ousted Mubarak in a clear military coup were \nunprecedented--until they were eclipsed by demonstrations this summer \nwhich drew as much as a third of Egypt's population of 83 million \npeople onto its streets. That is more than 30 million people who have \nbeen emboldened by the revolution, who are united in their call for \nreform and democracy, and who have embraced their ability and right to \npeaceful protests and to demand change.\n  If you think about it, a comparable protest in the United States \ninvolving a third of our Nation would mean that 100 million Americans \nwould be on the streets of the cities of America. That is the \nequivalent of what has been happening in Egypt.\n  So my point is that Egypt is changing but perhaps not as quickly as \nwe would like and with a process that has been, not surprisingly, \npretty chaotic.\n  Abandoning our diplomacy and engagement with Egypt--a country that \nsits at the heart of the Middle East--because the road that leads to \nchange is not straight or certain would be naive. It might make us feel \ngood, at least for a moment, but in the long run it would threaten to \nundermine vital national security interests and set back our values.\n  Making such a significant change to U.S. foreign policy--with all the \npotential implications for U.S. national security and for our ally \nIsrael--should not be done in haste. It should not be done carelessly \nor thoughtlessly. It should not be done without a full understanding of \nall of the ramifications of such a change. And it certainly should not \nbe tacked onto the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development \nappropriations bill. It is far too important a decision to be an \nafterthought to an appropriations bill. In my view, it is ill-advised \nto make foreign policy on the fly without due consideration of all of \nthe consequences.\n  I would point out that my friend from Kentucky has introduced an \nidentical bill that has been referred to the Foreign Relations \nCommittee. Last Thursday the committee held its first extensive hearing \non the crisis in Egypt. I can assure my friend from Kentucky that the \ncommittee will continue to work on this issue and to look at \nappropriate policy options through a deliberative process.\n  We need time to determine whether the process underway in Egypt will \nmeet the demands of the Egyptian people and lead back to democracy or \nif\n\n[[Page S6089]]\n\nthe military leadership will dig in further and thereby invoke \nrestrictions in U.S. law with respect to assistance. Our patience is \nnot unlimited and our assistance is not without limitations. The \nadministration is already actively reviewing U.S. assistance.\n\n  The delivery of four new F-16 aircraft that was to occur last week \nwas halted by the administration, clearly sensitive to the situation. \nAt the end of the day we should allow for flexibility to deal with this \ndelicate situation as events dictate, not precipitate an unwanted \nresponse with a knee-jerk reaction rather than deliberative reflection. \nThe administration has a process to make its decisions.\n  I would say this is about--as I listen to the Senator from Kentucky--\nfar more than Egypt. He basically opposes all foreign assistance \nabroad. The reality is that foreign assistance abroad has worked for \nthe national interests and security of the United States. It has saved \nmillions of lives through PEPFAR against AIDS and HIV. It has helped \nstrengthen democracies. It has helped create democracies. It has helped \ncreate open markets for American products and services. As a matter of \nfact, these sales to Egypt--about $1.2 billion--are largely from the \nmanufacture of equipment here in the United States that creates jobs \nhere at home and then ultimately gets used in Egypt.\n  We need a more nuanced approach, one that speaks to both our values \nand our interests, and one which provides the President with the \nflexibility needed to conduct delicate and discriminating policy in a \nchallenging and chaotic environment.\n  A quick end to aid at this time--meat-clever approach, when a scalpel \nis needed--is simply ill-advised.\n  Last week Ambassador Dennis Ross, whose reputation and experience as \na diplomat, Presidential adviser on the Middle East, and author, has \nmade him one of the Nation's most respected foreign policy minds on \nboth sides of the aisle, told the Foreign Relations Committee it is \nimperative that America ``stay in the game.'' We cannot and should not \npull out now. Ending aid to Egypt would only cause Egyptians to shut \nthe United States out of discussions and disregard our advice. \nAmbassador Ross also said that such an action could be the only thing \nto unite all Egyptians across the entire political spectrum against the \nUnited States--against the United States. In fact, that opinion was \nshared by the majority panelists who feared our inability to influence \nevents in Egypt if we were to step out of the game.\n  In the interim, as we further assess the situation, our response and \nour policy must be carefully calibrated to press for the democratic \nreforms that the Egyptian people have demanded and--simultaneously--\nsupport U.S. national security interests in the region.\n  U.S. assistance to Egypt has, for decades, helped support the Camp \nDavid Accords. It also supports our security interests in countering \ntrafficking of weapons and people into the Sinai, and in antiterrorism \ncooperation with the United States.\n  In recent weeks, Egypt's military has launched a major crackdown on \nterrorist activity and extremists in the Sinai Peninsula, carrying out \narrests and attempting to seal smuggling tunnels connecting the Sinai \nto Gaza. U.S. cooperation is essential to the continuation of these \nactivities.\n  Let me conclude by saying, at the end of the day, Egyptian leaders \nand the Egyptian military must show that they are committed to an \ninclusive political process, credible democratic elections, and \ndemocratic governance that protects the rights of religious minorities, \nwomen, civil society leaders, and a diversity of political parties.\n  That includes, from my perspective, vacating the June 4 verdicts for \nthe 43 individuals convicted in the politically motivated trial of \nnongovernmental organization workers, including 16 Americans, and \npermitting civil society organizations to reopen their offices and \noperate freely. It also clearly means an immediate cessation of arrests \nand use of force against peaceful protestors.\n  Steps that exacerbate the divide in Egyptian society, including the \nuse of force against protestors and arrests and harassment of pro-Morsi \nand Muslim Brotherhood leaders, serve only to deepen the chasm and \nforestall reconciliation.\n  The only way forward to a pluralistic, vibrant, and stable democracy \nlies in the inclusion of all political parties and groups, as long as \nthey are committed to a democratic process and to peaceful change.\n  The United States has to move cautiously, not precipitously, in this \ndelicate situation. The Paul amendment is not the answer when it comes \nto our future relationship with Egypt. The future of that relationship \nwill be determined by our actions in the coming weeks.\n  Whether we will have a stable and willing partner on crucial matters \nof security, combating terrorism, trafficking of weapons and persons \ninto the Sinai, and support for peace in the Middle East is up to us or \nwe can stand aside and hope for the best. I think abandoning Egypt is a \nparticularly poor choice. That is why I oppose the amendment and urge \nmy colleagues to do the same.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have a couple unanimous consent requests. \nI would also say this: This is an important debate, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that--on the floor now we have Corker, we have McCain and \nGraham--I ask unanimous consent that if they use more than the allotted \ntime here they be allowed to use that, and whatever time goes over that \nallotted time we have in the existing order would also be given to \nSenator Paul.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n            Unanimous Consent Agreement--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 1 p.m. \ntoday, the Senate proceed to executive session to consider Calendar No. \n201, Todd Jones, to be Director of ATF; that there be 1 hour for debate \nequally divided in the usual form prior to a vote on cloture on the \nnomination; that if cloture is invoked, all postcloture time be deemed \nexpired and the Senate proceed to vote on the confirmation, with no \nintervening action or debate, the motions to reconsider be considered \nmade and laid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate; \nthat no further motions be in order to the nomination; that any related \nstatements be printed in the Record; that the President be immediately \nnotified of the Senate's action and the Senate then resume legislative \nsession\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that upon \ndisposition of the Paul amendment, the Senate recess until 1 p.m. \ntoday; further, that the filing deadline for first-degree amendments to \nS. 1243, the transportation bill, be 1:30 p.m. today; finally, that \nwhen the Senate resumes legislative session following consideration of \nthe Jones nomination, the Senate proceed to a period of morning \nbusiness for 1 hour equally divided between the two leaders or their \ndesignees, with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each, \nwith the exception of Senator Inhofe, who is to be recognized for up to \n30 minutes; that following the period of morning business, the Senate \nproceed to executive session to consider the Power nomination under the \nprevious order.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, what this means is we will vote on the Paul \namendment, give or take, in a half-hour, at around 11 o'clock, or \nshortly thereafter, whatever time the order allows, and we will then \nrecess until 1 p.m. Then we will have the debate on the Jones \nnomination from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m., then the cloture vote at 2 p.m. If \ncloture is invoked, we will immediately vote on confirmation. We could \nhave two votes at 2 p.m. We will have morning business from around 2:45 \np.m. to 3:45 p.m., and then the Power nomination--to be U.N. \nAmbassador--debate from about 3:45 p.m. to 5:45 p.m., and then the vote \non confirmation at around 5:45 p.m.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I yield to the distinguished ranking member of the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Corker.\n  Mr. CORKER. I will be brief. I know that time may be extended. But \nlet me\n\n[[Page S6090]]\n\nstart by saying I understand how citizens across our country are \nfrustrated. Our country has gone through financial distress. We have \neconomic issues that are impacting people of all walks of life. I know \nas they look at what is happening around the world, there is \nfrustration, generally speaking, with issues relative to foreign aid. I \nunderstand that.\n  I also understand we are a nation of laws. We have had an event in \nEgypt which is going to cause us to have to deal with that. I think we \ncan deal with that in due time and live up to the laws of this Nation. \nI also understand, though, that we are the greatest Nation on the face \nof the Earth. One of the reasons we are the greatest Nation is because \nof the values we extend around the world and the fact that we have been \na voice of calm.\n  We have been a country that has tried to continue to engender peace. \nI know the Senator from Kentucky and I share Fort Campbell, a place \nwhere some of our most outstanding fighting men and women are based. I \nknow the Senator understands that much of what we do with foreign aid \nis to try to keep those men and women off the battlefield and in \ntraining. We do that to try to keep peace and to keep those men and \nwomen who protect our country from having to go to war.\n  The distinguished Senator from New Jersey just talked about the \nimportance of Egypt. From the very beginning, when this all began just \nwithin the last month or 6 weeks, I have believed that the \nadministration, candidly, has handled this well; that our Nation should \nbe the voice of calmness. We should try to be the steady hand that \nallows this transition to occur in the right way.\n  At the same time, we should push them toward democracy. I think that \nis exactly what we are doing. We have had a debate throughout this week \nin our lunch sessions among Republicans. I know the Senator from \nKentucky has made it clear that the poll numbers indicate we should cut \noff foreign aid. I want to say that we have tremendous responsibilities \nas Senators. One of the responsibilities we have, no doubt, is to \nrepresent our citizens.\n  On the other hand, we know that sometimes we understand that we \nshould sell to the citizens the reasons that we do the things we do on \nthis floor. I think most people in this body understand that just on a \nTHUD bill, having an amendment that cuts off aid to Egypt is not a \nthoughtful process as it relates to foreign aid.\n  My appeal today is really not to my friends on the other side of the \naisle, although I am sure some of them are contemplating what to do. \nBut my appeal is to my friends on this side of the aisle. I have talked \nto many of them in private. I think many of them know this is terrible \npublic policy.\n  No doubt, without us explaining to the American people why we should \nnot jerk the rug out from under Egypt as they go through this \ntransition; no doubt, without us sharing the importance of that, the \nAmerican people are going to look at aid to Egypt and see what is \nhappening there and say: No, let's take that money and let's do \nsomething else. I think most people on this side of the aisle \nunderstand that is terrible public policy. I think most people on this \nside of the aisle want to stand and to be thoughtful Senators and do \nnot want to have a poll-tested foreign policy.\n  We are going to have plenty of time to debate this issue in \nSeptember. I think all of us know a lot is going to be happening during \nthe recess. We have two Senators who are traveling to Egypt over the \nweekend to look at what is occurring there. I am going to be in the \narea in a few weeks.\n  It seems to me, as the greatest Nation on the face of the Earth, \ninstead of having some poll-tested amendment that may play well in the \nshort term, what we should do as Senators is be thoughtful, understand \nthe greatness of this Nation, understand the millions of lives and \nlivelihoods that are at stake in us being a calm hand in Egypt, \nunderstanding the impact that this is going to have on people all \naround the world and certainly our standing in the world, but our \ncontinued ability to help promote human rights, promote democracy, \npromote peace, promote calm.\n  So I would just urge the Senators on our side of the aisle, we have \nthese things that come up, and we certainly have groups who come forth. \nI think all of us understand that is a big vote. This is a vote that \nsays a lot about who we are as Senators. This is a vote that gives us \nan opportunity to step away from those short-term, hot, poll-tested \namendments that have nothing to do with furthering the greatness of \nthis Nation.\n  I would urge everybody in this body to stand, to be Senators, and to \ndo what we know is the right thing to do; that is, to be calm, to \naddress this issue as we should in the right way this September when \nall of us have more information to deal with this issue.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for the opportunity to speak. I hope \nthis body will rise and conduct themselves as the Senate should on \nissues of this importance. I thank the chairman for the time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hirono). The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, let me just say briefly that I have \ngotten a lot of calls about Egypt as well. Look, I understand it. We \nlook at what is happening over there, we look at some of the wild \nthings that are happening in the streets, certainly tragedies as well. \nWe see the oppression of religious minorities, and we wonder: Why do we \ncontinue to give aid to a country that does that? I think that is a \nvery important question.\n  I think the problem we face is we in this place are sometimes put \ninto a position between two absolutes, when there are other options \navailable to us. The choice before us is not to cut off aid to Egypt or \nto continue aid to Egypt. I think the opportunity we have now is to \nrestructure aid to Egypt in a way that furthers our national interest.\n  What is our national interest in Egypt? Our national interest is to \nhave a secular, stable, democratic government that provides security so \ntheir economy can grow, a government that lives up to the Camp David \nAccords, that cooperates in counterterrorism, that prevents \ndiscrimination to religious minorities. Our foreign aid should be \nrestructured--not simply canceled but restructured--so that it fits and \nfills that aim that we have for that country and for our national \nsecurity interests in that country. That means we should restructure \nour foreign aid, not simply eliminate it but go back to the Egyptians \nand say: If you want to continue to get foreign aid from the United \nStates, you are going to have to show measurable improvement on these \nfour things: You are going to show us how you are protecting religious \nminorities; you are going to have to show us how you are advancing \ntoward democracy and stability. You are going to have to show how you \nare doing these things. That needs to be measured. If they stop doing \nit, the aid stops coming.\n  I would also say regarding restructuring the aid that the aid should \nbe geared toward what they need. They probably do not need that many \nfor more F-16s. What they need is more capacity building for internal \nsecurity. What they need is more capacity building to live up to the \nCamp David Accords. That is what they need. Our aid should be aimed \ntoward that.\n  I also think it is a mistake to just say we are eliminating aid \ncompletely because if we eliminate aid completely, we lose leverage. \nThey are still going to buy weapons. They will just not get them from \nus and our influence will be diminished.\n  So I think there is a third way. I think what has happened in Egypt \nis a unique opportunity to restructure--not to cancel but to \nrestructure--and reframe our relationship with Egypt. If they do \ncertain things, they will continue to get aid. If they move toward \ncertain goals that are in our national interest, they will continue to \nget aid. They will continue to get aid that helps them meet these \ngoals, not simply anything they ask for.\n  This is the opportunity we have now. This should be done in a \nthoughtful and careful way. I hope that is the direction the body will \nmove. I think to simply cancel aid without putting these other \nconditions in place is a missed opportunity from which we should not \nwalk away.\n  So I would say to our colleagues, let's not simply cut off aid. Let's \ntake\n\n[[Page S6091]]\n\nthe time to work so that we can restructure aid with Egypt in a way \nthat furthers our national security interests: a secular, democratic \ngovernment that lives up to the Camp David Accords, that cooperates in \ncounterterrorism, that respects religious minorities, and that provides \nthe internal security they need to create the economic growth they need \nso that they can be stable now and in the future and be a partner of \nours.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the period \nfor morning business following the consideration of the Jones \nnomination be extended by 40 minutes, with the additional time being \nequally divided between the two leaders or their designees, with \nSenators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each, with the \nexception of Senator Inhofe for 30 minutes and Senator McCain for 20 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I yield to the Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. \nFirst, I would like to associate myself with the remarks of the Senator \nfrom Florida. Now is the time to be creative with our assistance to \nEgypt to try to change things while there is still hope of things \nchanging in a positive direction.\n  I certainly understand. Why should we be selling F-16s to people who \nbehave this way? The administration has put on hold the four F-16s that \nwere due to be delivered to Egypt, trying to find out what is going to \nhappen next. That makes sense to me. But why are we selling weapons to \nEgypt? It is because if we do not, someone else will. I want them to \nhave F-16s and come to our pilot training bases. I want Egyptian \nofficers to come to our military training academies. I want a \nrelationship with the Egyptian military that can be beneficial to our \nnational security interests. I want the people who build F-16s in \nAmerica to get the business from Egypt to get some of our money back.\n  If they buy MIGs or Mirages we lose that. It is not a question of if \nthey are going to buy fighter planes; it is a question of who they are \ngoing to buy them from. We have every right to withhold sales. We have \nevery right to put them on hold temporarily. But to just sever this \nrelationship now would be a huge mistake.\n  In fairness to Senator Paul, he says we would resume aid once they \nget their act together and move back toward democracy. I think that is \nsomething worth noting. That is an understanding on his part that he is \nlooking for an outcome that we can be more supportive of. The \ndifference I have is that if we cut off aid now, then I cannot tell you \nthe consequences of what that would mean in terms of moving in the \ndirection we would all like.\n  Unintended consequences to the decision jump out pretty clearly in my \nmind, and most of them are bad. Is it a coup? It certainly looks like \none. It certainly sounds like one. But at the end of the day, if we are \nmoving toward democracy and the military steps back and democratically \nelected leaders take over, I think that is the goal for all of us.\n  I wish we did not live in a world like we do. I wish things were \neasier. I wish the Arab Spring had been more successful. But the one \nthing I can say is that what happens in Egypt really does matter to us. \nIf the largest country in the Arab world, the heart of the Arab world, \nEgypt, becomes a failed state, I promise you it will affect our \nnational security interests for decades to come. It would be a \nnightmare for Israel, and it would take the whole region down a path \nthat would be at best chaotic.\n  Can we prevent a failed state in Egypt? I think we can. I don't know \nfor sure what is going to happen, but I do know this: If America does \nnot try, if we do not stay engaged and shape history rather than \nobserve it, we will pay a heavy price as a nation. So part of this \namendment takes money that would be going to the Egyptian military and \nputs it on projects in the United States. I think one is a bridge in \nKentucky. I have no doubt that there is a need for bridges in Kentucky \nand South Carolina. I would love to get my port deepened.\n  But to the people of Kentucky and to the people of South Carolina, if \nwe stop the 1 percent of our budget--it is $50 billion. That is no \nsmall sum. But if we cancelled it all out and just left $3 billion for \nIsrael--it seems everybody likes that idea. If we had $3 billion to \nspend on affecting the world, is that smart?\n  How much of the debt would be retired if we canceled all foreign aid \nand brought it back into the United States? Not a whole lot. But here \nis what I believe would happen. If America withdrew our foreign \nassistance, a lot of bad things would happen to us. Having a say, \nhaving influence in a world that is increasingly dangerous seems to me \nto be a good idea. I am tired of having to resort to the military as \nthe only solution to affect things.\n  The people in Egypt, the government particularly, wants a \nrelationship with us. They have to earn it, as Senator Rubio said. But \nto cut off our relationship with Egypt at this critical time, I think, \nwould be extremely ill-advised, and the consequences to the people of \nKentucky and South Carolina and every other State in the Union would be \nsignificant.\n  To my colleagues, when you cast your vote today about pausing, not \nterminating aid, but trying to reconstruct aid, I don't know how that \nfits in a 30-second sound bite. It is probably easier to explain the \n``no'' vote than it is a ``yes'' vote. But I do know this: Your country \nwould be well served if you decide today to pause and wait to find out \nthe right answer in Egypt.\n  I do know this: If Egypt goes, the entire region blows up. The \nbiggest fear I have is radical Islamists are closer to getting nuclear \nweapons and chemical weapons than any time in my lifetime. If Egypt \nbecomes a failed state, that is one more problem for us to have to deal \nwith, rather than focusing on the Iranian efforts to march toward a \nnuclear weapon.\n  Radical Islam has not forgotten about us. The question for us is have \nwe forgotten about radical Islam. If we wish to stop this march in the \nMiddle East of radical Islam getting stronger and stronger and \nstronger, let's try to hang on to our relationship with Egypt. If it \nbecomes a failed state, and the Sinai becomes one of the great safe \nhavens for terrorist groups--and the Egyptian Army, to their credit, is \nnow involved with the Sinai--the cataclysmic effect of a failed state \nin Egypt would be the biggest boost to radical Islam I could think of. \nIt would do a lot of damage to our national security and our best \nfriend in the region, Israel.\n  I have a letter from our APAC. I asked them to comment on this. They \nstate:\n\n       Dear Senators Menendez and Corker:\n       We are writing to express our concerns over the Paul \n     amendment to the Transportation/HUD Appropriations bill that \n     would eliminate military assistance and sales to Egypt. We do \n     not support cutting off all assistance to Egypt at this time, \n     as we believe it could increase the instability in Egypt and \n     undermine important U.S. interests and negatively impact our \n     Israeli ally.\n       As you know, Egypt is the largest Arab state in the Middle \n     East and has played a vital role in advancing key U.S. \n     interests in that region. Citing just two examples, the \n     government of Egypt has maintained the peace with Israel and \n     is taking important steps to address the instability in the \n     Sinai. Events in Egypt are rapidly evolving, and we believe \n     that for now the United States should avoid taking any \n     precipitous actions against Egypt such as cutting off all \n     assistance. We look forward to continuing to work with you on \n     these critical issues.\n\n  One final thought: Maybe one day I will agree with Senator Paul in \nsaying we have to sever our ties with the Egyptian military and the \nEgyptian people. Maybe one day I will come and cosponsor the Senator's \namendment or maybe come up with one of my own.\n  I can tell you if that day ever comes, it will be one of the saddest \ndays of my life because that would mean Egypt is gone. If Egypt is \ngone, all hell is going to break loose.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I yield to the distinguished Senator from Arizona, a \nmember of the committee, Mr. McCain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. May I ask the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nArizona has unlimited time.\n\n[[Page S6092]]\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Does the Senator from Kentucky wish to respond?\n  Mr. PAUL. Go ahead.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I think it is important in the context \nof this amendment on the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development \nbill that we put into focus what this amendment is really affecting. It \nis affecting the most important nation in the Arab world, the heart and \nsoul of the Arab world, Egypt. All countries in the Middle East are \nimportant, but Egypt is the most important.\n  In Egypt today there are demonstrations, there are scores of people \nbeing killed, hundreds being wounded. This Friday, only 2 days from \nnow, after prayers, there are predictions that there could be even more \ncarnage that will take place as a result of the pro-Morsi people taking \nto the streets of Cairo and other cities throughout Egypt.\n  I think we ought to consider this amendment in the context of what is \nhappening in arguably the most important nation in the Arab world. \nShould we ask ourselves that at this point without adequate hearings, \nwithout adequate discussion, without input from the administration, as \nwell as the oversight responsibilities by the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, the Appropriations Committee, the Armed Services Committee, \nall of whom, chairmen and ranking members, are opposed to this \namendment?\n  First, I caution against a rush to judgment on this issue. It \nrequires, frankly, more than 1 hour equally divided of debate on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  I would also like to point out this amendment is part of a larger \ndebate that has been going on in the Republican Party for well over a \ncentury. Prior to World War I, there was the isolationist wing of our \nparty. After World War I in the 1930s, there were the America Firsters. \nAfter World War II, there was the Eisenhower wing of our party and the \nTaft wing. The debate has gone on for the heart and soul of the \nRepublican Party.\n  This debate and this amendment that is posed by my friend from \nKentucky is part of that overall debate as to what the role of the \nUnited States should be in the world. Should we take our money from \nEgypt and give it to build a bridge in Kentucky? Should we take our \nforeign aid and cut it to the point to where we no longer have \ninfluence in these countries throughout the world and spend it on much \nneeded projects that are the result of a very ailing and still serious \nrecession in which we still remain?\n  I think the vote on this amendment has even larger implications than \nthat of whether we should cut off all assistance to Egypt. By the way, \nmy friends, I don't think it is an accident that APAC, our friends \nthere who represent the interests of the State of Israel, have opposed \nthis amendment. If there is further upheaval in the Sinai, and if there \nis a collapse of the rule of law in Egypt, I don't think there is any \ndoubt that the threat to Israel is dramatically increased.\n  I made it clear, and so has my friend from South Carolina, that it \nwas a coup. It was a coup and our law calls for that. But that is an \nimplementation of a law that needs to be done in a way that is in \nconsultation with the Foreign Relations Committee, the Appropriations \nCommittee, and, in fact, all Members of the Senate.\n  I think it is important for us to send a message to Egypt that we are \nnot abandoning them, but what we are doing is trying to caution them to \ntry to modify their behavior, to tell General Aziz that he has to have \nan inclusive government, he has to allow the Muslim Brotherhood to \npartake in the upcoming elections, and the Muslim Brotherhood has to be \ntold that they have to renounce violence.\n  Right now Egypt is spiraling down into a situation of chaos, which I \ncan promise my colleagues will sooner or later pose a threat to our \nvital national security interests. The most important nation in the \nArab world descending into chaos is going to be a threat to the United \nStates of America.\n  I urge my colleagues--and I urge my friend from Kentucky, with \nrespect--to realize this amendment would send the wrong message at the \nwrong time. It may be coincidental, but this Friday is going to be an \nimportant day in Egypt. Should we be sending the message to the \nEgyptians: OK, you are on your own?\n  Yes, other countries in the region are contributing enormously to the \nEgyptians without conditions. But the support or condemnation of the \nUnited States of America, the best, most free, and still most \ninfluential Nation in the world, is of vital importance. At this time, \nI think it would be a terrific mistake for the United States to send \nthe message to Egypt: You are on your own.\n  I hope we understand that it is not about U.S. foreign assistance; it \nis about what serves our interests and our values. This, my friends, is \na debate that we need to have over the weeks, months, and years ahead \nin, probably, one of the best places to have that debate.\n  I urge my colleagues, no matter how they feel about assistance to \nEgypt, that we are committed. I urge them to appreciate that we are \ncommitted to a long debate about this issue.\n  I have confidence in the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee \nthat we will be addressing this issue seriously. The Senator from \nKentucky is a member and would certainly take part.\n  I urge my colleagues to understand that an amendment on the \nTransportation, Housing and Urban Development-led appropriations bill \nis not the venue. We need to have this debate not only about Egypt but \nAmerica's role in the world. I look forward to joining him, but today \nis not the day to take a step that could have repercussions over time \nthat will damage the vital national security interests of the United \nStates.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote to table the Paul amendment.\n  I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. PAUL. This is exactly, precisely the time it should come up \nbecause on the infrastructure bill that we are looking at, this gives \nAmericans the chance to show great contrast. Do you want to do nation \nbuilding overseas or do you want to do nation building at home? Do you \nwant to spend billions of dollars in Egypt or would you rather build \nsome roads at home?\n  I think it provides a perfect contrast. In fact, there couldn't be a \nbetter place to have a discussion on this issue.\n  We always hear a lot of empty thoughts and empty promises: Oh, we \nwill do this in committee. We will do this.\n  They don't want this debate. I have been fighting tooth and nail \nagainst Members of my own party to get to this debate, to bring it to \nthe floor, to bring it to the American people.\n  Let's be very clear about what the amendment does. It halts military \naid until they have an election. It is just obeying the law.\n  Let's be very clear. Maybe we should do a summary of what their \narguments are. This is a summary of their arguments: They love sending \nAmerican money overseas so much that they don't mind breaking the law. \nI didn't hear one of them explain how they are going to adhere to the \nlaw. The law says military aid ends when there is a coup. The President \nsays you can't make him say there is a coup. There probably is a coup, \nbut he is never going to say it, and he is never going to adjudicate \nit. Who is going to adjudicate whether there is a coup?\n  This is about temporarily halting aid. Some people rise and say: Oh, \nwe will be closed out, and they will buy their weapons someplace else. \nThey don't have any money. We give them the money to buy our weapons.\n  Some have said they want to promote democracy. Well, there is an \nexemption. You can spend as much money on democracy promotion.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. PAUL. Not now.\n  The thing is, we have to understand what this is about. We have to \nunderstand this is about a temporary halting of buying weapons. People \nsay: Well, if we don't give them planes, we don't pay them to buy our \nplanes, they will think we don't like them. They will go to war with \nIsrael and everything will be so much worse.\n  They have hundreds of F-16s. They have thousands of tanks. I am \nprecisely worried about them using them against Israel when there is \nchaos and blood running in the streets, when there are millions of \npeople protesting.\n\n[[Page S6093]]\n\n  Do you think it is a good time to send more weapons? Do you think it \nis a good time to send more weapons when millions of people are in the \nstreets?\n  What happens if these weapons are used against Israel? The canard of \nbringing the letter--it always happens. Someone brings in a letter. I \nhave spoken to many people who love, respect, and have a great deal of \nadmiration for Israel. I admire our relationship and alliance and am \nvery proud of the fact that we stand together on so many issues. To \nbring it up and say the people who are against this don't care about \nIsrael is just a canard.\n  I think this precisely--continuing to arm an unstable government in \nEgypt--could well be to Israel's harm. This is precisely why I bring \nthis amendment forward.\n  Also, it needs to be clear for the record that everyone who has come \nforward together to send more of your money overseas, to send good \nmoney after bad, every one of them was for sending it to the Muslim \nBrotherhood. We hear them talking about Islamic jihadists and how they \nare worried about them. No, they are not. They were for funding the \nIslamic jihadists. They were for funding the Muslim Brotherhood just \nmonths ago.\n  I have had this vote before. I voted to cut off aid to the Muslim \nBrotherhood also. I have produced an amendment. They all voted against \nit then because we were going to do this on a more rational, reasonable \npace someday, somewhere, in some fictitious committee. No, we are not. \nThey want the money to continue. It doesn't go to the Egyptian people. \nIt doesn't buy good will. It buys ill will. Do you know what the money \nis spent on? Tanks. Tanks roll over people in protest.\n\n  I have no love lost for the Muslim Brotherhood, but they have \ndisappeared them. We are going to be giving money to the military that \nis disappearing people. No one has heard from President Morsi. Most \npeople think he was actually elected in a fair election. I don't agree \nwith radical Islam. I don't think he would be a good President for any \ncountry. I wouldn't give him any money. But we are going to give money \nto people who make people disappear?\n  Does anybody remember the Soviet Union? These same people stand and \nsay how bad it is the Soviet Union makes someone disappear. I am \nabsolutely with them. I support that. It is terrible. That is what the \nmilitary in Egypt is doing--making people disappear. Most of the \nmembers of the government haven't been seen in days, maybe weeks. We \nhave no idea where they are.\n  Once again, let me be clear. I have no sympathy for them. I don't \nwant to give them money either. But all these people who want to fund \nthe military, they all want to fund the Muslim Brotherhood. The only \nthing consistent about their argument is sending your money to other \npeople.\n  There is a finite amount of money. Detroit lays in ruins, Chicago is \nfull of violence, and there are bridges everywhere. Don't let them \npaint this that I have some special thing in Kentucky. There are no \nearmarks. There is no special money going to Kentucky. This is going \ninto the Transportation bill for the whole country.\n  There is actually nothing in here special for Chicago or Detroit, but \nI point it out that we have problems at home. Maybe we should do some \nnation building here at home.\n  The other side will falsely say: Oh, you want isolationism. You want \nto disengage from the world. Hogwash. I want to be involved. I am for \nbeing involved with Egypt. I am for trade. I am for international and \nglobal interaction and diplomacy and all those things. But do you think \nyou are making the world a better place by sending a few more F-16s and \ntanks and tear gas to Egypt? Do you think that is somehow making the \nworld a safer place? No.\n  If I thought the foreign aid was going to do something good, I might \nbe for it. Mubarak and his family fly on private jets, dine on caviar \nand champagne. Your money is more likely to buy a chateau in Paris for \nthe Mubarak family than it is to buy bread for the people of Egypt.\n  They say: Oh, well, the Egyptian people will not like us anymore if \nwe don't give them money. Seventy percent of the Egyptian people have \nsaid they do not want our money. It doesn't go to them. The people, by \nthe millions, are rioting in Cairo. By the hundreds of thousands they \nare rioting in Tahrir Square. They are not rioting for American aid. \nThey are rioting for us to quit giving aid to the despots who rule \nthem.\n  Mubarak ruled for 30-some-odd years. He ruled by martial law. He made \npeople disappear also. What about human rights? What about dignity? \nWhat about trials they just recently--the Muslim Brotherhood--tried 16 \nAmericans in absentia. If they were there, they would have put them in \njail. Yet all these same people are afraid to take away money.\n  How do you think leverage would best work? How would we have \nleverage? Maybe if we withheld some aid, we would have leverage. But if \nyou give them everything they want all the time, any time, do you think \nthey are going to do something differently? They say the definition of \ninsanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a \ndifferent response. We have given the aid for 30-some-odd years.\n  We gave a dictator in the Congo--Mobutu--aid for years and years. \nThey called his wife Gucci Mobutu. Why? Because she would take a Louis \nVuitton bag, full of about $1 million in cash, to Paris and spend it in \na weekend--your money, our money, spent on lavish homes. Mobutu had \nseven palaces. I think Mubarak has six or seven palaces. They steal the \nmoney. It doesn't buy the good will of the people. It actually buys ill \nwill. It does completely the opposite of everything they say it does. \nIt does completely the opposite.\n  So there is a disagreement on this. But the one thing there is not a \ndisagreement on is that it is against the law. The Republican Party \nmaintains: Oh, we are for the rule of law, and we proudly beat our \nchest all the time and say to Democrats: Oh, you don't want the rule of \nlaw; the President disobeys the rule of law. Guess what. This time many \nDemocrats and Republicans will flout the rule of law because the rule \nof law says military aid ends when you have a coup. It doesn't say you \ncan wait around until it is convenient for you and maybe you can parcel \nout the aid in different ways. It doesn't say that. It says military \naid ends until there is an election. It is very clear about this.\n  So the argument is about whether you believe in the rule of law. If \nyou do, there is no question you have to vote for this amendment \nbecause this amendment simply restates the law. I am not even creating \nthe law. I am just restating the law that says aid ends and it resumes \nwhen there is an election.\n  So those who say he is against all aid, don't listen to him, he is \nagainst all aid, that is not what this amendment does. This amendment \nenforces the law that actually every one of these men and women voted \nfor. They voted for this law. It has been on the books 30-some-odd \nyears, and the law says that aid ends when you have a military coup. So \nthey are all going to vote to bypass a law they have all supported. \nEvery one of them supported this law.\n  This isn't some extreme position of no aid; this is a position of \ntemporarily halting it. It is their plan, but it is not convenient now \nto obey the law they passed.\n  This is an important debate. It is not about doing things to harm \nIsrael; it is about doing things that, actually, I think would be \nbeneficial to Israel. It is not about ending all aid; it is about \nobeying the law. It shouldn't be about whether aid is good or bad. I \nthink there are a lot of bad things and unintended consequences that \ncome from the aid, but it is not about that. It is about whether we are \ngoing to obey the law.\n  I say think long and hard about this. Some say they are going to do \nsomething more important than what their people at home want, and they \nare very proud they are going to stand against the will of the people. \nThree-fourths of Republicans, three-fourths of Democrats, and three-\nfourths of Independents or higher think it is a bad idea to be sending \ngood money after bad overseas. We do have problems at home and this \ncould go toward fixing them.\n  Some say it is only 1 percent. Foreign aid is only 1 percent. Guess \nwhat. If you cut 1 percent of the budget each year, the budget balances \nwithin about\n\n[[Page S6094]]\n\n5 years. It is called the penny plan. Many on my side have actually \nendorsed this plan. So 1 percent isn't an insignificant amount of \nmoney, and it is not working. It is doing the wrong thing.\n  So I urge a ``yes'' vote on the amendment.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Donnelly). The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, this has been a robust debate. Listening \nto my friend and colleague from Kentucky, I appreciate his views, but I \nstrongly disagree with him. Above all, let's say what it is and what it \nis not about. This is not about Mubarak and chateaus. Mubarak is gone. \nThe Egyptian people decided that. He is gone. It is not about Mobutu or \nanybody else. You can conflate anything you want and throw it up \nagainst the wall, but this is a question of whether we will continue to \npursue our own national interest and national security in Egypt, in the \nMiddle East.\n  This is, in fact, about democracy. It is about the 30 million who \nwere protesting in the streets of Egypt, whom Senator Paul referred to. \nBut their call is not for us to leave; their call is for us to engage \nwith them. As the experts in this field who gave testimony before the \ncommittee said, the one uniting thing among all elements of Egyptian \nsociety we could do is cut off all aid. It would unite in what? Against \nus.\n  This is about making sure we have a stable Middle East. It is not a \ncanard to suggest that Israel's security is at stake, because when you \nhave hundreds of tunnels in the Sinai being used by extremists to send \nweapons into Gaza to attack Israel, it is about their security. I think \nno one knows better about their security than the State of Israel \nitself knows about their security.\n  It is not a canard. It is a fundamental element of whether we are \ngoing to have an ally that can be safe and secure. It is a fundamental \nelement of whether we are going to have the ability to affect the \noutcome in Egypt in a way that will create stability and peace. It is a \nfundamental element of whether we have to send soldiers abroad versus \nkeeping them here at home. Because when there is peace and stability, \nwe ultimately do not have to engage with our military in pursuit of our \nnational interest and security.\n  When terrorists cannot organize in Egypt, we are safer at home in the \nUnited States. So let's not cut off all aid to Egypt in a \ntransportation, housing, and urban development bill when, in fact, our \nvital national interests are at stake. There is plenty of opportunity \nto help America's cities. I was a mayor. No one wants to help America's \ncities more. You will get to do that if you vote for the THUD bill, if \nyou put your vote up. But this is not a way to achieve that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I yield to the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Ronald Reagan used to say facts are stubborn things. The \nSenator from Kentucky just said Egypt has no money. Isn't it a fact the \nGulf countries and the Saudis have just given them $13 billion?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Absolutely.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Again, isn't the question whether the Senator from \nKentucky knows what is better for Israel or Israel knows what is better \nfor Israel? The fact is, AIPAC and the Israelis are adamantly opposed \nto this amendment; isn't that correct?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. It is true they are opposed, and I would assume Israel, \na sovereign state, knows what its security interests are better than \nanybody else.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. What is the status of time right now? I think we should \nbring this to a close soon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time remaining is under the control of the \nSenator from Kentucky, and he has 2 minutes remaining.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, several points have been made about whether \nwe should engage with Egypt. Absolutely, we should. But the Egyptian \npeople don't see it as engagement when the engagement is at the end of \na truncheon, when the engagement is tear gas bought with American money \nand then sprayed on them. They do not quite understand that as \nengagement. So buying arms--American tanks and American tear gas--to be \nused for crowd control isn't exactly what the Egyptian people have in \nmind as far as engagement.\n  With regard to Israel, there is no unified statement from the nation \nof Israel saying they are for this. I have had both private and public \ndiscussions with the leaders of Israel, and to tell you the truth, \nwithout naming individuals, I can tell you they are not too excited \nabout sending more arms to Egypt. So for someone to come to the floor \nand say they speak for the nation of Israel, they speak for all people \nwho love Israel in our country, is false.\n  There are probably 20 different groups in our country that support \nthe nation of Israel and support them as our ally. I speak to them all \nthe time. I visit with them daily and weekly in our office. So what I \ncan tell you is if you talk to the people, to the grassroots and not to \nthe so-called leadership, you will find a much different story. Because \nI would promise you--let me speak to the entire crowd at an AIPAC \nmeeting and we will see whether they like sending more weapons to the \nMuslim Brotherhood or more weapons to Egypt. I think you will find a \nresounding no.\n  This amendment is ultimately about the law, and I hope my colleagues \nwill remember that if they vote against this amendment they are \nflouting the law, they are voting to disobey the law, they are voting \nagainst the rule of law, and they are actually voting against a law \nthey have all voted for.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I think most Members of the body realize \nthe THUD bill is not the place to address major foreign policy. I think \nall understand that in September it is the plan of this body to deal \nwith the legal issues regarding foreign aid to Egypt, so I move to \ntable the amendment of the Senator from Kentucky.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                           NASA Authorization\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, we passed the NASA \nauthorization bill out of the Commerce Committee yesterday. Sadly, I \nmust report that it is the first time the NASA bill has been a partisan \nvote that I can ever remember. NASA--this little program that is such a \ncan-do agency--has always been not only bipartisan, but it has been \nnonpartisan.\n  There was actually no real disagreement with the content, the \npolicies set in the NASA authorization bill. It is very similar to what \nthe Appropriations Committee indeed has already passed out of the full \nAppropriations Committee. But, sadly, there is an insistence that this \nartificial budget limitation, which is like a meat cleaver cutting \nacross the board--some would describe it as a guillotine coming down \nacross programs willy-nilly--cutting programs such as the National \nInstitutes of Health and all of the medical research that is going on \nand, indeed, a broadly embraced bipartisan program such as our space \nprogram.\n  So the vote was 13 to 12--specifically along partisan lines--not \nbecause of the content, not because of the policy, but because of the \nfunding level. In the bill that passed, we had the NASA authorization \nfor appropriations at the level provided in the budget resolution that \npassed the Senate--$18.1 billion. That is about level funding for NASA, \nthis little agency that is trying to do so much. However, our \nRepublican friends wanted it cut to $16.8 billion, and some spoke \nfavorably toward the House bill that has it cut back to $16.6 billion.\n  If we cut $1.5 billion out of this little agency, it can't do what it \nis attempting to do to get us ready to go to Mars in the decade of the \n2030s and in the meantime to get our human-rated rockets in the \ncommercial sector so we can send our astronauts to and from the \ninternational space station where six human beings are doing research \nright now. The multiplicity of science projects, the planetary \nexploration that is going on, and the aeronautics research that is \ngoing on--all of that is within this little agency.\n  My hope is that as we get further along in the fiscal year, we are \ngoing to hit some grand design, some grand bargain, some great \nbipartisan agreement on funding that maybe will include tax reform but \nthat will then allow us to operate with common sense instead of some \nartificial budgetary mechanism called sequester.\n  Yesterday it was stated that indeed the NASA authorization bill \nviolated the Budget Control Act of 2011. I tried to explain in the \ncommittee that it did not. As a matter of fact, the Budget Control Act \nis an overall level on compressing appropriations. It has no effect on \nthe authorization for appropriations. That is where we set policy, and \nthen we leave it up to the Appropriations Committee to set the actual \nfunding.\n\n  So I am happy to say that we made the step that we needed to make. We \nhave the bill proceeding now out of the committee. I am sad to say that \nfor the first time ever this broadly based, wildly popular, not only \nbipartisan but nonpartisan program, called America's space program, has \ncome out of the committee with a partisan vote.\n  Let's turn this around, and let's not have this excessive \npartisanship and this ideological rigidity that is gripping this \ncountry's politics. Let's not have that infect our Nation's space \nprogram.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \nup to 15 minutes on the Todd nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I come to the floor to ask my \ncolleagues to vote against cloture on the nomination, and here are my \nreasons for asking that of my colleagues.\n  Earlier this week I outlined my general objection to the Senate \nproceeding to a final vote on the confirmation of Mr. B. Todd Jones, \nthe nominee to be Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and \nFirearms. As I explained, the Senate should not be voting on a \nnomination when there is an open investigation.\n  In this case the Office of Special Counsel is investigating Mr. Jones \nin a complaint that he retaliated against a whistleblower in the U.S. \nAttorney's Office for the District of Minnesota.\n  Because of the way this nomination was handled in committee, I was \nable to conduct only a limited investigation. But what I found should \ngive all of us pause--real pause--on this nomination because it gives \nme concern about Mr. Jones's leadership ability and raises doubts about \nwhether he should be promoted to head this office.\n  According to both the whistleblowing assistant U.S. attorney and the \nformer head of the FBI in Minnesota, relationships with Federal, State, \nand local authorities deteriorated significantly under Jones's \nleadership. The problems primarily involved agencies that worked drug \ncases and violent crime.\n  Mr. Jones addressed the issue in a meeting with criminal prosecutors \nin his office. According to the whistleblower, following that meeting, \nMr. Jones came to the whistleblower's office and asked for his candid \nopinion of what could be done about the problem.\n  The whistleblower gave Jones his candid opinion, and a few weeks \nlater he put it in writing what he had told Jones during this meeting. \nHis e-mail to Jones included allegations of mismanagement by one of his \nsupervisors, the head of the Narcotics and Violent Crime Unit.\n  The very next day, that supervisor called that whistleblower on the \ncarpet and, according to the whistleblower, interrogated him about his \nwork in search of a pretext to discipline him.\n  Failing to find a substantive reason to discipline him, his \nsupervisors then suspended him for 5 days for his demeanor during the \nmeeting. Now, based on what we know at this point, it certainly looks \nlike retaliation, and it helps explain why the Office of Special \nCounsel believed these allegations merited further investigation. \nRemember, only about 10 percent, 1 in 10 of these types of allegations \nis selected for investigation by the Special Counsel.\n  To be fair, we do not know the full story. The Office of Special \nCounsel has not finished its investigation into the matter. But this \nfact remains: There is an open investigation of serious allegations of \nwhistleblower retaliation, and because that investigation remains open, \nthis body--the Senate of the United States--should have the full \ninformation about the nominee, and it\n\n[[Page S6096]]\n\ndoes not have it, and it should have it before voting on that \nnomination.\n  These are serious charges. The public interest demands resolution of \nthese issues. Members of the Senate are entitled to know if these \ncharges have merit. Members of the Senate are entitled to the complete \nrecord.\n  So everyone should ask, Why then are we voting on a nomination on \nwhich there is an open investigation and on a nominee where we do not \nhave the complete information? To me, the answer is obvious: We should \nnot be conducting this vote until this matter is resolved.\n  I would like to highlight a few comments contained in a recent letter \nfrom the National Whistleblowers Center. That organization, since 1988, \nhas been supporting whistleblowers.\n  The center opposes a vote on this nomination ``until there is a \ncomplete and thorough investigation into his treatment of employee-\nwhistleblowers.'' This is exactly what I am requesting today: a ``no'' \nvote to give the time to complete this investigation.\n  The National Whistleblowers Center notes that the Office of Special \nCounsel's investigation remains open. Again, I agree with their \ncontention; namely, ``that office should be able to complete its \ninquiry in due course, without any pressure triggered by the nomination \nprocess.''\n  I am surprised to hear rumblings about my opposition to this nominee \nbased on this particular matter. It seems some are asking the question, \nWhat does this whistleblower retaliation have to do with the ATF? Why \nis this investigation even relevant?\n  I sincerely hope my colleagues have not forgotten about the disaster \nof Operation Fast and Furious--an absolute failure by the former \nleadership of the ATF. In that case, the former ATF leadership and the \nex-U.S. attorney retaliated against the brave whistleblowers who \nalerted authorities about this botched operation of Fast and Furious. A \nU.S. attorney in Arizona had to resign because of his retaliatory \nconduct against whistleblowers.\n\n  Based in part on that history, I am extremely hesitant to place at \nthe head of that agency this individual who has been accused of \nretaliation against a whistleblower and, as Acting Director of ATF, Mr. \nJones sends a very chilling message to all the employees of that \norganization.\n  Mr. Jones was caught on video, so we know exactly what he said. He \nwas caught on video making very disturbing statements specifically \ntargeted at discouraging ATF agents from blowing the whistle.\n  Let me remind you, whistleblowers are patriotic Americans who think \nthe law ought to be followed and the government do what the law says.\n  He told these whistleblowers:\n\n       [I]f you don't respect the chain of command, if you don't \n     find the appropriate way to raise your concerns to your \n     leadership, there will be consequences.\n\n  Wouldn't that scare anybody who worked in that organization?\n  Of course, blowing the whistle requires going outside the chain of \ncommand to report wrongdoing. If you do not get the benefit of people \nlistening to you within, then it is your constitutional responsibility \nto go outside and report violation of law. So telling employees there \nwill be consequences for going outside the chain of command is the same \nthing as telling them there will be consequences for whistleblowing.\n  This video was seen by several employees in the U.S. Attorney's \nOffice of Minnesota, also headed by Mr. Jones in his other capacity. \nThese employees wrote to the Office of Special Counsel referencing the \nvideo, stating that they had ``felt for the employees of ATF as we too \nhave had the same types of statements made to us.''\n  They then said Mr. Jones ``ha[d] instituted a climate of fear, ha[d] \npushed employees out of the office, dismissed employees wrongly, \nviolated the hiring practices of the EEOC, and put in place an \nOrwellian style of management that continues to polarize the office.''\n  As I mentioned, the former head of the FBI in Minnesota also wrote to \nthe committee about Mr. Jones. In that letter, he wrote:\n\n       As a retired FBI senior executive, I am one of the few \n     voices able to publicly express our complete discontent with \n     Mr. Jones' ineffective leadership and poor service provided \n     to the federal law enforcement community without fear of \n     retaliation or retribution from him.\n\n  Meaning from Mr. Jones.\n  Those are chilling words, as I have said twice. They corroborate what \nmembers of his staff have said and are consistent with the \nwhistleblower retaliation complaint.\n  The former FBI Special Agent in Charge continued with this report:\n\n       [Mr. Jones] was, and still remains, a significant \n     impediment for federal law enforcement to effectively protect \n     the citizens of Minnesota. . . .\n\n  As the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported on December 31, 2012:\n\n       Criminal prosecutions have dropped dramatically at the U.S. \n     Attorney's office in Minneapolis under the leadership of B. \n     Todd Jones, rankling some in law enforcement.\n\n  But then the article continued:\n\n       Several federal and state law enforcement sources said that \n     the U.S. Attorney's office refused to prosecute drug and \n     violent crime cases that would have been snapped up by Jones' \n     predecessors. None agreed to be quoted, saying they must \n     maintain a relationship with the U.S. Attorney's Office.\n\n  My investigation revealed that during Mr. Jones's tenure as U.S. \nattorney, several people allege that relationships with other Federal \nlaw enforcement agencies deteriorated also. Now, why would we want to \nconfirm as Director of the ATF someone who has a poor track record \nworking with Federal law enforcement?\n  Since the majority insisted on moving forward without waiting for the \nOffice of Special Counsel to complete its work, on July 2 I wrote to \nthe FBI, the DEA, and ICE seeking information about the deteriorating \nrelationship between Federal law enforcement and the U.S. Attorney's \nOffice under Mr. Jones's leadership. I have received no replies to that \nrequest.\n  In addition to his record as U.S. attorney for the District of \nMinnesota, what about Mr. Jones's record as Acting Director of the \nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms? It is no secret that there \nhave been a number of controversial events that Mr. Jones has been \ninvolved in to one degree or another. I have sent numerous letters to \nthe department requesting information from and about Mr. Jones. In many \ncases, I have received no response or an incomplete response. Here is a \nsampling:\n  On Fast and Furious--on October 12, 2011, the House Oversight and \nGovernment Reform Committee subpoenaed records of the Attorney \nGeneral's advisory committee relating to Operation Fast and Furious \nduring a period Jones was committee chair. I reiterated that request on \nApril 10, 2013.\n  No. 2, ATF's accountability for Fast and Furious. On October 19, \n2012, and January 15, 2013, I requested information on which ATF \nemployees would be disciplined for their role in Fast and Furious.\n  No. 3, Fast and Furious interview request. From October 7, 2011, \nthrough January 2012, I requested a staff interview with Jones \nregarding Fast and Furious. I reiterated that request to Mr. Jones on \nApril 10, 2013.\n  No. 4, interview request on Reno, NV, ATF office. My April 10, 2013, \nletter also indicated that Mr. Jones's failure to act on Reno \nmanagement issues was another area of questions to be covered in a \nstaff interview.\n  No. 5, interview request on Operation Fearless. My April 10, 2013, \nletter indicated that the botched Operation Fearless in Milwaukee was \nanother area of questions to be covered in a staff interview.\n  No. 6, document request on Operation Fearless. On May 10 of this \nyear, I sent Mr. Jones a letter requesting a copy of the Office of \nProfessional Responsibility and Security Operations report on the \nbotched Milwaukee storefront operation.\n  No. 7, on the St. Paul and quid pro quo matter, I was able to have a \nstaff interview with Mr. Jones. Just to remind my colleagues about the \nissue I will tell you, briefly, on February 3, 2012, the Department of \nJustice and the City of St. Paul struck a deal. The terms of the quid \npro quo were as follows: The Department declined to intervene in two \nFalse Claims Act cases that were pending against St. Paul, and St. Paul \nwithdrew its petition before the U.S. Supreme Court on the Magner case, \na case that observers believed would invalidate the use of disparate \nimpact theory under the Fair Housing Act.\n\n[[Page S6097]]\n\n  But this was no ordinary settlement. Instead of furthering the ends \nof justice, this settlement prevented the courts from reviewing \npotentially meritorious claims and the recovery of hundreds of millions \nof dollars for the U.S. Treasury.\n  The U.S. attorney in Minnesota at the time of the quid pro quo, Mr. \nJones, was serving both as U.S. attorney and Acting Director of the \nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Mr. Jones was \ninterviewed by the committee staff as part of the investigation on \nMarch 8, 2013. However, before agreeing to the interview, the \ndepartment demanded that staff not be permitted to ask Mr. Jones any \nfurther questions other than those involving quid pro quo.\n  Questions remain about whether he was effectively managing both jobs \nas the U.S. attorney and Acting Director. For example, when asked by \ncommittee staff about his failure to attend a seminal meeting between \nthe department's civil division and representatives from the City of \nSt. Paul, which occurred in December 2011, he stated that he did not \nattend because he had an event at ATF that precluded his attendance. \nWhen pressed further, Mr. Jones indicated the important event at ATF \nwas a holiday party called ``sweet treats.''\n  He felt it was more important that he attend that event than it was \nto attend his crucial meeting----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent for 3 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. It was more important that he go to sweet treats than \nworry about collecting $200 million under False Claims Act cases \npending. I raised many of these issues with Mr. Jones at his hearing \nand in written questions for the record. But in too many instances Mr. \nJones was unable or unwilling to provide an adequate response. \nUnfortunately, I have a lingering concern about his candor during his \ntestimony. With this record before us, it should be apparent to all of \nmy colleagues that the Senate should not move forward with Mr. Jones' \nnomination.\n  First, the Senate has yet to learn the results from the \ninvestigations of Office of Special Counsel; two, the Senate has not \nhad an opportunity to hear Mr. Jones address those allegations himself. \nPoint blank he told the committee he could not speak about them because \nof the open investigation; third, the Senate should recognize a \ntroubling pattern indicating the nominee's inability to work with \nFederal law enforcement and whistleblowers; four, his involvement in a \nnumber of botched operations showing unacceptable management style or \ncapability.\n  Elevating an individual with such a record is not how you \nrehabilitate the reputation, image, and culture of Federal law \nenforcement agencies still recovering from the disastrous scandal of \nFast and Furious. I do not believe we should simply rubberstamp this \nnomination and sweep the alarming allegations under the rug.\n  I would hope that further action on the nomination pause until these \nmatters are resolved. Before I close, I wish to address one additional \nmatter. I have heard it argued from the majority that there is an \nurgency to get this nomination confirmed because ATF has not had a \nconfirmed Director for 7 years. President Bush made a nomination in \nMarch 2007. That nomination was held up in the Senate based on concerns \nregarding ATF's hostility to small gun dealers and the nominee's \napparent indifference to their concerns.\n  President Obama did not nominate a Director until November 17, 2010. \nThat is 2 years into his first term. That individual's nomination \nstalled because neither the White House nor the nominee responded to \nour requests for additional information. Rather than respond to our \nrequests so that nomination might move forward or withdraw that \nnomination and send up another, the White House did nothing for 2 \nyears.\n  The nomination of Mr. Jones was not sent up to the Senate until the \nbeginning of this year. So for the past 4\\1/2\\ years, the vacancy is \nthe responsibility of the White House. I do not think that supports \ntheir contention that there is a crisis because of a lack of a Senate-\nconfirmed nominee.\n  In any event, the prudent course for the Senate, and what I support, \nis to wait a short while, until the open complaint is resolved. I urge \nmy colleagues to vote against cloture.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n                            Power Nomination\n\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, this week the Senate will consider the \nnomination of Samantha Power to serve as our next Ambassador to the \nUnited Nations. In fact, I hope we will take it up later today. This is \na critical position to our President's national and foreign policy \nteam, and I believe Ms. Power's experience, values, and wise approach \nto foreign policy will make her a terrific Ambassador.\n  Throughout her career, she has displayed a passion for human rights \nand worked tirelessly to prevent atrocities abroad. From her early days \nas a journalist, to her work in the White House, she has shown a \npragmatic idealism and a deep and nuanced understanding of the foreign \npolicy and security challenges facing this country around the globe.\n  I met with Ms. Power a few weeks ago. I came away confident that she \nis the right choice to represent our country at the U.N. She \nunderstands the critical importance of democratic values and human \nrights to global stability. Ours is a complex time and a complex world. \nThe fabric of global stability is woven with many threads of democracy, \ngood governance, economic development, health, education, national \nsecurity and, of course, diplomacy.\n  The global challenges of our generation require leaders, leaders \ncapable of seeing each of these threads and appreciating how they \nconnect and how we can weave them together to make a stronger more \nvibrant world.\n  As chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on African \nAffairs, I am excited to work with Ambassador Power to strengthen our \nfriendship and strategic partnerships on that vital continent. On \nIsrael, it is clear she believes in our Nation's unbreakable bond with \nthe Jewish State. She has shown us, in her words and actions, \nespecially when she played an underreported and underappreciated role \ndefending Israel at the U.N. during the Palestinian statehood vote.\n  In closing, it is clear that in Samantha Power we have a nominee with \na keen intellect and a grasp of the complex foreign policy challenges \nwe face in the world. She combines a dedication to American values and \nprinciples with the pragmatism that will serve us well at the U.N. I am \nproud to vote for her confirmation and urge my colleagues to do the \nsame.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I rise in support of the nomination \nof Todd Jones to be Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, \nFirearms and Explosives. I wish to first thank Senator Coons for his \nremarks about Samantha Power. I am also looking forward to the vote on \nher confirmation. I am looking forward to her service.\n  This is a very important job. As the Presiding Officer knows, the ATF \nhas an incredibly important role in investigating crimes and terrorist \nincidents such as the Boston Marathon. They recently investigated the \nexplosion in Texas that took so many innocent lives. This must be a top \npriority for the United States of America.\n  Yet this is a position where there are 2,400 agents--2,400 ATF \nagents--and they have gone without a permanent Director for 7 years, \never since this became a confirmable position. This happened under \nPresident Bush. There was not a confirmed Director. It is happening now \nup until today under President Obama. It is time to change that. It is \nsimply time to change it.\n  I know Todd Jones. For 2 years he has served as the U.S. attorney of \nMinnesota at the same time he is serving as the ATF Director. That is \nnot an easy job. He has five children. He is a former marine. He was \nwilling to take on the ATF job after the Fast and Furious debacle. He \nwas willing to come in after that and help to clean up that agency and \nmake some very tough decisions. He took on that job while still\n\n[[Page S6098]]\n\nremaining the U.S. attorney in Minnesota.\n  I would note he served as the U.S. attorney of Minnesota under \nPresident Clinton and again was appointed to serve under President \nObama. Then, 2 years ago, he was asked to be the Acting Director of \nATF, never knowing if this day would ever come when actually there \nwould be a vote on his confirmation.\n  He literally has never turned down a tough assignment. Todd Jones has \nan impressive background that makes him well prepared to lead the ATF. \nAfter law school at the University of Minnesota, he entered the U.S. \nMarine Corps, as I noted, where he served on Active Duty as a judge \nadvocate and infantry officer from 1983 until 1989. Two years later, he \nwas called back to Active Duty during the first Iraq war.\n  In addition to his military career and having the rare distinction of \nserving as U.S. attorney under two different Presidents, Todd Jones \nalso has a strong record as a line prosecutor in the Minnesota U.S. \nAttorney's Office. When Jones was U.S. attorney in Minnesota from 1998 \nto 2001, the violent crime rate decreased by 15 percent. So far during \nhis second tenure as the U.S. attorney, the violent crime rate in \nMinnesota has already decreased by 9 percent.\n  We all know there are a lot of factors that go into that, including \nthe great work of our local police officers, including work of our \npolice chiefs, including the work of community groups, including the \neconomy. There are a number of things at hand. But when I hear attacks \nagainst Mr. Jones, I believe it is important to set the record \nstraight.\n  One other thing--I did want to set the record straight on one other \nthing. I so appreciate the leadership Senator Grassley has shown when \nit comes to whistleblowers. But everyone should know, regarding this \ncomplaint within the office, an internal complaint within the U.S. \nAttorney's Office in Minnesota, it was investigated by the Judiciary \nCommittee. In this place, to set the record straight, the complainant \nvoluntarily agreed to mediate his concerns. The Office of Special \nCounsel is no longer investigating. I wish to make that straight for \nall of my colleagues so they understand the outcome of that and that \nthere is a mediation going on. It is not being investigated.\n  As an assistant U.S. attorney, Todd Jones was the lead prosecutor in \na number of cases involving drug conspiracies, money laundering, \nfinancial fraud, and violent crime in the early 1990s. In the private \nsector, he became a partner at two very well regarded Minnesota law \nfirms, Robins Kaplan and Greene Espel. He has led a number of very \nimportant prosecutions in his capacity as U.S. attorney: Operation \nRhino, which involved the criminal prosecution of Omer Abdi Mohamed, \nwho recruited young Somali Americans to fight for terrorist groups in \nSomalia, To date, this investigation has resulted in charges filed \nagainst 22 other individuals and Operation Brother's Keeper, a major \nRICO case, the second biggest Ponzi scheme in the history of America, \nsecond only to the Bernie Madoff Ponzi scheme, prosecuted by the U.S. \nAttorney's Office, by a fine prosecutor named Joe Dixon and many others \nunder Todd Jones's leadership.\n  This gives us a sense--and I would end with this as I see Senator \nLeahy, our great chairman is here. Jones's confirmation is supported by \nthe Fraternal Order of Police, the International Chiefs of Police, 81 \nU.S. attorneys, the National District Attorneys Association, \nMinnesota's former FBI Special Agent in Charge, Ralph Boelter, the \nformer U.S. attorney Tom Hefflefinger, who served under both George H. \nW. Bush and George W. Bush in Minnesota, and dozens of others who have \nworked with Mr. Jones over his many years of public service.\n  I would end with this: The ATF has people on the frontlines every \nday. They do not ask if the work they have done is ordered by a \nRepublican or a Democrat. When they go to investigate a bombing, they \ndo not ask the police officers what their political affiliation is or \nwho the FBI is. They do not care. They just do their job. Now it is \ntime for the Senate to do its job and confirm an ATF Director for the \nfirst time in 7 years. I thank the chairman for his leadership.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, when the 113th Congress convened \nfollowing the terrible tragedy in Newtown, CT, the Judiciary Committee \nfocused its attention on commonsense gun violence prevention \nlegislation. The American people made their voices heard in favor of \neffective reforms, and many Senators went to work to find common \nground.\n\n  Although the Senate Judiciary Committee approved four pieces of \nlegislation to address gun violence, two of which were reported on \nbipartisan votes, the Senate was unable to pass any of these measures. \nLike many Americans, I was disappointed at the Senate's inability to \ncome together to make sensible changes to our laws to reduce gun \nviolence.\n  Today we have another chance to make progress in our efforts to \nreduce gun violence with the confirmation of B. Todd Jones to lead the \nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives. Todd Jones has \nserved as the Acting Director since September 2011. Under his \nleadership, the ATF has been called on to analyze the bombs left near \nthe finish line at the Boston Marathon, to sift through burned debris \nin the West, TX, explosion and to trace the weapons used by the \nshooters in the Newtown and Aurora massacres. The ATF has played a \nmajor role in investigating some of our Nation's worst tragedies.\n  In addition to the ATF's enforcement responsibilities, the agency is \ncentral to firearms commerce. The ATF issues permits for companies that \nimport firearms and provide firearms to law enforcement agencies. \nWithout a confirmed Director, the ATF's job of supporting and \nregulating Americans who make their living in the business of firearms \nis much more difficult. Yet we continue to hamper the ATF's ability to \ndo its job. No nominee to lead the ATF has been confirmed since that \nposition was made subject to the Senate's consent.\n  I hope the Senate will vote to change this unfortunate pattern of \nobstruction. Mr. Jones is a dedicated public servant and law \nenforcement official. He volunteered for the U.S. Marine Corps in 1983, \nserving on Active Duty as a Judge Advocate and Infantry officer until \n1989. In 1991, he was recalled to Active Duty to command the 4th Marine \nDivision's Military Police Company in Iraq. He also served as \ncommanding officer of the Twin Cities Marine Reserve Unit. When Todd \nJones was confirmed by this body in 1998, he became the first African-\nAmerican U.S. attorney in Minnesota's history. Todd Jones has served \nthis country honorably as a marine, a U.S. attorney, and the ATF's \nActing Director.\n  Unfortunately, there is opposition to Mr. Jones's confirmation. But \nin my view this opposition has little to do with his ability to lead \nthis important Federal agency. Every nominee to lead the ATF has been \nmet with unreasonable opposition. And the consistent opposition all \nnominees to this post have faced is less about those nominees' \nqualifications than about weakening a Federal law enforcement agency \nthat some disfavor.\n  Some Senate Republicans would prefer not to have anyone leading the \nATF, no matter who the nominee is. They would not allow President Bush \nto have a confirmed Director, and they do not want President Obama to \nhave one either.\n  Opposition to confirming an ATF Director is just another piece of the \noverall effort by some in Congress to make it more difficult for the \nATF to carry out its important mission. For example, when the ATF \nproposed and implemented a rule intended to provide investigative leads \non straw purchasing rings in the Southwest that were fueling drug \ncartel violence by trafficking firearms across the border, some Members \nof Congress immediately objected, and the agency was sued to block \nimplementation of the rule. The rule, which has now been upheld \nunanimously by two Federal Circuit Courts of Appeal, including the \nFifth Circuit, was simple--it required federally licensed firearms \ndealers to report sales of multiple semiautomatic rifles to the ATF, \njust as all licensed dealers are required to report multiple sales of \nhandguns. Yet some spent significant energy and resources to block the \nagency's action.\n\n[[Page S6099]]\n\n  And in recent years, some Members of Congress spent months and untold \npublic resources investigating misguided investigative tactics in the \nATF's Phoenix field office associated with an ATF criminal \ninvestigation called Fast and Furious. The Fast and Furious \ninvestigation concerned a significant firearms trafficking organization \nin Arizona. This trafficking organization was systematically purchasing \nhundreds of firearms using straw buyers and transferring them to \nmembers of Mexican drug cartels. They operated with ease and virtual \nimpunity as the result of weak Federal laws concerning straw purchasing \nand firearms trafficking. Investigators and prosecutors were hobbled by \nweak laws. Some took unacceptable risks to combat a very serious \nproblem on both sides of our border with Mexico.\n  When the investigative tactics at issue came to light, they were \nwidely criticized, and Attorney General Holder acted swiftly to put an \nend to them. The Attorney General also directed the Department of \nJustice inspector general to conduct a thorough investigation. As a \nresult of the inspector general's investigation, those responsible for \nthese tactics were disciplined. And the ATF's procedures were revised \nto set out clear guidelines for firearms trafficking investigations.\n  While some Members of Congress were content to merely heap blame on \nthe Attorney General and other dedicated law enforcement officials \nfollowing the Fast and Furious investigation, I and other Senators \nchose a different path and worked with law enforcement experts and \nadvocates on both sides of the firearms policy debate to come up with \nan effective, sensible approach to put an end to the straw purchasing \nand firearms trafficking.\n  Unfortunately, the same Senators who were so critical of the ATF's \ninvestigative tactics in Arizona and its approach to dealing with a \nvery serious law enforcement issue declined to support the bipartisan \nlegislation Senator Collins and I developed to give law enforcement the \ntools they need to fight gun trafficking.\n  I hope the same Senators that were so critical of the ATF and the \nDepartment of Justice for the breakdown in leadership and management at \nthe agency will not obstruct this nominee and the opportunity to give \nthe agency the solid footing it needs. If the Fast and Furious \ninvestigation revealed anything, it was that the ATF faces very \nsignificant law enforcement challenges, and that our current laws are \ninadequate to provide the tools investigators and prosecutors need to \nconfront these problems. Let us not compound these difficulties with \ncontinued obstruction of this nominee.\n  Todd Jones was nominated in January. It is now the last day of July. \nFor months, I accommodated the ranking member on requests for further \ninformation and delay on the nomination of Todd Jones. He insisted on \nthe production of documents from the Department of Justice that his \nstaff had already had access to for months. He insisted that his staff \nbe able to interview Todd Jones in his capacity as U.S. attorney for \nthe District of Minnesota, as well as two other Justice Department \nofficials, in order to try to build a case against another nomination, \nthat of Tom Perez to be Labor Secretary.\n  Senator Grassley requested additional background information from the \nadministration not usually required by the committee for an executive \nnomination and he was provided that information. When he sought \ninformation about an ATF operation in Milwaukee, I arranged a \nbipartisan briefing from the agency.\n  Then a member of the ranking member's staff disclosed a private \nOffice of Special Counsel, OSC, complaint against Todd Jones to the \npress. I thought it unfair that the nominee could not publicly defend \nhis reputation.\n  An employee complained of ``gross mismanagement and abuse of \nauthority'' but the OSC closed the file based on lack of evidence. The \nother allegation involved alleged retaliation for making the \nmismanagement claim, and that subsidiary claim has been referred to \nmediation. In deference to the complaining party and at the request of \nthe investigating agency that the complaint not be made public, it has \nnot been. I wish it were. It is not substantial or directly related to \nTodd Jones. It is certainly not a reason to oppose his confirmation.\n  I know Senator Grassley has the right to raise concerns, but he has \nmade it very clear he does not approve of Todd Jones under any \ncircumstances. I had asked his staff to work with us to get a clearer \nunderstanding of the retaliation complaint. But when we talked to the \ncomplainant, he was willing only to repeat his own allegations, \nallegations that are not aimed directly at Mr. Jones but at somebody \nelse, a mid-level manager.\n  We asked the complainant to provide the committee access to the \ncontemporaneous files so we could determine whether this instance was \nretaliation or one in a series of disciplinary actions against an \nemployee spanning several years. We offered to take the information in \nconfidence, not for the Justice Department but just for members of our \ncommittee. The complainant refused and his lawyer refused to provide \nthat to us, so I would ask all members to read the complaint \nthemselves. We have bent over backwards to allow the complainant to \ncome forward, and he has chosen not to do so.\n  I would also note for all Senators that we have moved forward on \nnominees in the past when there have been pending complaints. For \nexample, last year a civil suit was filed against a judicial nominee \nfrom Iowa alleging age discrimination and retaliation for raising \nmanagement issues against the nominee in her capacity as the U.S. \nattorney for the Northern District of Iowa. We conducted a bipartisan \nstaff investigation into the claims. I listened to the Senators from \nIowa, and we determined we could move forward despite the civil suit \nthat was pending against the nominee. The nominee was overwhelmingly \nconfirmed to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa.\n  Earlier this year, when a defense counsel filed a motion against the \nU.S. attorney for the District of New Mexico making allegations of \nimproper activity, we independently examined the matter. The committee \nproceeded with that nomination instead of delaying it.\n  Todd Jones is the ATF's fifth Acting Director since 2006. During that \ntime 80,000 Americans have been killed with guns. The ATF helps protect \nour communities from dangerous criminals, gun violence, and acts of \nterror. It is a central piece of our Federal law enforcement strategy. \nFor too long the position of Director at the ATF has been held hostage \nto partisan politics at the expense of public safety. It is time to \nmake real progress in our efforts to reduce gun violence and protect \nthe citizens of this great Nation. Today, I encourage all Senators to \ntake the opportunity to move toward that goal together with the \nconfirmation of B. Todd Jones to lead the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, \nFirearms, and Explosives.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President they say history has a way of repeating \nitself. That certainly came true in June when the Senate approved a \nsweeping reform bill to revamp the nation's immigration laws. \nUnfortunately, the U.S. Senate failed to learn from the mistakes \ncreated by the 1986 overhaul.\n  In the 1980s, about 3 million people who were living in the country \nillegally were granted legal status. Today, 27 years later, the U.S. \nestimates 11 million undocumented immigrants are living here.\n  What should that tell us? It says that the 1986 law failed to stem \nthe flow of illegal immigration. It sent the wrong signal by granting \nlegal status to millions while ignoring the need to secure the border.\n  I do not need a crystal ball to tell me what would happen on the road \nahead if we repeat the mistakes of the past. I saw how legalizing \nbefore securing our borders turned out. It turned America's time-\nhonored welcome mat into a timeworn doormat.\n  America's immigration system is broken. It is time to fix it so that \na legal flow of immigration can help the economy and bolster areas of \nthe workforce that are short of workers, from low-skilled to high-tech \nworkers.\n  But immigration laws should not come at the expense of American \nworkers or cause them to be disadvantaged, displaced or underpaid. \nRooting out fraud and abuse from many of our visa programs should be a \npriority.\n  Unfortunately, the bill passed by the U.S. Senate would not fix what \nis broken and is chock-full of loopholes that make the legalization \nsystem far from ideal.\n  Thankfully our system of self-government protects representation of, \nby and for the people with a bicameral Congress. Now the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives has a chance to get it right.\n  The House is moving on a number of bills. They are having very \nthoughtful\n\n[[Page S6101]]\n\ndiscussions on how to improve the legal system while adhering to the \nrule of law. They also know that passing one sweeping bill is a recipe \nfor disaster--one that inevitably creates loopholes and allows special \ninterest provisions to override good policy.\n  I would like to discuss a few of their good ideas.\n  First, the House Judiciary Committee approved the SAFE ACT, a bill \nthat beefs up our interior enforcement efforts. It provides tools to \nState and local law enforcement agencies to help the government enforce \nimmigration laws.\n  It enhances the 287(g) program, which I helped author. It gives the \nStates and localities the power to enact and enforce their own \nimmigration laws as long as they are consistent with Federal law. The \nbill would improve our country's ability to remove criminal aliens. \nDangerous individuals would be detained, sex offenders would be made \ninadmissible, and gang members would be both inadmissible and \ndeportable.\n  These are provisions that are omitted from the Senate bill. Dangerous \ncriminals are ignored in the Senate bill, and it was apparent that the \nother side of the aisle did not want to have votes that would bar these \ndangerous criminals from receiving legal status.\n  Securing the border is very important, but so is focusing on \nindividuals who violate our laws and violate the terms of their stay in \nthe U.S. If we are serious about being tough on sex offenders, domestic \nabusers, drunk drivers, and other criminals, then the SAFE Act needs to \nbe passed by the Senate and sent to the President.\n  Second, the House Judiciary Committee approved a bill that improves \nthe existing E-VERIFY program. This program is a valuable tool and \nshould be made mandatory for all businesses. While the Senate bill does \nmake it mandatory, it does so over 6 years and provides exceptions for \ncertain employers. The House bill would implement the program on a \nfaster timetable, for which I have advocated.\n  Third, the House Judiciary Committee approved bills that improve the \nlegal system for people who want to live and work in the United States. \nThe committee approved a bill that focuses on high-skilled workers that \nare needed in the country, and another bill that improves the legal \nchannels for people who want to work in agriculture. If we want to \nensure that we do not deal with millions of people here illegally in \nthe future, then we have to focus on getting our legal immigration \nsystem in order.\n  Now, I would like to talk about the border bill that was approved by \nthe Committee on Homeland Security. This is a bill I am not ready to \nendorse. Let me explain why.\n  The bill, known as the Border Security Results Act, is not a serious \nand comprehensive approach to border security. While it takes a good \nfirst step in requiring metrics to assess whether the borders are \nsecured, there is nothing that ensures that results are achieved.\n  The bill requires the Department of Homeland Security, within 6 \nmonths of enactment, to develop a strategy on how to secure our \nborders. The strategy includes an assessment of threats along the \nborder. It will take into consideration the coordination of departments \nand the cooperation of foreign countries. The strategy calls for an \nassessment of technology needed. But, it does not actually do anything \nto give agents the resources they need. It does nothing to require \nfencing to be built.\n  After the strategy is submitted to Congress, the Secretary develops \nan implementation plan and provides that to Congress and the Government \nAccountability Office.\n  But like the Senate bill, there is no repercussions if the Secretary \ndoes not actually submit a strategy. And, there is no verification or \napproval of the strategy by Congress. Instead, it relies on this or a \nfuture administration to make promises they will not keep. It relies on \nthem to fulfill the law, but we have seen time and again that they \nthumb their nose at bills we send them. They not only refuse to \nimplement laws they like--such as ObamaCare-- but they will refuse to \ncarry this one out as well.\n  The bill requires the Secretary to develop metrics to measure the \n``effectiveness'' of security at ports and between ports of entry. That \nis a good start. But, there are no consequences if the Secretary does \nnot develop such metrics. The GAO would evaluate the metrics, but \nagain, there is no real consequence if they are flawed metrics. The \nborder still will not be secured.\n  The Secretary then certifies that her department has achieved \n``operational control.'' The definition of ``operational control'' is \nweakened from current law. The bill defines it as a ``condition in \nwhich there is a not lower than 90 percent illegal border crossing \neffectiveness rate, informed by situational awareness, and a \nsignificant reduction in the movement of illicit drugs and other \ncontraband through such areas is being achieved.''\n  The GAO would attest if the certification for operational control is \ntruly done. What if the Secretary never certifies this? What if the GAO \nsays the Secretary's certification is not accurate? If the Department \nfails to achieve control of the border, then they have to issue a \nreport to explain why. Again, it lacks any true accountability for this \nor any future administration to secure the border.\n  Finally, I want to mention one part of the House border bill that is \nmost concerning to me. During committee mark-up, an amendment was \naccepted that would require a plan on the exit tracking system, but \nunfortunately there is no beef to it. Implementation of a biometric \nexit system was a key point when the Senate considered immigration.\n  The Congress has passed several laws that require the executive \nbranch to track the entry and exit of foreign nationals. Those mandates \nhave been ignored. The airline industry has resisted. Instead of \nbuilding upon current law and finding a way to make it happen, the \nHouse bill provides a way out if the exit system is not deemed feasible \nby the Secretary--the same Secretary that has made no progress on the \nsystem.\n  Border security is not only putting manpower and technology along the \nsouthern border. It is also about tracking people that enter this \ncountry. Given that 40 percent of our undocumented population consists \nof visa overstays, we must address this problem immediately.\n  This problem is highlighted by a GAO report that was issued on \nTuesday. GAO found that the Department has lost track of more than 1 \nmillion people. We know they arrived in the United States, but we do \nnot have departure records.\n  By statute, the Department is required to report overstays. They \nclaim they do not report the estimates because of lack of confidence \nthat the data is reliable. After 17 years, the law has been ignored. \nThe government is not sophisticated enough to match incoming and \noutgoing travel records, and that is a serious risk to our national \nsecurity.\n  Over the years, the GAO has highlighted the challenges that the \nDepartment faces in putting the entry and exit system in place. Their \nnew report casts more doubt on the Department's competency.\n  When the Senate passed the immigration bill in June, I was very clear \nin suggesting that the bill would have to be fixed by a conference \ncommittee with the House, if it ever goes to a conference. With the \nexception of the border security bill, the House has presented some \nvaluable ideas.\n  While I want an immigration reform bill sent to the President, I want \nit done right. We can take our time to get it right.\n  Over the August recess, the American people will get their \nopportunity to inform members of Congress how they feel about the \nimmigration proposals on the table.\n  But I can predict what many will say. I know from previous townhall \nmeetings in my State, the people do not want more laws that will go \nignored. They want the laws we have in place to be enforced.\n  We need legislation that upholds American values of hope, freedom and \nopportunity. We need immigration laws in place that welcome law-abiding \nimmigrants to share their entrepreneurial spirit, build better lives \nfor themselves, and help make America a better place for generations to \ncome.\n  But we need legislation that upholds the rule of law and ensures that \nwe do not saddle future generations with the same problems we are faced \nwith today.\n\n[[Page S6102]]\n\n  It is my hope that Congress, over the August break, will listen to \nthe American people and work to enact true reform that achieves real \nresults and makes good on the promises made in Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/31/senate-section/article/S6102-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6102-S6103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I rise again for the 41st time to ask \nmy colleagues to wake up to the threat of climate change. Today I come \nto discuss the serious risks that climate change poses to our energy \nsector.\n  It is no controversial idea that our climate affects our energy \ninfrastructure. In the Northeast, when we think about what causes power \noutages, we naturally think of bad weather. In fact, the American \nSociety of Civil Engineers reports that between 2007 and 2012, weather-\nrelated events were the main cause of electrical outages in the United \nStates.\n  That same report said: ``The average cost of a one-hour power outage \nis just over $1000 for a commercial business,'' just for 1 hour. This \ntakes a serious toll on our economy.\n  A recent Department of Energy report has highlighted how sensitive \nour energy sector is to climate change and to extreme weather.\n  In September 2011, the Department of Energy reports:\n\n       High temperatures and high electricity demand-related \n     loading tripped a transformer and transmission line near \n     Yuma, Arizona, starting a chain of events that led to \n     shutting down the San Onofre nuclear power plant with power \n     lost to the entire San Diego County distribution system, \n     totaling approximately 2.7 million power customers, with \n     outages as long as 12 hours.\n\n  Earlier that summer:\n\n       Consecutive days of triple-digit heat and record drought in \n     Texas resulted in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas \n     declaring power emergencies due to a large number of \n     unplanned power plant outages and at least one power plant \n     reducing its output.\n\n  The report says the Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant in Athens, AL, ``had \nto reduce power output because the temperature of the Tennessee River, \nthe body of water into which the plant discharges, was too high to \ndischarge heated cooling water from the reactor without risking \necological harm to the river.''\n  This happened in 2007, 2010, in 2011, and, in some cases, the power \nproduction was reduced for nearly 2 months. The Department of Energy \nreports that ``the cost of replacement power was estimated at $50 \nmillion.''\n  It is not just power generation, energy exploration has been affected \ntoo. The DOE report explains that last July: ``In the midst of one of \nthe worst droughts in American history, certain companies that extract \nnatural gas and oil via hydraulic fracturing faced higher water costs \nor were denied access to water for six weeks or more in several States, \nincluding Kansas, Texas, Pennsylvania, and North Dakota.''\n  It was a similar story in the fall of 2011:\n\n       Due to extreme drought conditions, the city of Grand \n     Prairie, Texas, became the first municipality to ban the use \n     of city water for hydraulic fracturing. Other local water \n     districts in Texas followed suit by implementing similar \n     restrictions limiting city water use during drought \n     conditions.\n\n  In July of 2011, the report recounts that:\n\n       ExxonMobil's Silvertip pipeline, buried beneath the \n     Yellowstone River in Montana, was torn apart by flood-caused \n     debris, spilling oil into the river and disrupting crude oil \n     transport in the region. The property damage cost was $135 \n     million.\n\n  Senator Vitter, our ranking member on the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, has told us that 18 percent of the Nation's oil supply \npasses through his home State of Louisiana at Port Fourchon. A recent \nGovernment Accountability Office report found that the only access road \nto that port is closed 3\\1/2\\ days a year on average because of \nflooding, effectively shutting down that port. With sea level rise \nclimbing due to climate change, NOAA is now projecting that within 15 \nyears portions of that highway will flood an average of 30 times each \nyear--again shutting down access to that port 30 times a year.\n  Vital infrastructure such as powerplants, power lines, roads, and \npipelines are all designed to stand up to historical weather patterns. \nWhat happens when the weather stops following historical patterns?\n  According to the draft National Climate Assessment:\n\n       U.S. average temperature has increased by about 1.5 degrees \n     Fahrenheit since 1895; more than 80% of this increase has \n     occurred since 1980. The most recent decade was the nation's \n     hottest on record.\n\n  Oceans and other bodies of water are warming right along with the \natmosphere.\n  The seasons are shifting. Research shows that in the last two decades \nthe frost-free season has increased in every region of the contiguous \nUnited States compared to the average between 1901 and 1960.\n  In the Southwest, the record shows the frost-free season has \nincreased 3 weeks and the western wildfire season has expanded by more \nthan 2 months since the 1970s. Precipitation patterns and the \navailability of water are changing throughout the Nation. One study \nconcluded that snow in the western mountains is melting, on average, 1 \nto 4 weeks earlier now compared to the 1950s.\n  The draft National Climate Assessment shows that the amount of rain \nfalling in what we call heavy precipitation events or, more \ncolloquially, downpours is up in every region of the Nation. It is up \n45 percent in the Midwest and 74 percent in the Northeast.\n  Sea level is rising about 8 inches, on average, globally, but in some \nparts of the country it is much higher. NOAA reports that mean waters \noff the Galveston, TX, coast are rising more than 2 feet per century. \nAt Grand Isle, LA, the rate is nearly 3 feet per century.\n  These aren't just projections of what is to come, these are actual \nmeasurements of changes that have already happened or are happening \naround us. The result is that we have an energy infrastructure built \nfor a different climate than the one which now exists and the one which \nis to come. Conditions are only predicted to get worse.\n  The threat to our energy sector from changes in the climate should be \nneither controversial nor partisan. There are a lot of commonsense \nsolutions here. Adapting our infrastructure for climate change is \nsmart, and it will save us from costly repairs.\n  Investing in energy efficiency by reducing the demand for power will \nrelieve pressure on the burdened systems. Investing in a diverse energy \nsector will protect against the unique vulnerabilities of specific \ntypes of power sources.\n  Rhode Island is part of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, \nnicknamed Reggie, along with eight other Northern States. Our region \ncaps carbon emissions and sells permits to powerplants to emit \ngreenhouse gases, which creates economic incentives for both States and \nutilities to invest in energy efficiency and renewable energy \ndevelopment. These efforts also reduce load demand on the region's \nelectrical grid.\n  We are proud of the effort we are making in New England. I know a lot \nof States are working just as hard. I say to my colleagues, our home \nStates are hampered by the inaction in Congress.\n  We have received credible and convincing warnings. We have received \ncompelling calls to act. The overwhelming majority of the scientific \ncommunity recognizes climate change is real and we are causing it.\n  Our national security and intelligence community, our faith leaders, \nmajor American corporations, including the insurance and reinsurance \nindustry and most Americans all agree we need to act. It is time for \nCongress to wake up, do its work to slow the onslaught of climate \nchange, and to prepare for what are now unavoidable, inevitable \neffects. Yet here in Congress we sleepwalk on.\n  This is an issue I know hits home in your home State in very \ndifferent ways than it hits home in my State. But In each of our own \nways, our States are already experiencing the hit from climate change. \nIt is caused by carbon pollution that we are putting into the air, that \nour companies, our smokestacks are launching into the atmosphere. It \nchanges our weather, changes our temperature, changes our seasons, \nchanges our oceans, changes our waterways, changes our weather, and \nchanges our lives.\n  The tragedy is that we sleepwalk on because we are unwilling to \naddress the special interests that are preventing us from taking the \naction that all Americans need. This is the archetypical\n\n[[Page S6103]]\n\nfight between the public good, between an important public security \nissue and a private special interest that is defending itself, that is \ndefending its right to pollute, that is defending its ability to \ncompromise our atmosphere, compromise our health, and compromise our \ngreat oceans and waters. This should be an easy struggle. This should \nbe an easy struggle, but it is not. And it will be a mark of shame on \nthis generation, and it will be a mark of shame on this building that \ngiven the choice between the clear information from the scientists, the \nclear experience of what is happening in all of our States and the \npower of the special interests, we ignored the first and yielded to the \npower of those special interests.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/31/senate-section/article/S6103-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        ``PROTECTING OLDER WORKERS AGAINST DISCRIMINATION ACT''\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Harkin and \nGrassley in reintroducing the Protecting Older Workers Against \nDiscrimination Act. This bipartisan bill seeks to restore crucial \nworker protections that were cast aside by five justices of the Supreme \nCourt in the 2009 case Gross v. FBL Financial, Inc. The bill reaffirms \nthe contributions made by older Americans in the workforce and ensures \nthat employees will be evaluated based on their performance and not by \narbitrary criteria such as age.\n  Congress has long worked to enact civil rights laws to eliminate \ndiscrimination in the workplace. In 1967, Congress passed the Age \nDiscrimination and Employment Act, ADEA, extending protections against \nworkplace discrimination to older workers. We strengthened and codified \nthese protections in the Civil Rights Act of 1991, which passed the \nSenate with an overwhelming, bipartisan vote of 93-5. These statutes \nestablished not only our clear congressional intent, but also a clear \nlegal standard: an employer's decision to fire or demote an employee \nmay not be motivated in whole or in part by the employee's age.\n  However, the Supreme Court's Gross decision unilaterally erased that \nlongstanding standard. A narrow 5-4 majority threw out a jury verdict \nin favor of Jack Gross, a 32-year employee of a major financial \ncompany, who had sued his employer under the ADEA. That jury concluded \nthat age was a motivating factor in the company's decision to demote \nMr. Gross and to reassign a younger, significantly less-qualified \nworker to take his place. But the Supreme Court ignored the fact \nfinder, its own precedent, and congressional intent to overturn the \njury verdict.\n  Five justices shifted the burden from the discriminators to the \ndiscriminated, deciding that workers like Mr. Gross must now prove that \nage was the only motivating factor in a demotion or termination. The \ncourt's decision required workers to essentially introduce a ``smoking \ngun'' in order to prove discrimination. By imposing such high \nstandards, the Court sided with big business and made it easier for \nemployers to discriminate on the basis of age as long as they could \ncloak it with another reason. The Protecting Older Workers Against \nDiscrimination Act rejects the Supreme Court's reasoning in the Gross \ndecision, not only in those cases under the ADEA but also under similar \ncivil rights provisions.\n  The Supreme Court's holding has created uncertainty in our civil \nrights laws, making it incumbent on Congress to clarify our intent and \nthe statutory protections that all hardworking Americans deserve. The \nProtecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act restores the \noriginal intent of the ADEA and three other Federal anti-discrimination \nstatutes. The bill reestablishes Congress' intent that age \ndiscrimination is unlawful even if it is only part of the reason to \ndemote or terminate a worker. It makes it clear that employers cannot \nget away with age discrimination by simply coming up with a reason to \nterminate an employee that sounds less controversial. Under the bill, a \nworker would also be able to introduce any relevant admissible form of \nevidence to show discrimination, whether the evidence is direct or \ncircumstantial.\n  I commend Senator Harkin for his efforts over the past 4 years to \nnegotiate a bipartisan bill to restore the civil rights protections \nthat all Americans deserve in the workplace. I also thank Senator \nGrassley, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, for his \ncommitment to this issue. I once again urge my fellow Senators to join \nthis bipartisan effort and show their commitment to ending age \ndiscrimination in the workplace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/31/senate-section/article/S6103-2", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6103-S6104]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           VOTING RIGHTS ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, nearly 50 years ago, Martin Luther King, \nJr., gave his historic ``I Have a Dream'' speech in front of hundreds \nof thousands of people on the National Mall. At the time, I was \nentering my last year of law school. I was inspired by the March on \nWashington and knew that history was being made before my very eyes. \nThe youngest speaker at the March was a compelling man by the name of \nJohn Lewis. Many spoke of their unyielding support for civil rights \nlegislation, but John Lewis demanded more. He demanded that the civil \nrights bill protect the right of every American to vote free from \ndiscrimination. With his strong and forceful voice, he proclaimed that \n``One man, one vote is the African cry. It is ours too. It must be \nours.''\n  A year and a half later, John Lewis would lead another march across \nthe Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, AL. There, State troopers brutally \nbeat, bloodied, and trampled John Lewis and the group of peaceful \nmarchers he led. Those powerful images from ``Bloody Sunday'' were \ncaptured on television and in vivid photographs, and would become a \ncatalyst for the passage of the Voting Rights Act. When President \nLyndon Johnson signed the act into law several months later, he \nfittingly gave one of the pens to John Lewis.\n  The Voting Rights Act has become the most successful piece of civil \nrights legislation in this Nation's history. It has worked to protect \nthe Constitution's guarantees against racial discrimination in voting \nfor nearly five decades. It has helped minorities of all races overcome \nmajor barriers to participation in the political process, through the \nuse of such devices as poll taxes, intimidation by voting officials, \nregistration and language barriers, and systematic vote dilution.\n  Despite the continuing evidence of racial discrimination in voting \nthat Congress amassed in 2006, the Supreme Court recently issued a \nruling that makes it more difficult to protect all Americans in \nexercising their sacred right to vote. In Shelby County v. Holder, a \nnarrow majority of the Supreme Court held that the coverage formula for \nsection 5 of the Voting Rights Act was unconstitutional. Section 5 \nprovides a remedy for unconstitutional discrimination in voting by \nrequiring certain jurisdictions with a history of discrimination to \n``pre-clear'' all voting changes before they can take effect. This \nremedy is both necessary and important because it stops the \ndiscriminatory voting practice before our fellow Americans' rights are \nviolated. By striking down the coverage formula for section 5, the \nCourt's ruling leaves this effective protection unenforceable.\n  Two weeks ago, I began a bipartisan conversation to restore the \nprotections of the Voting Rights Act when I chaired a hearing before \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee. The hearing included meaningful \ntestimony from John Lewis and Jim Sensenbrenner. Both agreed that \nprotecting the right to vote from discriminatory practices is neither a \nDemocratic issue nor a Republican issue. It is an American issue.\n  At this hearing, Republican City Commissioner Luz Urbaez Weinberg of \nAventura, FL, also testified to the need to restore the protections of \nsection 5 of the Voting Rights Act. She urged Congress to demonstrate a \n``clear and principled commitment to equal voting rights for all \nAmericans regardless of race, language spoken, and to also act swiftly \nto restore the protections.'' Moreover, she made clear that maintaining \nthe Voting Rights Act ``is not a partisan issue. It is a nonpartisan \nissue. It is an issue for all Americans. Whether Republicans or \nDemocrats, all Americans strongly believe in fair and equal electoral \nopportunities.''\n  It is true that America has made a lot of progress since the Voting \nRights Act was first enacted. Nobody denies this. But we are far from \nachieving the dream that Dr. King spoke of on that\n\n[[Page S6104]]\n\nmagnificent day in August of 1963. Although the Supreme Court struck \ndown the coverage formula in the Shelby County case, the Justices \nacknowledged, as they must and as the American people recognize, that \ndiscrimination in voting continues to be a problem. As the Chief \nJustice rightly noted in the majority opinion, ``voting discrimination \nstill exists; no one doubts that.'' The question only remains how best \nto protect Americans against this discrimination.\n  This is an issue on which Republicans and Democrats have always come \ntogether on. Every reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act, including \nits initial passage, has been marked by the overwhelming support of \nlawmakers of both parties. In the last few weeks, I have heard people \nsay that Congress is too gridlocked and will not act on voting rights. \nThat is wrong and it is unsupported by our tradition of leadership on \nthis issue. As my friend Senator Grassley said at the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee voting rights hearing I chaired 2 weeks ago, ``Cynicism and \ndefeatism have never before characterized reauthorization of the Voting \nRights Act.'' Senator Grassley is right. History shows that we have \nreauthorized the act time and again because it is a nonpartisan issue.\n  Those who forecast failure also underestimate what a person like John \nLewis can accomplish. I, for one, would never underestimate John \nLewis's tenacity and ability to bring people together.\n  The Supreme Court's ruling last month was a setback to the cause of \nequality. However, we should see it as a calling for Congress to come \ntogether to meet the voting discrimination which persists with a \nsteadfast resolve. It is up to us to meet this challenge. We must work \ntogether as a Congress--not as Democrats or Republicans, but as \nAmericans--to ensure that we protect against racial discrimination in \nvoting. We can only do that with a strong Voting Rights Act.\n  Earlier today, at the bipartisan and bicameral event marking the 50th \nAnniversary of the March on Washington in Statuary Hall, John Lewis \nsaid, ``We have come a great distance but we are not finished yet.'' I \ncould not agree more. Let us continue to work to protect the \nfundamental right to vote for all Americans.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on an important \nanniversary in our country. In just a few weeks, we will commemorate \nthe 50th anniversary of the famous March on Washington. On August 28, \n1963, we marched. We marched for jobs, for justice, for the economy, \nand for freedom.\n  I remember that march. I was getting ready to go back to school. \nBaltimore was a staging location, and many social workers helped as \nmarchers came down from New York and Pennsylvania. These determined \nindividuals--a diverse group--all with a story and a cause, made up the \nnearly 250,000 people who marched that day. It was an important \ntestament to the power of a collective voice, one in support of equal \nrights and treatment of all. And it was this collective voice that \nhelped lead to the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the Voting \nRights Act.\n  We have had many victories, and made much progress in ensuring \nequality for all. We have elected a Black President to the White House, \npassed the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, repealed DOMA and Don't Ask \nDon't Tell. We have accomplished so much, but we still have so far to \ngo. The fight for civil rights is far from over. Racial, religious and \ngender violence continues in our streets and in our homes. Voters \nrights have been threatened by the recent Supreme Court decision, \nleaving Americans vulnerable to prejudice and intimidation. And so we \nfind ourselves, 50 years later, fighting many of the same fights.\n  We need to reclaim that bill of rights, and not let any court \ndecision take it away from us. They are chopping away at the Voting \nRights Act, but let's change the law if we have to. Let us march for \nour liberties and the people who were there, and said ``ain't I a \nman'', later calling on the words ``ain't I a woman''.\n  So it is important now more than ever to hold that dream of Dr. King \nin our hearts. Let's remember the history that was written here 50 \nyears ago. And just as we marched then, we need to march today. \nTogether we can end injustice. Together we can break down barriers to \nequality, so that all people regardless of race, faith or gender can \nlive in a country that never promised anything less than their \nundeniable rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/31/senate-section/article/S6104-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6104]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              SERVICEMEMBER STUDENT LOAN AFFORDABILITY ACT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we've made a lot of progress over the past \ncouple weeks helping our Nation's students borrow at reasonable costs \nfor their higher education needs. This year alone, students are \nprojected to borrow $21 million in federal student loans. Borrowers \ncurrently carry about $1.1 trillion in student loan debt.\n  Several Federal programs help borrowers having trouble keeping up \nwith student loan debt. Two programs in particular are designed to \nrecognize the sacrifice made by those who serve our country--whether \nit's in the military or through public service.\n  The Servicemember Civil Relief Act protects our servicemembers from \ninterest rates above 6% on all loans--including student loans taken out \npreservice--while they are on active duty. The Public Service Loan \nForgiveness program encourages people to become public servants by \nforgiving student loan debt after 10 years of public service--including \nmilitary service. Under this program borrowers must enroll in a \nqualifying repayment plan and make 10 years of payments while working \nin public service before the loan is forgiven.\n  To be eligible, borrowers with Perkins or Federal Family Education \nLoans must consolidate their loans into a Direct Consolidation Loan to \nbe eligible for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. However, \nthere's an unintended consequence at play here.\n  Once a servicemember consolidates his or her preservice loans to \nqualify for the Loan Forgiveness program, those loans no longer qualify \nfor the 6 percent rate cap under the Servicemember Civil Relief Act. \nThis is because consolidation or refinancing of old debt is considered \na new loan under the Servicemember Civil Relief Act.\n  Unfortunately, this forces servicemembers to choose between the 6 \npercent rate cap now while they are on active duty and enrolling in a \nprogram that will forgive their loans after 10 years of service and \nsteady payments. Furthermore, this quirk in the law prevents \nservicemembers from taking advantage of historically low interest rates \nby refinancing. A lower interest rate could save borrowers thousands of \ndollars over the life of the loan.\n  Congress' intent was to help servicemembers burdened with student \nloan debt, and the Servicemember Civil Relief Act and the Public \nService Loan Forgiveness Programs have done that. But forcing \nservicemembers to give up the rate cap today for a chance to earn loan \nforgiveness in the future is not what Congress intended, and we should \nfix it.\n  This week I introduced the Servicemember Student Loan Affordability \nAct. This bill would allow preservice private or Federal student loan \ndebt to be consolidated or refinanced while retaining the 6 percent \nrate cap. This tweak to the law would allow servicemembers to \nparticipate in both beneficial programs. My bill is supported by the:\n  Center for Responsible Lending, National Consumer Law Center, \nNational Guard Association of the United States, NGAUS, the Retired \nEnlisted Association, TREA, Veterans of Foreign Wars VFW, and Woodstock \nInstitute.\n  We have made substantial progress for students in recent weeks, and \nmore work is ahead as we address the rising student loan debt. This is \na small change to the law, but it will have a big impact on \nservicemembers with large student loan debt. Congress continues to try \nto address the financial challenges facing our nation's middle class, \nworking families, and students. This fix is one of many steps toward \nthat effort.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider a simple solution to help \nservicemembers, and I hope they will support the Servicemember Student \nLoan Affordability Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/31/senate-section/article/S6104-2", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6104-S6105]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DAVID F. VITE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am honored today to pay tribute to my\n\n[[Page S6105]]\n\nfriend David Vite on his retirement from the Illinois Retail Merchants \nAssociation, IRMA. He spent 35 years with the Illinois retailers, \nhelping businesses across the State of Illinois engage with government \nand better serve their communities.\n  David has a long history of service. After serving in the Army, he \nwent to college in Wisconsin and graduated from the University of \nWisconsin at LaCrosse. This must be where he developed his affinity for \nthe Green Bay Packers. In all of the time David spent in Illinois, he \nnever adopted our very own Chicago Bears. He remains to this day a \nloyal Packers fan.\n  Early in his career, David became the Executive Director of the \nWoodstock Chamber of Commerce and oversaw community developments in \nWoodstock, IL. By 1978, David had joined the Illinois Retail Merchants \nAssociation as a field representative. Within 3 years, the Association \nhad promoted him to Vice President of Government Affairs and not long \nafter that, David Vite took over as President.\n  As President, David was determined to help resolve the challenges \nfacing Illinois retailers and at the same time to create opportunities \nfor them. He provided training for his members to help them promote \nsales. He created a school-to-work training program to help cultivate \nthe next generation of retail leaders. He led an effort to publish a \nmanual to help merchants become more environmentally friendly. And \nthroughout his tenure, he was the voice for business as Illinois \npolicymakers addressed dilemmas in unemployment insurance, worker's \ncompensation, and sales taxes.\n  I can't thank David enough for the support he helped build across \nIllinois for the Marketplace Fairness Act. I am proud to say that in \nMay, the Senate passed this bill by a vote of 69-27, helping to level \nthe playing field for retailers in Illinois and across the country. \nWith David's help, we were able to communicate with retailers in every \ncorner of Illinois to better understand the need and urgency for tax \nfairness legislation.\n  I would like to thank David for his leadership and many contributions \nover his decades of work with communities and business. Illinois retail \nhas been lucky to have had such a strong, good-willed advocate. I wish \nhim the very best in his retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/31/senate-section/article/S6105-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6105]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CLEAN CRUISE SHIP ACT OF 2013\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, last week, I introduced the Clean Cruise \nShip Act to limit the dumping of wastewater by cruise ships.\n  Cruise ships generate millions of gallons of wastewater every day, \nand currently these ships can dump their waste directly into the oceans \nwith minimal oversight.\n  The Clean Cruise Ship Act would require these ships to obtain permits \nthrough EPA's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System to be \nable to discharge sewage, graywater, and bilge water.\n  It also would require cruise ships to upgrade their wastewater \ntreatment systems to meet the standards of today's best available \ntechnology. This technology significantly reduces the pollutants that \nships discharge and is already being used successfully on some cruise \nships.\n  The problem is real. The number of cruise ship passengers has been \ngrowing nearly twice as fast as any other mode of travel.\n  In the U.S. alone, cruise lines carried over 10 million passengers in \n2011, with some ships carrying 8,000 passengers or more.\n  These ships produce massive amounts of waste: one ship can produce \nover 200,000 gallons, or 10 backyard swimming pools, of sewage each \nweek; a million gallons of graywater from kitchens, laundry, and \nshowers; and over 25,000 gallons of oily bilge water that collects in \nship bottoms.\n  I have nothing against cruise vacations. They can be a wonderful way \nto visit many beautiful places.\n  In fact, it is because these ships sail often into these beautiful, \nsensitive environments that we need to be particularly careful of the \npollution they release into those waters.\n  Here is the unpleasant reality. Within 3 miles of shore, vessels can \ndischarge wastewater from toilets and showers into the ocean provided \nthat a ``marine sanitation device'' is installed.\n  However, a 2008 report released by the Environmental Protection \nAgency concluded that these systems simply do not work.\n  The devices allow ships to discharge waste that consistently exceeds \nnational effluent standards for fecal coliform and other pathogens and \npollutants.\n  In fact, fecal coliform levels in effluent are typically 20 to 200 \ntimes greater than in untreated domestic wastewater.\n  While cruise ships must obtain permits to discharge graywater within \n3 miles of the coast, graywater should not go directly into the sea.\n  Graywater from sinks, tubs, and kitchens contain large amounts of \npathogens and pollutants.\n  Fecal coliform concentrations, for example, are 10 to 1,000 times \ngreater than those in untreated domestic wastewater.\n  These pollutants sicken our marine ecosystems, wash up onto our \nbeaches, and contaminate food and shellfish that end up on our dinner \nplates.\n  Even worse, beyond 3 miles from shore there are no restrictions on \nsewage or graywater discharge. Cruise ships can actually dump raw \nsewage directly into U.S. waters.\n  The Clean Cruise Ship Act seeks to address these practices.\n  No discharges would be allowed within 12 miles of shore.\n  Beyond 12 miles from shore, discharges of sewage, graywater, and \nbilge water would be allowed, provided that they meet national effluent \nlimits consistent with the best available technology. That technology \nworks and is commercially available now.\n  Under this legislation, the release of raw, untreated sewage would be \nbanned. No dumping of sewage sludge and incinerator ash would be \nallowed in U.S. waters.\n  All cruise ships calling on U.S. ports would have to dispose of \nhazardous waste in accordance with the Resource Conservation and \nRecovery Act.\n  The bill would establish inspection and enforcement mechanisms to \nensure compliance.\n  The protection of U.S. waters is vital to our nation's health and \neconomy. The oceans support the life of nearly 50 percent of all \nspecies on Earth.\n  Some cruise ship companies already are trying to improve their \nenvironmental footprint. They also want to preserve the environment--it \nis the natural beauty of the sea that attracts their passengers.\n  But the efforts between cruise ship companies are not uniform. A \nfederal standard would apply one set of requirements to all companies.\n  It is time to bring the cruise ship industry into the 21st century. \nIt is time to update the laws that protect our oceans and urge adoption \nof the best available wastewater treatment technology at sea.\n  Working together, we can support the industry while protecting the \nnatural treasures that are our oceans. The approach taken in the Clean \nCruise Ship Act will move us toward that goal.\n  I encourage my colleagues here in the Senate to work with me to pass \nlegislation that will put a stop to the dumping of hazardous pollutants \nalong our coasts. Together we can clean up this major source of \npollution that is harming our waters.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/31/senate-section/article/S6105-2", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6105-S6106]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING DR.

He was \n     a practicing physician for 61 years. He was one of the first \n     graduates from Caney Creek College, now known as Alice Lloyd \n     College in Pippa Passes, KY. After graduating from the \n     University of Kentucky, Phi Beta Kappa, in 1942, he enlisted \n     in the United States Navy and served as a first lieutenant \n     aboard the U.S.S. Weeden, serving in both the Atlantic and \n     Pacific campaigns of World War II.\n       Upon his honorable discharge, he was selected as one of the \n     first recipients of the Rural Kentucky Medical Scholarship \n     Fund, and entered and graduated from the University of \n     Louisville School of Medicine in 1949. Following his medical \n     internship, he extended his service to our country by \n     volunteering for the Korean War, serving as a medical officer \n     at the Louisville, KY, recruiting station. At the time of his \n     discharge on July 6th, 1951, he opened his first medical \n     practice 10 days later in Beattyville, KY. In 1962, he left \n     Beattyville temporarily to practice in the field of radiology \n     working at Morehead Hospital, Woodford County Hospital, and \n     the Lexington Clinic. In June 1974, he returned to \n     Beattyville as a general practitioner--his true love and \n     passion--faithfully serving the patients he loved for the \n     next 38 years until the age of 90.\n       He was a member of the Masonic Proctor Lodge 213 and the \n     Lee County Shrine Club, VFW Post 11296, and the Kentucky \n     Medical Association. He served as the Medical Director of the \n     Lee County Constant Care and Geri Young House and a member of \n     the Lee County Board of Health. Dr. Smith is survived by his \n     wife, Patty, of 54 years; sons John S. (Vivian) of \n     Beattyville, KY, Robert of Versailles, KY, William (Kim) of \n     Arlington, VA, Sparkman, Daniel (Jo, Martha), Giletta, and \n     John A., all of Lexington, KY; one brother, Luther \n     (Rosemary), Beattyville, KY; two sisters, Janet (Glenn) \n     Moore, Scottsburg, IN, and Joan Tilford, Falls of Rough, KY; \n     17 grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren.\n       Visitation will be Wednesday, June 19th from 6 to 8 p.m. \n     and Thursday, June 20th from 10 to 11 a.m. at Saint Thomas \n     Episcopal Church in Beattyville. Funeral services will be \n     Thursday, June 20th at 11 a.m. also at Saint Thomas Episcopal \n     Church with The Reverend Bryant Kibler officiating. Burial \n     will follow at the Lexington Cemetery, Lexington, KY.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/31/senate-section/article/S6106-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6106-S6108]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 SYRIA\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as we prepare to head out for the August \nrecess, I have returned to the floor today to speak, once again, about \nthe horrific and worsening situation in Syria--a conflict that, we \nlearned this week, has now claimed 100,000 lives.\n  I would like to take a few minutes to read from a remarkable \nstatement that was delivered on Monday by Mr. Paulo Pinheiro, the chair \nof the United Nations Independent International Commission of Inquiry \non Syria. The excerpts I wish to read are long, but they are shocking, \nand worth quoting in full.\n  Here is the assessment Mr. Pinheiro gave to the U.N., and I quote:\n\n       Syria is in free-fall. Relentless shelling has killed \n     thousands of civilians and displaced the populations of \n     entire towns. An untold number of men and women have \n     disappeared while passing through the ubiquitous checkpoints. \n     Those freed from detention are living with the physical and \n     mental scars of torture. Hospitals have been bombarded, \n     leaving the sick and wounded to languish without care. With \n     the destruction of thousands of schools, a generation of \n     children now struggle to obtain an education. The country has \n     become a battlefield. Its civilians are repeatedly victims of \n     acts of terror.\n\n  Mr. Pinheiro concludes with this powerful plea for action:\n\n       That civilians should come under such sustained unlawful \n     attacks should shock your conscience and spur you to action. \n     But it has not. As the conflict drags on, you--and the \n     world--have become accustomed to levels of violence that were \n     previously unthinkable . . .\n       It is time for the international community to act \n     decisively. There are no easy choices. To evade choice, \n     however, is to countenance the continuation of this war and \n     its many violations . . . The world must hear the cry of the \n     people--stop the violence, put an end to this carnage, halt \n     the destruction of the great country of Syria!\n\n  Again, this is not my assessment; it is that of a senior United \nNations leader. And I applaud Mr. Pinheiro for his moral leadership on \nbehalf of the Syrian people. At the same time, I say with the utmost \nrespect that I disagree with Mr. Pinheiro's counsel for what is \nrequired to achieve the goal we share, which is to create conditions \nthat favor a negotiated end to the conflict in Syria. I continue to \nbelieve that, while there is not a purely military solution to the \nconflict in Syria, I find it difficult to avoid the conclusion that \nmilitary intervention by the United States and our allies must be a \ncritical part of the solution we seek. Indeed it is unrealistic to \nthink we can arrive at a diplomatic solution otherwise.\n  Let's be absolutely clear about the realities in Syria today and \nwhere this conflict is headed. Asad is never going to negotiate himself \nout of power or seek to end the conflict diplomatically so long as he \nbelieves he is winning on the battlefield, and right now, he clearly \nhas the advantage on the ground. This is thanks, in critical part, to \nhis air power, which not only allows Asad to pound opposition military \npositions and civilian populations--including with chemical weapons, \nwhich nearly everyone believes he has used and will use again--but also \nto move his troops and supplies around the battlefield in ways that he \ncannot do on the ground.\n  Asad's growing military advantage is also thanks to the influx of \nthousands of Hezbollah fighters who are leading offensives in key parts \nof the country, Iranian special forces who are training and advising \nAsad's troops and private militias, Shia militants from Iraq and \nLebanon, as well as a steady and decisive flow of weapons and other \nassistance from Iran and Russia, which is being brought into Syria with \nimpunity, including through overflights of Iraq.\n  The consequences of this onslaught for Syria are bad enough. The \nstrategically vital city of Homs is expected to fall imminently, which \nwould be a major victory for Asad that would strengthen his position \nimmeasurably. The consequences for the region, however, are arguably \nworse. Syria's main export today is its civilian population, which is \nflooding into Turkey, Lebanon, and Jordan, by the hundreds of \nthousands. Indeed, 15 percent of Jordan's population is now Syrian \nrefugees, and the fourth largest city in the country is now a Syria \nrefugee camp.\n  At the same time, Syria's primary import today seems to be foreign \nextremists from all across the region and indeed the world. It is well \nknown from estimates in published reports that as many as several \nthousand people from all across the Middle East have moved into Syria \nto fight with Al Qaeda and other extremist groups. But, in addition, \nthe New York Times reported this week that Western counterterrorism and \nintelligence officials now believe that hundreds of Muslims from \nWestern countries have joined the fight in Syria, including 140 French, \n75 Spaniards, 60 Germans, a few dozen Canadians and Australians, as \nwell as fighters from Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, \nItaly, Norway, Sweden, and the Netherlands. As many as a dozen \nAmericans are believed to be among them. It is difficult to conclude \nthat Al Qaeda does not enjoy safe haven in Syria today, and no one \nshould believe that it won't be used eventually to launch attacks \nagainst us.\n  Make no mistake, this is where we are headed. Syria is becoming a \nfailed state in the heart of the Middle East and a safe haven for Al \nQaeda and its allies. It is becoming a regional and sectarian conflict \nthat threatens the national security interests of the United States. \nAnd it is becoming the decisive battleground on which Iran and its \nallies are defying the United\n\n[[Page S6107]]\n\nStates and our allies and prevailing in a test of wills, which is \nfundamentally undermining America's credibility among both our friends \nand enemies throughout the region and the world.\n  Some may see this as an acceptable outcome. I do not.\n  I know Americans are war weary. I know the situation in Syria is \ncomplex, and there are no easy answers. That said, all of us must ask \nourselves one basic question: Are the costs, and risks, and potential \nbenefits associated with our current course of action better or worse \nthan those associated with America becoming more involved militarily in \nSyria? I believe our current course of action is worse, because it \nvirtually guarantees all of the bad outcomes that are unfolding before \nour eyes and getting worse and worse the longer this conflict grinds \non.\n  Now, some would have us believe that military action of even a \nlimited nature is too cost intensive, too high risk, and too marginal \nin its potential impact in Syria. In a letter dated July 19, 2013, to \nthe chairman of the Armed Services Committee and myself, the Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff, GEN Martin Dempsey, described the \nrequirements to conduct various military options in Syria. He spoke of \nscenarios that would demand hundreds of military assets and thousands \nof special forces to resource military options that no one is seriously \nconsidering.\n  Now, in my many years, I have seen a lot of military commanders \noverstate what is needed to conduct military action for one reason or \nanother. But rarely have I seen an effort as disingenuous and \nexaggerated as what General Dempsey proposed.\n  The option that many of us have proposed is limited standoff strikes \nto degrade Asad's air power and ballistic missile capability. But here \nis General Dempsey's description of what would be needed to conduct \n``limited standoff strikes'':\n\n       Potential targets include high-value regime air defense, \n     air, ground, missile, and naval forces as well as the \n     supporting military facilities and command nodes. Stand-off \n     air and missile systems could be used to strike hundreds of \n     targets at a tempo of our choosing. Force requirements would \n     include hundreds of aircraft, ships, submarines, and other \n     enablers. Depending on duration, the costs would be in the \n     billions.\n\n  This is a completely disingenuous description of both the problem and \nthe solution. No one is seriously talking about striking Asad's naval \nforces as part of a limited campaign. And no one seriously thinks that \ndegrading Asad's air power would require hundreds of American military \nassets. The whole thing is completely misleading to the Congress and \nthe American people, and it is shameful.\n  For a serious accounting of a realistic limited military option in \nSyria, I would strongly recommend a new study that is being released \ntoday by the Institute for the Study of War, or ISW, which was overseen \nby GEN Jack Keane, the author of the surge strategy that enabled us to \nturn around the war in Iraq. This new study confirms what I and many \nothers have long argued: That it is militarily feasible for the United \nStates and our friends and allies to significantly degrade Asad's air \npower at relatively low cost, low risk to our personnel, and in very \nshort order--and to do so, I want to stress, without putting any U.S. \nboots on the ground.\n  Specifically, the ISW study reports that Asad's forces are only \nflying a maximum of 100 operational strike aircraft at present, an \nestimate that ISW concedes is likely very generous to the Asad regime. \nThe real figure, they maintain, is more likely around 50. What is more, \nthese aircraft are only being flown out of 6 primary airfields, with an \nadditional 12 secondary airfields playing a supporting role. What this \nmeans is that the real-world military problem of how to significantly \ndegrade Asad's air power is very manageable--again, as I and others \nhave maintained.\n  ISW calculates that U.S. and allied forces could significantly \ndegrade Asad's air power using standoff weapons that would not require \none of our pilots to enter Syrian airspace or confront one Syrian air \ndefense system. With a limited number of these precision strikes \nagainst each of Asad's eight primary airfields, we could crater their \nrunways, destroy their fuel and maintenance capabilities, knock out key \ncommand and control, and destroy a significant portion of their \naircraft on the ground. The ISW study estimates that this limited \nintervention could be achieved in 1 day and would involve a total of 3 \nNavy surface ships and 24 strike aircraft, each deploying a limited \nnumber of precision-guided munitions--all fired from outside of Syria, \nwithout ever confronting Syrian air defenses.\n  This should not come as a surprise. After all, hitting static targets \nfrom a distance is what the U.S. military does best. And hitting static \ntargets in Syria, without ever confronting Syrian air defenses inside \nof Syrian airspace, is something that our Israeli allies now seem to \nhave done on several occasions. Surely we can too.\n  There are other things we should do in conjunction with targeted \nstrikes against Asad's air power. We could expand the list of targets \nto include Asad's ballistic missiles, as well as key regime command-\nand-control sites. This would be an equally minimal number of targets \nthat could be hit with the same standoff weapons. We should also stand \nup a far larger train-and-equip operation than what published reports \nsuggest has been authorized to date. What all of the Syrian opposition \nleaders have told me their forces need most of all is antitank weapons \nthat can destroy Asad's artillery and armor, which would remain a major \nthreat even if we significantly degrade Asad's air power. We should \ngive the Syrian opposition these kinds of capabilities to level the \nplaying field themselves.\n  If we were to do all of these things--degrade Asad's air power and \nballistic missiles and train, equip and advise the opposition on a \nlarge scale--it probably would not end the conflict in Syria \nimmediately. But it could turn the tide of battle against Asad's forces \nand in favor of the opposition, and begin to create conditions on the \nground that could make a negotiated end to the conflict possible.\n  We cannot afford to lose the moral dimension from our foreign policy. \nIf ever a case should remind us of this, it is Syria. Leon Wieseltier \ncaptured this point powerfully in The New Republic last month. His \nwords are as true today as they were then, and I quote:\n\n       The slaughter is unceasing. But the debate about American \n     intervention is increasingly conducted in ``realist'' terms: \n     the threat to American interests posed by jihadism in Syria, \n     the intrigues of Iran and Hezbollah, the rattling of Israel, \n     the ruination of Jordan and Lebanon and Iraq. Those are all \n     good reasons for the president of the United States to act \n     like the president of the United States. But wouldn't the \n     prevention of ethnic cleansing and genocidal war be reason \n     enough? Is the death of scores and even hundreds of \n     thousands, and the displacement of millions, less significant \n     for American policy, and less quickening? The moral dimension \n     must be restored to our deliberations, the moral sting, or \n     else Obama, for all his talk about conscience, will have \n     presided over a terrible mutilation of American discourse: \n     the severance of conscience from action.\n\n  We have had these debates before. In Bosnia, and later in Kosovo, we \nheard many arguments against military intervention that we now hear \nabout Syria. It was said that there was no international consensus for \naction, that the situation on the ground was messy and confused, that \nit was not clear who we would actually be helping, and that our \ninvolvement could actually make matters worse. Fortunately, we had a \nPresident who led--who explained to the American people what the stakes \nwere in the Balkans, and why we needed to rise to the role that only \nAmerica could play. Here is how President Bill Clinton described Bosnia \nin 1995:\n\n       There are times and places where our leadership can mean \n     the difference between peace and war, and where we can defend \n     our fundamental values as a people and serve our most basic, \n     strategic interests. [T]here are still times when America and \n     America alone can and should make the difference for peace.\n\n  Nearly two decades ago, I worked with both my Democratic and \nRepublican colleagues in Congress to support President Clinton as he \nled America to do the right thing in stopping mass atrocities in \nBosnia. The question for another President today, and for all of my \ncolleagues in this body, indeed for all Americans, is whether we will \nonce again answer the desperate pleas for rescue that are made uniquely \nto us, as the United States of America.\n\n[[Page S6108]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/31/senate-section/article/S6108-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6108]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 REMEMBERING COLONEL GEORGE ``BUD'' DAY\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to take time today to honor \nthe life of a very brave man, and an exemplary Iowan, Col. George \n``Bud'' Day, who passed away over the weekend.\n  Bud Day's brave and memorable military career started at the age of \n17, when he volunteered for the Marine Corps during World War II in \nSioux City, IA.\n  After this period of service, Bud returned home, and received a law \ndegree from the University of South Dakota.\n  His military service to this country, however, would resume.\n  Bud Day joined the Air National Guard in 1950 and was called up for \nactive duty a year later during the Korean War.\n  By 1955 he had become a captain with the Air Force.\n  With the same go-getter attitude he displayed throughout his service, \nthen Captain Day went on to command a squadron of F-100s in Vietnam in \n1967.\n  On August 26, Bud's plane was hit and took a steep dive. Upon \nejection he sustained many injuries.\n  Shortly after the crash, Bud was taken prisoner and tortured.\n  Maintaining his unflagging spirit and fueled by his love for his \ncountry, Bud Day refused to cooperate and escaped his captors. \nSurviving treacherous conditions and life-threatening situations every \nminute, Bud spent 2 weeks trying to find U.S. troops.\n  His efforts left him exhausted and he was later recaptured and \nreturned to the same camp he had escaped from.\n  He was then moved to the infamous ``Hanoi Hilton'' camp where torture \nwas commonplace for the next 5 years of his life until his release in \n1973.\n  Even after all of this, Bud Day resumed his service with the U.S. Air \nForce, and was appointed vice commander of the 33rd Tactical Fighter \nWing at Eglin Air Force Base, FL.\n  Three years after his release from the Hanoi Hilton, Bud received the \nMedal of Honor from President Gerald Ford for not divulging information \nin the face of torture, thereby putting his own life in imminent risk \nto save others.\n  He has also received numerous other awards and recognitions such as \nthe Air Force Cross for extraordinary heroism in military operations \nagainst an opposing armed force as a POW, making him one of America's \nmost decorated servicemen.\n  Bud Day remained public spirited even after his military service, \ncontinuing to advocate for veterans and other causes that were \nimportant to him.\n  His life of service is a tremendous role model for future generations \nand he will be missed.\n  I am proud to have been able to call Bud Day an Iowan and a friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/31/senate-section/article/S6108-2", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6108]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. CHIESA.

Mr. President, on April 16, 2013 President Ma Ying-jeiou of \nTaiwan gave a speech on a videoconference with Center on Democracy, \nDevelopment and the Rule of Law at Stanford University. I feel my \ncolleagues could benefit from reading this speech. I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record President Ma Ying-jeiou's speech.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                           I. Opening Remarks\n\n       Professor Rice, Professor Diamond, Professor Fukuyama, \n     Admiral Roughead, distinguished guests, faculty members and \n     students of Stanford University, ladies and gentlemen: Good \n     evening! It's your evening now, but it's our morning here in \n     Taipei.\n       Before I start, I want to pay my deep condolences to those \n     victims suffered by the explosions happened at Boston \n     Marathon on Monday. My prayers and thoughts are with their \n     family members. In the meantime, I also strongly condemn the \n     violence on behalf of the government of the Republic of China \n     (Taiwan).\n       It is a great pleasure to be addressing my friends at \n     Stanford University this evening. Stanford University has \n     long been a distinguished center of learning. Under the \n     guidance of Professor Diamond, the Center on Democracy, \n     Development, and the Rule of Law, through the Journal of \n     Democracy, has made incomparable contributions to the study \n     of democracy. Since Taiwan represents a shining example of \n     how democracy can take root in the Chinese-speaking world, it \n     is only fitting to join you today for this videoconference.\n\n\n                        II. Changes in East Asia\n\n       Since I took office as President of the Republic of China \n     in 2008, the geopolitical situation in East Asia has \n     undergone tremendous change. Five years ago, there were two \n     flash points: the Korean Peninsula and the Taiwan Straits. \n     Today, the Korean Peninsula is at an unprecedented level of \n     tension: North Korea has conducted a third nuclear test \n     explosion, and in the aftermath of the resulting UN sanctions \n     continues its saber rattling, even claiming that it has \n     abrogated the 1953 Armistice Agreement that ended Korean War \n     fighting 60 years ago. In contrast, tensions in the Taiwan \n     Straits have been greatly reduced, and relations between \n     Taiwan and mainland China continue to advance toward peace \n     and prosperity.\n       This does not necessarily mean, however, that only one \n     potential source of instability remains in East Asia. \n     Geopolitical competition in both the East China Sea and the \n     South China Sea is growing more intense even as the drive \n     toward regional economic integration continues. In addition, \n     three of the major players in East Asia--mainland China, \n     South Korea and Japan--have changed leadership in the last \n     eight months, while here in Taiwan, I was elected to a second \n     term of office early last year.\n       Thus, amidst the uncertainty resulting from such changes, \n     the Republic of China on Taiwan remains firmly committed to \n     fostering peace and stability, and is a strong proponent of \n     the liberal values cherished by democracies worldwide. It is \n     against this backdrop that I would like to discuss how my \n     administration has steered Taiwan through this sea of change.\n\n\n            III. How Cross-Strait rapprochement was achieved\n\n       I decided to seek rapprochement with mainland China long \n     before I took office in 2008. To ensure peace in the Taiwan \n     Straits after some sixty tumultuous years, my administration \n     had to meet both the challenges of establishing mutual trust \n     between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits and of rebuilding \n     Taiwan's strength so that peace could be guaranteed.\n       From the start, the ``92 Consensus'' was a critical \n     anchoring point for Taiwan and mainland China to find common \n     ground on the otherwise intractable issue of ``One China.'' \n     The consensus, reached between the two sides in 1992, \n     established a common understanding of ``one China with \n     respective interpretations.'' With this understanding as the \n     foundation, my administration designed a number of modus \n     operandi that broadly defined how Taiwan would pursue peace \n     and prosperity with mainland China. These included iteration \n     of the ``Three No's''--``No Unification, No Independence, and \n     No Use of Force''--under the framework of the ROC \n     Constitution. This formulation, grounded de jure in the 1947 \n     Constitution of the Republic of China, sets clear parameters \n     for how both parties can work to move the relationship \n     forward in a positive direction without misunderstandings or \n     hidden agenda, so as to build mutual trust and achieve mutual \n     benefit for the people on either side of the Taiwan Straits.\n\n[[Page S6109]]\n\n       ``Beating swords into ploughshares'' requires pragmatism \n     and the wisdom to remain focused on what can be accomplished \n     in spite of past differences. So we then called for ``mutual \n     non-recognition of sovereignty, mutual non-denial of \n     governing authority'' allowing both sides to pursue \n     substantive exchanges without being derailed by disagreements \n     over sovereignty issues.\n       We also spelled out clearly to the other side, as well as \n     to the Taiwan public, how we intended to proceed with the \n     cross-strait dialogue. The priority of issues for the two \n     sides to address would be ``pressing matters before less \n     pressing ones, easy matters before difficult ones, and \n     economic matters before political ones''. My administration \n     firmly believed in setting a clear agenda from the start, to \n     prevent the cross-strait dialogue being bogged down by \n     intractable issues when we could see that agreement might be \n     found on many others. The goal is to build mutual trust which \n     is fundamental for long-term progress in developing a \n     peaceful cross-strait relationship. I firmly believe that \n     this ``building-blocks'' approach is the only way to achieve \n     lasting peace in the Taiwan Straits.\n       The result of this is 18 agreements concluded between \n     Taiwan and mainland China over the past five years, covering \n     such issues as direct flights, tourism, economic cooperation, \n     intellectual property rights, nuclear safety, and mutual \n     judicial assistance. Let me just give you an example of how \n     things stand now. Five years ago, there were no scheduled \n     flights between Taiwan and the mainland, now there are 616 \n     scheduled flights per week. Five years ago, there were \n     274,000 mainland people visiting Taiwan, in 2012, there were \n     2.5 million people. When the SARS epidemic first broke out in \n     2003, mainland China completely ignored Taiwan's needs and \n     concerns. But when the H7N9 avian flu struck recently, public \n     health experts from both sides began working together to \n     check its spread.\n       Over the next three years, the two sides are expected to \n     complete negotiations on trade in services and trade in goods \n     under the 2010 Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement \n     (ECFA). Both sides will also greatly expand the level of \n     educational and cultural exchanges. For example, the number \n     of students from mainland China studying in Taiwan, which \n     currently is 17,000 a year, is expected to rise and there \n     will be more cross-strait cultural cooperation. Each side \n     also intends to set up offices in major cities on the other \n     side to take better care of the 7 million people and over 160 \n     billion US dollars' worth of goods and services moving across \n     the Taiwan Straits last year alone. As a result, cross-strait \n     relations are now the most stable and peaceful that they have \n     been in over 60 years.\n\n\n              IV. Taiwan's Enhanced International Presence\n\n       As cross-strait relations continue to develop peacefully, \n     Taiwan is gaining an enhanced international presence. The \n     clear parameter articulated by my administration as we began \n     resumption of the cross-strait dialogue counter any mistaken \n     attempt to link Taiwan's greater international participation \n     to an agenda of ``two Chinas'', ``one China, one Taiwan'', or \n     ``Taiwan Independence''. Taiwan today strives to conduct \n     itself as a responsible stakeholder, that is, as a \n     facilitator of peace, a provider of humanitarian aid, a \n     promoter of cultural exchanges, a creator of new technology \n     and business opportunity, and the standard bearer of Chinese \n     culture.\n       The international community has seen recently how Taiwan \n     deports itself as a responsible stakeholder and facilitator \n     of peace. Last August, my administration proposed an East \n     China Sea Peace Initiative urging that negotiation take \n     precedence over confrontation regarding the sovereignty \n     dispute over the Diaoyutai Islets. The following November, \n     Taipei and Tokyo began negotiations on an East China Sea \n     fishery agreement. Sixteen rounds of such talks had been held \n     since 1996 but no agreement was ever reached. This time, both \n     sides decided to jointly conserve and manage fishery \n     resources in the Agreement Area of the East China Sea, \n     without changing their respective territorial and maritime \n     claims regarding the Diaoyutai Islets. A fishery agreement \n     was thus signed six days ago which safeguards the security of \n     fishing boats from both sides in the Agreement Area twice the \n     size of Taiwan. This agreement marks a historic milestone in \n     the development of Taiwan-Japan relations and sets a good \n     example for how the concerned parties can find ways to settle \n     their disputes and preserve peace and stability in the region \n     at the same time.\n       Our efforts over the past five years to enhance Taiwan's \n     participation in the international community have also \n     resulted in concrete progress. The Republic of China has kept \n     intact its diplomatic relations with its 23 allies, and has \n     enhanced its substantive relations with other countries. For \n     instance, we signed an investment agreement with Japan in \n     2011, and are working to sign economic cooperation agreements \n     with Singapore and New Zealand respectively in the near \n     future. Meanwhile, our health minister has attended the World \n     Health Assembly (WHA) of the WHO as an official observer \n     since 2009, the same year as Taiwan acceded to the Government \n     Procurement Agreement (GPA) of the WTO. For five years in a \n     row, former Vice President Lien Chan at my request has \n     attended as ``leader's representative'' the Leaders' Meeting \n     of Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC). On March 19 \n     this year I led an official delegation to attend the \n     investiture of Pope Francis, the first time for a ROC \n     president to meet with a Pope in the last 71 years ever since \n     the two countries established diplomatic ties in 1942. \n     Taiwan's enhanced international presence attests to a \n     virtuous cycle of improved cross-strait relations that \n     encourages greater international support for allowing Taiwan \n     further opportunities to play its role of responsible \n     stakeholder. This in turn further enhances regional peace and \n     stability, which is in the best interest of the international \n     community.\n\n\n          V. Taiwan-US Ties: Security, Economic, and Cultural\n\n       My administration is fully aware that strength is \n     fundamental to achieving peace. When I took office five years \n     ago, my administration worked promptly to restore high-level \n     trust between Taipei and Washington. As former Secretary of \n     State Hillary Clinton said in 2011 in Honolulu, Hawaii, \n     Taiwan is an important security and economic partner of the \n     United States. We deeply appreciate the relationship we have \n     with the United States, including US arms sales to Taiwan. \n     Only with a sufficient self-defense capability can Taiwan \n     confidently engage in a dialogue with mainland China. The \n     stability engendered by America's enhanced presence in the \n     Western Pacific will certainly help.\n       The United States is Taiwan's third largest trading partner \n     but remains the most important source of our technology. \n     However large a trading partner mainland China is to Taiwan, \n     the United States has always been an important trade and \n     investment partner to Taiwan. The ICT (information and \n     communication technology) industries are Taiwan's most \n     important export sector and they are the largest recipient of \n     U.S. investment. After successfully resolving the beef import \n     issue last year, the Republic of China resumed trade \n     negotiations with the U.S. under the 1994 Taiwan-US Trade and \n     Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA). Obviously, Taiwan \n     needs to accelerate its pace of trade liberalization. For the \n     good of its economic prosperity and national security, Taiwan \n     cannot afford to be left out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership \n     (TPP) and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership \n     (RCEP).\n       Culturally, American values and its high academic standards \n     have attracted Chinese students since Yung Wing became the \n     first Chinese student to study in the U.S. back in 1847. \n     Generations of Chinese students who studied in the United \n     States brought American values back to their homeland, making \n     tremendous contributions to China's modernization, including \n     the 1911 revolution. Today, the United States still remains \n     the most sought after academic destination for Taiwan \n     students.\n       Taiwan is grateful to the United States for letting Taiwan \n     join the Visa Waiver Program beginning in November last year. \n     The Republic of China is the 37th nation in the world to \n     secure that status, and the only one that does not have \n     formal diplomatic relations with the United States. The more \n     than 400,000 Taiwan visitors to the U.S. each year not only \n     take in American culture and natural scenery, they also shop \n     very seriously in the United States and thus help reduce the \n     U.S. trade deficit with Taiwan. In a word, relations between \n     the Republic of China and the United States continue to \n     thrive and grow since the end of formal diplomatic ties in \n     1979.\n       Nevertheless, Taiwan still faces many challenges with only \n     limited resources at its disposal. In formulating Taiwan's \n     national security strategy, my administration has steered \n     Taiwan toward a tripartite national security framework. The \n     first part involves institutionalization of the rapprochement \n     with mainland China so that neither side would ever \n     contemplate resorting to non-peaceful means to settle their \n     differences. The second part involves making Taiwan a model \n     world citizen by upholding the principles of a liberal \n     democracy, championing free trade and providing foreign aid \n     to the international community. The third part involves \n     strengthening national defense capability. This national \n     security strategy is formulated to facilitate peaceful and \n     positive development of cross-strait ties while remaining \n     grounded in pragmatic realization of the challenges we face. \n     In other words, Taiwan and the United States share the same \n     values and interests in preserving regional peace and \n     stability.\n\n\n           VI. Taiwan's Ultimate Value: A Beacon of Democracy\n\n       States in a security partnership frequently fear being \n     entrapped or abandoned by their partners. In the past, some \n     in the United States have expressed concern that as mainland \n     China rises, Taiwan might someday entrap the United States in \n     an unnecessary conflict with mainland China. Others fear that \n     Taiwan is tilting toward mainland China, thus ``abandoning'' \n     the United States. Both arguments imply that the United \n     States should reduce support for Taiwan. But neither view is \n     warranted. My administration's pursuit of rapprochement with \n     mainland China has clearly helped preserve and enhance peace \n     in the Taiwan Straits. My administration's adherence to the \n     Constitution of the Republic of China legally rules out any \n     possibility of a reckless change in the status quo.\n       Taiwan has so much in common with the United States, from \n     our love of democracy,\n\n[[Page S6110]]\n\n     to respect for human rights and the rule of law, to support \n     for free trade, and even to an intense passion for basketball \n     and baseball! We are also crazy about Jeremy Lin and Jianmin \n     Wang! Taiwan cherishes its longstanding friendship with the \n     United States and will always cherish the values and culture \n     that the Chinese people have developed over five thousand \n     years. Preserving the Republic of China has immense \n     importance that goes far beyond the borders of Taiwan. For \n     the first time in Chinese history, we in Taiwan have proved \n     that democracy can thrive in a Chinese society. It presents \n     shining ray of hope to the 1.3 billion Chinese people on the \n     mainland. I know how much this means to the government and \n     people of the United States, just as it does to my \n     administration and the people of Taiwan.\n       Ladies and gentlemen, my administration will steer this \n     democracy through the sea of change in East Asia. We will \n     endeavor to strengthen peace and prosperity in the Taiwan \n     Straits; and, in the meantime, we will strive for an enhanced \n     international presence for Taiwan that allows it to play its \n     role as a responsible stakeholder in the international \n     community. I feel nothing but confidence about the future of \n     the Republic of China!\n       Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/31/senate-section/article/S6110-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6110]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL F. ADAMS\n\n Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to \nthe career of Dr. Michael F. Adams, who stepped down as president of \nthe University of Georgia on June 30 after 16 years of dedicated \nservice to our State university.\n  Dr. Adams became president on June 11, 1997, and he immediately began \nhis work to make the University of Georgia one of the Nation's top \npublic research universities. Under his leadership, UGA has excelled \ntremendously and student quality has risen steadily. He is one of \nAmerica's best known and longest serving university presidents.\n  Dr. Adams' dedication to improving the university's facilities and \ninfrastructure is evident upon visiting the campus. He secured over $1 \nbillion in new construction programs through his foundation of the UGA \nReal Estate Foundation. The university has undergone incredible \nrenovations and now boasts the nation's most state-of-the-art \nfacilities. Adams has overseen the construction of the East Campus \nVillage, the Georgia Museum of Art, the Tate Student Center and the \nRichard B. Russell Special Collections Library. His commitment to \nproviding students with the best learning environment is apparent \nthroughout the highly impressive and ever-improving campus.\n  Under Adams' leadership, the University of Georgia has achieved the \nhighest rankings in its history, with the U.S. News and World Report \nranking UGA in its top 20 public research universities for 8 out of the \npast 10 years. Student enrollment has grown from 29,000 to 35,000 \nstudents. UGA has become more selective and student quality is at its \nbest. Adams oversaw the establishment of five new colleges and schools, \nincreasing the diversity of academic programs and fields of study. \nWhile the university continued to excel academically, the Georgia \nBulldogs' rich tradition of athletics flourished as well, with 27 \nnational championship titles, 58 SEC Titles, and 125 individual titles.\n  It comes as no surprise Adams has received over 50 awards in higher \neducation throughout his time with the university, including the Knight \nFoundation Award for Presidential Leadership, the Pioneer Award for \nLeadership in Civil Rights, and the James T. Rogers Award, the highest \nhonor bestowed by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. He \nhas also been listed as one of Georgia Trend magazine's Most \nInfluential Georgians for 11 years in a row.\n  I am honored to have attended the University of Georgia and grateful \nfor all that President Adams has done to make it the educational \nstandard that it is today. I thank him for his service to the \nUniversity of Georgia and to our great State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/31/senate-section/article/S6110-2", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6110]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING REV. CAESAR CAVIGLIA\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I wish to offer a tribute honoring \nthe life and work of Father Caesar Caviglia. Father Caviglia was a \ndedicated community leader from my home State of Nevada who passed away \nthis week. He touched the lives of countless Nevadans and will be long \nremembered for his compassion, faith, and service to his church and \ncommunity.\n  Father Caviglia was a lifelong Nevadan who spent more than half a \ncentury as a minister and educator. Throughout his life, he served in \nvarious capacities across the entire State. He was born in Ely, NV in \n1928, and returned to the Silver State after being ordained and earning \nmultiple degrees in philosophy, theology and education. He was a \ncommitted educator who spent time teaching at Bishop Manogue Catholic \nHigh School and the University of Nevada, Reno before moving to the \nsouthern part of the State to serve as the superintendent of Nevada \nState Catholic Schools.\n  Father ``C,'' as he was known by his parishioners, spent much of his \nministry serving as the parish priest at St. Peter's Catholic Church in \nHenderson, NV. Throughout his time there, he took on a variety of \nleadership roles and was active in advocating for important issues \naffecting those he served. He was a member of the faculty at the \nHenderson Campus of the College of Southern Nevada, where he taught \nsociology, anthropology and philosophy. He played a key role in the \nconstruction of that campus, and one of its academic buildings is named \nin his honor. He returned to Ely to begin his retirement, but soon \nafter, he resumed his role of service as the administrator at Sacred \nHeart Catholic Church, where he served until 2008.\n  Father Caviglia spent a lifetime devoted to serving his community and \nserves as an example to us all. I ask my colleagues to join me in \nremembering Father Caesar Caviglia, and offer my deepest condolences to \nhis family and parishioners as they mourn the loss of this great \nNevadan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/31/senate-section/article/S6110-3", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6110]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO ALAYNA ACKERMAN\n\n Mr. THUNE.

Buell captured the \nNational Championship by pole vaulting 14 feet, 7.25 inches on June 7, \n2013 at Hayward Field in Eugene, OR.\n  Bethany Buell has had a terrific season for the USD Coyote's, earning \nAll-American honors before ultimately capturing the D-I NCAA National \nChampionship. Buell's record-breaking season was almost cut short after \ntearing ligaments in her shoulder after setting the highest national \nmark of 14 feet, 7.5 inches on March 29th. Buell returned from injury \nto compete on May 9th at the Summit League Championships. Buell was \nalso named the NCAA Division I Outdoor Field Scholar Athlete of the \nYear by the U.S. Track and Field/Cross Country Coaches Association.\n  Bethany Buell is a redshirt junior from Rockwood Summit High School, \nin St. Louis, MO. Bethany, the daughter of Bill and Kerry Buell, is \ncurrently majoring in psychology with a minor in anthropology. Buell's \ncareer at USD has been record-breaking; as a true freshman, Bethany won \nthe pole vault at the GWC Indoor Championships and broke the school \nrecord in the event twice. In 2011, Buell became the first USD Coyote \nto qualify for the NCAA D-I National Championships, where she would \nfinish 13th and earn 2nd team All-America honors. In 2012, Bethany \ncontinued her ascent as one of the Nation's top pole vaulters becoming \nthe first Coyote to earn All-American First-Team honors.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the Sioux \nFalls Orpheum Theater Center's 100th Anniversary. Opening their doors \nin 1913, The Orpheum Theater Center was built to serve the City of \nSioux Falls as a venue for theatrical presentations. Over the past 100 \nyears, the Orpheum Theater has grown to become a cherished location for \nSouth Dakotans to enjoy quality entertainment.\n  The Orpheum Theater was built for the Solari Brothers and opened on \nOctober 3, 1913, as a vaudeville house and seated 1,000 audience \nmembers. Tickets for the opening night were sold for $5 each and acts \nincluded features such as ``An Evening in Honolulu,'' two different \ncomedy acts, and the Orpheum Concert Orchestra.\n  In 1919, the theater was sold to a major theater management firm. It \nremained as a vaudeville house until 1927, when it was sold and became \na second run and B movie theater. It was not until the Sioux Empire \nCommunity Playhouse purchased the building in 1954 that it was restored \nto its original theater space.\n  The City of Sioux Falls purchased the Orpheum and neighboring \nbuildings in 2002 and has since named the entire facility The Orpheum \nTheater Center.\n  The Orpheum Theater Center has provided quality entertainment to many \ngenerations of South Dakotans. It attracts over 100,000 visitors each \nyear with events that include plays, concerts, community events, and \nprivate events. Known for its superb acoustics, it is the oldest \ntheater in\n\n[[Page S6112]]\n\nSioux Falls. In 1983, the Orpheum Theater was added to the National \nRegister of Historic Places.\n  I am honored to congratulate the Sioux Falls Orpheum Theater Center \non their 100th Anniversary and wish them another 100 years of \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/31/senate-section/article/S6112-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6112]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO ADAM TIMMERMAN\n\n Mr. THUNE.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Utah urging the United States Congress to pass \n     S. 336 and H.R. 684, the Marketplace Fairness Act; to the \n     Committee on Finance.\n\n                      House Joint Resolution No. 4\n\n       Whereas, the Supreme Court of the United States held in \n     Quill v. North Dakota, 504 U.S. 298 (1992) that the \n     ``dormant'' or ``negative'' Commerce Clause of the \n     Constitution of the United States prohibits a state from \n     requiring a retailer to collect and remit sales tax on sales \n     to consumers in the state unless the retailer has physical \n     presence in the state;\n       Whereas, the Supreme Court further held ``that the \n     underlying issue is not only one that Congress may be better \n     qualified to resolve, but also one that Congress has the \n     ultimate power to resolve'';\n       Whereas, the sales tax, as applied to consumer purchases, \n     can be a transparent tax levied by state and local \n     governments;\n       Whereas, the sales tax is, from the individual consumer's \n     perspective, one of the simplest taxes imposed by state and \n     local governments;\n       Whereas, a complex aspect of sales taxation, from the \n     individual consumer's perspective, is the requirement to pay \n     ``use'' tax directly to the state or locality when sales tax \n     is not collected by the retailer;\n       Whereas, the electronic commerce industry needs to be left \n     free from government interference, and any argument in favor \n     of taxing sales on the Internet is problematic in light of \n     constitutional provisions regarding interstate commerce and \n     interstate compacts;\n       Whereas, because there are over 9,600 state and local \n     taxing jurisdictions in the United States, each with unique \n     and changing definitions, rules, and holidays, the sales tax \n     is, from a remote seller's perspective, one of the most \n     complex and costly taxes imposed by state and local \n     governments;\n       Whereas, consumption taxes can be used to achieve \n     competitiveness;\n       Whereas, the sales tax has been a stable source of state \n     and local revenue and provides some level of certainty for \n     states and localities;\n       Whereas, some proposed federal legislation authorizing \n     states to require all retailers whose sales to consumers in \n     those states exceed a minimum threshold to collect sales \n     taxes has garnered support from some businesses and \n     organizations;\n       Whereas, despite the progress states have made in \n     simplifying state sales tax collection for remote sellers, \n     there remain some inequities between the burden of tax \n     collection obligations imposed upon sellers with physical \n     presence and the burdens those same obligations would impose \n     on remote sellers serving consumers in multiple states \n     without physical presence;\n       Whereas, any federal legislation should be fair to both in-\n     state and remote sellers, whether such legislation requires \n     sales and use taxes to be collected on a point-of-sale or \n     point-of-delivery basis; and\n       Whereas, the state of Utah has adopted or supports, and \n     Congress is considering, the following items in federal \n     legislation:\n       1. State-provided or state-certified tax collection and \n     remittance software that is simple to implement and maintain, \n     and paid for by states;\n       2. Immunity from civil lawsuits for retailers utilizing \n     state-provided or state-certified software in tax collection \n     and remittance;\n\n[[Page S6113]]\n\n       3. Tax audit accountability to a single state tax audit \n     authority;\n       4. Elimination of interstate tax complexity by streamlining \n     taxable good categories;\n       5. Adoption of a meaningful small business exception so \n     that small, remote seller businesses are not adversely \n     affected; and\n       6. Fair compensation to the tax-collecting retailer, taking \n     into account such elements as the exchange fees retailers are \n     charged for consumer credit card transactions, which fees \n     apply equally to any state taxes collected on the purchase of \n     goods sold as well as the actual purchase amount;\n       Whereas, the Marketplace Fairness Act, currently introduced \n     in the United States Senate as S. 336 and the United States \n     House of Representatives as H.R. 684, helps level the playing \n     field between remote sellers and main street sellers by \n     requiring larger remote sales to collect the same sales and \n     use taxes that the brick and mortar stores in Utah already \n     collect;\n       Whereas, in Quill Corp. v. North Dakota (1992), the Supreme \n     Court of the United States indicated that Congress has the \n     ability to resolve this sales tax collection inequity between \n     remote sellers and brick and mortar sellers;\n       Whereas, the Marketplace Fairness Act will provide states \n     with the authority to require remote sellers to collect and \n     remit the sales tax due if the state is willing to make \n     significant simplifications for sellers;\n       Whereas, Utah has already shown the way by adopting all the \n     simplifications and uniformity standards required in the \n     Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement;\n       Whereas, these simplifications, along with the ease of \n     reporting through recent technological advances, have removed \n     the obstacles to remote sellers collecting sales taxes just \n     like any other retailer;\n       Whereas, this is evidenced by the fact that over 1,800 \n     sellers have voluntarily registered to collect the taxes in \n     the states, including Utah, that have conformed their laws to \n     the requirements of the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax \n     Agreement;\n       Whereas, there is an urgent need to pass this long overdue \n     legislation to level the playing field for all retailers;\n       Whereas, the legislation is about fairness, simplification, \n     and stemming the erosion of state sales tax systems;\n       Whereas, that both houses of Congress have agreed on the \n     approach and legislative language indicates there is a \n     readiness to take this important step to safeguard state \n     sales tax systems;\n       Whereas, although purchasers still owe a corresponding use \n     tax on taxable purchases from remote retailers, most \n     individuals are either not aware of this requirement or \n     choose to ignore it;\n       Whereas, while the Internet was essentially unknown to \n     consumers in 1992, the loophole identified in the Quill Corp. \n     v. North Dakota decision points out the competitive advantage \n     online and mail order merchants have over traditional brick \n     and mortar stores that are required to collect and remit \n     sales tax from their customers; and\n       Whereas, no compelling reason exists for government to \n     continue to give remote sales retailers a competitive \n     advantage over in-state merchants who live and work in a \n     community, hire employees, and pay taxes;\n       Whereas, the United States Congress should act now so \n     businesses compete on the basis of price and service, not on \n     the ability of one form or retailer to avoid collecting \n     taxes;\n       Whereas, the Marketplace Fairness Act would give states the \n     authority to require remote sellers with more than $1 million \n     in total remote sales in the preceding calendar year to \n     collect their state's sales and use tax on sales to \n     customers; and\n       Whereas, the Marketplace Fairness Act identifies minimum \n     simplification requirements a state must enact before it can \n     require remote sellers to collect its sales and use taxes, \n     making it easier for the remote sellers to comply with the \n     laws of multiple states: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah urges \n     Congress to enact S. 336 and H.R. 684 to authorize states, \n     consistent with this resolution and principles of taxation \n     espoused by national associations of legislators and \n     governors, and subject to the enactment of any necessary \n     state laws, to establish true fairness in state tax \n     collection for both retailers having physical presence in a \n     state and retailers who are remote sellers; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah, having \n     addressed the principles of fairness outlined in this \n     resolution, urges Congress to require all retailers whose \n     sales to consumers exceed a minimum threshold to collect and \n     remit applicable sales taxes on sales in the state; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be sent to the \n     members of the United States House of Representatives and to \n     the members of the United States Senate.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-91. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Utah urging the United States \n     Congress to repeal portions of the Patient Protection and \n     Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education \n     Reconciliation Act; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                            House Resolution\n\n       Whereas, sections 9010 and 10905 of the Patient Protection \n     and Affordable Care Act, and section 1406 of the Health Care \n     and Education Reconciliation Act, impose an unprecedented new \n     tax on health insurance that numerous policy experts agree \n     will be passed on to individuals, working families, small \n     employers, and senior citizens, contradicting a primary goal \n     of health reform by making care more expensive;\n       Whereas, the health insurance tax will cause premiums on \n     the individual market to rise an average of $2,150 for \n     individuals and $5,080 for families nationally over 10 years \n     and will increase premiums for families over $4,305 over 10 \n     years;\n       Whereas, the health insurance tax will impact small \n     employers over the next 10 years, reducing private sector \n     jobs by 125,000;\n       Whereas, 59% of these lost jobs will come from small \n     businesses;\n       Whereas, potential sales will be reduced by at least $18 \n     billion, 50% of which will come from small businesses;\n       Whereas, in the state of Utah, premiums for small employers \n     will increase by an average of $2,173 per employer over 10 \n     years and premiums for large employers will increase by an \n     average of $2,400 over 10 years;\n       Whereas, the health insurance tax will impact Medicare \n     Advantage beneficiaries in the state of Utah by costing an \n     average of $2,926 in additional premiums and reduced benefits \n     over 10 years;\n       Whereas, the health insurance tax will impact Medicaid \n     beneficiaries in the state of Utah enrolled in a coordinated \n     care program by costing an average of $1,506 over 10 years, \n     putting pressure on already strained state budgets, \n     decreasing benefits, and potentially creating coverage \n     disruption; and\n       Whereas, higher premiums are a disincentive for everyone to \n     obtain insurance coverage, particularly younger, healthier \n     people who are likely to drop their policy if it becomes too \n     expensive, further eroding the risk pool and making coverage \n     less affordable: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the state of \n     Utah strongly urges the United States Congress to enact \n     legislation to repeal the health insurance tax, sections 9010 \n     and 10905 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, \n     and section 1406 of the Health Care and Education \n     Reconciliation Act, to make health care more affordable for \n     working families, individuals, and businesses; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be sent to the \n     President of the United States, the Majority Leader of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives, and the members of Utah's congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-92.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania supporting those peaceful \n     political actions that will result in the final reunification \n     of Ireland; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 53\n\n       Whereas, Ireland and its people comprise an ancient and \n     distinct island nation, and the people of Ireland have a \n     right and the responsibility to govern themselves; and\n       Whereas, Human and civil rights derive ``their just powers \n     from the consent of the governed'' and are best guaranteed by \n     people freely elected by democratic means to an independent \n     government; and\n       Whereas, The logic of history, international law, human \n     rights and peaceful political actions dictate the \n     reunification of the island of Ireland, and the reality of \n     the moment in the Peace Process, the Good Friday Agreement, \n     the Desolved Assembly and the development of the All-Ireland \n     institutions of governance attest to this momentum; and\n       Whereas, In the past, the General Assembly adopted the \n     MacBride Principles for Northern Ireland and strongly \n     endorsed passage of the Good Friday Agreement among the \n     parties, in part because of the dedication and bipartisan \n     support of three separate presidents of the United States, in \n     seeing the Good Friday Agreement to fruition and formation of \n     the Assembly; and\n\n[[Page S6114]]\n\n       Whereas, The contributions of the Irish born and Irish \n     Americans to the United States of America and this \n     Commonwealth are legion; and\n       Whereas, The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is home to a \n     significant percentage of Americans whose ancestors migrated \n     in times of famine and war to seek a better life, but in \n     whose hearts still desire peace and unification for their \n     ancestral home: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate of Pennsylvania strongly support \n     a United Ireland by supporting those peaceful political \n     actions that will result in the final reunification of \n     Ireland; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be forwarded to \n     the President and Vice President of the United States; the \n     United States Secretary of State; all members of the \n     Pennsylvania Congressional Delegation; the Governor of \n     Pennsylvania; and the Taoiseach and President of Ireland; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be forwarded to \n     the United States Ambassador to Ireland, who shall be urged \n     to transmit a copy to the United States Ambassador to Great \n     Britain and to Great Britain's Ambassador to the United \n     States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-94. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of California memorializing the Congress and the \n     President of the United States to observe the California Week \n     of Remembrance for the Armenian Genocide by participating in \n     the Armenian Genocide Commemorative Project; to the Committee \n     on Foreign Relations.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 2\n\n       Whereas, The Armenian Genocide of 1915-1923 was the first \n     genocide of the 20th century, in which 1.5 million men, \n     women, and children lost their lives at the hands of the \n     Turkish Ottoman Empire in their attempt to systematically \n     eliminate the Armenian race; and\n       Whereas, In their 3,000 year historic homeland in Asia \n     Minor, Armenians were subjected to severe and unjust \n     persecution and brutality by the Turkish rulers of the \n     Ottoman Empire before and after the turn of the 20th century, \n     including widespread acts of destruction and murder during \n     the period from 1894 to 1896, inclusive, and again in 1909; \n     and\n       Whereas, The massacre of the Armenians constituted one of \n     the most atrocious violations of human rights in the history \n     of the world; and\n       Whereas, Adolph Hitler, in persuading his army commanders \n     that the merciless persecution and killing of Jews, Poles, \n     and other people would bring no retribution, declared, ``Who, \n     after all, speaks today of the annihilation of the \n     Armenians?''; and\n       Whereas, Unlike other people and governments that have \n     admitted and denounced the abuses and crimes of predecessor \n     regimes, and despite the overwhelming proof of genocidal \n     intent, the Republic of Turkey has inexplicably and adamantly \n     denied the occurrence of the crimes against humanity \n     committed by the Ottoman and Young Turk rulers, and those \n     denials compound the grief of the few remaining survivors of \n     the atrocities, desecrate the memory of the victims, and \n     cause continuing pain to the descendants of the victims; and\n       Whereas, Leaders of nations with strategic, commercial, and \n     cultural ties to the Republic of Turkey should be reminded of \n     their duty to encourage Turkish officials to cease efforts to \n     distort facts and deny the history of events surrounding the \n     Armenian Genocide; and\n       Whereas, The determination of those who continue to speak \n     the truth about the Armenian Genocide is tested to this day \n     with some of these speakers of truth being silenced by \n     violent means; and\n       Whereas, The accelerated level and scope of denial and \n     revisionism, coupled with the passage of time and the fact \n     that very few survivors remain who can serve as reminders of \n     indescribable brutality and tormented lives, compel a sense \n     of urgency in efforts to solidify recognition of historical \n     truth; and\n       Whereas, By consistently remembering and forcefully \n     condemning the atrocities committed against the Armenians, \n     and honoring the survivors as well as other victims of \n     similar heinous conduct, we guard against repetition of such \n     acts of genocide and provide the American public with a \n     greater understanding of its heritage; and\n       Whereas, This measure would provide that the Legislature \n     deplores the persistent, ongoing efforts by any person in \n     this country or abroad to deny the historical fact of the \n     Armenian Genocide; and\n       Whereas, California is home to the largest Armenian-\n     American population in the United States, and Armenians \n     living in California have enriched our state through their \n     leadership in business, agriculture, academia, government, \n     and the arts; and\n       Whereas, The State of California has been at the forefront \n     of encouraging and promoting a curriculum relating to human \n     rights and genocide in order to empower future generations to \n     prevent recurrence of the crime of genocide: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and the Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the State of California commends \n     its conscientious educators who teach about human rights and \n     genocide; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the State of California \n     hereby designates the week of April 18 to 24, 2013, as \n     ``California Week of Remembrance for the Armenian Genocide of \n     1915-1923''; and be it further\n       Resolved, That California commemorates California Week of \n     Remembrance for the Armenian Genocide through the Armenian \n     Genocide Commemorative Project; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the State of California respectfully calls \n     upon the Congress and the President of the United States to \n     act likewise and to formally and consistently recognize and \n     reaffirm the historical truth that the atrocities committed \n     against the Armenian people constituted genocide; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature calls upon the Republic of \n     Turkey to acknowledge the facts of the Armenian Genocide and \n     to work toward a just resolution; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, Members of the United States Congress, \n     the Governor, and the Turkish Ambassador to the United \n     States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-95.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Michigan urging careful review of the proposed underground \n     nuclear waste repository in Ontario, Canada, and \n     memorializing the United States Congress to do all it can to \n     see that Michigan's concerns are fully addressed; to the \n     Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 58\n\n       Whereas, Ontario Power Generation is proposing to construct \n     an underground, long-term burial facility for all of \n     Ontario's low- and intermediate-level radioactive waste at \n     the Bruce Nuclear Generating Station, some of which is long-\n     lived intermediate waste. This site, less than a mile inland \n     from the shore of Lake Huron and about 440 yards below the \n     lake level, is approximately 120 miles upstream from the main \n     drinking water intakes for Southeast Michigan; and\n       Whereas, Lake Huron and the other Great Lakes are \n     critically-important resources to both the United States and \n     Canada. The Great Lakes contain 95 percent of North America's \n     surface fresh water and provide drinking water to tens of \n     millions of people. Pristine water is important to fishing, \n     boating, recreation, tourism, and agriculture in Michigan and \n     throughout the region. Agriculture, commercial and sport \n     fisheries, shipping, recreation, and tourism are important \n     components of the Great Lakes economy. This proposal to place \n     a permanent nuclear waste burial facility so close to the \n     Great Lakes raises serious concerns; and\n       Whereas, As part of an effort to protect water quality, \n     Michigan's siting criteria for the disposal of low-level \n     radioactive waste prohibits any site located within ten miles \n     of Lake Michigan, Lake Superior, Lake Huron, Lake Erie, the \n     Saint Mary's River, the Detroit River, the St. Clair River, \n     or Lake St. Clair. It also excludes sites located within a\n\n[[Page S6115]]\n\n     500-year floodplain, located over a sole source aquifer, or \n     located where the hydrogeology beneath the site discharges \n     groundwater to the land surface within 3,000 feet of the \n     boundaries of the site. We encourage Canada to consider \n     similar siting criteria; and\n       Whereas, International agreements between the United States \n     and Canada state that radiological contamination should be \n     reduced and emphasize the concept of prevention. We encourage \n     Canada, as part of its public review process, to make known \n     the steps that have been or will be taken to fulfill the \n     requirements of these agreements; and\n       Whereas, Siting an underground nuclear waste repository in \n     limestone, as proposed by Ontario Power Generation, is the \n     first of its kind. The environmental impact statement for \n     this proposed nuclear waste burial facility noted that the \n     acceptability of an alternative site was ``unknown.'' We \n     encourage the use of sound scientific principles and analyses \n     in determining whether this geologic formation is appropriate \n     for the safe long-term storage of radioactive waste and that \n     before making any further approvals of this proposed \n     facility, this scientific data, along with information \n     regarding the alternative sites that were considered, be made \n     available; and\n       Whereas, Given the proximity and potential impact to many \n     Michigan residents, we urge Canadian and Ontario officials, \n     along with all relevant governmental agencies, to ensure open \n     communication and information sharing with Michigan citizens \n     about this proposal and to possibly consider extending the \n     public comment period: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we urge Canadian officials to \n     thoroughly review the proposed underground nuclear waste \n     repository in Ontario, Canada, including the issues raised \n     herein, and we memorialize the United States Congress to do \n     all it can to see that Michigan's concerns are fully \n     addressed; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the Prime Minister of Canada, the Premier of Ontario, the \n     President of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission, the \n     Chairman of the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission, \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-97.

Kennedy \n     authorized a detachment from the 4400th Combat Crew Training \n     Squadron to deploy to South Vietnam as Project Farm Gate;\n       Whereas, Operation Mule Train, begun in January 1962, was \n     designed to drop supplies to isolated outposts and transport \n     parachutists into areas controlled by the Vietcong;\n       Whereas, at the request of South Vietnam's President, the \n     United States Air Force was directed to spray the Vietnamese \n     countryside with an aerial herbicide that would strip the \n     jungles of all foliage and eliminate the cover and available \n     food for the North Vietnamese;\n       Whereas, this action, named Operation Ranch Hand, began in \n     1962;\n       Whereas, arguments in Washington erupted on whether the \n     spraying actually did any good, or whether the Americans and \n     the South Vietnamese governments were risking the loyalty of \n     the South Vietnamese people whose livelihoods were also at \n     risk;\n       Whereas, President Kennedy allowed the spraying, but only \n     under limited conditions and as long as crops were not \n     damaged;\n       Whereas, the planes that dropped the herbicide were \n     modified to carry and spray the defoliants to only attack \n     areas of the jungle where combatants could hide, but by 1971 \n     the policy had changed and even crops were sprayed;\n       Whereas, the operation continued for nine years and \n     affected 36% of the mangrove forest and 20% of the jungles of \n     South Vietnam;\n       Whereas, this operation began the controversy over the \n     effects of the defoliant Agent Orange on humans, which \n     continues today;\n       Whereas, in August 1964, two U.S. destroyers, the USS \n     Turner Joy and the USS Maddox, were performing surveillance \n     patrols in conjunction with the South Vietnamese Navy along \n     the North Vietnamese coast in the Gulf of Tonkin;\n       Whereas, North Vietnam claimed a 12-mile territorial zone \n     off its coastline, but the United States only recognized a 3-\n     mile border and allowed its ships to sail within 11 miles of \n     the coast;\n       Whereas, when ships would come into range, the North \n     Vietnamese radar sites on shore would activate and the South \n     Vietnamese Navy would then harass the installations with \n     gunfire;\n       Whereas, in retaliation, the North Vietnamese Navy sent out \n     several torpedo boats on an attack, which proved \n     unsuccessful;\n       Whereas, when President Lyndon B. Johnson received \n     notification of the incident, he ordered the first American \n     air strikes against North Vietnamese naval bases;\n       Whereas, a few days later, Congress passed the Gulf of \n     Tonkin Resolution, which gave President Johnson the authority \n     to increase America's involvement in Vietnam;\n       Whereas, in February 1965, President Johnson ordered a \n     series of reprisal air strikes after several attacks on U.S. \n     bases by Vietcong units;\n       Whereas, a series of paved and unpaved roads, rivers, and \n     sometimes narrow footpaths through dense jungle, commonly \n     referred to as the Ho Chi Minh Trail, were being utilized by \n     the North Vietnamese and Vietcong armies to smuggle supplies \n     and troops back and forth from North and South Vietnam;\n       Whereas, this intricate transportation system stretched \n     throughout the mountains along the Vietnamese-Laos-Cambodia \n     borders and was a large problem for the South Vietnamese and \n     U.S. forces;\n       Whereas, cutting off the Ho Chi Minh Trail, often called \n     the ``Secret War,'' was controversial because it often \n     entailed constant air strikes to areas in Laos and Cambodia, \n     which were neutral countries, and these tactics were not \n     known to most Americans;\n       Whereas, after several attacks upon United States Air Force \n     bases, 3,500 United States Marines were dispatched to South \n     Vietnam on March 8, 1965;\n       Whereas, this marked the beginning of the American ground \n     war, and public opinion at the time overwhelmingly supported \n     the deployment;\n       Whereas, the initial deployment of 3,500 Marines increased \n     to nearly 200,000 American military personnel by December of \n     1965;\n       Whereas, that same month, South Vietnamese forces suffered \n     heavy losses in a battle that both sides viewed as a \n     watershed, and American leaders responded by developing plans \n     for U.S. troops to move from a defensive strategy to an \n     offensive approach to the escalating war;\n       Whereas, the bombing campaigns that began in 1964, which \n     were intended to force North Vietnam to cease its support for \n     the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam, \n     escalated significantly by the end of 1966;\n       Whereas, where ground combat was sometimes made complicated \n     by unconventional military opposition and difficult terrain, \n     U.S. air superiority remained constant, and throughout the \n     Vietnam War, various policies and strategies were put in \n     place by the U.S. military to take advantage of that \n     strength;\n       Whereas, over the course of the conflict, U.S. forces \n     dropped over 7 million tons of bombs through Southeast Asia, \n     compared to only about 2 million tons dropped during all of \n     World War II;\n       Whereas, geared towards suppressing the Pathet Lao's \n     Communist guerrillas in Northern Laos, Operation Barrel Roll, \n     a heavily covert operation, was initiated to provide air \n     support for the Royal Laotian Army, and included the first \n     bombings in Laos in support of the war against North Vietnam;\n       Whereas, another interdiction effort, Operation Steel \n     Tiger, was aimed at destroying the North Vietnamese flow of \n     supplies and troops along the Ho Chi Minh Trail and involved \n     heavy covert bombing in Southeastern Laos;\n       Whereas, Operation Tiger Hound, initiated in support of \n     both Barrel Roll and Steel Tiger, focused solely on \n     disrupting movement along the Ho Chi Minh Trail on the lower \n     portion of the Laotian panhandle and was initiated by the \n     South Vietnamese Air Force and by United States Air Force \n     units based in South Vietnam;\n       Whereas, what was expected to be the usual two-day cease-\n     fire in observance of Tet Nguyen Dan, the lunar New Year and \n     the most important Vietnamese holiday, became an opportunity \n     for the North Vietnamese Army and Vietcong to strike;\n       Whereas, this large, well-coordinated surprise campaign on \n     cities and U.S. targets throughout South Vietnam, named the \n     Tet Offensive, was North Vietnam's attempt to end the war in \n     one swift blow;\n       Whereas, the morning of January 31, 1968, saw many \n     provincial capitals and cities such as Saigon and Hue under \n     siege from large numbers of Communist fighters who had \n     apparently infiltrated the South in the months and weeks \n     leading up to the planned offensive;\n       Whereas, U.S. and South Vietnamese forces, initially \n     unprepared and overwhelmed, countered many of the attacks, \n     and eventually gained back control by early March of all \n     areas where the Vietcong were entrenched;\n       Whereas, in the aftermath, many cities and towns in South \n     Vietnam were devastated, with thousands of casualties \n     sustained by forces and civilians in the South;\n       Whereas, the Tet Offensive was evidence of North Vietnam's \n     ability to stage a large-scale attack;\n       Whereas, this turning point in the war would lead to a \n     change in approach by political and military leadership, and \n     change the way many in the United States viewed the war from \n     home;\n       Whereas, the first major bombing campaign on North \n     Vietnamese territory, Operation Rolling Thunder was intended \n     to place heavy military pressure on the North Vietnamese \n     leaders and reduce their ability and\n\n[[Page S6116]]\n\n     desire to wage war against the U.S.-supported South \n     Vietnamese government;\n       Whereas, from 1965 to 1968, about 643,000 tons of bombs \n     were dropped on North Vietnam;\n       Whereas, leading up to the Tet Offensive, widespread \n     protests and demonstrations against U.S. involvement and the \n     continued loss of American lives were already taking place in \n     the United States;\n       Whereas, beginning in 1964, these protests and \n     demonstrations led to a polarization of Americans, with one \n     side continuing to support America's role in Southeast Asia \n     and the other preaching peace and the end to U.S. operations \n     in the region;\n       Whereas, although most demonstrations were peaceful, some \n     were highlighted by violence and, whether instigated by \n     protestors or police, these confrontational events often \n     received more attention than the war itself;\n       Whereas, the North Vietnamese-led Tet Offensive in early \n     1968 brought a new wave of criticism from the American public \n     as images of those events shocked many across the nation;\n       Whereas, with many news outlets publicizing the horrors \n     encountered in South Vietnam during that period, as well as \n     the depiction of the attack on the American Embassy in \n     Saigon, many Americans questioned the ability of the United \n     States to resolve the conflict by use of military \n     intervention and the validity of previous reports of \n     successful operations in the region;\n       Whereas, Operation Menu was a highly secretive bombing \n     campaign of Communist-supported supply bases in Cambodia that \n     the North Vietnamese used in aiding attacks on South Vietnam;\n       Whereas, these controversial B-52 bombing raids in neutral \n     Cambodia, authorized by President Richard Nixon, continued \n     until 1973 when information about those raids was leaked and \n     the devastation to the region was exposed;\n       Whereas, public protests increased, and on May 4, 1970, the \n     Ohio National Guard fired on Kent State University students, \n     killing four students, during a protest against President \n     Nixon for sending American troops into Cambodia;\n       Whereas, the killings resulted in a nationwide student \n     strike;\n       Whereas, the Vietnam War was the central issue of the 1972 \n     presidential election, with President Nixon's opponent, \n     George McGovern, campaigning on a platform of withdrawal from \n     Vietnam;\n       Whereas, starting in 1969, President Nixon's National \n     Security Adviser, Henry Kissinger, carried on secret \n     negotiations with North Vietnamese officials;\n       Whereas, in October 1972, an agreement was reached, but \n     South Vietnamese President Nguyen Van Thieu demanded massive \n     changes to the peace proposal;\n       Whereas, with negotiations deadlocked, President Nixon \n     approved Operation Linebacker II, a massive bombing campaign \n     by B-52 strategic bombers aimed at reassuring the South \n     Vietnamese and forcing the North Vietnamese back to the \n     negotiating table;\n       Whereas, in just 11 days, over 49,000 tons of bombs were \n     dropped on North Vietnam, devastating the country and forcing \n     North Vietnam back to the table;\n       Whereas, on January 15, 1973, President Richard Nixon \n     announced the suspension of offensive action against North \n     Vietnam;\n       Whereas, the Paris Peace Accords, the agreement signed on \n     January 27, 1973, between North Vietnam and the United States \n     and South Vietnam, effectively ended the conflict and began \n     the complete withdrawal of American troops;\n       Whereas, the key provisions of the agreement included a \n     cease-fire throughout Vietnam, withdrawal of U.S. combat \n     forces, the release of prisoners of war, and the \n     reunification of North and South Vietnam through peaceful \n     means;\n       Whereas, the South Vietnamese government was to remain in \n     place until new elections were held, and North Vietnamese \n     forces in the South were not to advance further or be \n     reinforced;\n       Whereas, little more than two months after the peace \n     agreement, U.S. combat troops left Vietnam;\n       Whereas, Operation Homecoming, a result of the Paris Peace \n     Accords, made possible the return of nearly 600 American \n     prisoners of war (POWs) held by North Vietnam;\n       Whereas, groups of released POWs were selected on the basis \n     of their length of time in prison, with the first group \n     consisting of POWs that had spent six to eight years as \n     prisoners of war;\n       Whereas, after Operation Homecoming, about 1,350 Americans \n     were still listed as prisoners of war or missing in action, \n     and another 1,200 Americans were reported killed in action \n     without their bodies being recovered;\n       Whereas, these missing personnel would become the subject \n     of an intense search by the United States Army, Navy, Air \n     Force, and Marine Corps, with many remains of missing \n     personnel located and returned in the decades since;\n       Whereas, following the refusal of Congress to fund \n     additional U.S. activity in Vietnam, all American troops and \n     equipment were withdrawn from Vietnam;\n       Whereas, Communist leaders in the North had expected that \n     the cease-fire terms would favor their side, but even before \n     the last American combat troops departed on March 29, 1973, \n     the Communists violated the cease-fire;\n       Whereas, in Saigon, approximately 7,000 United States \n     Department of Defense civilian employees remained behind to \n     aid South Vietnam in conducting what was beginning to look \n     like a fierce and ongoing war with Communist North Vietnam;\n       Whereas, Saigon, bolstered by a surge of U.S. aid received \n     just before the cease-fire went into effect, at first started \n     to push back the Vietcong, but by early 1974, full-scale \n     warfare had resumed;\n       Whereas, the Vietcong recaptured the territory it lost \n     during the previous dry season, and during the rest of 1974 \n     Communist forces took possession of additional areas in the \n     South;\n       Whereas, at the end of 1974, South Vietnamese authorities \n     reported that 80,000 soldiers and civilians had been killed, \n     making it the costliest year of the war;\n       Whereas, in the spring of 1975, 20 divisions of the North \n     Vietnamese Army invaded South Vietnam;\n       Whereas, South Vietnamese forces fell back in disorder and \n     panic, abandoning air bases, weapons, aircraft, fuel, and \n     ammunition, and on April 29, 1975, Communist forces reached \n     Saigon, the South Vietnamese capital, and quickly overran the \n     city;\n       Whereas, South Vietnam formally surrendered the next day;\n       Whereas, April 30, 1975, also saw the last American \n     civilians and military personnel still in South Vietnam \n     airlifted out of Saigon by U.S. support forces;\n       Whereas, statistics from the 1970 census indicate that \n     27,910 Utahns served in Vietnam;\n       Whereas, 388 Utahns were killed, 14 are still listed as \n     missing in action, and many more were wounded during their \n     service;\n       Whereas, a new exhibit, which honors and pays tribute to \n     the sacrifices of POWs during the Vietnam War, opened \n     September 12, 2012, at the Hill Air Force Base museum; and\n       Whereas, it is fitting that in the 50th year since the \n     beginning of the conflict Utahns reflect on the Vietnam War \n     and its legacy: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah, the \n     Governor concurring therein, recognize the 50th Anniversary \n     of the Vietnam War and those who fought, suffered, and died \n     in the conflict; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature and the Governor urge the \n     citizens of Utah to reflect on the service and sacrifice of \n     many during the Vietnam War; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be sent to the \n     Veterans of Foreign Wars USA, the United States Department of \n     Veterans Affairs, the Utah Department of Veterans' Affairs, \n     the Hill Air Force Base museum, and the members of Utah's \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-98. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Utah recognizing Israel's legal, historical, \n     and moral right of self-governance and self-defense; to the \n     Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n                   Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 4\n\n       Whereas, the Jewish people have a long standing connection \n     to the land of Israel;\n       Whereas, the claim and presence of the Jewish people in \n     Israel has remained constant throughout the past 4,000 years;\n       Whereas, Israel declared its independence and self-\n     governance on May 14, 1948, with the goal of reestablishing a \n     homeland for the Jewish people;\n       Whereas, the United States, having been the first nation to \n     recognize Israel as an independent nation and as Israel's \n     principal ally, has enjoyed a close and mutually beneficial \n     relationship with Israel and her people;\n       Whereas, Israel is the greatest friend and ally of the \n     United States in the Middle East and the two countries enjoy \n     strong bonds and common values;\n       Whereas, there are those in the Middle East who, since the \n     time of Israel's inception as a state, have continually \n     sought to destroy Israel;\n       Whereas, Israel and the United States have similar goals of \n     democracy and stability in the Middle East; and\n       Whereas, Utah and Israel have enjoyed a cordial and \n     mutually beneficial relationship since 1948, a friendship \n     that continues to strengthen with each passing year: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah, the \n     Governor concurring therein, commend Israel for its cordial \n     and mutually beneficial relationship with the United States \n     and with the state of Utah; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature and the Governor express \n     support for Israel in its legal, historical, and moral right \n     of self-governance and self-defense upon its lands; and be it \n     further\n        Resolved, That the Legislature and the Governor recognize \n     that Israel is not an attacking force of other nations, and \n     that peace can be afforded the region only through combined \n     efforts and trust; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be sent to the \n     Embassy of Israel to the United States, the President of the \n     United States, the Majority Leader of the United States \n     Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, and the members of Utah's congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-99. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Utah urging the President of the United States \n     and the United States Congress to support free trade with \n     Taiwan; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 12\n\n       Whereas, the state of Utah is proud of the sister-state \n     relationship it has enjoyed with Taiwan since 1980;\n\n[[Page S6117]]\n\n       Whereas, Taiwan, as a full-fledged democracy, shares the \n     same values of freedom, democracy, human rights, open market, \n     peace, and prosperity with the United States;\n       Whereas, Taiwan is currently the 18th largest exporter as \n     well as importer, the United States' 10th largest trading \n     partner, and the 6th largest agricultural products market;\n       Whereas, despite being a member of the World Trade \n     Organization since 2002 and a faithful ally and an important \n     strategic partner of the United States, Taiwan has yet to \n     sign a free trade agreement with the United States;\n       Whereas, approximately 580,000 people from Taiwan visit the \n     United States annually, and Taiwanese airline carriers \n     currently have more than 40 flights destined for the United \n     States weekly, carrying more than 5,000 passengers daily for \n     business, tourism, study, and other purposes;\n       Whereas, Taiwanese airlines fly to every corner of the \n     globe and Taiwan aims to ensure that all aspects of its \n     aviation sector conform to the standard formulated by the \n     International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) for safety \n     and security;\n       Whereas, for the past 40 years, however, Taiwan has not \n     been able to enter or meaningfully participate in the ICAO;\n       Whereas, this hampers Taiwan's voluntary efforts to comply \n     with the ICAO standards due to lack of timely and \n     comprehensive information;\n       Whereas, Taiwan has recently promoted an East China Sea \n     Peace Initiative, a commendable effort to ease tensions that \n     might seriously endanger peace and prosperity in the region; \n     and\n       Whereas, resolving disputes in the East China Sea in a \n     rational and peaceful manner is in the best interests of all \n     parties in the region and the United States: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah \n     reaffirms the friendship, and encourages the sister-state \n     relationship, between Utah and Taiwan; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature urges the President of the \n     United States and the United States Congress to support a \n     free trade agreement with Taiwan and support Taiwan's \n     participation in multilateral free trade negotiations; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature expresses its continued \n     support for Taiwan's meaningful participation in United \n     Nations specialized organizations, conventions, and programs, \n     such as acquiring an observer status in the International \n     Civil Aviation Organization; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature welcomes Taiwan's initiative \n     for peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific Region and urges \n     all parties concerned in East China Sea disputes to refrain \n     from any antagonistic actions and resolve their differences \n     through open dialogue and other peaceful means; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be sent to the \n     President of the United States, the Majority Leader of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives, the President of the Republic of China on \n     Taiwan, and the members of Utah's congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-100.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Maine memorializing the United States Congress \n     to oppose section 8 of H.R. 1919; to the Committee on Health, \n     Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                            Joint Resolution\n\n       Whereas, Section 8 of H.R. 1919, ``An Act to Amend the \n     Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,'' allows prescription \n     drug manufacturers to decide to supply drug information \n     labels only by electronic means, as opposed to the paper \n     labels currently accompanying prescription drugs upon \n     receipt; and\n       Whereas, a similar provision is not contained in the United \n     States Senate's version of the bill; and\n       Whereas, the United States Congress addressed electronic \n     labeling in 2012 and directed the United States Government \n     Accountability Office to study the potential advantages and \n     associated risks of this labeling and the results of the \n     study are due to be released in July 2013; and\n       Whereas, Congress should await the results of the study it \n     ordered to be undertaken before passing legislation that \n     would require critical medical information, such as \n     information on dangerous side effects and contraindications, \n     to be made available to health care professionals and \n     prescription drug consumers only by electronic means; and\n       Whereas, Maine would be disproportionately negatively \n     affected by Section 8 of H.R. 1919; and\n       Whereas, as of 2011, 16.3% of Maine's population was over \n     65 years of age, compared to only 13.3% for the nation as a \n     whole; and\n       Whereas, due to its geography, climate and highly dispersed \n     and rural population, significant areas of Maine do not have \n     reliable access to the Internet; and\n       Whereas, Maine relies on the forest products industry to \n     create and maintain jobs and sustainably manage Maine's \n     forests, and that industry would be negatively affected by \n     Section 8 of H.R. 1919 without further study of the effects: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That We, your Memorialists, the Members of the \n     One Hundred and Twenty-sixth Legislature now assembled in the \n     First Regular Session, on behalf of the people we represent, \n     take this opportunity to urge and request that Section 8 of \n     H.R. 1919 not be passed until the Government Accountability \n     Office study on the effects of required electronic-only \n     labeling for prescription medications is published, reviewed \n     and considered; and be it further\n       Resolved, That We urge and request that this section of the \n     bill not become law without further consideration and \n     mitigation of the disproportionate negative effects on \n     Maine's elderly, rural and highly dispersed population; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That suitable copies of this resolution, duly \n     authenticated by the Secretary of State, be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, to the Speaker of \n     the United States House of Representatives and to each Member \n     of the Maine Congressional Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-102.

Currently, there are seven Job \n     Corps centers located in California in the Cities of Long \n     Beach, Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Bernardino, San Diego, \n     San Francisco, and San Jose; and\n       Whereas, these seven Job Corps centers provide a vital \n     piece of California's workforce development system by serving \n     5,373\n\n[[Page S6118]]\n\n     disadvantaged youth between 16 and 24 years of age, \n     inclusive, by providing high school diplomas and career \n     technical education to young men and women, all of whom come \n     from very low income households and are unemployed or \n     underemployed; and\n       Whereas, in addition to academic and employment training, \n     these Job Corps centers provide social skills training and \n     other services to empower these young men and women to obtain \n     and hold a job, enroll in advanced training, attend college, \n     or enter the Armed Forces to defend the interests of the \n     United States around the world; and\n       Whereas, over 8,000 former dropouts have received fully \n     accredited public high school diplomas at the Job Corps \n     centers and thousands more unemployed youth have received \n     career training and job placement assistance; and\n       Whereas, the young men and women who participate in the Job \n     Corps gain entry level job skills for well-paying careers in \n     construction, health care, culinary arts, security services, \n     and other employment sectors vital to California's economy; \n     and\n       Whereas, recent studies demonstrate a significant economic \n     gain from funds invested in dropout recovery by increasing \n     employment, raising individual earnings, improving home and \n     auto sales, increased job and economic growth, greater \n     spending and investments, and tax revenues, and significant \n     reductions in health care costs, crime prevention and \n     corrections expenditures, and other social services provided \n     by California; and\n       Whereas, the National Job Corps Association reports that \n     the combined economic activity stimulated by the Job Corps \n     centers in California is two hundred forty-three million \n     seven hundred twenty-six thousand five hundred nineteen \n     dollars ($243,726,519), and that 2,971 local jobs are created \n     by the operation of the Job Corps centers in California; and\n       Whereas, the United States Department of Labor is entrusted \n     to serve the disadvantaged youth in America. However, the \n     United States Department of Labor recently decided to suspend \n     all new student enrollments to Job Corps centers in \n     California and throughout the 125 Job Corps centers serving \n     the nation, which would prevent as many as 30,000 otherwise \n     eligible young men and women from receiving diplomas and job \n     training; and\n       Whereas, recent decisions of the United States Department \n     of Labor to implement a 93-day suspension of new student \n     enrollment and a 21-percent reduction in funding for future \n     enrollments appear to be inequitably balancing a budget \n     shortfall on the backs of disadvantaged youth it is entrusted \n     to serve when other alternatives are available for closing \n     the shortfall; and\n       Whereas, seventy-one members of the United States House of \n     Representatives and 17 members of the United States Senate \n     have sent a bipartisan letter asking Acting Secretary and \n     Deputy Secretary of Labor, Seth D. Harris, to reverse the \n     suspension of new student enrollments in order to protect the \n     opportunities provided to the nation's most disadvantaged \n     youth and to prevent further economic damage to the \n     communities served by the Job Corps: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and the Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature supports the United \n     States congressional action to reverse the suspension of new \n     student enrollments in the Job Corps, to prevent any limits \n     to student enrollment until other cost-saving measures have \n     been exhausted, and to maintain The full range of educational \n     and employment services provided by the Job Corps; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, to the Majority Leader of the Senate, and to \n     each Senator and Representative from California in the \n     Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-103. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana urging and requesting the \n     Department of Health and Hospitals examine the benefits of \n     routine nutritional screening and therapeutic nutrition \n     treatment for those who are malnourished or at risk for \n     malnutrition; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \n     and Pensions.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 41\n\n       Whereas, the National Black Caucus of State Legislators \n     (NBCSL) has established policy promoting the importance of \n     quality nutrition for all Americans in order to maintain \n     healthy, active, independent lifestyles; and\n       Whereas, the NBCSL adopted policy supporting increased \n     access to quality nutrition and support for infants and \n     children, as passed by the United States Congress in \n     Resolution HHS-11-19; and\n       Whereas, leading health and nutrition experts agree that \n     nutrition status is a direct measure of patient health and \n     that good nutrition and good patient health can keep people \n     healthy and out of institutionalized health care facilities, \n     thus reducing healthcare costs; and\n       Whereas, inadequate or unbalanced nutrition, known as \n     malnutrition, is not routinely viewed as a medical concern in \n     this nation, and that malnutrition is particularly prevalent \n     in vulnerable populations, such as older adults, hospitalized \n     patients, or minority populations that statistically shoulder \n     the highest incidences of the most severe chronic illnesses \n     such as diabetes, kidney disease, and cardiovascular disease; \n     and\n       Whereas, illness, injury, and malnutrition can result in \n     the loss of lean body mass, leading to complications that \n     impact good patient health outcomes, including recovery from \n     surgery, illness, or disease; the elderly lose lean body mass \n     more quickly and to a greater extent than younger adults and \n     weight assessment (body weight and body mass index) can \n     overlook accurate indicators of lean body mass; and\n       Whereas, the American Nursing Association defines \n     therapeutic nutrition as the administration of food and \n     fluids to support the metabolic processes of a patient who is \n     malnourished or at high risk of becoming malnourished; and\n       Whereas, access to therapeutic nutrition is critical in \n     restoring lean body mass such that it resolves malnutrition \n     challenges and, in turn, improves clinical outcomes, reduces \n     health care costs, and can keep people and our communities \n     healthy; and\n       Whereas, despite the recognized link between good nutrition \n     and good health, nutritional screening and therapeutic \n     nutrition treatment have not been incorporated as routine \n     medical treatments across the spectrum of health care: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana urges and \n     requests that the Department of Health and Hospitals examine \n     the benefits of routine nutritional screening and therapeutic \n     nutrition treatment for those who are malnourished or at risk \n     for malnutrition, as well as examine the benefits of \n     nutrition screening and therapeutic nutrition treatment as \n     part of the standard for evidenced-based hospital care; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana supports an \n     increased emphasis on nutrition through the reauthorization \n     of the Older Americans Act, as well as for Medicare \n     beneficiaries, to improve their disease management and health \n     outcomes; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana is encouraged \n     that preventive and wellness services, such as counseling for \n     obesity and chronic disease management, are part of the \n     Essential Health Benefits package included in the Patient \n     Protection and Affordable Care Act; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the president of the United States, the vice president of the \n     United States, the secretary of the United States Senate and \n     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives, to \n     each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United States \n     Congress, and to the secretary of the Department of Health \n     and Hospitals.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-104. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Utah describing the impacts of the federal \n     Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act on Utah families, \n     insurers, health care providers, and the state; to the \n     Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 10\n\n       Whereas, the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care \n     Act and its companion legislation, the Health Care and \n     Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, referred to jointly as \n     ``the Affordable Care Act,'' ``the ACA,'' or ``Obamacare,'' \n     were enacted in March 2010;\n       Whereas, under the ACA, Utah families, employers, \n     manufacturers, and insurers will pay at least 18 new or \n     increased taxes and fees that over 10 years will transfer \n     $500 billion from the private sector to the public sector, \n     suppressing economic growth and reducing employment in the \n     state;\n       Whereas, hundreds of Utah medical device companies will be \n     subject to the ACA's excise tax on manufacturers and \n     importers of certain medical devices, without regard for \n     company profitability;\n       Whereas, the tax will threaten the viability of many firms \n     and have a chilling effect on the very innovation needed to \n     drive down health care costs and support economic growth in \n     this state;\n       Whereas, Utahns will suffer further reductions in \n     employment growth and economic activity as employers comply \n     with uncompensated regulatory burdens imposed by the ACA;\n       Whereas, Utah families will also pay more for goods and \n     services as employers, insurers, and medical providers pass \n     along various costs imposed by the ACA;\n       Whereas, health insurance premiums for certain younger, \n     healthier Utahns will more than double in 2014 as the result \n     of various ACA provisions, including a prohibition on medical \n     underwriting and restrictions on the use of age-based \n     premiums;\n       Whereas, the cost of insurance for many other Utah families \n     will go up as well in response to ACA provisions that are \n     known to drive up costs, including prohibitions on pre-\n     existing condition exclusions, annual benefit limits, and \n     lifetime benefit limits;\n       Whereas, the ACA will penalize Utah employers that have \n     more than 50 employees if they do not offer health insurance \n     to their employees, even if an employer cannot afford \n     insurance or chooses instead to compensate employees with \n     higher wages, larger retirement contributions, or other \n     employee benefits;\n       Whereas, working Utah families will have fewer full-time \n     employment opportunities as employers replace full-time \n     workers with part-time workers to avoid ACA penalties;\n       Whereas, some Utah families will be unable to keep their \n     current health insurance and may have fewer options as \n     employers abandon plans not meeting minimum benefit and \n     affordability requirements in order to avoid ACA penalties;\n\n[[Page S6119]]\n\n       Whereas, working Utah families will find it even harder to \n     secure employment with health insurance benefits as premium \n     increases continue unabated in response to both the ACA and \n     long-term cost drivers not addressed by the ACA;\n       Whereas, many Utahns will face increased premiums as their \n     insurers attempt to fund $81 million in losses created by the \n     ACA's transfer of individuals from publicly funded high-risk \n     pools to the private insurance market;\n       Whereas, many Utah families with insurance offered by small \n     or midsize employers could be threatened with higher premiums \n     or no insurance at all if commercial insurance risk increases \n     too much as the result of employers dropping coverage or \n     switching to self-insurance arrangements;\n       Whereas, there is a high likelihood that many Utah families \n     will experience higher premiums due to the ACA's minimum \n     benefit requirements, which threaten to ratchet up plan costs \n     both inside and outside health insurance exchanges;\n       Whereas, Utah families will pay higher insurance premiums \n     because of ACA provisions that subsidize states with high-\n     cost, poorly managed health care plans at the expense of \n     states like Utah that have low-cost, better managed plans;\n       Whereas, Utah seniors will likely have fewer care options \n     due to Medicare provider payment reductions made by the ACA;\n       Whereas, Medicaid enrollees will likely have greater \n     difficulty making appointments with health care providers as \n     Medicaid enrollment expands under the ACA, particularly after \n     the two-year enhanced reimbursement rate for primary care \n     providers ends;\n       Whereas, Utah hospitals will suffer as a result of ACA \n     reductions in funds paid to hospitals that serve a \n     disproportionate number of low-income individuals;\n       Whereas, Utah families will suffer if medical facilities \n     close or medical practitioners leave their professions in \n     response to the financial strain created by shrinking \n     provider payments under the ACA;\n       Whereas, state funding for education, roads, public safety, \n     and other important services will be crowded by a $46 million \n     annual liability to pay for the ACA's mandatory Medicaid \n     eligibility expansion;\n       Whereas, we and our children must one day pay the price for \n     entitlements Congress has created but failed to realistically \n     fund, including the ACA;\n       Whereas, that price already includes tax increases and cost \n     shifting to our posterity, and will likely include benefit \n     reductions and even currency devaluation;\n       Whereas, that price will tend to include the shifting of \n     greater fiscal responsibility for government programs--\n     including Medicaid--from Washington to the states, even \n     further crowding out funding for education and other \n     essential state services;\n       Whereas, the real cost of more Utahns having insurance \n     under the ACA will be a far greater dependence on government, \n     not less;\n       Whereas, under an optional Medicaid expansion the state \n     would incur large, ongoing funding liabilities and both the \n     state and its citizens would be more dependent, not less \n     dependent, on a fiscally unsustainable federal government;\n       Whereas, Utah has refused to exacerbate the federal fiscal \n     crisis by choosing not to implement the ACA's federally \n     subsidized health insurance exchange, which makes people \n     dependent on large government subsidies and gives priority to \n     publicly funded, rather than privately funded, coverage;\n       Whereas, because of the ACA, Utah employers, insurers, and \n     health care providers will face more regulation, not less \n     regulation, and will have fewer options, not more options, \n     for addressing the underlying challenges faced by our health \n     care system;\n       Whereas, notwithstanding the ACA's focus on preventive care \n     and its acknowledgment of alternative payment and delivery \n     systems, many Utahns will see little relief from premium \n     increases driven by underlying problems the ACA fails to \n     address, including reliance on payment and delivery systems \n     that promote over consumption of health care;\n       Whereas, implementation of the ACA will tend to destroy the \n     private market for health insurance and move families, \n     insurers, and health care providers ever closer to a single-\n     payer system of federally controlled health care;\n       Whereas, the state, its citizens, employers, insurers, and \n     health care providers will all suffer as the ACA fails to \n     bring unsustainable health care spending under control and \n     metastasises instead into greater federal regulation and \n     control of not just health care, but most aspects of Utahns' \n     and Americans' daily lives and activities;\n       Whereas, the ACA disregards state jurisdiction over health \n     care policy and constrains the state's efforts to develop and \n     implement meaningful health care reform; and\n       Whereas, the Legislature and the Governor believe that \n     successful reform of health care's most vexing problems will \n     require more--not less--state flexibility and innovation: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah, the \n     Governor concurring therein, urges the state's Congressional \n     delegation to continue its efforts to arrest the devastating \n     impacts of the ACA on Utah's economy, its citizens, its \n     employers, its medical providers, and its insurers, using all \n     means possible, including repeal of the act; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature and the Governor urge Utah's \n     Congressional delegation to work cooperatively with other \n     members of Congress and officials of this state and other \n     states to develop workable alternatives to the ACA that \n     encourage state innovation, preserve states' policy-making \n     jurisdiction and regulatory authority, and lead to greater \n     enrollment in affordable health insurance; be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature and the Governor affirm by \n     this resolution the state's policy that no person in this \n     state should be required to either sponsor or enroll in \n     health insurance, particularly under threat of federal \n     penalty; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature and the Governor urge the \n     Legislature's Health Reform Task Force to continue working \n     cooperatively with the Governor's Office to ensure that ACA \n     implementation rules address the needs of Utah families, \n     employers, health care providers, insurers, and insurance \n     regulators; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature and the Governor urge all \n     stakeholders in Utah's health care system--including \n     families, employers, health care providers, and insurers--to \n     continue working cooperatively with the Governor and the \n     Legislature to develop state-based health care reforms with \n     the greatest potential for increasing consumerism, improving \n     quality of care, constraining spending growth, and promoting \n     enrollment in affordable health insurance, regardless of how \n     ACA implementation unfolds; be it further\n       Resolved, That this resolution be sent to the United States \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Governor, the \n     Legislature's Health Reform Task Force, Utah's Congressional \n     delegation, the Utah Health Policy Project and other consumer \n     advocacy groups, the Salt Lake Chamber of Commerce and other \n     employer associations, the Utah Hospital Association, the \n     Utah Medical Association, Utah insurers, the Utah Association \n     of Health Underwriters, and the Speakers and Presidents \n     presiding over the legislatures of each of the 49 other \n     states.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-105.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Hawaii commemorating the twentieth \n     anniversary of Public Law 103-150; to the Committee on Indian \n     Affairs.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 6\n\n       Whereas, in 1993, the United States Congress passed Public \n     Law 103-150 (the ``Apology Resolution''), acknowledging and \n     apologizing for the critical role of United States diplomats, \n     military forces, and citizens in the overthrow of the \n     sovereign Kingdom of Hawai`i; and\n       Whereas, the Apology Resolution confirms that the actions \n     of United States agents in the overthrow and occupation of \n     the Hawaiian government violated treaties between the United \n     States and the sovereign Kingdom of Hawai`i, and norms of \n     international law; and\n       Whereas, the Apology Resolution confirms that one million \n     eight hundred thousand acres of crown and government lands \n     were thereafter ceded to the United States without consent or \n     compensation to the Native Hawaiian people or their sovereign \n     government, as a result of the United States' annexation of \n     Hawai`i; and\n       Whereas, the Apology Resolution recognizes that the Native \n     Hawaiian people never relinquished their claims to their \n     inherent sovereignty as a people or of their national lands \n     throughout the overthrow, occupation, annexation, and \n     admission of Hawai`i into the United States; and\n       Whereas, the Apology Resolution recognizes that the health \n     and well-being of the Native Hawaiian people is intrinsically \n     tied to their deep feelings and attachment to the land; and\n       Whereas, the Apology Resolution recognizes that the Native \n     Hawaiian people are determined to preserve, develop, and \n     transmit to their descendants, both their ancestral lands and \n     their cultural identity; and\n       Whereas, the Apology Resolution acknowledges that the \n     overthrow has resulted in the suppression of the inherent \n     sovereignty of the Native Hawaiian people; and\n       Whereas, the Apology Resolution apologizes to the Native \n     Hawaiian people on behalf of the people of the United States, \n     commends the efforts of reconciliation initiated by the State \n     of Hawaii and the United Church of Christ with the Native \n     Hawaiians, including the appropriation of funds to educate \n     the public regarding Hawaiian sovereignty; and\n       Whereas, the State Legislature also passed Act 340, Session \n     Laws of Hawaii 1993, mandating that the lands and waters of \n     Kaho `olawe island be held in the public land trust, \n     directing the State to transfer management and control of \n     these lands and waters to the sovereign Native Hawaiian \n     entity upon its recognition by the United States and the \n     State of Hawai`i, and establishing the Kaho `olawe Island \n     Reserve Commission to manage these lands and waters in the \n     interim; and\n       Whereas, the State Legislature passed Act 329, Session Laws \n     of Hawaii 1997, recognizing the deep sense of injustice felt \n     among many Native Hawaiians and others and affirming that \n     reconciliation with the Native Hawaiian people is desired by \n     all people of Hawai`i; and\n       Whereas, in 2000, the Department of the Interior and the \n     Department of Justice published a report, ``From Mauka to \n     Makai: The River of Justice Must Flow Freely,'' which \n     formally initiated the federal government's efforts to \n     reconcile past injustices, and recognize and establish a \n     government-to-government relationship with the Native \n     Hawaiian people; and\n       Whereas, in 2000 and 2002, the United States Congress \n     passed Public Law 106-568, the Hawaiian Homelands \n     Homeownership Act, and Public Law 107-110, the reenacted \n     Native Hawaiian Education Act, confirming the special \n     relationship between the federal government and the Native \n     Hawaiian people; and\n       Whereas, in 2005, Hawai`i's entire congressional \n     delegation, including then-representative and current \n     Governor of Hawai`i, Neil Abercrombie, as well as the then-\n     Hawai`i Governor, expressed to the United States Senate \n     Committee on Indian Affairs their unanimous support for self-\n     governance and self-determination for Native Hawaiians; and\n       Whereas, in Office of Hawaiian Affairs v. Housing and \n     Community Development Corporation of Hawaii (HCDCH), 117 \n     Hawaii 174, 195 (2008), rev'd and remanded by 556 U.S. 163 \n     (2009), the Supreme Court of the State of Hawai`i held that \n     ``the Apology Resolution and related state legislation . . . \n     give rise to the State's fiduciary duty to preserve the \n     corpus of the public lands trust, specifically, the ceded \n     lands, until such time as the unrelinquished claims of the \n     native Hawaiians have been resolved.''; and\n       Whereas, in Office of Hawaiian Affairs v. HCDCH, 117 Hawaii \n     174, 216, the Supreme Court of the State of Hawai`i also \n     recognized the critical importance of the `aina to Hawaiian \n     people and stated, ``We firmly believe that, given the \n     `crucial importance [of the `aina or land to] the [n]ative \n     Hawaiian people and their culture, their religion, their \n     economic self-sufficiency, and their sense of personal and \n     community well-being,' any further diminishment of the ceded \n     lands (the 'aina) from the public lands trust will negatively \n     impact the contemplated reconciliation/settlement efforts \n     between native Hawaiians and the State''; and\n       Whereas, the State Legislature passed Act 195, Session Laws \n     of Hawaii 2011, acknowledging that Native Hawaiians are the \n     only indigenous, aboriginal, maoli population of Hawai`i nei, \n     that the State of Hawai`i has a special political and legal \n     relationship with the Native Hawaiian people, that Native \n     Hawaiians have continued to maintain their identity as a \n     distinctly native political community with rights to self-\n     determination, self-governance, and self-sufficiency, and \n     establishing a Native Hawaiian roll commission to maintain a \n     roll of qualified Native Hawaiians to facilitate Native \n     Hawaiian self-governance; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-\n     seventh Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session \n     of 2013, the Senate concurring, That the Legislature hereby \n     commemorates the twentieth anniversary of the Apology \n     Resolution, recognizes the progress that has been made \n     towards reconciliation and Native Hawaiian self-governance \n     and self-determination, reaffirms the State's commitment to \n     reconciliation with the Native Hawaiian people for historical \n     injustices, urges the federal government to advance \n     reconciliation efforts with Native Hawaiians, and supports \n     efforts to further the self-determination and sovereignty of \n     Native Hawaiians; and be it further\n       Resolved, That certified copies of this Concurrent \n     Resolution be transmitted to the President of the United \n     States, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, the President of the United States Senate, \n     the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, \n     the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Hawai`i, the \n     Governor of the State of Hawai`i, and the Chairperson of the \n     Board of Trustees of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-107.

Federal Election Commission; to the Committee on \n     the Judiciary.\n\n                       Assembly Resolution No. 86\n\n       Whereas, A divided United States Supreme Court, in a 5-to-4 \n     decision issued en January 21, 2010 in Citizens United v. \n     Federal Elections Commission, overturned two important \n     precedents by lifting a 20-year ruling in Austin v. Michigan \n     Chamber of Commerce, that restricted campaign spending by \n     corporations in support of or in opposition to political \n     candidates; and\n       Whereas, The Court also overturned part of its 2003 \n     decision in McConnell v. Federal Elections Commission by \n     rejecting a large portion of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform \n     Act of 2002, commonly called McCain Feingold, which \n     restricted campaign spending by corporations and unions by \n     banning broadcast, cable or satellite transmissions of \n     electioneering communications paid for by corporations or \n     labor unions from their general funds in the 30 days before a \n     presidential primary and in the 60 days before the general \n     election; and\n       Whereas, In his 80-page dissent in the Citizens United \n     case, Justice Stevens called the decision ``a radical change \n     in the law'' that ignores ``the overwhelming majority of \n     justices who have served on this court'' and stated that ``In \n     the context of election to public office, the distinction \n     between corporate and human speakers is significant . . . \n     [Corporations] cannot vote or run for office. Because they \n     may be managed and controlled by nonresidents, their \n     interests may conflict in fundamental respects with the \n     interests of eligible voters''; and\n       Whereas, President Obama recently criticized the ruling as \n     ``a green light to a new stampede of special interest \n     money,'' and declared ``It is a major victory for big oil, \n     Wall Street banks, health insurance companies and the other \n     powerful interests that marshal their power every day in \n     Washington to drown out the voices of everyday Americans''; \n     and\n       Whereas, Senator John McCain who co-wrote the 2002 campaign \n     reform law with\n\n[[Page S6121]]\n\n     Senator Russell Feingold, said he was ``disappointed'' by the \n     decision, and Senator Feingold called the decision ``a \n     terrible mistake'' ignoring ``important principles of \n     judicial restraint and respect for precedent''; and\n       Whereas, For decades, Congress has exercised its \n     constitutional authority to regulate elections by seeking to \n     prevent corporations and unions from exerting undue influence \n     or the appearance of undue influence over federal candidates; \n     and\n       Whereas, It is fitting and proper for the [Senate] General \n     Assembly of this State to express its opposition to the \n     Citizens United decision and to call upon the Congress of the \n     United States to propose an amendment to the United States \n     Constitution to provide that, with respect to corporation \n     campaign spending, a person is only a natural person for \n     First Amendment protection of free speech; Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved by the General Assembly of the State of New \n     Jersey:\n       1. The General Assembly of the State of New Jersey \n     expresses strong opposition to the United States Supreme \n     Court ruling in Citizens United v. Federal Elections \n     Commission and calls upon the Congress of the United States \n     to propose an amendment to the United States Constitution to \n     provide that with regard to corporation campaign spending, a \n     person means only a natural person for First Amendment \n     protection of free speech.\n       2. Duly authenticated copies of this resolution, signed by \n     the Speaker of the General Assembly and attested to by the \n     Clerk of the Assembly, shall be transmitted to the President \n     and Vice President of the United States, the Majority and \n     Minority Leaders of the United States Senate, the Speaker and \n     Minority Leader of the United States House of \n     Representatives, and to each member of the United States \n     Congress elected from this State.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-108.

Valeo and continuing through Citizens United \n     v.

VAWA provides millions of \n     dollars to support programs for victim services, transitional \n     housing, and legal assistance, as well as tools that law \n     enforcement, prosecutors, and judges need to hold offenders \n     accountable and keep communities safe while supporting \n     victims; and\n       Whereas, Domestic violence, sexual assault, dating \n     violence, and stalking, once considered private matters to be \n     dealt with behind closed doors, have been brought out of the \n     darkness; and\n       Whereas, VAWA has been successful because it has had \n     consistently strong, bipartisan support for nearly two \n     decades; and\n       Whereas, Senators Patrick Leahy and Mike Crapo and \n     Representative Gwen Moore have introduced identical \n     legislation, the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act, \n     in their respective houses with language that includes \n     several updates and improvements to the law, including the \n     following:\n       (a) An emphasis on the need to effectively respond to \n     sexual assault crime by adding new purpose areas and a 25-\n     percent set-aside in the STOP (Services, Training, Officers, \n     and Prosecutors) Violence Against Women Formula Grant Program \n     (STOP Program) and the Grants to Encourage Arrest Policies \n     and Enforcement of Protection Orders Program.\n       (b) Improvements in tools to prevent domestic violence \n     homicides by training law enforcement, victim service \n     providers, and court personnel to identify and manage high-\n     risk offenders and connecting high-risk victims to crisis \n     intervention services.\n       (c) Critical improvements that provide important \n     protections for students, immigrant women, as well as the \n     lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender and Native American \n     communities.\n       (d) Improvements in responses to the high rate of violence \n     against women in tribal communities by strengthening \n     concurrent tribal criminal jurisdiction over perpetrators who \n     assault Indian spouses and dating partners in Indian \n     countries.\n       (e) Measures to strengthen housing protections for victims \n     by applying existing housing protections to nine additional \n     federal housing programs.\n       (f) Measures to promote accountability to ensure that \n     federal funds are used for their intended purposes.\n       (g) Consolidation of programs and reductions in \n     authorization levels to address fiscal concerns, and renewed \n     focus on programs that have been most successful.\n       (h) Technical corrections to update definitions throughout \n     the law to provide uniformity and continuity; and\n       Whereas, There is a need to maintain services for victims \n     and families at the local, state, and federal levels. VAWA \n     reauthorization would allow existing programs to continue \n     uninterrupted, and would provide for the development of new \n     initiatives to address key areas of concern. These \n     initiatives include the following:\n       (a) Addressing the high rates of domestic violence, dating \n     violence, and sexual assault among women 16 to 24 years of \n     age, inclusive.\n       (b) Improving the response to sexual assault with best \n     practices, training, and communication tools for law \n     enforcement, as well as for health care and legal \n     professionals.\n       (c) Preventing domestic violence homicides through enhanced \n     training for law enforcement, advocates, and others who \n     interact with those at risk: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and the Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly,  That the Legislature requests the \n     President to sign and Congress to pass the Violence Against \n     Women Reauthorization Act and ensure the sustainability of \n     vital programs designed to keep women and families safe from \n     violence and abuse; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, to the Majority Leader of the Senate, to \n     each Senator and Representative from California in the \n     Congress of the United States, and to the author for \n     appropriate distribution.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-113.

Wade decision, making access to \n     abortion safe and legal, has greatly improved the health of \n     women and families; and\n       Whereas, Roe v. Wade has been the cornerstone of women's \n     remarkable strides toward equality in the past four decades, \n     and reproductive freedom is critical to a woman's ability to \n     participate fully in the social, political, and economic life \n     of the community; and\n       Whereas, California is committed to protecting public \n     health and the welfare of all its residents, and recognizes \n     that access to reproductive health services, including family \n     planning and prenatal care, supports individuals and their \n     families by ensuring that babies are planned, wanted, and \n     healthy; and\n       Whereas, The public policy of California, as expressed in \n     the Reproductive Privacy Act, and protected by the California \n     Constitution's express right to privacy, is that each woman \n     has the fundamental right to make decisions regarding her \n     reproductive health; and\n       Whereas, California has a pioneering history in supporting \n     reproductive rights, including the California Supreme Court's \n     1969 decision in People v. Belous, recognizing that a woman's \n     decision to end a pregnancy is protected by her \n     constitutional right to privacy, four years prior to the \n     United States Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade; and\n       Whereas, In a democracy, people may have differing views \n     about abortion, but most Californians recognize that only a \n     pregnant woman can know, and should be entitled to decide, \n     what option is best for herself and her family; and\n       Whereas, Over 75 percent of Californians oppose efforts to \n     overturn Roe v. Wade, which could create a public health \n     crisis if individual states made abortion illegal and unsafe; \n     and\n       Whereas, The 2012 elections sent a powerful and \n     unmistakable message to Members of Congress and state \n     legislatures that women do not want politics or politicians \n     to interfere with their personal medical decisions; and\n       Whereas, Violence against abortion providers and laws that \n     create barriers to abortion endanger a woman's health: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the State of California, That on \n     the 40th anniversary of Roe v.

I \n     often traveled on horseback in the mountains to try cases \n     before Justices of the Peace'';\n       Whereas, Sutherland earned a well-deserved reputation as a \n     hardworking and honest family man who was smart, empathetic, \n     and kind;\n       Whereas, in 1886, at age 24, his law partnership with Sam \n     Thurman began, and they were joined by William King two years \n     later;\n       Whereas, as young lawyers, Sutherland and Thurman defended \n     nine Irish miners accused of lynching, a capital offense; all \n     were tried and convicted but none was executed--a victory for \n     Sutherland and Thurman;\n       Whereas, Sutherland also represented many members of the \n     LDS Church charged with violating the Federal Edmund's Act \n     outlawing polygamy;\n       Whereas, through these cases and his general character, he \n     earned respect within the LDS community and at the same time \n     received the political support of the non-LDS community;\n       Whereas, Sutherland did not represent Karl Maeser when he \n     was convicted in 1887 of violating the Edmund's Act, but he \n     nonetheless appeared at Maeser's sentencing and made an \n     impassioned and successful plea to the Court not to jail \n     Maeser, citing his many accomplishments at Brigham Young \n     Academy;\n       Whereas, the Court did not sentence Maeser to jail, but \n     fined him $300, which Sutherland immediately paid to the \n     Court;\n       Whereas, as a young lawyer, Sutherland dove into public \n     service and politics;\n       Whereas, from 1886 to 1890, Sutherland was an Overseer of \n     the State Hospital in Provo, and in 1890 he ran for Mayor of \n     Provo as a Liberal Party candidate on an antipolygamy \n     platform, and lost;\n       Whereas, LDS-Church sanctioned polygamy ended in late 1890, \n     gutting the Liberal Party of its purpose, so Sutherland \n     became a Republican and narrowly lost the 1892 Republican \n     nomination for Congress;\n       Whereas, Sutherland was gratified that Utah's new \n     Constitution provided for women's suffrage, a cause for which \n     he campaigned throughout his political career;\n       Whereas, Sutherland's legal practice blossomed, and in 1894 \n     he left Thurman & Sutherland and moved to Salt Lake City \n     where he joined the predecessor to the Van Cott law firm;\n       Whereas, Sutherland helped form the Utah Bar Association in \n     1895, and in 1896 was elected to the first Utah State Senate, \n     where he chaired the Judiciary Committee, which drafted the \n     first Utah Judicial and Penal Codes;\n       Whereas, Sutherland proposed the state's first State \n     Workers' Compensation Statute and laws granting eminent \n     domain to miners and those working in irrigation;\n       Whereas, in 1900, Sutherland narrowly defeated Democrat and \n     former law partner William H. King for Utah's lone seat in \n     the United States House of Representatives;\n       Whereas, Sutherland remained very active in state and \n     national Republican Party affairs, serving as a party \n     delegate from Utah to every Republican convention between \n     1900 and 1916;\n       Whereas, in his only House term, Sutherland was \n     instrumental in passing the Reclamation Act, which allowed \n     Western water projects to be engineered and financed with \n     federal money, allowing the Western States to grow much \n     faster than if water projects had been left to private and \n     state financing;\n       Whereas, Sutherland chose not to run for a second term and \n     resumed his practice with Van Cott;\n       Whereas, in 1905, United States Senators were elected by \n     State Legislatures;\n       Whereas, years earlier, Sutherland had represented United \n     States Senator Reed Smoot's father in a polygamy case and \n     now, with the endorsement of his friend and Senator, \n     Sutherland prevailed in an interparty fight with incumbent \n     Thomas Kearns;\n       Whereas, Sutherland's two-term Senate career was stellar;\n       Whereas, through his legal ability, affability, and hard \n     work, Sutherland accomplished much regarding women's \n     suffrage, workers' compensation, reclamation, Indian affairs, \n     and foreign policy;\n       Whereas, Sutherland was the driving force behind the \n     Federal Employer Liability Act, which created a workers' \n     compensation system;\n       Whereas, in support of the new system, Sutherland argued, \n     ``When we are able to get to the truth as to how these \n     accidents happen we will be able to apply the remedy with \n     greater certainty, so that the law is not only just in \n     providing compensation to all injured\n\n[[Page S6124]]\n\n     employees, one of the legitimate expenses of the industry, \n     but what is perhaps still more important, it will tend to \n     greatly reduce the number of accidents and consequently the \n     aggregate of human suffering'';\n       Whereas, Sutherland championed many other labor causes, \n     earning him the praise of Samuel Gompers, President of the \n     American Federation of Labor;\n       Whereas, Sutherland's Judiciary Committee rewrote the \n     United States Criminal and Judicial codes, ``a monumental \n     task'' according to Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes of the \n     United States Supreme Court;\n       Whereas, in 1907, Sutherland's courtroom skills were well \n     displayed in the Senate where he mounted a detailed and \n     successful defense of Senator Reed Smoot when the Senate \n     considered expelling Smoot due to his religious and alleged \n     polygamous practices;\n       Whereas, Sutherland sponsored the Nineteenth Amendment to \n     give women the right to vote in 1915 and exerted every effort \n     to assure its passage;\n       Whereas, Sutherland gave several well received speeches \n     promoting the amendment, including a 1914 speech in which he \n     stated, ``I give my assent to woman suffrage because, as the \n     matter appeals to me, there is no justification for denying \n     to half our citizens the right to participate in the \n     operations of a government which is as much their government \n     as it is ours upon the sole ground that they happen to be \n     born women instead of men'';\n       Whereas, Sutherland was not a pacifist, and contended that \n     security should be won through vigilance and strength;\n       Whereas, when Germanys new submarine fleet attacked \n     shipping in the open sea, President Wilson's apparent \n     vacillation in 1915 gave rise to sham criticism from \n     Sutherland in the Senate, where he stated, ``. . . my own \n     view of the matter is that the new weapon [the submarine] \n     must yield to the law not that the law must yield to the new \n     weapon. . . . I for one am becoming sick and tired of the \n     spineless policy of retreat and scuttle. . . . Instead of \n     warning our own people to exercise their rights at their \n     peril I would like to see issued to other people a warning to \n     interfere with these rights at their peril. The danger of it \n     all is that by this policy of always backing down, instead of \n     backing up, we shall encourage an increased encroachment upon \n     our rights until we shall finally be driven into crises from \n     which nothing but war can extricate us'';\n       Whereas, during his Senate years, Sutherland was frequently \n     engaged as a speaker on many public issues and he gained a \n     strong reputation as a constitutional scholar;\n       Whereas, this reputation was enhanced by the fact that he \n     argued three cases before the United States Supreme Court \n     while serving in the Senate;\n       Whereas, in 1915, Sutherland supported the Seventeenth \n     Amendment, which provided for popular election of United \n     States Senators;\n       Whereas, in 1916, Sutherland ran for a third term against \n     his old law partner and friend, William King, and lost;\n       Whereas, although Sutherland had not run a statewide \n     campaign for 16 years, his loss was likely due to the \n     coattail effect of the antiwar fervor that propelled \n     President Wilson to a second term, on the mantra that ``He \n     kept us out of war'';\n       Whereas, many Republican candidates were badly defeated in \n     1916, but in his consoling words to William Howard Taft on \n     his loss of the presidential race, Sutherland stated, ``We \n     are to pass through a period of readjustment, and the present \n     administration, in view of its past history, is not likely to \n     deal with the serious problems which will arise in such a way \n     as to satisfy the country. The result will be, therefore, \n     that we shall come back into power for a long time'';\n       Whereas, the Republicans won the next three presidential \n     elections;\n       Whereas, after leaving the Senate, Sutherland practiced law \n     in Washington, D.C. and argued four cases before the United \n     States Supreme Court;\n       Whereas, in 1917, Sutherland was elected President of the \n     American Bar Association and gave a series of six lectures at \n     Columbia University Law School on the Constitution and \n     foreign affairs;\n       Whereas, always a keen political strategist, Sutherland \n     supported Warren G. Harding's seemingly unlikely but \n     successful bid for the Republican presidential nomination, \n     and after Harding was elected he appointed Sutherland as lead \n     counsel for the United States in a seven week trial at The \n     Hague;\n       Whereas, Sutherland was also counsel to the United States \n     Delegation to the Armament talks of 1921;\n       Whereas, on September 5, 1922, President Harding nominated \n     Sutherland for an open seat on the United States Supreme \n     Court and the Senate unanimously confirmed him the same day;\n       Whereas, there was great public interest in and support for \n     Sutherland's appointment because he was the first Utahn to be \n     appointed, one of the few Senators to ascend to the bench, \n     only the fourth foreign born Justice to serve on the Court, \n     and the first to do so since 1793;\n       Whereas, as he had throughout every aspect of his life, \n     Justice Sutherland worked very hard on the United States \n     Supreme Court;\n       Whereas, in 15 years he wrote 295 majority opinions, 35 \n     dissents, and 1 concurrence--an average of 20 majority \n     opinions per year, which is double the average production of \n     today's Supreme Court Justices;\n       Whereas, Justice Sutherland's broad life experiences, \n     sobriety, hard work, and self-reliance brought a valuable \n     perspective to the Court;\n       Whereas, Justice Sutherland's impoverished upbringing and \n     boyhood years filled with extremely hard work, combined with \n     his intellect and ambition, propelled him into the highest \n     echelon of power on the state and national levels, exposing \n     him to people from all walks of life;\n       Whereas, Justice Sutherland's extensive experience in the \n     state and national legislative branches gave him a solid \n     foundation as a constitutional scholar and an expert in \n     governmental affairs;\n       Whereas, having seen temporary factions spring to life from \n     time to time, claiming to have all the answers to society's \n     challenges only to fade away and leave in their wake ill-\n     considered legislation that often infringed on individual \n     rights or violated other constitutional principles, Justice \n     Sutherland was wary of the tyranny of the majority;\n       Whereas, Justice Sutherland challenged the Congress, the \n     President, and other courts in order to protect individual \n     rights or fundamental constitutional doctrines;\n       Whereas, in 1935, in Berger v. United States, wherein an \n     Assistant U.S. Attorney was guilty of gross misconduct during \n     a criminal trial, Justice Sutherland eloquently set the \n     standard for prosecutorial misconduct when he wrote that the \n     misconduct called for a stern rebuke and repressive measures, \n     stating, ``The United States Attorney is the representative \n     not of an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a \n     sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as \n     compelling as its obligation to govern at all; and whose \n     interest, therefore, in a criminal prosecution is not that it \n     shall win a case, but that justice shall be done. As such, he \n     is in peculiar and very definite sense the servant of the \n     law, the twofold name of which is that guilt shall not \n     escape, or innocents suffer. He may prosecute with \n     earnestness and vigor, indeed he should do so. But, while he \n     may strike hard blows, he is not at liberty to strike foul \n     ones. It is as much his duty to refrain from improper methods \n     calculated to produce a wrongful conviction as it is to use \n     every legitimate means to bring about a just one'';\n       Whereas, this decision better clarified the prosecutor's \n     role and obligations and gave trial judges a clear directive \n     and authority to punish prosecutorial misconduct;\n       Whereas, when Franklin D. Roosevelt overwhelmingly defeated \n     President Hoover in 1932, the Congress quickly passed many \n     acts to address the economic calamity, but the laws were not \n     thoroughly assessed from a constitutional point of view \n     before they were passed;\n       Whereas, this led to scores of court challenges, and many \n     laws were struck down by unanimous vote in 1934, 1935, and \n     1936, while others were struck down by close votes on various \n     constitutional grounds;\n       Whereas, the most controversial opinions that Justice \n     Sutherland wrote struck down portions of President Franklin \n     Delano Roosevelt's New Deal legislation;\n       Whereas, after his landslide 1936 reelection, Roosevelt \n     proposed adding six Justices to the United States Supreme \n     Court, which Justice Sutherland saw as a roadblock to \n     economic recovery;\n       Whereas, the political upheaval that the court-packing plan \n     sparked caused conservative Justice Owen Roberts to change \n     his votes and to uphold the New Deal legislation;\n       Whereas, this switch of a vote and strong public opposition \n     to court-packing led to its defeat in the Senate and avoided \n     a constitutional, and perhaps a national, crisis;\n       Whereas, Justice Sutherland was bitterly disappointed with \n     Justice Roberts's vote change, and when the Supreme Court \n     then reversed recent Supreme Court decisions, Sutherland \n     dissented sharply, contending that political expediency had \n     trumped constitutional principles;\n       Whereas, much to the disappointment of moderates and \n     conservatives, Justice Sutherland retired in 1938;\n       Whereas, humble to the end, Sutherland did not mention the \n     Supreme Court or his career in his last public address, the \n     Convocation of the BYU Class of 1941, but instead reminisced \n     about Utah in the 1860s and 70s, his daylong labors as a \n     child, and his education at his beloved Brigham Young \n     Academy;\n       Whereas, above all he implored graduates to be vigilant \n     caretakers of their character, then to focus on career, \n     family, and church;\n       Whereas, George Sutherland passed away in 1942;\n       Whereas, this nation's heritage and good sense teach us to \n     honor distinguished and exemplary forefathers; and\n       Whereas, other public servants may deserve the recognition \n     of having their names on the new federal courthouse, but none \n     deserves it more than George Sutherland: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah urge \n     the members of Utah's congressional delegation to work to \n     have the new federal courthouse in Salt Lake City named after \n     Justice George Sutherland; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature urge the members of Utah's \n     congressional delegation to make this effort in recognition \n     of Justice Sutherland's lifetime of service to the citizens \n     of the state of Utah as a member of the Utah Senate and to \n     the United States as a member of the United States House of \n     Representatives, a member of the United States\n\n[[Page S6125]]\n\n     Senate, and the only Utahn to serve on the United States \n     Supreme Court, and whose example of humility and integrity in \n     public service is unsurpassed; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be sent to the \n     members of Utah's congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-116. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Utah supporting the Financial Ready Utah \n     enterprise risk management process; to the Committee on the \n     Judiciary.\n\n                      Senate Concurrent Resolution\n\n       Whereas, the Legislature of the state of Utah declares that \n     the nation's fiscal recklessness poses a great, clear, and \n     present threat to America's future;\n       Whereas, David Walker, former Comptroller General of the \n     United States warns, ``The most serious threat to the United \n     States is not someone hiding in a cave in Afghanistan or \n     Pakistan, but our own fiscal irresponsibility'';\n       Whereas, the federal government is now in its fourth year \n     of not passing a budget;\n       Whereas, the national debt has now surpassed $16.4 \n     trillion, more than $136,000 per household;\n       Whereas, annual deficits have exceeded $1 trillion for each \n     of the last four years, and unfunded obligations for social \n     programs now exceed $85 trillion, with no apparent \n     Congressional resolution on the horizon;\n       Whereas, it took 200 years for the United States to \n     accumulate the first trillion dollars in debt and only 286 \n     days to accumulate the most recent trillion;\n       Whereas, $85 billion per month of the national debt and \n     annual deficits are now offset through Federal Reserve \n     operations such as ``quantitative easing'' and ``operation \n     twist'';\n       Whereas, more than 40 cents of every dollar the state of \n     Utah spends comes from the federal government that borrows \n     and prints more than 40 cents of every dollar it sends to \n     Utah;\n       Whereas, last New Year's Eve, the United States Congress \n     merely delayed until March 1, 2013, the implementation of the \n     automatic cuts or ``sequestration'' of 8-9% of federal \n     discretionary spending, including funds to state and local \n     governments, and 10% of military spending under the Budget \n     Control Act of 2011;\n       Whereas, in its recently released audit of the federal \n     government's financial statements, the Government \n     Accountability Office declared, ``Over the long term, the \n     structural imbalance between spending and revenue will lead \n     to continued growth of debt held by the public as a share of \n     GDP [Gross Domestic Product]; this means the current \n     structure of the federal budget is unsustainable'';\n       Whereas, this fiscal scenario is by all accounts \n     unsustainable for the nation as well as for our state;\n       Whereas, in May 2012, the American Institute of Certified \n     Public Accountants, in its review of the federal government's \n     most recent annual financial statements, warned, ``The U.S. \n     is not exempt from the laws of prudent finance. We must take \n     steps to put our financial house in order. The credit rating \n     agencies have recently issued renewed warnings of U.S. credit \n     downgrades unless substantive reforms are made. Our current \n     fiscal policy results in mortgaging our nation's future \n     without investing in it, leaving our children, grandchildren \n     and future generations to suffer the consequences. This is \n     irresponsible, unethical and immoral'';\n       Whereas, restoring fiscal sanity and sustainability is at \n     the heart of jumpstarting economic growth and fostering a \n     business climate where companies can grow and begin to hire; \n     and\n       Whereas, absent credible actions to address this fiscal \n     irresponsibility, uncertainty will continue to dominate \n     business decision making and economic recovery will languish: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah, the \n     Governor concurring therein, wholeheartedly supports the \n     Financial Ready Utah initiative of fostering within the state \n     of Utah an enterprise risk management process to assess the \n     immediacy, severity, and probability of risks from any \n     reductions of federal funds to the state of Utah and how the \n     state will marshal its resources, both human and capital, to \n     prioritize and provide the most essential government \n     services; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature and the Governor strongly \n     urge local, state, and national representatives to take \n     immediate and sustained action to eliminate deficit spending \n     and secure economic self-reliance to the state of Utah and to \n     the United States;\n       Resolved, That the Legislature and the Governor strongly \n     urge the President of the United States and the United States \n     Congress to pass a budget each year and adopt a credible and \n     sustainable plan to balance those budgets;\n       Resolved, That the Legislature and the Governor strongly \n     urge Utah's towns, cities, and counties to adopt and \n     implement comprehensive financial risk management measures as \n     soon as possible;\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be sent to the \n     Attorney General of the United States, the President of the \n     United States, the Majority Leader of the United States \n     Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, the Utah Association of Counties, the Utah \n     League of Cities and Towns, Financial Ready Utah, the Utah \n     State Chamber of Commerce, the Utah Board of Regents, the \n     Utah State Board of Education, and the members of Utah's \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-117. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Utah rejecting United Nations Agenda 21 and \n     urging state and local governments across the United States \n     to reject it; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 11\n\n       Whereas, the United Nations Agenda 21 was initiated at the \n     United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in \n     Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1992;\n       Whereas, the United Nations Agenda 21 is being introduced \n     into local communities across the United States through the \n     International Council of Local Environmental Initiatives, \n     through local ``sustainable development'' policies including \n     Smart Growth America, the Wildlands Project, and Center for \n     Resilient Cities;\n       Whereas, the United Nations has accredited and enlisted \n     numerous nongovernmental and intergovernmental organizations \n     to assist in the implementation of its policies relative to \n     Agenda 21 around the world;\n       Whereas, the United Nations Agenda 21 plan of sustainable \n     development views private property ownership, single family \n     homes, private car ownership, individual travel choices, and \n     privately owned farms as destructive to the environment;\n       Whereas, according to the United Nations Agenda 21 policy, \n     social justice is described as the right and opportunity of \n     all people to benefit equally from the resources afforded \n     citizens by society and the environment, which would be \n     accomplished by redistribution of wealth;\n       Whereas, according to United Nations Agenda 21 policy, \n     national sovereignty is deemed a social injustice;\n       Whereas, Utah has a tradition of locally driven community \n     planning efforts dating back to the first settlers who laid \n     out a community plat that formed the basis for most of the \n     cities in Utah;\n       Whereas, Utah regional planning efforts have focused on \n     citizen participation, local decision making, transparent \n     processes, sound technical data, response to market demand, \n     and respect for due process and private property;\n       Whereas, Utah's Associations of Governments and Councils of \n     Governments are created and controlled by Utah counties, \n     cities, and towns, predate the adoption of Agenda 21 by more \n     than 20 years, and provide a forum for these local \n     governments to cooperate on issues of regional significance; \n     and\n       Whereas, cooperative decision making that is locally driven \n     and controlled provides great benefits in terms of cost and \n     service delivery and continues to serve the state of Utah \n     well: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah rejects \n     United Nations Agenda 21, both its intent and its potential \n     for abuse; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature urges Utah's state agencies \n     and political subdivisions to not adopt or implement policy \n     recommendations that deliberately or inadvertently infringe \n     or restrict private property rights without due process, as \n     may be required by policy recommendations originating in or \n     traceable to Agenda 21, adopted by the United Nations in 1992 \n     at its Conference on Environment and Development, or any \n     other international law or ancillary plan of action that \n     contravenes the Constitution of the United States or the \n     Constitution of the state of Utah;\n       Be it Further Resolved, That the Legislature urges Utah's \n     state agencies and political subdivisions to not adopt or \n     develop environmental and developmental policies that, \n     without due process, would infringe or restrict the private \n     property rights of property owners;\n       Be it Further Resolved, That the Legislature urges state \n     and local governments across the United States to be well \n     informed regarding the underlying harmful implications of \n     implementing United Nations Agenda 21's strategies for \n     ``sustainable development.'';\n       Be it Further Resolved, That the Legislature urges state \n     and local governments across the United States to not enter \n     into any agreement, expend any sum of money, contract \n     services, or give financial aid to those nongovennnental and \n     intergovernmental organizations affiliated with United \n     Nations Agenda 21;\n       Be it Further Resolved, That the Legislature urges state \n     and local governments across the United States to reject \n     United Nations Agenda 21 and any grant money or financial aid \n     attached to it;\n       Be it Further Resolved, That the Legislature of the state \n     of Utah supports the locally directed regional planning \n     efforts that are occurring in Utah and encourages other \n     states to look to the Utah model of collaboration that \n     protects local sovereignty and private property rights;\n       Be it Further Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be \n     sent to the Council of State Governments, the National \n     Conference of State Legislatures, the National Association of \n     Counties, the United Nations General Assembly, the Wildlands \n     Project, Smart Growth America, Center for Resilient Cities, \n     the International Council of Local Environmental Initiatives, \n     the Utah Association of Counties, the Utah League of Cities \n     and Towns, the Majority Leader of the United\n\n[[Page S6126]]\n\n     States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, and the members of Utah's congressional \n     delegation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/31/senate-section/article/S6126-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Ms. LANDRIEU, from the Committee on Small Business and \n     Entrepreneurship, with an amendment:\n       S. 415.

Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. BOOZMAN:\n  S. 1402. A bill to repeal the Federal estate and gift taxes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. President, part of the American Dream is to build an inheritance \nthat will benefit our future generations. The death tax works against \nthat idea by making planning and passing on family farms and businesses \nto the next generation even more difficult. Often times the cost is too \nmuch to absorb and families end up spending their hard-earned money on \nattorney fees, selling their land or business and its assets, or laying \noff workers just to pay Uncle Sam. We need to eliminate polices like \nthe death tax that create unnecessary burdens on our agriculture \ncommunity and family businesses. The Death Tax Repeal Act would \npermanently eliminate the federal estate and gift taxes that punish \nAmerica's agriculture producers and small business owners. According to \na study by Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the non-partisan \nCongressional Budget Office, repealing the death tax would create 1.5 \nmillion additional small business jobs and would decrease the national \nunemployment rate by nearly 1 percent.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1402\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Death Tax Repeal Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REPEAL OF ESTATE AND GIFT TAXES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subtitle B of the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 (relating to estate, gift, and generation-skipping \n     taxes) is hereby repealed.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The repeal made by subsection (a) \n     shall apply to estates of decedents dying, gifts made, and \n     generation-skipping transfers made after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Lee, and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 1410.

A bill to provide for the conveyance of certain Federal land \nin the State of Oregon to the Confederated Tribes of Coos, Lower \nUmpqua, and Siuslaw Indians; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce two bills that \nare aimed at righting past wrongs and fostering the self-sufficiency of \nproud nations. The Canyon Mountain Land Conveyance Act of 2013 and the \nOregon Coastal Land Conveyance Act will provide homelands for the Cow \nCreek Band of Umpqua Tribe of Indians and the Confederated Tribes of \nCoos, Lower Umpqua, and Siuslaw Indians, respectively--two tribes that \nare currently without a land base or that have only a nominal land \nbase. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Merkley.\n  Our country's official policies toward its native peoples have \nchanged over time since the founding of the United States. When \nEuropean settlers came to American shores, they recognized that the \nlands on which our Nation now sits were occupied by millions of people \norganized by hundreds of governments, and these European colonial \npowers respected these governments as fellow sovereigns. In the late \n1700's, when our great Nation was born, it followed suit, making \ntreaties with the governments of the various tribes and aiming to get \nalong with them to ensure peace and prosperity for all. As our Nation \nbecame more powerful, its policies toward Native peoples and \ngovernments shifted with the political tides of those times. If you \nexamine history books, some of the darkest episodes in our history can \nbe found in the chapters written about our federal government's \ntreatment of the first Americans.\n  Our Nation's past is littered with failed policies toward its first \npeoples, and one of those failed policies--that to which scholars refer \nto as, ``Termination''--had a profoundly negative impact on my State. \nDuring the 1950's, the federal government was not in the business of \nhonoring the treaties it made with the Indian tribes nor was it \ninterested in living up to its trust responsibility toward its first \npeoples. Importantly, and as an aside, the tribes had bargained for \nthese rights in exchange for the millions of acres of lands ceded to \nthe United States to enable our westward expansion. At that time, our \nofficial Federal stance was focused on terminating the government-to-\ngovernment relationships between tribal governments and the United \nStates. In my own State of Oregon, several tribes west of the Cascade \nMountains were terminated, including the two that are the subjects of \nthe bills I am introducing today. The Termination Era had tragic \neffects on those tribes that lost Federal recognition. Members of \nterminated tribes struggled to retain their cultural and religious \nidentities and to survive in a new landscape in which federal programs \nfor their health, education, and housing did not exist.\n  The Termination Era was such a disaster that the Federal Government \nformally rebuked it a mere twenty years later when Presidents Johnson \nan Nixon ushered in the Self-Determination Era. Now, our Federal stance \ntoward tribes is one that respects tribal sovereignty and supports a \ntribe's right to determine its own destiny while at the same time, \nfulfilling our duty as trustee to the various tribes. Our Federal \npolicy of self-determination has been lauded by scholars as being the \nonly Federal Indian policy that has succeeded in benefitting our native \npeoples. Self-Determination Era policies have resulted in an economic \nboom all over Indian Country as tribes have used Federal assistance to \ncreate jobs for Indians and non-Indians alike all across the Nation, \nmuch of the time in rural areas where economic opportunities would \notherwise not exist. Many of the tribes in my State, for instance, have \nbeen able to build their economies, become more self-sufficient and \nprovide valuable goods and services as well as jobs to surrounding \ncommunity members.\n  For a tribe to fully exercise its governmental powers--to protect and \nnurture its members, to retain its cultural and religious heritage, and \nto grow its economy--it needs a land base. Even though the Cow Creek \nand Coos tribes were restored to Federal recognition in the 1980's, \nthey still have not been given back any of their former land from which \nthey can exercise their inherent authority as sovereigns. My bills \nwould provide home bases for these tribes from which they can flourish.\n  The bills I am introducing today convey 17,826 and 14,804 acres of \nland that is now managed by the Bureau of Land Management, to the \nSecretary of the Interior to hold in trust for the Cow Creek Band of \nUmpqua Tribe of Indians and the Confederated Tribes of Coos, Lower \nUmpqua, and Siuslaw Indians, respectively. The bills specify that \ncommercial forestry activities taking place on the land must be done \npursuant to all applicable federal laws, and because both of the tribes \nalready own casinos, they specify that the land cannot be used for \ngaming purposes. Lastly, to address the concerns of counties over lost \ntimber revenues from the Oregon and California Railroad lands within \nthe conveyances, the bills contain provisions ensuring there will be no \nnet loss of O lands to the counties.\n  I want to thank the tribes, counties, and other stakeholders for \nworking together to find the common ground which made these bills a \nreality.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bills be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bills were ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1414\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 207\n\n       Whereas the members of the airborne forces of the Armed \n     Forces of the United States have a long and honorable history \n     as bold and fierce warriors who, for the national security of \n     the United States and the defense of freedom and peace, \n     project the ground combat power of the United States by air \n     transport to the far reaches of the battle area and to the \n     far corners of the world;\n       Whereas the experiment of the United States with airborne \n     operations began on June 25, 1940, when the Army Parachute \n     Test Platoon was first authorized by the Department of War, \n     and 48 volunteers began training in July 1940;\n       Whereas August 16 marks the anniversary of the first \n     official Army parachute jump, which took place on August 16, \n     1940, to test the innovative concept of inserting United\n\n[[Page S6132]]\n\n     States ground combat forces behind a battle line by means of \n     a parachute;\n       Whereas the success of the Army Parachute Test Platoon in \n     the days immediately before the entry of the United States \n     into World War II validated the airborne operational concept \n     and led to the creation of a formidable force of airborne \n     formations that included the 11th, 13th, 17th, 82nd, and \n     101st Airborne Divisions;\n       Whereas, included in those divisions, and among other \n     separate formations, were many airborne combat, combat \n     support, and combat service support units that served with \n     distinction and achieved repeated success in armed \n     hostilities during World War II, and provide the lineage and \n     legacy of many airborne units throughout the Armed Forces;\n       Whereas the achievements of the airborne units during World \n     War II prompted the evolution of those units into a \n     diversified force of parachute and air-assault units that, \n     over the years, have fought in Korea, Vietnam, Grenada, \n     Panama, the Persian Gulf region, and Somalia, and have \n     engaged in peacekeeping operations in Lebanon, the Sinai \n     Peninsula, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Bosnia, and Kosovo;\n       Whereas, since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, \n     the members of the United States airborne forces, including \n     members of the XVIII Airborne Corps, the 82nd Airborne \n     Division, the 101st Airborne Division, the 173rd Airborne \n     Brigade Combat Team, the 4th Brigade Combat Team (Airborne) \n     of the 25th Infantry Division, the 75th Ranger Regiment, \n     special operations forces of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, \n     and Air Force, and other units of the Armed Forces, have \n     demonstrated bravery and honor in combat, stability, and \n     training operations in Afghanistan and Iraq;\n       Whereas the modern-day airborne forces also include other \n     elite forces composed of airborne trained and qualified \n     special operations warriors, including Army Special Forces, \n     Marine Corps Reconnaissance units, Navy SEALs, and Air Force \n     combat control and pararescue teams;\n       Whereas, of the members and former members of the United \n     States airborne forces, thousands have achieved the \n     distinction of making combat jumps, dozens have earned the \n     Medal of Honor, and hundreds have earned the Distinguished \n     Service Cross, the Silver Star, or other decorations and \n     awards for displays of heroism, gallantry, intrepidity, and \n     valor;\n       Whereas the members and former members of the United States \n     airborne forces are all members of a proud and honorable \n     tradition that, together with the special skills and \n     achievements of those members, distinguishes the members as \n     intrepid combat parachutists, air assault forces, special \n     operation forces, and, in the past, glider troops;\n       Whereas individuals from every State in the United States \n     have served gallantly in the airborne forces, and each State \n     is proud of the contributions of its paratrooper veterans \n     during the many conflicts faced by the United States;\n       Whereas the history and achievements of the members and \n     former members of the United States airborne forces warrant \n     special expressions of the gratitude of the people of the \n     United States; and\n       Whereas, since the airborne forces, past and present, \n     celebrate August 16 as the anniversary of the first official \n     jump by the Army Parachute Test Platoon, August 16 is an \n     appropriate day to recognize as National Airborne Day: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates August 16, 2013, as ``National Airborne \n     Day'';

Con. Res. 21\n\n       Whereas safe and responsible production, transportation, \n     and use of oil and petroleum products provide the foundation \n     of the energy economy of the United States, helping to secure \n     and advance the economic prosperity, national security, and \n     overall quality of life in the United States;\n       Whereas the Keystone XL pipeline would provide short- and \n     long-term employment opportunities and related labor income \n     benefits, such as government revenues associated with taxes;\n       Whereas the State of Nebraska has thoroughly reviewed and \n     approved the proposed Keystone XL pipeline reroute, \n     concluding that the concerns of Nebraskans have had a major \n     influence on the pipeline reroute and that the reroute will \n     have minimal environmental impacts;\n       Whereas the Department of State and other Federal agencies \n     have conducted extensive studies and analysis over a long \n     period of time on the technical, environmental, social, and \n     economic impact of the proposed Keystone XL pipeline;\n       Whereas assessments by the Department of State found that \n     the Keystone XL pipeline is ``not likely to impact the amount \n     of crude oil produced from the oil sands'' and that \n     ``approval or denial of the proposed Project is unlikely to \n     have a substantial impact on the rate of development in the \n     oil sands'';\n       Whereas the Department of State found that the incremental \n     life cycle greenhouse gas emissions associated with the \n     Keystone XL project are estimated in the range of 0.07 to \n     0.83 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents, with \n     the upper end of this range representing 12/1,000 of 1 \n     percent of the 6,702,000,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide \n     emitted in the United States in 2011;\n       Whereas after extensive evaluation of potential impact to \n     land and water resources along the 875-mile proposed route of \n     the Keystone XL pipeline, the Department of State found, \n     ``The analyses of potential impacts associated with \n     construction and normal operation of the proposed Project \n     suggest that there would be no significant impacts to most \n     resources along the proposed Project route (assuming Keystone \n     complies with all laws and required conditions and \n     measures).'';\n       Whereas the Department of State found that ``[s]pills \n     associated with the proposed Project that enter the \n     environment are expected to be rare and relatively small'' \n     and that ``there is no evidence of increased corrosion or \n     other pipeline threat due to viscosity'' of diluted bitumen \n     oil that will be transported by the Keystone XL pipeline;\n       Whereas, the National Research Council convened a special \n     expert panel to review the risk of transporting diluted \n     bitumen by pipeline and issued a report in June 2013 to the \n     Department of Transportation in which the National Research \n     Council found that existing literature indicates that \n     transportation of diluted bitumen poses no increased risk of \n     pipeline failure;\n       Whereas plans to incorporate 57 project-specific special \n     conditions relating to the design, construction, and \n     operations of the Keystone XL pipeline led the Department of \n     State to find that the pipeline will have ``a degree of \n     safety over any other typically constructed domestic oil \n     pipeline''; and\n       Whereas, the Department of State found that oil destined to \n     be shipped through the pipeline from the oil sands region of \n     Canada and oil shale deposits in the United States would \n     otherwise move by other modes of transportation if the \n     Keystone XL pipeline is not built; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) construction of the Keystone XL pipeline will promote \n     sound investment in the infrastructure of the United States;\n\n[[Page S6134]]\n\n       (2) construction of the Keystone XL pipeline will promote \n     energy security in North America and will generate an \n     increase in private sector jobs that will benefit both the \n     region surrounding the Keystone XL pipeline and the United \n     States as a whole; and\n       (3) completion of the Keystone XL pipeline is in the \n     national interest of the United States.\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about \nthe Keystone XL Pipeline. I am going to submit a concurrent resolution \nthat I am sponsoring with Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, but before I do \nthat, I want to talk specifically in terms of the Keystone XL Pipeline \nand correcting the record. I am correcting the record relative to \nstatements the administration has made recently about the project.\n  As we all know, the Obama administration has been reviewing this \nproject for 5 years. The initial application was submitted by \nTransCanada, the parent company, in September of 2008, and we are now \nalmost in August of 2013. So in addition to delaying the project, they \nare also putting out false information. President Obama and Treasury \nSecretary Lew presented information this week on the Keystone Pipeline \nthat is wrong, and today I want to correct the record.\n  I want to quote directly from an interview President Obama conducted \nand reported in the New York Times on Saturday. I am going to read from \nthat transcript because it goes to a number of issues in terms of jobs \nand energy development as well as the requirements the administration \nsays need to be addressed for the Keystone Pipeline. However, I think \nthe company has addressed those issues in great detail.\n  Again, this is the transcript from the New York Times. Also, the \ninterview was conducted last week when the President was on his jobs \ntour.\n  The interviewer said:\n\n       A couple of other quick subjects that are economic-related. \n     Keystone pipeline--Republicans especially talked about that \n     as a big job creator. You've said that you would approve it \n     only if you could be assured it would not significantly \n     exacerbate carbon in the atmosphere. Is there anything that \n     Canada could do or the oil companies could do to offset that \n     as a way of helping you reaching that decision?\n\n  That was the question asked of the President. The President \nresponded:\n\n       Well, first of all, Michael, [the interviewer] Republicans \n     have said that this would be a big jobs generator. There is \n     no evidence that that's true. And my hope would be that any \n     reporter who is looking at the facts would take the time to \n     confirm that the most realistic estimates are this might \n     create maybe 2,000 jobs during the construction of the \n     pipeline--\n\n  That is the Keystone Pipeline.\n\n     which might take a year or two--and then after that we're \n     talking somewhere between 50 and 100 [chuckles] jobs in an \n     economy of 150 million working people.\n\n  The interviewer goes on:\n\n       Yet there are a number of unions who want you to approve \n     this.\n\n  Mr. Obama:\n\n       Well, look, they might like to see 2,000 jobs initially. \n     But that is a blip relative to the need.\n       So what we also know is, is that that oil is going to be \n     piped down to the Gulf to be sold on the world oil markets, \n     so it does not bring down gas prices here in the United \n     States. In fact, it might actually cause some gas prices in \n     the Midwest to go up where currently they can't ship some of \n     that oil to world markets.\n       Now, having said that, there is a potential benefit for us \n     integrating further with a reliable ally to the north our \n     energy supplies.\n       But I meant what I said; I will evaluate this based on \n     whether or not this is going to significantly contribute to \n     carbon in our atmosphere. And there is no doubt that Canada \n     at the source in those tar sands could potentially be doing \n     more to mitigate carbon releases.\n\n  The interviewer asked:\n\n       And if they did, could that offset concerns about the \n     pipeline itself?\n\n  To which the President responded:\n\n       We haven't seen specific ideas or plans. But all of that \n     will go into the mix in terms of John Kerry's decision or \n     recommendation on this issue.\n\n  That was the key part of the interview I want to address in my \ncomments.\n  There are three points I would like to make. The first one is jobs. \nPresident Obama says the project will create 2,000 jobs during \nconstruction. Then he says maybe 50 or so after that, and he kind of \nchuckles as he says that.\n  The first question is: Where does that number come from? Where is he \ngetting his number? His own State Department has a very different \nnumber. They say it is going to create more than 42,000 jobs during \nconstruction. They didn't say 2,000 jobs during construction, but more \nthan 42,000 jobs during construction.\n  I will read from the State Department report. It is a draft from the \nenvironmental impact statement which came out on March 1, 2013. The \nState Department report says:\n\n       Including direct, indirect, and induced effects, the \n     proposed Project would potentially support approximately \n     42,100 average annual jobs across the United States over a 1-\n     to 2-year construction period.\n\n  That is right out of the report. The State Department goes on to talk \nabout some of the other employment benefits created by the Keystone \nproject.\n\n       This employment would potentially translate into \n     approximately $2.05 billion in earnings. Direct expenditures \n     such as construction and material costs . . . would total \n     approximately $3.3 billion. Short-term revenues from sources \n     such as sales and use taxes would total approximately $65 \n     million in states that levy such a tax.\n\n  So you are getting tax revenues and $65 million as well.\n\n       Yields from fuel and other taxes could not be calculated, \n     but would provide some additional economic benefit to host \n     countries and states.\n\n  There is the environmental impact as to the employment right out of \nthe State Department report. We have to ask: Why is President Obama \ntalking about a number like 2,000? It appears the number he is quoting \ncomes from opponents of the projects. Rather than taking his own State \nDepartment numbers--done after 5 years of study--he is quoting numbers \nwhich are wrong from opponents of the project. Again, don't take my \nword for it.\n  Recently the Washington Post--in their fact-check article--stated \nthat President Obama appeared to be using numbers from opponents of the \nproject rather than from his own State Department.\n  So why would he do that? Why would he take numbers from opponents \nrather than the State Department?\n  Well, here is what Sean McGarvey, president of North America's \nBuilding Trades Unions, had to say about it in a statement he issued \nseveral days ago. According to Sean McGarvey, president of North \nAmerica's Building Trade Unions:\n\n       America's Building Trade Unions were disappointed to see \n     that the President chose to minimize the importance of jobs \n     for construction workers and to use employment figures \n     promulgated by special interests and activist billionaires \n     rather than his own Department of State's findings that the \n     proposed Keystone XL Pipeline would support approximately \n     42,100 average annual jobs across the United States over a 1- \n     to 2-year construction period.\n\n  But the President goes on--it is not just the jobs number that is \nincorrect. The President also stated this in that New York Times \ninterview:\n\n       What we also know is, is that that oil is going to be piped \n     down to the Gulf to be sold on the world oil markets, so it \n     does not bring down gas prices here in the United States. In \n     fact, it might actually cause some gas prices in the Midwest \n     to go up where currently they can't ship some of that oil to \n     world markets.\n\n  So he is saying the oil won't be used in the United States and, in \nfact, it might cause gas prices to go up. But now he is contradicting a \nreport from his own Department of Energy. His own Department of Energy \naddressed those very issues back in June of 2011. They issued a report, \nand that report forecasted that the oil will be used in the United \nStates and, further, that it will reduce the price of fuel at the pump \nfor Midwest consumers. I will quote from that report. Again, this is a \nreport from the Department of Energy that was provided in June of 2011.\n\n       Without a surplus of heavy oil in (the Gulf Coast), there \n     would be no economic incentive to ship Canadian oil sands to \n     Asia via Port Arthur (in Texas). Many of these (Gulf Coast) \n     refineries rely on declining supplies of Mexican and \n     Venezuelan heavy crudes. . . . They would be natural \n     customers for increased supplies of Canadian dilbit (oil \n     sands oil). . . . The Gulf Coast appetite for Canadian oil \n     sands . . . will be much higher than can be supplied by just \n     the Keystone XL Pipeline.\n\n  So they are saying it will be used in the United States.\n  Concerning the cost of fuel to customers, DOE said:\n\n       With substantial additional volumes of light-sweet and \n     other crudes accessible to Gulf Coast refineries, (West Texas \n     Intermediate) prices would increase, Brent, Argus\n\n[[Page S6135]]\n\n     and other market crude prices would decline. Crude costs to \n     (East Coast) and (Gulf Coast) refineries would be lower.\n\n  Here is the key sentence from this section:\n\n       Gasoline prices in all markets served by (East and Gulf \n     Coast) refineries would be lower, including the Midwest.\n\n  So the Department of Energy in its report specifically states that \nthe oil will be used in the United States--we are a net importer of \ncrude oil--and that gas prices would be lower, not higher. As I said \nearlier, the State Department in the EIS said the job number will be \n42,000, not 2,000.\n  The President then concludes the interview by essentially telling \nCanada what they should do in terms of their regulatory requirements. \nHe says:\n\n       And there is no doubt that Canada at the source in those \n     tar sands could potentially be doing more to mitigate carbon \n     release.\n\n  The interviewer then asks:\n\n       And if they did, could that offset the concerns about the \n     pipeline itself?\n\n  President Obama declines to indicate any specifics, but he says \nessentially all of that will go into the mix for the decision on \nwhether to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline.\n  So here we are. After 5 years--after 5 years of delay, the President \nis talking about adding new requirements to the project. He is talking \nabout adding those requirements in another country--our closest friend \nand ally, Canada--or I guess he is essentially saying he would turn \ndown the project--a project that actually reduces greenhouse gas \nbecause there is less greenhouse gas if we move that oil by pipeline \nthan if it is moved by truck, by train, or by tanker.\n  Furthermore, perhaps the biggest irony is that he is imposing this \ntype of regulatory barrier at the same time he is on a jobs tour, which \ncreated some problems for his Cabinet members as well. For example, \nJack Lew was on ``Fox News Sunday'' with Chris Wallace, and he got it \nwrong on Keystone as well last Sunday. The following is part of that \ntranscript. Again, this was ``Fox News Sunday'' with Chris Wallace and \nJack Lew. Wallace asked this question:\n\n       Let me ask you one question. If you're so interested in \n     creating more jobs, why not approve the Keystone Pipeline \n     which would create tens of thousands of jobs, sir?\n\n  Lew responds:\n\n       Chris, I think, as you know, the Keystone Pipeline is being \n     reviewed. It's been in the process that was slowed down \n     because--\n\n  Wallace then says:\n\n       Several years it's being reviewed. I think what, three, \n     four years.\n\n  Lew responds:\n\n       It was--there were some political games that were played \n     that took it off the trail, past its completion. When \n     Republicans put it out there as something that was put on a \n     timetable where it could not be resolved, it caused a delay. \n     We are getting to the end of the review and we'll have to see \n     where that review is. But I think playing political \n     games with something like this is a mistake.\n  So he is saying that somehow the Republicans were playing political \ngames and that slowed down the project and that is why it has been in \nreview for 5 years. Five years it has been in review.\n  Well, as for Secretary Lew's remarks on ``Fox News Sunday,'' we need \nonly to let the facts--especially the dates--speak for themselves. \nSecretary Lew claimed that the Keystone XL project was delayed because \nRepublicans politicized it. I would be happy to share with them a \nletter I received in the summer of 2011 from Secretary of State Hillary \nClinton. In that letter the Secretary assured me that the Department \nwas poised to make a permitting decision on the Keystone XL project by \nDecember of that year--December of 2011.\n  I have the letter here. It is dated July 26, 2011. It is addressed to \nSenator Hoeven. It says: ``Thank you for your letter regarding the \nproposed Keystone XL Pipeline.'' It goes on to make various comments. \nThe key line in the letter is this: ``We expect to make a decision on \nwhether to grant or deny the permit before the end of the year.'' This \nis for the Keystone XL Pipeline project from, at that time, Secretary \nof State Clinton. Instead, however, during the 2012 Presidential \nelection--less than a year away in November--President Obama intervened \nto postpone that decision until after the election. Then and only then \ndid I press to seek legislatively for a timely decision on the Keystone \nXL Pipeline and introduced legislation, which we passed, calling for a \ndecision within 60 days, which the President declined to make. So \nclearly the delay of 5 years is because the administration has refused \nto make a decision and not for any other reason.\n  It is not only time to make a decision on the Keystone Pipeline, it \nis far past time. That is exactly what the American people want. As a \nmatter of fact, in a recent--the most recent poll on the Keystone \nPipeline project, Harris Interactive Poll, 82 percent of Americans \nsupport approving the Keystone XL Pipeline--82 percent. The President \nhas continued to review it and talk about more requirements. He has \nprovided incorrect information on the jobs and whether the oil will be \nused here and the impact on gas prices. But 82 percent of Americans \nwant this project approved.\n  It is about energy. It is about jobs. It is about economic activity. \nIt is about energy security for our country. That is why, as I conclude \nhere today, I wish to submit for the Senate Record today, along with \nSenator Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, a concurrent resolution expressing \nthe sense of the Congress that construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline \nand the Federal approvals required for construction of the Keystone XL \nPipeline are in the national interests of the United States. \nEssentially, with this concurrent resolution, what we are saying is \nthat the Keystone XL Pipeline is in the national interests of the \nUnited States and that the administration needs to approve it. It is a \nbipartisan resolution, and we will seek to have it approved here in the \nSenate and approved in the House as well. This is in addition to \nbipartisan legislation I have already introduced which would approve \nthe project congressionally.\n  The simple point is this: We need to keep the push on to get this \nproject approved, whether it is with a joint resolution of Congress in \nsupport of the project, getting the President to make a decision and to \nmake a favorable decision and to do it now instead of continuing to \npostpone after 5 years or whether Congress steps forward and approves \nthe project directly through legislation I have already submitted.\n  We need to get this project done for the American people. It really \nis about jobs. It is about economic growth and activity. It is about \nenergy for our country and getting this country to the point where we \nare energy independent, energy secure, where we don't need to rely on \noil from the Middle East. That is why 82 percent of Americans in the \nmost recent poll across this country are saying this is the kind of \nproject we need. Mr. President, step up and get it done for the \nAmerican people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/31/senate-section/article/S6135-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6135]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1832.

Res. 156) expressing the sense of the \n     Senate on the 10-year anniversary of NATO Allied Command \n     Transformation.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution, which had been reported from the Committee on Foreign \nRelations, with an amendment and an amendment to the preamble, as \nfollows:\n  (Strike out all after the resolving clause and insert the part \nprinted in italic.)\n  (Strike the preamble and insert the part printed in italic.)\n       Whereas, on June 19, 2003, NATO's Allied Command \n     Transformation (ACT), was formally established to increase \n     military effectiveness and prepare the Alliance for future \n     security challenges;\n       Whereas, on June 19, 2013, the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization (NATO) will celebrate the 10-year anniversary of \n     the establishment of NATO ACT;\n       Whereas the security of the United States and its NATO \n     allies have been enhanced by the establishment and continued \n     work of NATO ACT;\n       Whereas, for the past 10 years, ACT has been leading NATO's \n     military transformation, and providing relevant and timely \n     support to NATO operations, while developing partnerships \n     around the globe to adapt to the changing global security \n     environment;\n       Whereas ACT is the only NATO headquarters in the United \n     States, and the only permanent NATO headquarters outside of \n     Europe;\n       Whereas ACT provides state of the art education, training, \n     and application of best practices and lessons learned from \n     past operations, and equips Alliance troops with the tools \n     they need to win today's wars;\n       Whereas ACT improves NATO's defense planning and develops \n     compatible equipment and common standards necessary to keep \n     Alliance capabilities aligned;\n       Whereas NATO ACT has been integral to a NATO mission of \n     promoting a Europe that is whole, undivided, free, and at \n     peace;\n       Whereas NATO ACT strengthened the ability of NATO to \n     perform a full range of missions throughout the world;\n       Whereas NATO ACT has provided crucial support and \n     participation in the NATO International Security Assistance \n     Force in Afghanistan, as NATO endeavors to help the people of \n     Afghanistan create the conditions necessary for security and \n     successful development and reconstruction;\n       Whereas ACT employs personnel from 26 of the 28 NATO member \n     nations and six of the 41 NATO Partner nations and \n     contributes more than $100,000,000 annually to the local \n     economy;\n       Whereas NATO has been the cornerstone of transatlantic \n     security cooperation and an enduring instrument for promoting \n     stability in Europe and throughout the world for over 60 \n     years, representing the vital transatlantic bond of \n     solidarity between the United States and Europe, as NATO \n     nations share similar values and interests and are committed \n     to the maintenance of democratic principles;\n       Whereas the Chicago Summit Communique affirms that all NATO \n     members ``are determined that NATO will continue to play its \n     unique and essential role in ensuring our common defense and \n     security'' and that NATO ``continues to be effective in a \n     changing world, against new threats, with new capabilities \n     and new partners'';\n       Whereas, through the Alliance, the United States and Europe \n     are effective and steadfast partners in security, and ACT is \n     well positioned to contribute to the strength of the Alliance \n     on both continents;\n       Whereas NATO ACT has done much to help NATO meet the global \n     challenges of the 21st century, including the threat of \n     terrorism, the spread of weapons of mass destruction, \n     instability caused by failed states, and threats to global \n     energy security; and\n       Whereas the 10th anniversary of NATO ACT is an opportunity \n     to enhance and more deeply entrench those principles, which \n     continue to bind the alliance together and guide our efforts \n     today: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) celebrates the 10th anniversary of the establishment of \n     NATO Allied Command Transformation (NATO ACT);\n       (2) recognizes NATO ACT's leading role in transforming \n     Alliance forces and capabilities, using new concepts such as \n     the NATO Response Force and new doctrines in order to improve \n     the Alliance's military effectiveness;\n       (3) expresses appreciation for the continuing and close \n     partnership between the United States Government and NATO to \n     transform the Alliance;\n       (4) remembers the 64 years NATO has served to ensure peace, \n     security, and stability in Europe throughout the world, and \n     urges the United States Government to continue to seek new \n     ways to deepen and expand its important relationships with \n     NATO;\n       (5) recognizes the service of the brave men and women who \n     have served to safeguard the freedom and security of the \n     United States and the whole of the transatlantic alliance;\n       (6) honors the sacrifices of United States personnel, \n     allies of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and \n     partners in Afghanistan;\n       (7) recognizes the outstanding partnership between the \n     local community in Norfolk, Virginia and NATO personnel \n     assigned to ACT;\n       (8) reaffirms that NATO, through the new Strategic Concept, \n     is committed to helping the Alliance adapt and prepare for \n     the complex and demanding future security;\n       (9) urges all NATO members to take concrete steps to \n     implement the Strategic Concept and to utilize the taskings \n     from the 2012 NATO summit in Chicago, Illinois, to address \n     current NATO operations, future capabilities and burden-\n     sharing issues, and strengthen the relationship between NATO \n     and partners around the world;\n       (10) calls upon the President to use the momentum of the \n     occasion of the 10th anniversary of NATO ACT--\n       (A) to engage each of the member states of the North \n     Atlantic Treaty Organization in a dialogue about the long-\n     term health of the Alliance, and strongly encourage each of \n     the member states to make a serious effort to protect defense \n     budgets from further reductions, better allocate and \n     coordinate the resources presently available, and recommit to \n     spending at least 2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) \n     on defense; and\n       (B) to examine and report to Congress on recommendations \n     that will lead to a stronger Alliance in terms of military \n     capability and readiness across the 28 member states, with \n     particular focus on the smaller member states; and\n       (11) conveys appreciation for the steadfast partnership \n     between NATO and the United States.\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I further ask unanimous consent that the committee-\nreported substitute be agreed to; the resolution, as amended, be agreed \nto; the amendment to the preamble be agreed to; the preamble, as \namended, be agreed to; and the motions to reconsider be considered made \nand laid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, 3 years ago Congress passed a massive \nhealth insurance law which didn't have a single Republican vote, and it \nhad significant opposition by the public.\n  In an administration proclaiming to be the most transparent ever, \nthis 2,700-page bill was rammed through Congress in the early morning \nhours on Christmas Eve. Even then-Speaker of the House Pelosi said \nCongress had to pass this bill so that we could find out what was in \nit.\n  Well, we did. It was passed, and the American people are not liking \nwhat they have discovered.\n  While the President promised the Affordable Care Act would lower \nhealth care costs and strengthen our health care system, the law, \ninstead, is increasing health insurance premiums, slowing economic \nrecovery, and hindering job creation. We should not allow the \nadministration to continue to ignore this reality. We must permanently \ndelay the Affordable Care Act.\n\n[[Page S6139]]\n\n  Since its enactment in 2010, 18 components of the health care law \nhave been changed, cancelled, or delayed. The President downplays the \nlaw's substantial defects by characterizing them as ``glitches and \nbumps'' that are to be expected. He also claims that the Affordable \nCare Act critics are responsible for the law's broken promises by \narguing that the problem is with ``folks out there who are actively \nworking to make this law fail.'' Meanwhile, the Affordable Care Act is \nslowly unraveling.\n  Every day brings new information about missed deadlines, funding \nshortfalls, soaring health insurance premium rates, and a technical \nimplementation that is floundering. Is it any wonder that this law \ncontinues to be publicly unpopular?\n  With the majority of mandates, fees, and taxes taking effect in 2014, \nwe are already beginning to see the alarming effects of the law on \nindividuals, families, employers, and on our economy. It is one broken \npromise after another.\n  Promise No. 1. In attempting to convince the American people that the \nACA was good, the President promised it would ``save families $2,500 in \nthe coming years.'' But since 2008, the average American family has \nseen health insurance premiums rise more than $3,000. Nonpartisan \nactuaries estimate that national health spending will grow at an \naverage rate of close to 6 percent annually between 2011 and 2021. As \nnational spending ticks up, American families will continue to see \ntheir monthly premiums go up.\n  States are beginning to release details on the rates consumers will \npay for ACA-related health insurance starting on January 1. An \nunfortunate pattern is emerging--ACA-mandated insurance is going to \nincrease costs for many Americans.\n  Recently, the State of Indiana announced that insurance rates will \nincrease 72 percent for consumers in the individual market. Consumers \nin Ohio, Florida, South Carolina, and Maryland have also announced they \nare expecting to see their premiums increase significantly. Just \nyesterday, the Georgia insurance commissioner asked the Department of \nHealth and Human Services to extend the deadline to approve health \nplans in their State because some rates were expected in Georgia to \nrise by 198 percent.\n  In my home State of Kansas, I consistently hear concerns from \nindividuals, business owners, and even local government officials about \nthe impending costs of the Affordable Care Act.\n  For example, rural Kansas school districts and special education co-\nops, whose budgets are already stretched thin, will now be forced to \ncover the costs associated with the law. This has resulted in \nreductions in employees' hours and may trigger layoffs in order for the \ndistricts to avoid significant ACA-related penalties.\n  It is sad to visit with the director of a special education co-op \nonly to learn that less services are going to be provided to special \nneeds students because of the costs associated with the Affordable Care \nAct.\n  The American people were promised savings and security. Instead, we \nare experiencing less of both. The Affordable Care Act is leaving \nAmericans with less options and simply unaffordable care.\n  Promise No. 2. In 2009, the President said:\n\n       No matter how we reform health care, we will keep this \n     promise: If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep \n     your doctor, period.\n\n  Reality has since whittled down this promise dramatically. If you go \nto the Affordable Care Act Web site today, you will find this far less \nconfident statement:\n\n       Depending on the plan you choose in the Marketplace, you \n     may be able to keep your current doctor.\n\n  Even large labor unions have recently criticized the President and \ncongressional Democrats for breaking this promise. Notably, the \nNational Treasury Employees Union, the union that represents most IRS \nemployees, is urging its members to write their elected officials to \noppose any effort that would force them to participate in the health \ninsurance exchanges.\n  Further, several unions stated:\n\n       When you and the President sought our support for the \n     Affordable Care Act (ACA), you pledged that if we liked the \n     health plans we have now, we could keep them. Sadly, that \n     promise is under threat.\n\n  And another statement:\n\n       [A]pproximately 3 million laborers, retirees, and their \n     families now face the very real prospect of losing their \n     health benefits. This, I must remind you, was something that \n     you promised would not happen.\n\n  Promise No. 3. The President indicated that the Affordable Care Act \nwould ``lower costs for . . . the federal government, reducing our \ndeficit by over $1 trillion in the next two decades. It is paid for. It \nis fiscally responsible.''\n  The only way the Affordable Care Act will reduce deficits is by \ngrossly increasing the taxes and fees associated with this law. One \nwonders how anyone believed at the time that the new entitlement \nprogram would ever save money.\n  These broken promises are more than just words. The administration's \nfalse starts and early failures in implementing the Affordable Care Act \nare just the beginning. The harm this law will do to individuals, \nfamilies, and businesses will continue to emerge. In less than 3 \nmonths, individuals will be asked to start enrolling in a health \ninsurance exchange when insurance rates, coverage requirements, and \nsubsidy amounts are still largely unknown. And, increasingly, the \nquestion being asked is, What happens to individuals required to buy \nhealth insurance or face penalties if the exchanges are not ready on \ntime?\n  I am the ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on \nLabor, Health and Human Services. I offered two amendments to the \nfiscal year 2014 bill that would bring some certainty to this \noverarching issue.\n  First, I offered an amendment to codify the administration's decision \nto delay the employer mandate. While many of my colleagues on the \nDemocratic side issued press releases praising the administration's \ndecision to delay, when asked to affirmatively vote in committee to \ndelay for 1 year, they all voted no. The amendment failed on a straight \nparty-line vote.\n  The second amendment I offered delayed the implementation and \nenforcement of the individual mandate for 1 year. While I support the \ndelay of the employer mandate, in that decision, like it or not, the \nadministration undermined its own credibility in stating that the \nAffordable Care Act would be implemented on time, as promised. We \nshould not, and cannot, require individuals to risk their health care \ncoverage by signing up for an unworkable program with a dubious \nfuture. Unfortunately, my colleagues--again, on the Democratic side--\ndisagreed. They refused to extend the exemption the President granted \nto businesses to families and individuals--to all Americans.\n\n  The evidence continues to show that the Affordable Care Act is so \nlarge and convoluted that it cannot be implemented into practice. \nReports from State actuaries, the Congressional Budget Office, the \nGovernment Accountability Office, and nonpartisan think tanks have \nreached the same conclusion: Almost everything we were told about the \nAffordable Care Act is untrue.\n  We were told 3 years ago that we need to pass the Affordable Care Act \nto find out what is in it. Now we know, and it is not good. We don't \nneed to force American families to endure another 3 years just to see \nhow bad it actually will be.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
