Mr. President, yesterday, we learned our economy \ncontracted for the first time in more than 3 years. This news comes, of \ncourse, after President Obama spent an entire election promising \nAmericans that a return to robust economic growth was right around the \ncorner and little more than 1 week after the President said in his \ninaugural address that ``economic recovery has begun.''\n  I am not so sure the people of Kentucky would agree with that \nassessment, given that the unemployment rate there is still above 8 \npercent. But this is not the first or the second time this White House \nhas oversold the recovery. It is not even the third or fourth time. A \nlot of us remember the ``summer of recovery.'' A lot of us also \nremember when the Vice President promised the stimulus would \n``literally drop-kick'' us out of the recession.\n  Look, if the White House spent nearly as much time trying to actually \nfix the economy as it did claiming it was fixed--and then finding \nexcuses and scapegoats when its premature pronouncements turned out to \nbe false--I suspect the economy would actually be doing better than it \nis today. But the President seems not to have learned that lesson \nbecause, just yesterday, he tried to pin the latest negative economic \nnews on congressional Republicans once again.\n  The President can make any excuse he wants, but it is not going to \nhelp Americans find jobs.\n  One thing the President could have done instead of wasting so much \ntime blaming others would have been to convene the Jobs Council he \ncreated amidst so much fanfare. He has not done that for more than 1 \nyear. In fact, from what I understand, the Council is expected to \nactually disband today after having met only four times since 2011.\n  We have had 4 years of the Obama economy. It has not worked. This \nwould be the time to try something new. But the President seems content \nto simply double down on more of the same. He wants to spend more, \nwhich would only worsen our trillion-dollar deficits. The very same \nPresident who\n\n[[Page S412]]\n\nwarned against raising taxes in a down economy is proposing to raise \ntaxes in a down economy. He is clearly getting a big assist on that \nfront from the chairwoman of the Budget Committee, who says she is \ngoing to include tax hikes in the Senate Democrats' budget plan. That \nis a bad enough idea to begin with, but it is especially \ncounterproductive considering yesterday's dismal growth numbers, \nbecause there are two things we know about tax increases for sure; \nfirst, they reduce jobs and hurt economic growth; second, they distract \nus from addressing the real problem, which is spending.\n  As I have explained repeatedly on the floor over the past 2 weeks, \ngovernment spending is completely out of control--completely out of \ncontrol--and it is projected to get much worse in years to come. Even \nif the President got the additional tax increases he is asking for, we \nstill would not even come close--not even close--to solving the \nproblem. We certainly will not get there by wasting time on poll-tested \nPR gimmicks that will hardly bring in any revenue. Every minute the \nadministration spends talking about corporate jets is 1 less minute we \nhave to discuss serious ways to confront the challenges we face. \nClearly, it is the spending we have to deal with, and now is the \nperfect time to do so.\n  The key to robust recovery is freeing the private sector to grow and \nto create jobs. We can do that by making government more efficient, by \nreforming spending, and by eliminating programs that do not work--which \nhappens to be the very same things we need to do to get our fiscal \nhouse in order.\n\n  Economic growth and debt reduction can actually go hand in hand but \nonly if we pursue the right policies. As a first step, let's stop \nmaking things worse than they already are. Threatening families and \nbusinesses with even more job-killing tax hikes is clearly \ncounterproductive and so is trying to borrow more money from China to \nfund more failed stimulus packages.\n  The President and his allies have had 4 years--4--to put their ideas \ninto practice. Those policies have failed. It is time for a new \napproach. If Democrats are ready to finally get serious--to end the \nblame game and pursue real growth policies--then Republicans are here \nto show them the way forward to a stronger economy and to a more secure \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/31/senate-section/article/S412-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S412]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schatz).

Mr. President, just a brief comment on the statement of my \nfriend, the Republican leader.\n  He continues bad-mouthing the recovery. We are in a recovery. The \nmoral of the fourth quarter is a repudiation of the Republican \nplaybook. Growth went down in the fourth quarter because of reduced \ngovernment spending and a reticence of the private sector, as Congress \nfought over the fiscal cliff. That fight came as a result of the \nRepublicans being so unreasonable. When we were finally able to work \nsomething out that was a compromise, it was good for the economy. The \neconomy was rejecting the austerity and brinksmanship.\n  So let's hope the Republicans will understand that we have to move \nforward, that the Republican playbook of continually complaining about \nspending is something--we know we have to do something with spending. \nWe understand that. But there is more to making our economy recover \nthan just continually harping on what is going on with spending.\n  Everyone recognizes we have to do something with spending, but we \nalso have to do something to have a fair program. Is it fair that to \nthis point all spending cuts have come from nondefense spending? The \nanswer is no. Is it fair that the Republicans continue to want to go \nafter Social Security, Medicare, even food stamps that hits the poorest \nof the poor?\n  Let's start talking about fairness. Even Presidential nominee Romney \nsaid he had all these tax loopholes that he believed should be closed. \nWe agree with Mitt Romney, and we would hope the Republicans would \nagree with their nominee for President. That is where we should be \nlooking--to have a fair approach to what we do with sequestration and \nbalancing the budget.\n\n\n                             The Debt Limit\n\n  Mr. President, later today the Senate will vote on the House-passed \nlegislation to suspend the debt ceiling until this summer and remove \nthe specter of default hanging over the Nation's economy. I expect this \nlegislation will pass on a strong bipartisan vote, sending the message \nloudly and clearly that while we are willing to negotiate, we will not \nengage in another irresponsible debate over whether the U.S. Government \nshould pay its bills.\n  I would remind my Republican colleagues that most of them voted to \nincur the debts now coming due. Suspending the debt limit will not \nauthorize a penny of new spending, but it will ensure we pay the bills \nwe have already incurred.\n  What are some of those bills we have incurred?\n  We have had two wars going on that have been unpaid for with real \nmoney. We borrowed the money. Every Republican voted for these wars. So \nwe should pay our bills.\n  I was reassured by the House Republicans' decision last week to back \noff their reckless threat to hold the debt ceiling hostage. Suspending \nthe debt limit will not authorize a penny of new spending, but it will \nensure we pay the bills we have already incurred.\n  The legislation before the Senate sets an important precedent that \nthe full faith and credit of the United States will no longer be used \nas a pawn to extract painful cuts to Medicare, Social Security, or \nother initiatives that benefit the middle class. A clean debt ceiling \nincrease that allows the United States to meet its existing obligations \nshould be the standard.\n  Congress will continue to work to reduce the deficit but will do it \nwithout the threat of default. We have already made $2\\1/2\\ trillion in \nhistoric, bipartisan deficit reduction--$2\\1/2\\ trillion. Democrats \nbelieve we should do more. It is critical that we use a balanced \napproach that couples smart spending cuts with revenue from the \nwealthiest Americans and from closing the wasteful tax loopholes I have \njust talked about.\n  Obviously, Democrats would prefer a longer suspension of the debt \nceiling, which would provide additional economic security and stability \nas we continue to find ways to decrease the deficit. Raising the \npossibility that the United States could default on its obligations \nevery few months is not an ideal way to run government. But a short-\nterm solution is better than another imminent manufactured crisis.\n  Every Republican admits that default would rock our financial system \nto its core. However, injecting uncertainty into the system every few \nmonths also has a chilling effect on the economy. This insecurity does \nnot just affect big investment banks or wealthy investors, it costs \njobs. All around the country, ordinary Americans with 401(k)s and \ncollege savings accounts are affected. I am glad Republicans set aside \ntheir plan to gamble with default. It was bad politics and even worse \npolicy.\n  Middle-class Americans remember the last time the Republicans put us \nthrough a protracted fight over the debt ceiling in an effort to force \ndeep cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and other programs important to \nthe middle class. Middle-class Americans remember how the tea party-\ndriven Republicans forced the Nation to the brink of default in 2011, \nsending the stock market into a tailspin and prompting a historic \ndowngrade of America's credit rating. Middle-class Americans remember \nhow the economy suffered and our bottom line suffered\n\n[[Page S413]]\n\nwith it. Middle-class Americans remember the consequences of the \nRepublicans' willingness to threaten a national default. I am relived \nthat this time Congress was able to reach a compromise and avert a \nfight so middle-class families can get the certainty they badly need.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/31/senate-section/article/S413-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S413]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, thanks in part to filmmaker Steven \nSpielberg, there is renewed interest today in America's 16th President, \nAbraham Lincoln.\n  A century and a half ago, during one of the most critical times in \nAmerican history, Lincoln faced a nation divided by ideology and war. \nOnly through fierce determination and moral courage was Lincoln able to \npreserve the Union.\n  Today, we again are in an ideological divide. Too often, Congress \nfails to agree on key social and economic issues.\n  Politics is winning out over progress. Like the America of the 1860s, \nthe unwillingness to compromise has crippled our ability to move \nforward as a nation.\n  As we discuss America's fiscal responsibility today, I would like to \nshare the words of Lincoln. One of my favorite quotes is this: ``You \ncannot escape the responsibility of tomorrow by evading it today.''\n  As a nation we have a responsibility to fulfill existing commitments \nto pay our bills, and it is a responsibility we cannot evade. As we \nknow, the Federal Government officially hit its current authorizing \nspending limit--also known as the debt ceiling--on December 31, 2012.\n  Over the past month, the Treasury Secretary has been using \nextraordinary measures to continue funding the government and sending \nout Social Security checks and veterans' benefits. Treasury's action \nonly bought limited time. The debt limit deadline was moved from \nDecember 31 to mid-February or early March. Needless to say, a feeling \nof uncertainty has spread across the country. However, on January 23, \nthe House of Representatives approved a plan to ensure America can meet \nour obligations through May 18.\n  The bill, H.R. 325, which we have before us today, also provides an \nincentive for action on the Federal budget. The legislation includes a \nprovision that would withhold the pay of lawmakers in the House or the \nSenate if their Chamber fails to pass the budget blueprint by April 15.\n  Since 1917, Congress has always taken appropriate action to avoid \ndefaulting on America's bills. We must continue to fulfill our \nresponsibility. We must not fail now. There is too much at stake.\n  Failure to pass this bill will set off an unpredictable financial \ncalamity that would plunge not only the United States but much of the \nworld back into recession and more. Every single American would feel \nthe economic impact. There would be radical cuts in military salaries, \nveterans' programs, Social Security benefits, and education. Tax \nrefunds may not be issued, and our country's credit rating would almost \ncertainly be downgraded significantly.\n  I understand the concern over America's deficits and debt. I share \nthose concerns, and I strongly believe we must develop a long-term plan \nto cut the debt and get America's fiscal house in order.\n  Let me remind you, over the past 2 years we have made real progress \nat cutting deficits and debt. We have done so working together across \nthe aisle.\n  In 2011, we passed $1.4 trillion in spending cuts. Earlier this \nmonth, Congress passed legislation that reduced the deficit by another \n$600 billion. Together, with interest savings, these two actions will \ncut the deficit by about $2.5 trillion over the next 10 years.\n  Add to this the savings from winding down the wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan and the savings to America's Federal budget reach almost \n$3.5 trillion over 10 years--all together $3.5 trillion over 10 years--\nwhich we already are doing as a consequence of winding down the wars in \nIraq and Afghanistan. That is real progress.\n  In the coming weeks we will have to confront the deficit issue again \nwhen sequestration of spending programs starts on March 1. March 27, \nthe day the continuing resolution for appropriations expires, brings \ntough choices. That is why we are here, to make the tough decisions, to \ndo the hard work.\n  The threat of defaulting on our fiscal obligations is extremely \ndangerous. It puts America on unstable ground. We all are aware how our \npolitical brinkmanship of 2011 led to the first ever downgrade of our \ncountry's credit rating. It sent shock waves in stock markets across \nthe globe and nearly crashed the American economy.\n  We have the opportunity today to avoid that calamity. We have the \nopportunity today to avoid another destructive budget battle. H.R. 325 \nensures America can meet our obligations through May 18 and provides \nthe Congress with a necessary calm between fiscal storms.\n  The House of Representatives adopted the bill by a bipartisan vote, \n285 to 144, and it is supported by the administration. The bill before \nus is necessary to remove the threat of default that would throw the \nU.S. economy into chaos. It gives us time to work together on a \nsensible, balanced solution to our Nation's fiscal challenges without \nundermining the Nation's economy. It deserves our support.\n  I congratulate Speaker Boehner on his leadership with regard to this \nissue and the House for its bipartisan approach to a tough but \nnecessary vote. Let's pass this legislation today and move on to the \ndebate over what further deficit reduction options we need to help keep \nAmerica's economy moving forward.\n  In the words of Lincoln: ``The occasion is piled high with \ndifficulty, and we must rise with the occasion.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, right now the Federal deficit stands at \nroughly $16.4 trillion. I don't know how anyone can hear that number \nand not be appalled, nor do I believe there will be, over 10 years, \n$2.5 trillion in deficit reduction. In fact, I don't see any deficit \nreduction except, perhaps, bringing our soldiers back, but that is not \nparticularly deficit reduction since it looks as though we are going to \nhave difficulty maintaining the military with the strength it has had \nin the past.\n  Think about it, $16.4 trillion. It is incredible. The Federal \nGovernment is currently operating with just $25 million of so-called \nheadroom underneath a statutory debt limit which, to be more precise, \nis $16.394 trillion. We are told that we reached the debt ceiling at \nthe beginning of the year, and in order for the government to pay for \nobligations without further borrowing, Treasury has been using so-\ncalled ``extraordinary measures,'' such as changing the finances of \ncertain Federal savings plans.\n  Sadly, the use of such measures has become the norm under this \nadministration and under this Senate majority, where budget and debt \ndecisions are continually made through last-minute, closed-door deals. \nI don't think the American people can stomach another cliff scenario. I \ndon't think they\n\n[[Page S414]]\n\nwant to turn on the news and see another clock counting down to the \nlatest in a string of perfectly avoidable crises.\n  There is a better way to legislate. I am not talking about some novel \nor unheard of approach. I am talking about doing things through the \nregular order. Anyone watching the Senate operate over the last few \nyears probably doesn't know what I am talking about. There is a process \nthat has been established to facilitate compromise and move even \ncontroversial pieces of legislation over the finish line.\n  Under this process bills are assigned to committees where they are \ndebated and discussed in hearings and markups. Committees are able to \nconsider and process proposals before legislation is brought to the \nSenate floor. While this system isn't perfect, moving a bill through \nthe committee greatly improves its prospect for passage in a divided \nSenate.\n  This isn't meant to be a civic lesson. I know my colleagues \nunderstand how the committee process works. As we debate yet another \nmajor piece of legislation that hasn't gone through a committee, I \ndon't think a reminder is out of order. We need to return the Senate to \nregular order, which includes processing budgets through the Senate \nBudget Committee and processing the debt limit through the Senate \nFinance Committee.\n  We are told if we pass this legislation, the administration will be \nable to borrow to be able to pay off incoming obligations until May 19. \nThen, presumably, we will be back to the use of ``extraordinary \nmeasures,'' which as I understand it will get the government through \nthe end of July before we are once again talking about a possible \ndefault.\n  That is not the way to run a government. Prospects of more debt limit \nimpasses and threats of future defaults serve only to elevate \nuncertainty among the American people about whether the Federal \nGovernment will honor its financial obligations. Unfortunately, this \nadministration has continued to play on this uncertainty for political \npurposes. Rather than working with Congress to resolve our fiscal mess, \nthe President throws out suggestions that Social Security recipients \nwould not receive their benefits or that our troops would not get paid. \nIndeed, it seems that the President is more interested in engaging in \npolitical fights and manufacturing straw men than he is in eliminating \nthreats to the fiscal security of our Nation's seniors and our troops.\n  At the same time, we wait for the first Senate budget in 4 years. I \nwas heartened when I heard the news that the Democratic leadership \nplans to move forward with a budget this year. However, I am \ndisappointed by indications that no effort will be made in the budget \nto rein in our unsustainable entitlement programs. I hope that is not \ntrue because, to borrow a phrase from the President, ``We can't wait.'' \nEntitlement reform can't wait.\n  Even the trustees of Social Security and Medicare have stated that \nthe entitlements are unsustainable, and they urge quick action. Those \ntrustees include senior officials in the Obama administration who could \nhardly be viewed as deficit hawks.\n  These are the problems our Nation faces. Our fiscal and economic \nwell-being literally hang in the balance of these debates. If the \nSenate is going to be up to the challenge of fixing these problems, we \nare going to have to start doing things differently. We shouldn't wait \nuntil the Nation's finances reach yet another cliff sometime this \nsummer before we start talking again and addressing our unsustainable \nfiscal situation. That is not what the American people want to see, and \nthat is not the direction in which we should be going.\n  I believe my colleague from Montana feels the same way; that we can \nstart the talks now in committees and do the things we should in \ncommittee and report bills to the floor. Even if we can't support them, \nat least they will be done the right way. A return to regular order \nwould provide a potential solution, but it wouldn't require that we \nbegin work immediately; that we don't just wait until the last minute \nand have these decisions made in the office of the majority leader.\n  Even if we were to pass the stop-gap debt limit suspension measure \nbefore us, there is precious little time for us to act. I have \nsuggested and will continue to suggest that the Senate Finance \nCommittee begin to engage now on a longer term debt limit solution. The \nbill before us would only eliminate the prospect of Federal default \nuntil sometime in the summer. That means if we go through regular \norder, we have only a few months at best to debate, have hearings, \nprocess proposals, and make decisions.\n  I am not under any illusions this process will be easy. If we want to \navoid another cliff scenario in late July, this is the best way to go \nforward. It is the best path forward.\n  We don't need any more last-minute deals to avoid going over cliffs. \nWe certainly don't need any more countdowns or threats of default and \ndowngrades to our Nation's credit rating. Of course, we don't need to \nwait in the hopes that President Obama will finally break his string of \nfailures to arrive at a so-called grand bargain. We have the tools at \nour disposal to address these problems, but, as I said, we need to \nstart now, immediately.\n  As the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, I am committed \nto working with my colleagues on the committee--those on both sides of \nthe aisle--to reach a long-term solution on the debt limit. I believe \nthis process can put us on a path to tax and entitlement reform, which \nis the key to righting our Nation's fiscal course and putting us on a \nbetter economic footing.\n  The measure before us is not a long-term solution to the debt ceiling \nor our fiscal predicament, nor is it intended to be. I am convinced \nthat if we want a long-term solution, and if we want to avoid facing \nyet another cliff, we need to restore regular order in the Senate. I \nthink anything short of that is not going to work.\n  We have good people on both sides of the floor, people who love this \ncountry, people who really can work together if they will. We have \ncommittees set up to take care of these problems, but they are being \nbypassed. We must find ways of working through the committees.\n  We have a number of people on both sides who need to deal with the \nuncertainties, the problems and the difficulties in these fiscal \nmatters. I have confidence in our chairman and in his leadership, and I \nknow this is not his fault. I think he would prefer regular order, as \nwould I. It puts a lot more burden on us as committee members, but that \nis where it ought to be. We ought to be able to face these problems.\n  We have excellent people on both sides on the Finance Committee. I \nwould like to see the Finance Committee do its work and have the \nconfidence that we should and get this done in a proper manner, in the \nright way, before we go off the fiscal cliff again or before we need to \nbe faced with the fiscal cliff.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Continuing appropriations.''.\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer first a commonsense \namendment to begin to address our Nation's unprecedented national debt. \nIt is hurting jobs in our economy today and is placing an immoral \nburden on our kids and our grandkids. This is called the Dollar For \nDollar Deficit Reduction Act. It ensures every time we raise the debt \nlimit we cut spending by the same amount over a 10-year period.\n  We all know the growth of the national debt is not sustainable. In \nthe past 4 years our national debt has risen by $6 trillion and is \nprojected to add another $9 trillion over the next decade. These \nnumbers are huge, too big to comprehend. So let's put it this way: If \nwe don't do something, we are really in trouble. Between the end of \n2008 and 2022--so 9 years from now--the average household share of the \nnational debt will have risen from $90,000 a household to $160,000 a \nhousehold. That is how big the debt will get. Today, it is about \n$130,000 per household.\n  We know we need to do something. Democrats and Republicans alike talk \nabout it a lot. The debt limit is an opportunity to have this debate. \nFuture\n\n[[Page S416]]\n\ndecades will bring even more debt, with the Congressional Budget \nOffice--a nonpartisan group here in Congress--now projecting the debt \nwill top 200 percent of our economy in 25 years. Again, this is \nunprecedented. It is about 100 percent of our economy right now.\n  And, by the way, the projection that the debt will be 200 percent of \nour economy in 25 years is a rosy scenario that assumes we will have \npeace, prosperity, and relatively low interest rates. I think we can \nall agree that saddling our children and grandchildren with this \nenormous debt is not just bad economics, it is immoral.\n  In reining in the debt, the Congressional Budget Office makes clear \nthat spending is driving future deficits. When we look at the future \ndeficits, it is spending that is creating a major problem. Again, \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office, revenues will surpass \ntheir historic average, which is about 18 percent of our economy, as \nsoon as the economy begins to recover. Spending, which has been \nhistorically 20 percent of our economy, has already jumped to over 23 \npercent of our economy and is projected to rise to 30, 40, 50 percent \nof GDP over the next several decades. So clearly we have a spending \nproblem.\n  The amendment I offer today will ensure that debt limit increases are \nmatched with equal cuts in Federal program spending over the next 10 \nyears--so for a decade. There are no gimmicks, no timing shifts, but \nthese will be real cuts in the growth of Federal spending.\n  This chart shows what the results of this would be for the country. \nThe top lines are spending. This is the blue line. The bottom line, the \nred line, is revenue. So here we are today, 2013. Again, the spending \nas a percent of our economy is just over 23 percent. If we continue to \ngo the way we are going, what will happen, based on these relatively \nrosy scenarios about our future, is we will see a dip in the spending \nas a result of our economy and then it goes up and quickly begins to \nclimb further from that over the coming decades. Revenues, again under \nthe current scenario, continue to grow to the point they go above the \nhistoric 18 percent. Here it indicates that by 2022 they would be at \n19.1 percent. Spending, under the proposal we have before us today--\nthis amendment, the dollar for dollar amendment--goes to 19.6 percent, \nso just about at the 20-percent historic average.\n  This of course means we are very close to balance. And it means, \nagain, there is a reasonable result to this, which ends up with \nspending being very close to the historic average, revenue coming above \nits historic average, and again we are back on track toward fiscal \ndiscipline and toward fiscal sanity. That means we can have a stronger \neconomy--the kind of robust economy we all hope for--bringing back the \njobs and not leaving to our kids and grandkids such an enormous debt \nand deficit.\n  We would still have a deficit here, a small one, and this would be \npositioning the deficit to get to balance because it would be such a \nrelatively small deficit compared to what we have had in the past. If \nenacted, the result will be about $3 trillion in savings over the next \ndecade. This is roughly consistent with what other groups have talked \nabout, including the Simpson-Bowles Commission and others. Given the \n$44 trillion in spending projected over the next decade, this $3 \ntrillion in savings should not be too much to ask. In fact, simply \nlimiting spending growth to about 3 percent per year would accomplish \nthis same result.\n  So that is essentially what is being required here when you say there \nwill be a dollar-for-dollar reduction in spending over 10 years every \ntime you raise the debt limit by $1. The result is that, again, by 2022 \nthe deficit will fall to less than 1 percent of GDP--very close to \nbalance. The debt as a percentage of the economy would actually be \ndeclining as well, and it actually declines to the point where, \naccording to the Simpson-Bowles Commission and others, it would be 60-\nsome percent of the economy, which many view as having stabilized our \ndebt. Again, we have a lot of work to do even at that point, but at \nleast it stabilizes it. It actually declines by about 19 points as a \npercentage of the economy from its peak in terms of our debt. Future \ngenerations would be spared this crushing debt and the economic \nstagnation we otherwise will face if Washington does nothing.\n  Some may contend that the debt limit is the wrong place to have this \nspending debate. I have heard this a lot as I have been promoting this \nidea. I have to respectfully disagree. The debt limit is about all that \nhas worked. The debt limit is not just about paying past bills, it also \npresents an opportunity to talk about the future--what should our bills \nbe in the future? It is not about, as the President often says, paying \nour past bills. Those should be paid. It is about what bills we are \ngoing to rack up going forward. We have to make a change. If we don't, \nthe country is headed toward bankruptcy.\n  Furthermore, nearly every single deficit reduction bill over the past \n28 years has been linked to the debt limit. In fact, I would say every \nsingle one of the significant deficit reduction packages in the last \nfew decades has been linked to the debt limit. It is all that has \nworked around here.\n  In 1985--there are some Members in the Senate today who were here \nthen, and they will tell you that the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings bill, which \ncame out of the Senate, helped reduce the deficit. It was attached to \nwhat? A debt limit bill. Since that time, the three largest deficit \nreduction packages in the 1990s--1990, 1993, and 1997, including the \n1997 Balanced Budget Act--were all linked to what? A debt limit \ndiscussion. So it is really all that has worked.\n  The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act, which a lot of Democrats were very \nsupportive of, was in 2010. That came out of a debt limit discussion.\n  Finally, of course, the debt limit was the impetus for the Budget \nControl Act just 2 years ago, when this Congress made a commitment to \nsave $2.1 trillion over the decade. So just 2 years ago, we agreed to \nthis dollar-for-dollar provision, and it was done as part of the debt \nlimit.\n  As we discuss the dollar-for-dollar amendment pending today, we have \nto remember that this is really where the idea came from. Dollar-for-\ndollar came out of the Budget Control Act. So for folks who attempt to \nlabel this idea as untenable, too aggressive, or without precedent, \nremember that the dollar-for-dollar legislation passed only 2 years ago \nwith only 95 Democratic votes in the House and 45 of the 51 Democrats \nhere in the Senate voting yes. So the idea certainly has precedent, and \ngiven the results we talked about earlier, it is a commonsense way to \naddress the debt limit debate today and in the future if this body is \ngoing to be serious about getting Washington's spending and debt under \ncontrol.\n  By the way, it wouldn't apply to this first short-term debt limit \nextension. This would apply to the debt limit extension that we all \nhope will be a longer term agreement with Republicans and Democrats, \nincluding, as the chair and the ranking member of the Finance Committee \njust talked about, tax reform and entitlement reform--working together \nto solve these problems. This would provide the impetus to do that.\n  So whether that is in 3 months or, as some are suggesting, 6 months \nfrom now, given the fact that Treasury will be able to use some \nauthorities to help extend that debt limit, that is when this would \napply. It would not apply to this short-term debt limit, but it is \nputting the discipline in place now that we employed only 2 years ago \nto be able to get real savings for our country.\n  The debt limit is also an important tool for deficit reduction \nbecause it is all we have had. And when you think about it, we haven't \nhad budgets. The only recent restraint came in the context of the debt \nlimit and dollar-for-dollar reductions in the Budget Control Act. This \nis partly because the Senate has not passed a budget, as we all know \nand we all have heard about, in over 3 years. I understand the majority \nis committed to passing a budget in the Senate this year. I commend \nthem for that. I hope they will. But reconciling it with the House, of \ncourse, will be a challenge, and future years also remain uncertain. So \nin the absence of a budget, the fact remains that the debt limit has \nbeen the effective tool we have used.\n  By the way, the fact also remains that now nearly two-thirds of all\n\n[[Page S417]]\n\nspending is not even subject to the budget. Why? Because it is on \nautopilot. It is not annually appropriated. It is the mandatory \nspending. So even if we have a budget, which I hope we do, still, the \ndebt limit is the most likely way for us to get at the bigger picture \nsince 62 percent of spending is on autopilot--or mandatory--and not \nsubject to the annual appropriations process that would be part of the \nbudget agreement. This is why the debt limit is likely to remain the \nmost successful tool for deficit reduction.\n  Common sense tells us that while Washington pays its past bills, it \nalso has to take steps to reduce its future bills. Based on one poll I \nsaw, 72 percent of Americans agree that when you increase the debt \nlimit, it should be matched by equal cuts, dollar-for-dollar--72 \npercent of Americans. It is common sense. We did it 2 years ago. It \nleads us to a result that seems reasonable.\n  Most people think we need to get spending under control. The revenues \nare going to go up based on the CBO projections here, and we get to \nvirtually a balance over 10 years if we put this in place, with the \npermitting of about 3 percent growth in spending every year. So this is \nnot an unreasonable result. It is a sensible solution. Congress did it \na couple years ago.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me on a bipartisan basis to say that \nwith regard to the longer term debt limit extension we are facing \nsomewhere in the 3- to 6-month period, that we put in place this \ndiscipline and then allow the committees to do their work. We should go \nback to regular order. The Finance Committee chairman has made this \npoint repeatedly, and so has the ranking member. Other members have. We \nneed hearings. We need to have an open process. We don't want these \nlast-minute bills that people haven't had a chance to read and staff \nhasn't had a chance to review.\n  This would put us in that position--knowing that we have this \ndiscipline in place, we can achieve this, and we must achieve this for \nthe sake of our kids and grandkids. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I now would like to offer a second amendment. I have \nbeen asked to offer these two amendments together. The second amendment \nis another idea because it doesn't have to do with the debt limit per \nse, but it has to do with how we avoid government shutdowns. This is \nbipartisan legislation, and it is a bipartisan idea whose time I \nbelieve has come.\n  Every year since 1997 and in all but 2 years since 1985, Congress has \nreached the October 1 fiscal year-end without doing all the \nappropriations bills. Think about that. Every year since 1997, we have \nnot been able to reach agreement on all the appropriations bills, and \nonly twice since 1985 have we ended the fiscal year with having all the \nappropriations bills done.\n  What is the result? In some years there has been a relatively quick \nvote on what is called a continuing resolution to continue government \nspending in those areas where we haven't completed our work. In other \nyears the result has been a real showdown, with the threat of \ngovernment shutdown. And then in some years we have had an actual \ngovernment shutdown. In fact, it has happened way too often, and the \nreason is that, again, we haven't been able to come together as \nRepublicans and Democrats, the House and the Senate, working with the \nPresident, to put forward these appropriations bills in regular order, \nand so we face these shutdowns. And we actually have faced some last-\nminute budget bills, many of which are full of surprises because \nMembers haven't had a chance to read them and staff has not had a \nchance to review them.\n  These shutdowns, by the way, when we have had them, have created real \nproblems. Americans hoping to travel abroad find that their passport \napplications can't be processed. Disease surveillance ceases at the \nCenters for Disease Control. Recruitment of Border Patrol agents stops. \nFamilies planning to go on vacations to national parks find their \ndestinations closed. It is not a good way to run a government, and I \nthink we should avoid those shutdowns.\n  Some make the reasonable argument that these shutdowns are an \nacceptable price to pay if they lead to spending cuts. I understand \nthat is an argument out there, but in fact, as I look at it, I think \nthe opposite has occurred. The 1996 government shutdown that a lot of \npeople talk about produced such a large backlash that it seems as if a \nlot of lawmakers decided to abandon spending restraint altogether. A \nproof point might be that after that 1996 shutdown, nondefense \ndiscretionary spending nearly doubled over the next decade. So it seems \nto me as though the case for spending restraint was harmed, not helped, \nby the 1996 government shutdown.\n  The last-minute budget bill that usually results from the threat of \ngovernment shutdown tends to have a lot of surprises in it. It is a \nreal problem because over the years Congress has found itself just \nhours away from a government shutdown, often forced to vote on these \nthousand-plus page bills--an omnibus spending bill that folks have not \nhad a chance to read and our staffs haven't sufficiently reviewed. It \nis not the fault of our Appropriations committees, which do their best \nunder tight deadlines. I think it is the fault of these artificial \ndeadlines themselves.\n  With hundreds of billions of dollars at stake, we could all use more \ntime to better understand what we are voting on. This bipartisan \namendment would solve these problems.\n  For all regular programs or activities whose appropriations bills \nhave not been approved--whether it is all the bills or whether it is \nonly one bill--the End Government Shutdown Act would automatically \ncontinue the current level of spending, no significant disruption, no \ncrisis for citizens, no furloughed employees, no rush to approve a \nlast-minute budget deal that people haven't had a chance to look at.\n  Yet we don't want these continuing resolutions to take the pressure \noff lawmakers to complete their work, so after 120 days there would be \na 1-percent reduction in spending. It would be across the board in a \nnormal year. Because the new fiscal year is October 1, this would mean \nlawmakers would have until January 29--well after the holiday break--to \ncomplete their work on the appropriations bills.\n  And this year, should Washington fail to come to an agreement on the \ncontinuing resolution, spending would remain at whatever the current \nlevel of spending is for those first 120 days.\n  Under this amendment, after the 120-day period, spending levels on \nany remaining unfinished bills would continue to be reduced across the \nboard 1 percent every 90 days. I doubt that would be necessary because \nI think the appropriators of the House and Senate would come together \nto solve the problems. But every 90 days, there would be an additional \n1 percent reduction until the appropriations bills for the yearlong \ncontinuing resolution have been enacted.\n  These eventual small cuts are designed to keep both sides at the \nbargaining table. They aren't so small as to be irrelevant, but they \nare not so large as to gut any programs. Priorities of both Republicans \nand Democrats would be subject to the same across-the-board cuts, and \nboth parties, therefore, would have an incentive to come to an \nagreement to fully fund the priority programs and reduce funding for \nlower priorities.\n  This bipartisan amendment may not be each lawmaker's idea of perfect. \nIt is certainly not mine. I would rather get all the appropriations \nbills done, but that is not what is happening. But we should all agree \nthat it improves upon the current situation where we bounce from crisis \nto crisis, worried about government shutdowns as well as the rushed \nbills we have to vote on to avoid shutdown. The American people want us \nto complete our work in a logical way, and this amendment helps us to \ndo that.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this \ncommonsense, bipartisan approach.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 8\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk and ask \nfor its consideration.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. If the Senator from Pennsylvania will withhold?

The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I wish to address the substance of this \namendment, but let me start with a little context on this underlying \nbill. The underlying bill, of course, suspends the debt ceiling from \nnow until May 18. What that means is in the meantime, the \nadministration will be able to borrow as much money as it wants within \ncertain constraints, but a very large sum of money over the next 3\\1/2\\ \nmonths, at which point the debt ceiling will be reinstituted at a \nhigher level. We expect the government will probably borrow something \non the order of $400 billion between now and such time as the debt \nceiling is reestablished.\n  We have $16.4 trillion in debt today, so by the time the debt ceiling \nis reapplied, reimposed, it will be just under $17 trillion. At that \npoint we will be right back to the standoff we were at very recently, a \nstandoff over what to do about this massive amount of debt we already \nhave and the massive amount of additional debt the administration would \nlike to create. The administration's position is very clear: They want \nadditional borrowing authority with no strings attached--no conditions, \nno limits on future spending. They just want to be able to keep \nborrowing. Some on our side of the aisle believe very strongly that any \nincrease in the debt ceiling that authorizes still more borrowing needs \nto be accompanied with some measure of spending discipline so we can at \nsome point begin to regain control over these out-of-control deficits \nand the debt.\n  In any case, what we know for sure is that this tension will reemerge \nand that we do not have a resolution in place now. If this measure \npasses, which very likely it will, and it will be signed into law, we \nhave just kicked this can down the road until May--maybe June or July \nat the most--but we surely will be back at this point where we are \nhaving this argument.\n  Here is what else we know. We know that tax revenue, ongoing tax \nrevenue coming into the Government's coffers, is going to be about 75 \npercent of all the money the Government is planning to spend in the \ncoming year--or is likely to spend. Since 75 percent does not cover \neverything, the other 25 percent is meant to be borrowed. Therein lies \nthe necessity of raising the debt ceiling, precisely to fund the \ndifference between all the Government wants to spend and the tax \nrevenue it is going to have.\n  It is important to note, by the way, that raising this debt ceiling \nis not about paying for past bills incurred. I know that is repeated \naround here all the time. It is totally untrue. We have a funding for \nthe appropriations process that expires at the end of March. There is \nno appropriation that is in place going forward. The debt ceiling \nincrease, the authority to borrow more money, is all about funding \nfuture spending, which is part of the reason why some of us think this \nis a very sensible moment to try to bring some discipline to that \nfuture spending.\n  What would happen if we do not raise the debt ceiling right away? If \nwe do not, we would have to have a 25-percent cut in all government \nspending. That is pretty massive. That is pretty problematic. The \nadministration and some actually go way overboard in the threats they \nattach to this. They threaten to inflict the maximum possible economic \ndamage if the debt ceiling is not raised promptly upon the point at \nwhich they run out of their maneuvering room. So you hear threats about \na default on our debt and senior citizens will not get their Social \nSecurity check and our military folks will not get paid. All kinds of \nthe most disruptive, most damaging, and most dangerous kinds of \noutcomes are threatened by the administration. This is unnecessary. \nThis is not true. This is not what would happen. But there is an \nincentive, of course, to try to scare and intimidate Republicans into \ngiving the administration the unconditional ability to keep on \nborrowing and spending as they have been doing, and that is why we hear \nthis.\n  My amendment is an attempt to absolutely minimize the disruption, the \ndanger, and the drama. It is an attempt to get away from ``government \nby cliff'' and to have a sensible approach to bringing our spending \nunder control. It is called the Full Faith and Credit Act. What it does \nis it says very simply, since none of us can guarantee the debt ceiling \nis going to be raised on any particular date--we all know how we are \ngoing to vote. We cannot control anyone else's vote. We certainly \ncannot control a single vote in the House and we cannot control what \nthe President is going to do. Therefore, we can never know for sure \nwhether and when and under what circumstances the debt limit will be \nraised.\n  My point is the sensible and prudent and responsible thing to do is \nhave a plan to minimize the downside if the debt ceiling is not raised \nimmediately upon reaching it. This has nothing to do, by the way, with \nthe current circumstances of suspending the debt ceiling. This is all \nabout the next time, in May or June or July, when we find ourselves \nfacing these circumstances.\n  What my bill says is, if we get to that point, the Federal Government \nwould be obligated to prioritize three categories of spending: That \nwould be interest on our debt to make sure we do not default on our \ndebt and create a financial crisis; it would be Social Security \npayments to everybody who qualifies for a Social Security payment so \nthat no senior citizen has to worry and wait to get their check; and it \nwould be Active-Duty Military personnel so that no soldier has to worry \nor wonder whether they are going to get paid.\n  By the way, what my bill does is it goes a step forward and says not \nonly will the Federal Government have to prioritize those three \ncategories, but it says in the event on any given day the tax revenues \nwere not sufficient to cover those three payment obligations, the \nTreasury Secretary would be authorized to borrow additional amounts to \nensure that those payments were made.\n  What does it do? It guarantees that it would be absolutely \nimpossible, under any circumstances, to default on our\n\n[[Page S419]]\n\ndebt, to miss a Social Security payment to anyone, or to be late with \nthe military pay to anybody. That is what it would do. It would take a \nlittle bit of the drama and the risk and the uncertainty and the \npotential damage to the economy off the table and allow us to have an \nhonest, sensible discussion about how we are going to get spending \nunder control.\n  Mind you, these three categories of spending, if you add them all \ntogether, cumulatively account for about one-third of all the spending \nthe government is scheduled to engage in over the course of this fiscal \nyear. Ongoing tax revenue is about three-quarters of all the spending \nthat is going to occur. So clearly there is far more than enough tax \nrevenue to cover these items, but tax revenue comes in in a lumpy \nfashion. It doesn't come in smoothly and uniformly over the course of \nthe year, hence the provision that allows the Treasury Secretary to \nborrow in the event that they needed to in the short run to smooth it \nout.\n\n  Let me say something that is of more fundamental importance. This \namendment is not intended to be a replacement for raising the debt \nceiling. Unfortunately, as long as we are running structural deficits, \nwe are going to have to borrow money to fund them. This amendment, if \nit were to pass and be signed into law, does not mean we would not have \nto raise the debt ceiling at some point. Of course we are going to have \nto until we get to the point where we have balanced budgets and do not \nhave to continue to run deficit spending.\n  By the way, I do not think it is desirable or optimal to cross into \nthat threshold where we are living under the rules of prioritization, \nbecause it is very disruptive to not be paying all the other bills on \ntime as we ought to. That is much better. But my point is, there is \nsomething even more important here and that is to fundamentally bring \nour spending and deficits under control. Trillion dollar deficits, a \ntotal debt that now exceeds the total economic output of our country--\nwe have a disastrous fiscal situation on our hands. It is right now \ncosting us jobs, economic growth today, and it is guaranteed to result \nin a full-blown fiscal crisis and a meltdown if we do not change the \npath we are on.\n  The only time we have ever been able to persuade this President to \nagree to significant spending reductions was the last time we argued \nover the debt limit and we did end up getting spending cuts as part of \nthat. I think the urgency of getting our spending under control and \ngetting our fiscal house in order so we can avoid a fiscal crisis and \nhave the kind of economic recovery we need is what necessitates a \nprioritization bill so we can take the shrill excesses and the threats \nthat some are claiming off the table and have a real discussion and \nreal solutions about how we are going to get spending under control.\n  My strong hope is that we can bring an end to ``government by \ncliff.'' Senator Portman has an amendment, I believe, that he is going \nto introduce, which would prevent the danger of a government shutdown \nin the event that a CR, a continuing resolution, expires. It makes all \nthe sense in the world. We should not find ourselves backed up against \nthe wall at midnight on December 31 with a great calamity threatened if \nwe do not pass some bill that nobody has ever seen. This is a terrible \nway to run the government and that is what we have been doing. What my \nbill does is it eliminates the risk of default and it creates the \nopportunity for us to bring some spending discipline associated with \nany future debt limit increase. The bill of Senator Portman will avert \nthe risk of a government shutdown.\n  I fully support his other efforts to make sure we have a dollar in \nsavings for every new dollar in debt we create. We have an obligation \nto do that. We have already have too big a debt burden. We have to \nbegin curbing the problem that causes it, and that is too much \nspending.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. As I say, it will not \nhave any effect on the specific bill under consideration to temporarily \nsuspend the debt limit. It will make a much more manageable and a much \nless disruptive discussion when we address the debt limit once again in \nMay or June--or when that day surely will arrive.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to speak on two amendments. It will \nbe the first amendment offered by the Senator from Ohio, his first \namendment, and also I will speak on an amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania. I think the Senator from Maryland, the chairman of \nthe Appropriations Committee, will speak on the second Portman \namendment.\n  I chuckled this morning. I see two new Members, very able Members of \nthe Senate, who are now members of the Senate Finance Committee, follow \ntheir urges to offer amendments immediately to bills before the Senate. \nSenator Portman is doing that, Senator Toomey is doing that, and I \ncommend them, very much commend them for being so interested in the \nsubject and allowing their intellectual juices to flow and come up with \nsomething that is new and different and in their view might make some \nsense. I think part of this is because of the newly found efforts here \nin the Senate, and desire in the Senate, certainly among rank-and-file \nMembers, to do something.\n  What you hear around here is: ``Regular order.'' That is something I \nvery much subscribe to, namely let the committees do their work. \nSenator Portman and Senator Toomey are certainly following that \ntradition by offering amendments so the Senate Finance Committee, or in \nthis case the Senate floor, is doing its work with respect to the \npending measure.\n  I want to start by saying how much I appreciate the efforts of the \nSpeaker, Speaker Boehner. He has done a good job giving us a few \nmonths' breathing room here in the Congress with respect to the debt \nlimit increase; that is, having the House pass on a bipartisan basis a \nmeasure which extends the debt ceiling limit for another several \nmonths, to May 18. That gives us a chance to figure out how we are \ngoing to get our fiscal house better in order, cut the debt, and deal \nwith some other vexatious issues such as the sequester and the \ncontinuing resolution.\n  The amendment, I must say, though, offered by my good friend from \nOhio is a throwback to an effort that was undertaken essentially a year \nor two ago. With all due respect, it didn't work. What was that? \nNamely, it was the Sanders amendment, which is for every dollar \nincrease in the national debt there be a dollar cut in Federal \nspending. This was something that was tried, the House of \nRepresentatives tried, the Speaker negotiated with the President, and \nit didn't work. Frankly, it led to a big confrontation, if you will, on \nAugust 11, where the debt was reaching its limit, there was no \nagreement on spending cuts, and the credit agencies began to downgrade \nU.S. credit. It didn't work. I again say I am very proud of the Speaker \nfor trying a different approach.\n\n  It is also important to point out that if this amendment were to \npass, we would have to send this bill back to the House. We are already \nnow on a good track for the Senate to pass, without amendment, the \nHouse-passed bill. If that happens, then the world knows that the U.S. \nGovernment will not be in debt until at least May 18, and because of \nmeasures the Treasury Secretary will not exceed the debt limit until \nsometime in August.\n  We will be in debt. We have a big debt. The debt is about a $16 \ntrillion debt, but we will not reach our debt limit if the House bill \nis passed by the U.S. Senate. In my judgment, it is very important that \nwe pass this House amendment so that we in the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives can get to work on how we reduce the debt and how we \nget our house in order as best as we possibly can.\n  I thank my friend from Ohio for his approach. Dollar for dollar, this \nhas been attempted in the past. It has been rejected by the Speaker in \nthe House of Representatives, and it has been rejected by the majority \nof the House of Representatives. This is an idea that was once tried, \nbut it didn't work. I submit, with all due respect, it would not work \nthis time either for the reasons I just mentioned and for the \nadditional reason that it would further complicate an effort to \nincrease our debt limit for a short period of time, which allows us to \ndo our work.\n  I now wish to turn to the Toomey amendment. Again, I thank my \ncolleague from Pennsylvania, a member of\n\n[[Page S420]]\n\nthe committee, for industriously coming up with an idea. I must say, \nwith total respect, I don't think the idea works. Basically the idea is \nthat when the debt limit is reached, the limit would be increased only \nfor the purpose of addressing principal and interest on the debt held \nby the public or Social Security benefits and military pay, and that is \nit. The debt limit is automatically increased only for those three \nreasons and not for other reasons; that is, not for other programs the \nU.S. Government has an obligation to fund.\n  What are some of the other programs? Medicare, veterans' benefits, \ndisability benefits, Medicaid, Pell grants, special education for \ndisabled children, and highway funding. The list is extremely lengthy. \nI just mentioned a few.\n  What happens if the Toomey amendment is law? First of all, we have \nreached our debt limit. What are the credit markets going to think? \nWhat are credit agencies going to think? They are going to think, oh, \nmy gosh, the U.S. Congress has not increased its debt limit but for \nessentially on a daily basis Social Security, interest on the debt, and \nmilitary pay. It is not for military procurement or men and women in \nthe Air Guard. It is just military pay. It sounds as though it is just \nfor active-duty pay. Think of what will happen. Think of the chaos. \nOther agencies are not going to know whether they will be funded. They \nhave no idea. According to the Toomey amendment, it is up to the \nTreasury Secretary to prioritize. How can he do that when there is no \nmoney there and the debt limit is not increased? Frankly, I cannot \nbelieve this amendment is even offered. With all due respect to my \nfriend from Pennsylvania, it is so nonsensical.\n  With respect to the two amendments that are offered here, the first \nbeing the Portman amendment, I say to my friends, it has been tried in \nthe past and it didn't work. It didn't work when the President and \nSpeaker were trying to negotiate a deal on August 11. It caused chaos \nin the markets. That is one of the reasons the markets fell so much in \nAugust of 2011.\n  If this amendment is agreed to, it will have to be sent back to the \nHouse. It will mean putting this issue of extending the debt limit \nincrease for 3 months in tremendous jeopardy. I don't think we want to \ndo that. I think it is the wrong thing to do.\n  The second amendment, the Toomey amendment, is totally unworkable. It \nwill cause even more chaos at a time when we are trying to calm the \nmarkets, at a time when we are trying to get more confidence, more \ncredibility, not less. In my judgment, both--especially the latter--\nwill result in a lot more worry in the markets, not more confidence. It \nwill create more worry, more uncertainty, and for those reasons I think \nthese amendments should be rejected.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I stand as the chair of the full \nAppropriations Committee to respond to two Portman amendments. I will \ncomment on one and speak to the one related to automatic CRs, which is \nin the jurisdiction of the Appropriations Committee.\n  First I will speak to the dollar-for-dollar cuts, which the Senator \nfrom Montana and chair of the Finance Committee spoke to. I want to say \nI absolutely support his position. As an appropriator, I agree with his \narguments. The dollar-for-dollar cuts would make the Boehner rule \npermanent. It would raise the debt limit by mandating a $1 trillion cut \nin spending. This amendment could allow the minority of 41 Senators to \ndictate the fiscal policy to the majority.\n  I also oppose the Portman amendment related to automatic continuing \nresolutions. What does the amendment do? It sounds good. I must say I \nhave great admiration for the Senator from Ohio. He has a well-known \nreputation for working on a bipartisan basis. When he was in the House, \nhe worked so well with my colleague Senator Cardin. I look forward to \nhaving these kinds of discussions and seeing how we can work out some \nof these issues.\n  In listening to the debate, I think we are all in agreement of our \ngoals, but we disagree on the means.\n  As I read it, Senator Portman's amendment says if Congress fails to \npass an appropriations bill or a continuing resolution related to it, \ninstead of a government shutdown, automatically a continuing resolution \nwould go into effect.\n  Now that sounds good. However, there is an additional part that says \nevery 3 or 4 months, if Congress fails to replace the CR, it would \ndecrease agency funding by 1 percent across the board.\n  That sounds pretty good too because, after all, what is 1 percent? \nWell, 1 percent compounded has Draconian results. This amendment would \nset up essentially the framework for many sequesters that would go into \neffect automatically if Congress doesn't pass the appropriations.\n  I agree with the Senator from Ohio that we need to follow regular \norder, which means bringing up appropriations bills one by one, open, \ntransparent, debatable. If you want to shave or save, offer amendments. \nIf we had regular order, we would be able to pass our bills.\n  We cannot have a situation in the Congress where we have not been \nable to bring up bills because of the filibusters and deleterious \ntactics of some Members, and then when we can't bring them up, we are \npunished for it.\n  I oppose this amendment for three reasons. The amendment is the wrong \nsolution, regular order is the solution.\n  Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. In deference to the Senator from Maryland, I went through \nthe cold-and-cough crud that caused her to begin coughing, so I fully \nunderstand why she needed to take a break. I am more than willing to \nstep aside when she comes back.\n  In the interest of time, since I am next up--I know we are trying to \nmove toward a vote at 12:15 p.m.--I wish to proceed. I will be happy to \nsuspend when the Senator gets back.\n  This afternoon the Senate will vote on a bill recently passed by the \nHouse to suspend the debt ceiling for 4 months. First, I wish to \ncommend the House on one aspect of the legislation, which I strongly \nsupport, and that is the suspension of salary for Members of Congress \nif we do not pass a budget by April 15.\n  As I mentioned on the floor yesterday, Congress, by law, is required \nto pass a budget. It has been nearly 4 years since it has done so. As a \nresult, the Senate has blatantly ignored its legal duty, not to mention \nits moral duty, to enact a budget. This is completely irresponsible, \nand, quite frankly, it is embarrassing. If this body cannot fulfill its \nmost fundamental duty under law to pass a budget, then I say we don't \ndeserve to get paid.\n  However, another aspect of the bill that would suspend enforcement of \nthe Federal debt limit until at least May--and according to recent \nstatements issued by the administration possibly until August--concerns \nme. I understand why the House is taking this approach for political \nand tactical reasons, but unfortunately, this decision only continues \nthe practice of governing from crisis to crisis, cliff to cliff, and \npushing through flawed, haphazard legislation at the last minute as we \ndid with the vote on the fiscal cliff, which is a great example of how \nthis body should not function.\n  As a result of this practice, Members are left deciding between \nchoosing the lesser of two evils. Never again will I, nor I believe \nmany of my colleagues, support any legislation that is negotiated in \nsecret, bypasses the regular process where we have an opportunity to \ntake it up in committee and amend it, if necessary, and then present it \nto the Senate for debate and evaluation or amendment. Never again will \nI support something that takes us into the wee hours of the night into \nNew Year's Eve and New Year's Day and then just have a few minutes to \ntry to evaluate it with no debate and no opportunity to amend. This is \nno way to govern a country. It is no way to strengthen a weak economy \nand spur job creation, and it is no way to restore confidence among \nconsumers and investors, which is such a critical factor in making for\n\n[[Page S421]]\n\nrobust growth, which we are not enjoying right now. Eventually all of \nus have to stand up and say enough is enough. Pushing these debates up \nuntil the last minute, creating our fiscal cliffs, and passing short-\nterm measures must cease.\n  The people of Indiana have had enough. Across the country the \nAmerican people have had enough of Washington postponing real action on \nthe most serious challenge facing our country, namely the out-of-\ncontrol plunge into further deficit spending and debt.\n  Both Republicans and Democrats, the President and the Congress, \nliberal and conservative economists and nonpartisan people, all agree \nthat our continued increase in debt is unsustainable. We all know that \nwhat has been fueling this fire that has engulfed our fiscal house is \nspending. To date our meager efforts to deal with this looming fiscal \ncalamity are like trying to put out a five-alarm fire with the \noccasional squeeze of a squirt gun.\n  I note that the Senator from Maryland is on the floor. If she wishes \nto resume, I would be happy to suspend my remarks.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Is that okay with the Senator?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Senator for the courtesy. Both the Senator \nfrom Montana and I have been hit by this bug.\n  Mr. COATS. I was hit by it 2 weeks ago so I fully understand what the \nSenator is going through.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Little germs are doing to me what my opponents \ncouldn't, which is stop me from talking. I thank the Senator for his \ncourtesy.\n  Mr. President, I oppose the Portman amendment related to automatic \nContinuing Resolutions with cuts if Congress does not pass \nappropriations bills. I acknowledge the legitimacy of his concerns, and \nI agree that we are all tired of governing from crisis to crisis. And I \nshare his goal of keeping the government open so our Federal agencies \ncan carry out their missions, and serve the American people. But I very \nmuch oppose this proposed solution.\n  Now, what does the amendment do? It sounds good, and I must say, I \nhave a great admiration for the Senator from Ohio. And he has a well-\nknown reputation for working on a bipartisan basis. He has worked so \nwell when he was in the House with my colleague, Senator Cardin. And I \nlook forward to having these kinds of discussions and seeing how we can \nwork out some of these issues. I think in listening to the debate, we \nall are in agreement of goals, but we disagree on means.\n  His amendment, as I read it, says if Congress fails to pass an \nappropriations bill or a Continuing Resolution related to it, instead \nof a government shutdown, an automatic Continuing Resolution would go \ninto effect. That sounds good. However, there's an additional part that \nsays, after four months, if Congress fails to replace the Continuing \nResolution, it would decrease agency funding by one percent across the \nboard. Well, that sounds pretty good too. Because after all, what is \none percent?\n  Well, one percent every 90 days compounded has draconian results. \nThis amendment would set up essentially the framework for mini-\nsequesters that would go into effect automatically if Congress doesn't \npass appropriations bills.\n  I oppose this amendment for three reasons. First, the amendment is a \nwolf in sheep's clothing. The amendment's stated purpose is to \nestablish automatic Continuing Resolutions, but the amendment wouldn't \njust extend funding for government operations. It would also cut \nfunding one percent across the board for every 90 days that Congress \ndoesn't pass Appropriations bills or a Continuing Resolution. Mr. \nPresident, this amendment just creates a new crisis instead of \nproviding confidence and clear direction. This type of robotic-cutting \nContinuing Resolution would add uncertainty to the operations of the \nFederal government.\n  Second, this amendment is the wrong solution to a long-standing \nproblem. A problem we have become too familiar with, and too \ncomfortable with. I'm talking about not operating according to regular \norder. I agree with the gentleman from Ohio, we need to follow a \nregular order. Regular order means Congress receives the President's \nbudget. Regular order means the Appropriations Committee holds hearings \nand marks up bills. Regular order means bringing up appropriations \nbills on the Senate floor, one by one, a process that is open, \ntransparent, and allows debate. If a Member wants to save money or \nshave spending on these bills, that Member can offer amendments. If we \nhad regular order, we would be able to pass our bills.\n  The solution to the problem of governing from crisis to crisis, of \navoiding Continuing Resolutions and government shutdowns, is not an \nautomatic Continuing Resolution. The solution is to get back to regular \norder, where Congress makes smart decisions about where to make needed \ninvestments and where to cut. Permanent robotic-cutting Continuing \nResolutions are not the solution.\n  You have a situation in Congress where we haven't been able to bring \nup bills because of filibusters, and because of the dilatory tactics of \nsome Members. We can't bring our bills up, and we're punished for it. \nThere are those who have thrown sand in the gears of regular order by \ntying up appropriations bills with controversial riders and calls for \ndraconian cuts, and then complain when we have to do Continuing \nResolutions to keep the government working for the American people. \nThey can't have it both ways. Regular order is the solution.\n  Third, this amendment simply gives up Congress's Constitutional \nresponsibility, the power of the purse. This amendment would put the \ngovernment on auto-pilot for months, perhaps even years. In a divided \nCongress, it is hard to come to an agreement on spending. But every \ntime we pass a Continuing Resolution, we are giving the executive \nbranch more and more control over the federal budget. This means \nCongress gives up control to OMB and Cabinet officers.\n  By not passing our bills, we weaken Congressional oversight. The \nAppropriations Committee is the only committee that reviews every \nspending account of every agency. The Committee digs down further than \nany other committee to make sure that agencies are not wasting taxpayer \ndollars. And when we find things that need to be fixed, we fix them in \nour bills. But if we can't get our bills to the President's desk, then \nour efforts at oversight are not realized.\n  Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from Ohio that we should stop \nour dependence on Continuing Resolutions, especially long-term \nContinuing Resolutions. They are a terrible way to govern. It is time \nfor us to show we can govern. The American people want to see us \ngovern. We all need to work together in good faith and in a timely \nmanner. This is what the Appropriations Committee does.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I also oppose the amendment from the Senator from Ohio \nthat demands a dollar in cuts for every dollar increase in the debt \nlimit.\n  Under this amendment, the debt limit could not be raised without \nspending cuts equal to the amount to be raised, unless the requirement \nis waved by a super-majority of 60 votes. This amendment would make the \n``Boehner Rule'' permanent. The amendment means that in order to raise \nthe debt limit by $1 trillion, Congress would need to cut $1 trillion \nin spending over the next ten years.\n  This is a terrible amendment. The point has been made before, but I \nmake it again. The debt limit is not about cutting spending, it is \nabout paying for spending that Congress has already authorized. If \nenacted, the Portman amendment would require trillions and trillions of \ndollars in cuts to earned benefits programs over the next decade. Cuts \nto Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and all of our other \nmandatory programs. It would also squeeze discretionary spending, \nincluding defense, to the point where I doubt our agencies could carry \nout their most basic responsibilities.\n  I remind my colleagues that under this amendment, if the Congress \nwere to pass a tax cut, revenues would fall but spending would not. So \nthe next year, when less revenue comes in, Congress would be forced to \npay for the tax cut with equal spending cuts. If Congress passed \nanother huge tax cut for the wealthy, like the Bush tax cuts, then \nCongress would have to cut programs for the middle class to pay for it.\n\n[[Page S422]]\n\n  And I also remind my colleagues that if Congress passed emergency \nspending, like the Sandy bill, then guess what? Next year, Congress \nwould have to find even more cuts to earned benefits or to \ndiscretionary spending to pay for that.\n  The Senate has a history of always protecting the rights of the \nminority. But it is one thing to protect the interests of the minority \nparty, and it is quite another to allow a minority of 41 Senators to \ndictate policy to the majority. By requiring an affirmative super-\nmajority of 60 votes to raise the debt without draconian spending cuts, \nthis amendment gives veto power to the minority over most fiscal \ndecisions that the majority supports. Tax changes, spending, earned \nbenefit reforms, Budget Resolutions, and even Reconciliation. That is \nsimply not acceptable.\n  Mr. President, the objective of this amendment is obvious to me. The \nAmerican people do not support cuts to their earned benefits, to Social \nSecurity and Medicare. This amendment is a way to force huge cuts in \nthese programs without ever having to justify them.\n  I suggest that if Members want to cut a trillion dollars from Social \nSecurity over the next ten years, let them come down and offer an \namendment that does just that. And if Members want to change the rules \nfor Medicare, in order to remove Americans from eligibility for \nMedicare, or from Medicaid, let them come to the floor with legislation \nin hand to do just that.\n  We're talking about trillions of dollars here. Chained CPI is not \ngoing to do it. Cuts to providers won't do it. And that's the problem. \nCuts of this magnitude require immediate cuts to Social Security. And \nthese cuts reduce the number of people helped by Medicare and Medicaid. \nAnd of course, they gut non-defense discretionary spending. And I say \nto my colleagues, if I'm overstating the case, I look forward to \nsomeone coming down here and offering legislation that saves trillions \nof dollars and doesn't do those things.\n  We need to get our financial house in order. But we need a balanced \nsolution, one that includes revenues, sensible reforms to earned \nbenefits that save money but do not hurt the middle class, and spending \ncuts.\n  This amendment could not be less balanced. This amendment is all cuts \nand no revenues, and contains not one specific policy that would save a \nsingle dollar. Tens of millions of middle class Americans work their \nwhole lives, play by the rules, and pay their taxes every year so one \nday they can retire with some dignity and some security guaranteed to \nthem. That's the promise this government made, and it's a promise the \nCongress needs to keep. With reforms to revenues and with reforms to \nour earned benefits programs. With frugality. With compromise. That's \nthe solution to our fiscal challenges.\n  Mr. President, this amendment would fundamentally rewrite the social \ncompact between the government and its citizens. Without a single \nhearing. Without a single witness. This approach is unacceptable, and I \nurge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I send my sympathy and empathy to the \nSenator from Maryland. Having gone through the same thing, I fully \nunderstand what she is dealing with and trust she will recover quickly.\n  Picking up where I left off, dare a politician stand here and \nacknowledge this? Many don't want to. But the truth is this: The main \ndriver of our debt and deficit spending is the runaway mandatory \nspending on Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security.\n  Despite those who claim it is political suicide to touch these \nprograms and despite the fact none of us are saying we should eliminate \nthese programs, this is an area where many don't want to tread. But I \nbelieve these programs, which provide much needed benefits for many \nHoosiers and Americans, need to be preserved. But our goal and our \nchallenge is to find common ground on not how to eliminate these \nprograms but how to save these programs, both for current retirees and \nfor future generations. If we don't take steps to reform these \nprograms, we risk not only bankrupting our country, we risk having to \ntell the recipients of the benefits of these programs we no longer can \nfulfill their needs and our propositions.\n  It is difficult for me to support any effort to increase the debt \nlimit when we continue to avoid taking the necessary steps to eliminate \ndeficit spending and control our debt in the future. Despite several \nbipartisan attempts over the last 2 or 3 years, including efforts by \nthe Simpson-Bowles Commission--the President's Commission--the Gang of \n6 and the supercommittee of 12, we have failed to put together a \ncredible, long-term deficit reduction package. How then can we continue \nto raise the debt limit over and over again without agreeing on a way \nto reduce it in the future?\n  Repeatedly and thoughtlessly raising the debt limit represents a \npolitical moral hazard, a taxpayer bailout for big government \npoliticians who don't want to be bothered by controlling spending. \nCongress continually increasing the debt limit is akin to consumers \nhaving the ability to increase their own credit borrowing limit with no \noversight. We just keep increasing the credit limit to pay for more and \nmore spending. It reminds me of a parent dealing with an irresponsible \nteenager who was given a credit card, asked to stay within the credit \nlimits but month after month after month continues to exceed the limit \nas the debt piles and the interest on the debt accumulates. Eventually, \nthe parent has to take away the card and take the scissors and cut it \nup. At what point do we in the Congress take the congressional credit \ncard, cut it up, and get control of our spending?\n  I urge my colleagues and the President to focus not on how to get \nenough votes to raise the borrowing limit again but on how we can truly \nbegin the essential task of eliminating deficit spending and reducing \nour debt as a percentage of GDP.\n  Part of what makes America so remarkable is we have the ability in \nthis great country to control our destiny. The problems we face are not \ninsurmountable, but they are not avoidable either. It is time we take a \nstand and do what the people we represent sent us to do. It is time we \nmake the changes we pledged we would make when we were seeking office, \nand it is time we take control of our country's financial future and \nput America on a path to prosperity.\n  With that, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I am going to lay out and discuss a motion \nto commit which I have at the desk, and we are going to be voting on \nthat motion to commit later today. It is very simple, very \nstraightforward. In fact, I will read it:\n\n       Mr. Vitter moves to commit the bill H.R. 325--\n\n  That is, of course, the debt limit increase which we have at the desk \nwhich we are debating--\n\n     to the Committee on Finance with instructions to report the \n     same back to the Senate within 7 days with legislative \n     language that makes changes in existing programs that reduce \n     Federal spending by the increase amount required by section \n     2(b) . . . over the period of fiscal years 2013 to 2022.\n\n  It is very simple. By whatever amount we are increasing the debt \nlimit, so too would we reduce spending. The idea is to start actually \npaying for what we spend or at least paying for the extra we are going \nto borrow. It is a commonsense idea, a straightforward approach, and it \nis not Draconian. We can do it. It starts to put discipline into the \nprocess.\n  This bill before us suspends the debt limit until May 18. That is \nestimated to mean between $300 billion and $400 billion in additional \ndeficit spending. So under this motion to commit, that is the savings \nwe would find. Those are the cuts we would make: $300 billion to $400 \nbillion total over 10 years. Obviously, that is $30 billion to $40 \nbillion a year. That is thoroughly doable. It is meaningful. It takes \nsome work, but it is thoroughly doable, and those savings would be such \na small percentage. The part for this year would only be about 3 \npercent of the deficit and around 1 percent of total Federal spending.\n  If we can't find between $30 billion and $40 billion a year in \nsavings, is\n\n[[Page S423]]\n\nthere truly a way we can agree to major budget reforms? If we can't \nfind those modest savings, should we be borrowing more money to just \nspend and spend and spend?\n  Let me be clear. My limited motion is not enough. We need more \nspending cuts and we need more and fundamental budget reform and we \nneed it now. But I am proposing a reasonable first step that is \nconcrete and meaningful as a downpayment toward fiscal soundness.\n  This bill is short term. It is a patch. It is for 3 months. But it \nputs us on the right path. It is a concrete, meaningful first step.\n\n  Surely, we should have learned by now; Congress passed the last debt \nlimit deal in 2011, but we got a credit downgrade anyway. As we \ncontinue to rack up more and more debt--without spending reform, \nwithout budget reform--a new downgrade has to be on the way. It is not \na question of if; it is a question of when.\n  All the credit rating agencies have maintained their negative \noutlook, including after the fiscal cliff deal. The problem, as it was \nwith the deal passed on New Year's Day, is not that we are taxed too \nlittle; the problem is we clearly spend too much. Not enough folks in \nthis building recognize that. Everybody in the real world recognizes \nthat, and certainly the credit rating agencies recognize that.\n  So why don't we take this reasonable, concrete first step? Again, my \nmodest amendment is a small downpayment but an important step, concrete \naction during the time for which this bill would increase debt, as we \nwork toward a more comprehensive solution.\n  If we are going to raise the debt limit, we must at least show the \ntaxpayers, the credit rating agencies, and the world that we are \nserious about getting our fiscal house in order. Without this type of \namendment--or in this case a motion to commit--we are not saying that \nin any way, shape, or form with this bill. That is why without this \nsort of motion to commit or a roughly similar amendment, I cannot vote \nfor this debt limit increase.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to join me in a bipartisan way around \nthis approach. I think it would be a step in the right detection.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the debt limit alone, under the current \nadministration, had been increased by over $5 trillion. That is simply \nunsustainable.\n  Not to worry, I have recently been told. We have made massive \nprogress toward promising deficit reduction. I hear this even though we \nhave not seen any significant actual reduction.\n  I have been hearing bold claims by my friends on the other side of \nthe aisle about having attained trillions in budget ``savings'' and \ndeficit reduction in just the past couple of years alone. They have \ngone so far as to say that we have had $2.4 trillion of deficit \nreduction legislated in the past 2 years. Of course, the deficit \nreduction has not been realized. It represents promises and plans that \neven Democrats seek to undo. It is amazing to me that they make these \nclaims.\n  I have heard bold claims that we have somehow legislated deficit \nreduction totaling as much as $3.6 trillion from my friends on the \nother side. I have heard that deficit reduction that has been promised \ncan be broken down to an 80-to-20 ratio of spending cuts to tax hikes.\n  While I often applaud creativity, I have to say these deficit \nreduction claims and the ratio of spending reductions to tax hikes is \nmore than creative. It is more like Enron accounting, and if you were \nrunning a company in the private sector and made such claims, you would \nprobably end up in jail.\n  Let me make a few brief comments on the Democrats' Enron accounting \nof deficit reduction.\n  First, the so-called spending cuts they identify have not yet been \nrealized, and even they are working hard to undo some of them, if not \nall of them.\n  Second, the so-called spending cuts are only cuts if you are \nselective in the starting point you use to measure whether spending is \nbeing cut. Relative to what spending levels would be, had we not had a \nDemocrat spending spree, spending has increased even if you include \nplans put forward in the Budget Control Act, which have not yet been \nrealized.\n  Third, the spending-cut-to-tax-hike number thrown around by my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle counts only one discrete tax \nhike--the one associated with the fiscal cliff bill.\n  Why do Democrats want to entirely ignore the massive tax hikes \nassociated with ObamaCare that have already gone into effect, with more \nto come?\n  Fourth, spending cuts that my friends on the other side of the aisle \nare banking on when they devise their Enron accounting have not yet \nbeen set in place. Until fiscal year 2013 comes to a close, those \nspending reductions have not actually occurred, and Congress has a long \nhistory of promising cuts without delivering.\n  It is ironic to me that my friends on the other side of the aisle \nfight tooth and nail against any true reductions in the outsized \nspending of the current administration. Then when budget realities \nforce consideration of reductions, and legislation is passed promising \nreductions, Democrats boast of having cut spending to reduce deficits.\n  Finally, when it comes to actually implement any spending cuts, \nDemocrats want to undo them and replace them with yet more taxes. That \nis what we are hearing from the other side with regard to the \nsequestration.\n  I believe our country faces a large spending problem and that our \ndebt is too big and grows too fast. I believe presenting a picture of \nour finances that would pass muster only in the Enron accounting \ndepartment is a disservice to the American people. If my friends on the \nother side of the aisle want more tax hikes to pay for more spending, \nthen they should just say so. And some of them do, by the way, and I \ncompliment them for doing that, even though I think it is crazy. \nCloaking their desires in manufactured claims that we have somehow cut \nspending 4 to 1 relative to tax hikes is simply dishonest. And I do not \nthink I have been wrong in calling it Enron accounting.\n  Frankly, I am getting a little sick of it because they throw these \nfigures around as though they are really tax cuts, and they are not tax \ncuts, and they never will be according to my friends on the other side \nin what their actions show. So it is important that we get rid of the \nfuzz and get rid of the buzz and get rid of the phony stuff and the \nEnron accounting and start realizing that we need to have some real tax \nreductions.\n  Frankly, we need to have some real spending reductions. Even if we \ncannot get tax reductions, we ought to all be working on spending \nreductions. We ought to be looking at every aspect of this economy, \nevery aspect of our budget, every aspect of our legislation, and we \nought to be looking for as many spending reductions as we can find.\n  Spending is out of control. Even today, you know they are going to be \nspending well over 22 percent of GDP, according to the best of \nestimates. The economic results of yesterday that were in the paper of \nthis slow growth ought to be waking up everybody on both sides of the \naisle that we are not doing our job. The reason we are not doing our \njob is because we phony up these numbers that are not really spending \nreductions, and then we act like everything is hunky-dory, when, in \nfact, things are not hunky-dory.\n  We are in real trouble in this country, and it is inexcusable to let \nthe greatest country in the world have to go through this type of \ncharade because we are unwilling to face the music that every \nindividual family in this country has to face on balancing their \nbudgets and on balancing ours.\n  I think it is time to cut the charade and quit talking about spending \nreductions that do not materialize and amount to nothing but Enron \naccounting.\n  Mr. President, I ask that both sides be charged equally for the time \nwe are in a quorum call.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the order.\n  Mr. HATCH. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S424]]\n\n                            Amendment No. 9\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up amendment \nNo. 9.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Paul] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 9.\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To prohibit the sale, lease, transfer, retransfer, or \ndelivery of F-16 aircraft, M1 tanks, or certain other defense articles \n                or services to the Government of Egypt)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. PROHIBITION ON CERTAIN MILITARY SALES TO EGYPT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, the United States Government shall not license, approve, \n     facilitate, or otherwise allow the sale, lease, transfer, \n     retransfer, or delivery of F-16 aircraft, M1 tanks, or other \n     defense articles or services listed in Category VI, VII, or \n     VIII of the United States Munitions List to the Government of \n     Egypt.\n       (b) United States Munitions List Defined.--In this section, \n     the term ``United States Munitions List'' means the list \n     referred to in section 38(a)(1) of the Arms Export Control \n     Act (22 U.S.C. 2778(a)(1)), as in effect on January 1, 2013.\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I rise today to present an amendment that \nwould stop the transfer of F-16s and Abrams tanks to Egypt. I think it \nparticularly unwise to send tanks and our most sophisticated fighter \nplanes to Egypt at a time in which many are saying the country may be \nunraveling.\n  Ironically, a year ago, the Arab spring occurred. Hundreds of \nthousands of people gathered in Tahir Square to protest against the \ngovernment that was instituting martial law. Ironically, the current \nPresident now has instituted martial law. Once again, the dread \n``indefinite detention'' is threatened to citizens in Egypt.\n  As the rioting expands, many see Egyptian descending into chaos. What \nis President Obama's response to this? To send them some of the most \nsophisticated weapons we have, F-16 fighters and Abrams tanks. I think \nthis is particularly unwise. This amendment will stop it. I think this \nis particularly unwise since Egypt is currently governed by a religious \nzealot, a religious zealot who said recently that Jews were \n``bloodsuckers'' and ``descendents of apes and pigs.''\n  This does not sound like the kind of stable personality to whom we \nshould be sending our most sophisticated weapons. I think it is a grave \nmistake to send F-16s and Abrams tanks to a country that last year \ndetained American citizens on trumped-up political charges, to a \ncountry that currently is still detaining Egyptian citizens on trumped-\nup political charges.\n  I think it is a blunder of the first proportion to send sophisticated \nweapons to a country that allowed a mob to attack our embassy and to \nburn our flag. I find it objectionable to send weapons, F-16s and \ntanks, to a country that allowed a mob chanting ``death to America'' to \nthreaten our American diplomats.\n  I am concerned that these weapons, some of the most sophisticated \nweapons in the world, someday may be used against Israel. I am \nconcerned these weapons threaten Israel's security. I am concerned that \nwe are sending weapons to a country with a President who recently was \nseen to be chanting ``Amen'' to a cleric who was saying, ``death to \nIsrael'' and ``death to those who support Israel.''\n  I think it is foolhardy to support and send arms to both sides of an \narms race. We send 20 F-16s to Egypt, which already has 240 F-16s. We \nsend 20 in addition. What does Israel feel? They have to have two for \nevery one Egypt has. It escalates an arms race and makes it more \ndifficult for Israel to defend herself.\n  Today we have a chance to stop this folly. I urge my colleagues to \ninstruct the President that we will not send any more F-16s and any \nmore Abrams tanks to the current Government of Egypt.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is considering H.R. 325.\n  Mr. McCAIN. How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Only Democratic time remains.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \n10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I speak in opposition to the amendment \nevidenced by my friend, the Senator from Kentucky, which would prohibit \nthe sale, licensing, approval, facilitation, transfer, retransfer, or \ndelivery of any defense articles and services to the Government of \nEgypt, including F-16 aircraft and M-1 tanks.\n  There are many problems with this amendment. I would like to explain. \nFirst, the amendment is not revenue neutral. The Congressional Budget \nOffice has not provided an official score, despite my request, but \nthere is a way to avoid the basic fact that there are numerous costs \nassociated with this amendment. The defense articles the Senator from \nKentucky wishes to block and prohibit are manufactured by American \nworkers and defense companies. They have contracts to produce this \nequipment, and American workers are doing that as we speak.\n  If the Federal Government steps in, as my colleague's amendment would \nmandate, those contracts would have to be immediately broken, and U.S. \nproduction lines would have to be shut down immediately. There is a \ncost of breaching a contract in this country, and there should be. That \ndoes not change just because the government is the one doing the \nbreaching. This is also as it should be.\n  So the Senator's amendment would obligate the Federal Government to \npay the many costs to American businesses and workers for breaking our \ncommitments to them. Furthermore, many of these defense articles have \nalready been produced. They have already been paid for. They are \ntechnically the property of the Egyptian Government already. If the \nCongress prohibits these defense articles from being delivered to \nEgypt, they become the responsibility of the U.S. Government. We will \nhave to store them somewhere, and that is not free either.\n  In short, there are a lot of hidden costs in this amendment. If this \nprovision becomes law in its current form, it will add to the national \ndebt. This is fiscally irresponsible, and I cannot support it on these \ngrounds alone.\n  Second, and more important than the costs associated with this \namendment, it is harmful to America's national security interests. I \nknow as well as anyone that Egypt is beset now with many problems.\n  I was in Egypt 2 weeks ago with a bipartisan delegation of my \ncolleagues. The Muslim Brotherhood-led government, which I would remind \nmy colleagues was elected by the Egyptian people, has done a poor job \nof governing in an exclusive and pluralistic way, establishing the rule \nof law, and building democratic institutions.\n  The results of the Egyptian Government's failing are plain to see in \nthe awful street violence and expanding unrest in Egypt. President \nMorsi's government has not been able to stem the violence and has often \nmade matters worse. Egyptian police seem to have neither the capacity \nnor the legitimacy to restore order. The fact is, despite its flaws, \nthe Egyptian Army remains one of the major stabilizing forces in Egypt \ntoday. If, God forbid, the current unrest worsens, and Egypt tips \ndeeper into civil conflict, the one force in that country that might be \ncapable of pulling Egypt back from the abyss is the Egyptian military.\n  If the Senate were to adopt the amendment proposed by the Senator \nfrom Kentucky, we would not only be harming the effectiveness of the \nEgyptian military, which, by the way, is not objected to by the \nIsraelis, who probably understand better than anyone what defense \ncapabilities might be used someday to threaten their security, we would \nbe rupturing a decades-long partnership and denying and squandering our \ninfluence with the leaders of one of the most important institutions in \nEgypt.\n  The ramifications of this decision would be enormous, especially when \nit comes to the ability of U.S. ships, including U.S. aircraft carriers \nand other\n\n[[Page S425]]\n\nvessels, to transit the Suez Canal securely and effectively. I would \nurge the Senator from Kentucky to call the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff and ask him what effect this would have on the U.S. military \nand America's overall national security.\n  As I say, this amendment would be even more detrimental to our ally \nIsrael, for which the continuing instability in Egypt is an abiding, \nclear and present danger. I have seen no objections raised by our \nIsraeli allies to U.S. military assistance to Egypt, nor do I expect to \nsee any. Here too I would urge my colleague to pick up the phone and \ncall the Israeli Ambassador or just recall what I am sure he heard from \nIsrael's leaders during his recent visit there a few weeks ago.\n  This amendment is absolutely harmful to the national security of our \nally Israel. The timing of the amendment is also detrimental because \nour government is currently engaged in discussions with the Egyptian \nGovernment and military about the need to shift our security \ncooperation more toward the kinds of programs and equipment Egypt needs \nto combat the threats they increasingly face: porous borders, a rising \nthreat from terrorism, deteriorating conditions in the Sinai, and a \nsecurity sector in dire need of reform. It is in Egypt's interest to \nmove in this direction, as they are beginning to do. It is in our \ninterest to help them.\n  If we adopt this amendment, the promise of this entire endeavor will \nbe destroyed. Egypt will suffer, Israel will suffer, and the United \nStates will suffer.\n  I oppose this amendment because it is uninformed and oblivious to the \nworld challenges America faces and our continuing need to work with \nAmerica's partners, imperfect and frustrating though they may be, to \ndefend our Nation, our interests, and our allies in an increasingly \ndangerous world.\n  Finally, the Middle East is in a period of transition and change that \nwe have not seen practically in its entire history. The Egyptians are \nkey and vital to what happens in that part of the world. It is the \nheart, soul, and center of the Arab world. One out of every four Arabs \nwho live in the Arab world lives in Egypt. It is the cultural and \nhistoric center of all the Arab world.\n  It is vital we do whatever we can to see that Egypt makes a \ntransition to a free, democratic, and open society. That is in grave \ndanger today. To pass this amendment today and send this message to \nEgypt in this very unstable and unsure time, I believe, would be \nexactly the wrong message at this time. I would also point out that \nthis legislation has nothing to do with Egypt. It has nothing to do \nwith Egypt.\n  A decision of this magnitude, in my view, requires hearings, debate, \nand legislation that would stand by itself, rather than in a 15- or 20-\nminute discussion on the floor of the Senate. For that reason alone, I \nurge my colleagues to overwhelmingly--as we have other amendments of \nthe Senator from Kentucky--reject this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PAUL. I find the argument spurious and, frankly, absurd that not \ngiving F-16s to Egypt is somehow against the interests of Israel. \nImagine this. The President of Egypt has called Jews bloodsuckers and \ndescendents of apes and pigs. The President of Egypt has also said that \nwhen we look at the relationship of Israel and her supporters--he stood \nnext to a cleric, chanted ``Amen'' and said ``Amen,'' that we should go \nafter and destroy Israel and the supporters of Israel.\n  Somehow it is a good idea to ship weapons to this country and to this \nreligious zealot? I find it absurd that that would be in Israel's best \ninterests. Somehow, the argument is made that, oh, this will lead to \nstability in Egypt. Well, giving F-16s is somehow going to stabilize \nunrest in Egypt? It makes no sense whatsoever.\n  I would say that when we look at this and we hear arguments such as \nthis will cost money, do you know whose money it was that bought these \nF-16? It was our money to begin with. We send the money to Egypt and \nthen they buy the weapons from us.\n  If we are worried about a place to store the F-16s, why don't we give \nthem to our military? Everybody seems to be saying it is a problem, \nthis sequester, and there is not enough money for our military. Why \ndon't we give the 20 F-16s to our military? Why don't we give the tanks \nto our military? Apparently, these are more tanks that are being given \nto Egypt than often different contingents of our Marines have at any \none given point in time.\n  I would say keep the money and keep the weapons in our country. Mark \nmy words, it is a mistake to send these weapons to Egypt. It is not in \nIsrael's best interest.\n  For people to come down and argue it is in Israel's best interest to \nsend weapons to a country that professes hate, professes a disbelief in \nthe Holocaust, that professes they are in favor of destroying Israel--\nthat is whom we are supposed to send these weapons to? It makes no \nsense at all.\n  Our foreign policy often makes no sense at all. I do think we need to \nreassess. We made this deal with Mubarak. We didn't make this deal with \nMursi. Currently, Egypt is unraveling. I think it is a terrible mistake \nto send these weapons to Egypt, and I hope my colleagues will consider \nthat.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 6\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate, equally divided, prior to a vote on amendment No. 6, \noffered by the Senator from Ohio, Mr. Portman.\n  The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, we had a debate earlier on this. This \nis the Dollar-for-Dollar Deficit Reduction Act. It makes all the sense \nin the world.\n  Here we have a $16 trillion national debt, now exceeding $130,000 per \nhousehold in America. We are told by the Congressional Budget Office \nthat there is $9 trillion more coming over the next decade.\n  We have to make this difference here on this bill. We have to take \nthis opportunity to ensure that we are, in fact, beginning to reduce \nspending, getting this under control, as we once again are asked to \nextend the debt limit.\n  This would not apply to this particular short-term debt limit, by the \nway; it would set up the discipline for the next debt limit, which is \nanywhere from 3 to 6 months from now.\n  Now is the time for us to come together as Republicans and Democrats \nand determine how we indeed reform the entitlement programs, put tax \nreform in place, go through regular order in the Finance Committee, as \nthe chairman and others have called for, to ensure that we can get this \nunder control.\n  It is a commonsense proposal. We did it 2 years ago. Most Democrats \nand most Republicans here on the floor supported it in the past. About \n95 Democrats in the House have also supported it. It is a dollar-for-\ndollar reduction over 10 years as we raise the debt limit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, on January 23, something marvelous \nhappened. What was that? The House, on a strong bipartisan basis, \npassed a bill which would raise the debt limit, which would extend the \ndebt limit to May 18. It was bipartisan. Speaker Boehner is to be \ncommended.\n  This town is criticized for its lack of working together because it \nis just too partisan. Speaker Boehner found a solution to help us \nrelieve the pressure so we can get our job done and get the deficit \nspending under control.\n  The method suggested by the Senator from Ohio is a step backward. We \nhave tried that. We tried that a couple of years ago, and it didn't \nwork. We all remember August 11, when the markets basically collapsed \nwhen the credit agencies began to downgrade our debt.\n\n[[Page S426]]\n\n  So I say let's follow the lead of the bipartisan Speaker, who found a \nway through great leadership to pass a provision. We should pass the \nsame provision because if we don't, then we will be back to chaos.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Amending the provision means it has to go back to the \nHouse. If you think the markets are in disarray today, just think of \nthe lack of confidence that would prevail if this amendment were to \nsucceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I move to table the Portman amendment \nand ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKerry) and the Senator from Washington (Mrs. Murray) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 7 offered by the Senator from Ohio, Mr. Portman.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, this amendment is a commonsense \namendment that would end government shutdowns as well as keep us from \nfacing these last-minute budget deals. For all regular programs or \nactivities for which an appropriation bill has not been approved, the \nEnd Government Shutdowns Act would automatically continue funding--no \nsignificant disruption, no crisis for citizens, no furloughed \nemployees, and no rush to approve a budget agreement that folks simply \nhaven't read.\n  It doesn't take pressure off lawmakers altogether, however, because \nit forces us to complete our work by saying that after 120 days, \nspending would be reduced by one percentage point and then every 90 \ndays by one more percentage point. It would force the administration, \nCongress, and Members of both parties to come together to make sure we \nhave regular order and we have a process by which we have to get \nappropriations bills done, which we haven't been doing around here.\n  Instead of bouncing from crisis to crisis worrying about government \nshutdowns and having to vote on rush bills that Members haven't read \nand staff haven't had time to review, this is a more sensible and \nlogical way to proceed. The American people expect us to do it and I \nhope we get support from both sides of the aisle on this bipartisan \napproach.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I oppose the amendment. It would \ntrigger an automatic CR if Congress doesn't pass appropriations bills \nor a CR.\n  I understand the Senator's goal, but I oppose the amendment for three \nreasons: One, the amendment is really about cutting; it is not about \nkeeping the government open. It includes an automatic CR with a 1-\npercent cut every 90 days, which means it would be compounded--these \nwould be compounded cuts by compounded interest--if the Congress does \nnot pass an appropriations bill. So a cut every 90 days would be a 1-\npercent cut, and then the following 90 days another 1 percent.\n  The amendment gives up Congress's constitutional responsibility. If \nwe go on auto pilot, it gives the major power of the purse, which is \nmandated in the Constitution, to OMB and Cabinet officers--essentially \nnonelected political appointees. I don't think the Congress or the \nAmerican people want to give the power of the purse to nonelected \npolitical appointees. Also, I agree we need to get back to regular \norder.\n  Madam President, because I disagree with this amendment, I move to \ntable the Portman amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 8 offered by the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Toomey.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, the underlying bill we are going to vote \non in a little while suspends the debt ceiling for a period of time, as \nwe all know. My amendment does not change that fact, but it addresses \none of the consequences of that fact.\n  The fact is this bill suspends the debt ceiling, but it does not \nresolve the underlying problem. So we are going to be back here in a \nfew months with the same impasse we have had in the past: What do we do \nabout the mounting debt? What do we do about having reached the debt \nceiling? Will we do anything about curbing the spending that is driving \nthis problem?\n  My point is we are going to be back at this situation where we will \nhave reached the debt limit once again, we will be at this impasse as \nto how to resolve this situation, and none of us can possibly know \ntoday how quickly that will be resolved. We cannot know how the other \nbody will vote, how this body will vote, the President--we cannot know.\n  It seems to me, given the inherent uncertainty, we ought to at least \nhave a contingency plan that minimizes any disruption in the event that \nthe debt ceiling is not raised immediately upon reaching the expiration \nof this period. That is what this amendment is all about.\n  My amendment is about minimizing the risk of disruption in the event \nthat the debt ceiling is not raised at the moment the time expires. \nWhat it does is it instructs the Treasury Secretary to prioritize three \ncategories of payments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. This amendment would prioritize interest on our debt, \nSocial Security payments, Active-Duty military, and authorize the \nTreasury to raise the debt ceiling as necessary to cover those three \ncategories.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I appreciate the intent of the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania. When we stop and think about this amendment, it \nreminds us of the movie and the book ``The Hunger Games.'' In ``The \nHunger Games,'' you will recall, children were pitted against each \nother until one survived.\n  Under this amendment, there are three categories that are protected: \nmilitary pay, Social Security, and bondholders. Everybody else is out \nfor him or herself. The Treasury Secretary would have to decide who \ngets what money, what funds--whether it is food stamps, whether it is \nMedicare, whether it is Medicaid, whether it is the Coast Guard; \nwhatever it is, it would be total chaos, and people who would find \ntheir food stamps cut would find themselves in greater hunger.\n  This is a very disruptive amendment. If you think the country is \nworried about a lack of confidence now, if this were the law, there \nwould be less confidence, there would be total chaos in this country. I \ncannot think of a more disruptive amendment that would cause so many \nproblems. It truly is a ``hunger games'' amendment and I urge that we \ntable the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I move to table the Toomey amendment and \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

This amendment would stop the transfer of F-16s and Abrams \ntanks to Egypt. Egypt is in danger of unraveling. Egypt is currently \nruled by martial law. I think it is unwise to give our most \nsophisticated weaponry to a country in such disarray. I think it is \nunwise to give our most sophisticated weaponry to a country ruled by a \nPresident who recently said that Jews are bloodsuckers and descendents \nof apes and pigs.\n  I hope my colleagues will consider the ramifications of continuing to \narm such an unstable regime, and I urge a vote in support of ending \narms sales at this point to Egypt.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  Would that this amendment were as simple as the junior Senator from \nKentucky described. His amendment would hinder our military assistance \nprogram and licenses for commercial sales of all major military \nequipment, including aircraft, ships, tanks, other armored vehicles, \nand so on.\n  Ending these contracts would not only mean a loss of thousands and \nthousands of American jobs, it would incur more than $2 billion in \ncontract termination penalties for U.S. taxpayers. We would also put at \nrisk our access to the Suez Canal, the overflights of the U.S. Air \nForce over Egyptian territory, cooperation on the Sinai, Gaza, Syria, \nand elsewhere in the Middle East and North Africa--a part of the world \nwhere we need all the allies we can get--and our emphasis on the \nability to keep the Israeli-Egyptian peace agreement going.\n  Do I have problems with the way the Morsi government is going? \nCertainly. But removing our ability to be involved with keeping that \npeace agreement and our ability to influence, this is not the way to do \nit.\n  It is shortsighted and harmful to U.S. security arrangements.\n  I move to table the amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren).

Madam President, I have a very simple, straightforward \nmotion to commit. It would commit the bill back to the Finance \nCommittee for 7 days only with instructions to find savings--cuts--\nequal to the amount this bill would increase the debt limit--very \nsimple, very straightforward, and very reasonable. This would only take \n$30 billion to $40 billion a year, which is very doable.\n  The American people are asking when we are going to turn to the \nspending side of the equation. President Obama talked all through the \ncampaign about balance. Well, we have had the tax increases. Now we are \nhaving the debt increases. When are we going to have any new spending \ncuts? This would at least start, in a modest way, on some reasonable \nspending cuts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator wish to call up his motion?\n  Mr. VITTER. Yes, I call up the motion to commit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The motion is as follows:\n\n                   Motion to Commit With Instructions\n\n       Mr. Vitter moves to commit the bill H.R. 325 to the \n     Committee on Finance with isntructions to report the same \n     back to the Senate within 7 days with legislative language \n     that makes changes in existing programs that reduce Federal \n     spending by the increase amount required by section 2(b) (as \n     estimated by CBO) over the period of fiscal years 2013 to \n     2021.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, we have essentially already voted on \nthis. It is very similar to the Portman amendment, which lost by a vote \nof 54-to-44. This approach was rejected by the House of Representatives \nwhen the Speaker sent over the debt increase to us, which gives us \nbreathing room. We tried the approach suggested by the Senator in \nAugust 2011--to tie in spending. It didn't work. This moves us \nbackward, not forward.\n  I think we should give praise to the Speaker for putting together a \nbipartisan approach to, in a way, begin to resolve our debt and debt \nlimit solutions, and so I ask that this motion be tabled.\n  I move that this motion, the Vitter motion, be tabled, and I ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I know that some have raised questions about \nwhether Section 2 of the bill is constitutional under the 27th \nAmendment, though the legislation does not lower pay but rather \nwithholds it temporarily. Of course, as members of the House knew by \nthe time they passed the bill, Section 2 is largely moot since the \nSenate leadership previously announced our intention to take up a \nbudget resolution, regardless of whether H.R. 325 is enacted.\n  In any event, does my colleague agree with me that even if the law is \nchallenged in court and Section 2 is found to be unconstitutional for \nany reason, the first section would remain in force? That is, does he \nagree that, in such a circumstance, Section 2 should be severed from \nthe rest of the legislation, leaving the debt limit suspension \nunaffected?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I do agree with the majority leader. As we have \ndiscussed, it should be obvious that the overriding, critical purpose \nof this legislation is to suspend the debt limit and avoid the \ncatastrophic implications of a default. This is an entirely different \nand severable issue from Section 2, which relates to the budget \nresolution and member pay.\n  Mr. President, it would make no sense to vitiate the suspension of \nthe debt limit, and risk default, because of an entirely separate \nissue. It is hard to believe that many, if any, of my colleagues would \nwant that result. In fact, were a court to strike down Section 1 \nbecause of problems with Section 2, there could be serious \nconsequences, potentially including uncertainty about the validity of \nTreasury securities issued with the full faith and credit of the United \nStates. Nobody would want that to happen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to a vote on passage of the measure.\n  Who yields time?\n  All time has expired.\n  The bill was ordered to a third reading and was read the third time.\n  Mr. BEGICH.

Mr. President, the latest economic report came out \nyesterday, and it showed that the economy of the United States actually \nshrank in the last quarter of 2012, with U.S. exports plunging 5.7 \npercent. You heard me correctly--the economy is growing more slowly. In \nfact, it is contracting rather than growing. This news is a sobering \nreminder that we are still experiencing the weakest economic recovery \nand the longest period of high unemployment since the Great Depression, \nand it has very human consequences. Millions of Americans are out of \nwork or they are working part time when they wish they could work full \ntime so they can provide for their families.\n  We cannot create more jobs in this economy unless the economy grows. \nWe must never accept slow growth and high unemployment as the new \nnormal. As I said, these are not just economic concerns, these are \nhuman concerns. When millions of people are unable to get full-time \njobs, the social and psychological effects can be devastating for \nindividuals, families, and entire communities. Yet it seems that the \nPresident is no longer focused on the economy. By shutting down the \nWhite House Jobs Council--with unemployment at 7.8 percent--the \nPresident is sending a clear message that the economy and jobs are no \nlonger his top priorities and that his priorities lie elsewhere. This \nis greatly disappointing.\n  We must do everything we can within our power to revive the American \njobs machine and accelerate the pace of U.S. economic growth. That \nmeans doing some simple but apparently complicated things at the same \ntime, such as reforming our Tax Code, abolishing unnecessary and \nharmful regulations, and removing the obstacles to greater domestic \nenergy production. In other words, we should copy the simple economic \nblueprint that has proven so successful in my State of Texas: lower \ntaxes, limited government, sensible regulations, and strong support for \nour domestic energy production. These policies have helped Texas turn a \n$5 billion deficit into an $8.8 billion surplus while creating hundreds \nof thousands of new jobs in the private sector.\n  Texas achieved that budget surplus by having the courage to make some \nhard decisions when it came to spending.\n  Unfortunately, the Federal Government continues to spend and spend \nand postpone its own hard decisions about America's long-term finances. \nWhen we look back over the past several decades, for example, we see \nour programs, such as Medicare and Social Security, on an unsustainable \npath, and we see that virtually all of the increases in Federal \nspending come from those programs. When we look ahead over the next \nseveral decades, we see that these programs are headed for bankruptcy. \nThis is not a Republican issue or a Democratic issue, this is \nunacceptable to all of us. Why aren't we doing everything in our power \nto preserve and protect Medicare and Social Security by taking the \nsteps we all know need to be taken in order to save these for future \ngenerations?\n  I know there are some people in the Chamber and across the Capitol \nwho still believe we can solve all of our problems by raising taxes. \nWell, we just saw the American people's taxes go up by roughly $60 \nbillion a year as a result of the fiscal cliff negotiations. The \nPresident has gotten his tax increase. The President has gotten his \npound of flesh. So now it is time for a little bit of what the \nPresident himself likes to call ``balance.'' Where are the spending \ncuts? Where is the spending restraint that would provide the balance to \noffset that revenue increase? The President knows these facts as well \nas anyone. He has acknowledged that tax increases alone cannot save \nprograms such as Medicare. Instead, we all know we need measured \nstructural reforms to make these programs sustainable in the long haul.\n  With the national debt now roughly around $16.5 trillion, with the \nMedicare hospital trust fund projected to be insolvent within 11 years, \nwith our unfunded Medicare liabilities approaching $27 trillion, and \nwith our total unfunded liabilities exceeding $100 trillion, America's \ntoughest financial decisions must not be delayed any longer.\n  The politics, no doubt, are difficult, but the choice is pretty \nsimple: Either we will reform these programs--Medicare and Social \nSecurity--gradually, slowing the rate of growth, or we will be forced \nto slash them abruptly when the bottom drops out of our economy. If we \nreform them gradually, starting now, we can minimize the impact and \nprotect our most vulnerable citizens. If we wait until a debt crisis \nensues and those changes have to be made abruptly, the impact will be \nmuch harsher and they will disproportionately affect low-income people \nand the needy. Nobody wants that. If we continue to kick the can down \nthe road, pretty soon we are going to run out of road.\n  I have one final point. I read in the Washington Post this morning \nthat people were saying that the contraction of the economy has been \nbecause the Federal Government has not been spending enough. Well, I \nwould remind everyone here that about 40 cents out of every dollar the \nFederal Government spends is borrowed money. That racks up trillion-\ndollar-plus annual deficits and contributes to the $16.5 trillion \nnational debt. We cannot keep spending our way out of slow economic \ngrowth. Over the past few years, we witnessed an explosion of new \nFederal spending, and that has not solved our economic problems. We \nhave also seen the weakest economic recovery since the Great \nDepression. So we have seen a confluence of unprecedented Federal \nspending and weak economic growth. That is not a coincidence.\n  In 2008 America ranked No. 1 in the world for global competitiveness. \nWe were No. 1 in the world. In 2012 we ranked seventh. In 2008 we \nranked fifth on the Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic Freedom. \nToday we rank 10th. This decline is simply unacceptable and can be \neasily reversed--not with more government spending of borrowed money, \nthereby exacerbating our deficits and debt and crowding out the private \nsector, creating uncertainty as to what our tax policy will be or what\n\n[[Page S430]]\n\nthe fiscal consequences will be when the bottom drops out. Instead, \nwhat we need are genuine progrowth policies designed to help small \nbusinesses and middle-class families.\n  We don't need more government intervention; we need more \nentrepreneurship and more innovation. Government must simply take its \nboot off the neck of the great American jobs engine. After all, this is \nstill the most dynamic economy on Earth, and America continues to \nattract the best and brightest from around the world who want to come \nto America to achieve their own version of the American dream. With \nbetter leadership--particularly from the President, whose leadership is \nrequired--there is no reason we cannot turn this slow economic growth \naround and turn it into fast growth, which in turn will increase \nprivate sector job creation. It will create more taxpayers who will pay \nmore money into the Treasury, which will help us close that deficit. In \nthe process, we need to expand economic opportunity for all Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, even though the confirmation hearing \nregarding the nomination of former Senator Chuck Hagel for Secretary of \nDefense is going on before the Armed Services Committee, I would like \nto make some comments in terms of my thoughts regarding his potential \nappointment and the conclusion I have come to based on the 130 pages of \nwritten answers to questions posed to Senator Hagel by the Senate Armed \nServices Committee and some of the information I have gleaned, as my \nschedule has allowed, from his testimony before the SASC--ongoing, as I \nsaid.\n  Based on his written answers and what I have heard so far, it is \nclear that Senator Hagel is willing to execute the policies established \nand endorsed by the President. But the idea floated out of the White \nHouse, what the President has described as bipartisan balance--that is \nwhy Senator Hagel was selected--to consideration of these critical \nissues before us regarding the role of the next Secretary of Defense, \ndoesn't hold water.\n  As I said, Senator Hagel has essentially indicated on a number of \noccasions--through his written answers and through his answers to the \nSASC committee--that he is in line with the President's policies and, \nin fact, in some cases, to the left of some of those policies.\n  It is obvious that I and many of my Republican colleagues disagree \nwith many of the views and policy positions taken by the administration \nand Senator Hagel. This is to be expected. Most policy differences \nshould not be sufficient reason to oppose a nomination of a President's \npreferred Cabinet appointment. Elections have consequences, and the \nPresident does have the right to his own advisers. However, this usual \ntolerance of alternative views has its limits. For me, the limit is \nwhen a nominee is of such a high position, such as the Secretary of \nDefense, and that nominee has a point of view which places the United \nStates in greater danger, which I believe is the case for this nominee, \nthen I think we have to ask ourselves a number of questions before we \ngive our support and before we make our decision.\n\n  Senator Hagel's views about the threat posed by Iran's nuclear \nambitions and the best way to counter that threat are significantly \ninconsistent with my own, inconsistent with America's responsibilities, \nI believe, at this moment in history, and inconsistent with the \nsecurity needs of our country and the survival of our friends.\n  I have been focused on the Iranian nuclear threat for more than 5 \nyears. After I left my position as Ambassador to Germany and returned \nto the private sector, I joined the Bipartisan Policy Center. Together \nwith former Democrat Senator Chuck Robb, we cochaired a project on \nIran. The Bipartisan Policy Center has been on the front lines of those \nringing alarm bells about the situation in Iran and its pursuit of \nnuclear weapons. We issued our first report in 2008 entitled ``Meeting \nthe Challenge: U.S. Policy Toward Iranian Nuclear Development.'' I was \ninvolved in producing a second, more urgent report in 2009 entitled, \n``Meeting the Challenge: Time is Running Out.''\n  After I left the Bipartisan Policy Center and returned to the Senate, \nthe organization produced two more reports on the subject, each more \nurgent than the last, and each demanding clearer, more vigorous, and \nmore determined U.S. policy to avert this ever present danger. Each \nyear since the beginning of my involvement in this Bipartisan Policy \nCommittee project, I have become increasingly worried about Iran's \ncontinuing irresponsible and dangerous behavior and the \nadministration's inconsistent, unsure policies to respond to this \ngrowing threat.\n  Preventing Iran from gaining nuclear weapons capability is the most \nurgent foreign policy matter facing the United States and international \nsecurity. The consequences of a nuclear weapons-capable Iran are not \ntolerable, not acceptable, and must motivate the most powerful and \neffective methods and efforts possible to prevent this from happening. \nBased on his record as a Senator and subsequent public statements, I do \nnot believe Senator Hagel agrees with this assessment.\n  Since returning to the Senate, I have joined many colleagues in \npressing for a robust, comprehensive, three-track effort to raise the \nstakes for the Iranian regime and compel it to live up to its \ncommitments and halt its weapons program. The first track is enhanced \ndiplomatic efforts--and I mean enhanced. We have pressed the \nadministration to create, invigorate, and motivate a much enhanced \ninternational coalition devoted to one single objective: to prevent \nIran from gaining nuclear weapons.\n  This doesn't mean simply repeated outreaches to the Iranian regime \nitself to engage in dialogue. The Obama administration came into office \npromising such discussions, but this has gone nowhere, nor have other \ndiplomatic efforts, either unilateral or multilateral. All such \ndiplomatic efforts have failed--all such diplomatic efforts have \nfailed--for nearly a decade in achieving the goal of preventing Iran \nfrom its continuous and relentless pursuit of developing nuclear \nweapons.\n  Senator Hagel, whose life story brings him to a justifiable reliance \non dialogue before the use of force--a preference which we all \nunderstand and we all share--has, in my opinion, an exaggerated and \nunrealistic belief in what dialogue and diplomacy can accomplish. This \nis especially so when the dialogue partner is a revolutionary regime of \nzealots with a self-declared historical mission rather than rational \nleaders of a nation state--a huge distinction between dialogue with \nrational states and dialogue with Iran and its irrational leadership.\n  Senator Hagel has long called for direct, unconditional talks with \nthe Iranian regime, not to mention direct talks with Hamas, Hezbollah, \nand Syria as well. He has pressed that such talks should proceed \nwithout the backing gained from other, more forceful, credible options. \nThis approach is far too weak to be effective and reveals a person less \ncommitted to results than this critical moment demands.\n  The second track of a comprehensive search for a solution is \nsanctions. I have supported all legislative efforts to create and \nimpose both unilateral and multilateral sanctions on Iran, leveraging \nsimilar commitments from our friends and allies when possible, and \npursuing unilateral sanctions when necessary. Indeed, it has been our \nwillingness to impose sanctions by unilateral action that arguably has \nstiffened the spine of the international community and made \nincreasingly harsh multilateral sanctions regimes possible.\n  Senator Hagel does not see it that way. He repeatedly voted against \nsanctions legislation, even opposing those aimed at the Iranian \nRevolutionary Guard Corps, which at the time was killing our troops in \nIraq. He has long argued against sanctions imposed by the United States \nabsent an international judgment by others that we are doing the right \nthing. He has not seen the connection between America's firmness, \ndetermination and leadership, and international acquiescence. It is his \ninstinct to give a veto to Brussels or Paris or even Moscow and \nBeijing, and I cannot support the nomination of a Secretary of Defense \nwho shows such deference to foreign politicians.\n  Senator Hagel has famously agreed publicly that the United States is \na\n\n[[Page S431]]\n\nbully. I assume our reliance on unilateral sanctions when necessary may \nfit his definition of bully. I cannot possibly agree.\n  The third track of a comprehensive approach to this crucial problem \nis open discussion of, and early preparation for, military options. It \nhas become increasingly clear over the past several years that \ndiplomacy and sanctions alone are too weak to compel Iranian compliance \nwith the international communities' demands. A frank discussion of \nmilitary options and preparations give credibility to the rest of our \nstrategy. No one should suppose these steps mean anything other than \npreparing the ground for the logical and necessary access to measures \nof last resort.\n  At the Bipartisan Policy Center, I participated in an exhaustive \nanalysis of all of the means and consequences of a potential military \naction against Iran's nuclear weapons program. There were no war \nadvocates among us. Nevertheless, if it is true that a nuclear weapons-\ncapable Iran is unacceptable, as now four U.S. Presidents have publicly \ndeclared, including the current President, then our Nation and the \ninternational community as a whole must see with vivid clarity what \nmeasures remain should the first two tracks fail to achieve the \nobjective.\n\n  The Iranian regime must be especially clear-eyed and nondelusional \nabout those potential consequences should it not change its behavior. \nIndeed, to give the diplomatic and sanctions tracks the essential \ncredibility they require, then a military option must be entirely \nbelievable if, as the President has repeatedly said, Iranian possession \nof nuclear arms capability is unacceptable.\n  I cannot conclude that Senator Hagel views the military option in \nthis credible way. Indeed, he has maintained in recent years that ``a \nmilitary strike against Iran is not a viable, feasible, responsible \noption.''\n  Many of us have examined Senator Hagel's on-the-record comments \ncarefully and parsed each one to determine what his views on these \nimportant subjects actually are. In the meantime, he has hastened to \napparently amend the record so that his advocates can point to more \nrecent statements that seem to negate the earlier ones. But this is not \na court of law, and we are not looking for admissible evidence. Rather, \nwe are defining the basis for our own judgments on how the full pattern \nof words and behavior define the views and likely future behavior of \nthe nominee.\n  In so doing, I have concluded that when Senator Hagel pays lipservice \nnow to the contention that ``all options are on the table,'' it does \nnot reveal his real, extinctive, and strong disinclination to consider \nmilitary force if it becomes necessary. For me, that is very nearly a \ndisqualifying position for any Secretary of Defense.\n  A related concern is what I believe to be Senator Hagel's views about \nthe so-called containment option. This is related to his nearly \nnotorious views about nuclear proliferation in general. He has famously \nsaid ``the genie of nuclear weapons is already out of the bottle, no \nmatter what Iran does.'' I fear Senator Hagel holds the mistaken view \nthat a nuclear-armed Iran is more palatable than the consequences of \ngoing to war to prevent it. That is a dangerously corrosive idea.\n  Indeed, my concern was heightened this morning when Senator Hagel, in \ntestimony before the Armed Services Committee, referred twice to his \nsupport for containment. It was only when someone handed him a note, \npresumably reminding him the administration's formal position did not \nsupport containment, did he correct himself and say he didn't support \nit either.\n  So what are we to conclude relative to what he truly believes and \nwhere he actually stands on a number of issues vital to our national \nsecurity? The supreme fallacy of the containment option as modified is \nthat it severs the spine of all of our friends and allies who are \njustifiably appalled by the contemplation of real military action. They \nwill eagerly lead toward a containment option should others fail. But \nwe must all see clearly that, in fact, containment means toleration.\n  A nuclear weapons-capable Iran that we believe can be contained is \none that we are, therefore, prepared to tolerate. This is an illusion \nand one that makes our task all that much harder. If others--especially \nIran, but also including our allies and other coalition partners--come \nto believe that we would consider ever tolerating a nuclear Iran \nbecause it can somehow be contained, then none of our efforts to \nprevent it will work. This is why a nominee for Secretary of Defense \nwho is less than firm on this key point is, in my opinion, a dangerous \nchoice.\n  It has been said by Senator Hagel's supporters that whatever his \npersonal views and past statements on these important issues, as \nSecretary he will toe the line; he will not be making these basic \npolicies himself. In other words, those of us who find his policies \nobjectionable are encouraged to support the nominee despite his views, \nnot because of them.\n  I cannot bring myself to support a nominee based on the assumption \nthat his own views will become irrelevant once he is under the policy \nyoke imposed by the White House.\n  Finally, the most worrisome consequence of confirming Senator Hagel \nto be Secretary of Defense is something on which the ayatollahs in \nTehran and I can agree: The confirmation will tell the Iranian regime \nthat their fear of U.S. military action in Iran is now unjustified. \nThey can rest more comfortably that their pursuit of nuclear weapons is \nless likely to provoke the military option that, until recently, may \nhave seemed more credible.\n  The Iranians will, therefore, feel less constrained in pursuing their \ndangerous nuclear ambitions. That, more than any other reason, is why I \nam voting no on the Hagel nomination.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, all of us in our lives from time to time \nhear of the passing, the death of someone we know. Sometimes it is \nfamily, often friends, or perhaps someone we are only vaguely \nacquainted with. This past week, we learned of the death of a Kansas \nCity resident, Adele Hall. Her passing so personally saddens me because \nAdele Hall was a person with such optimism and so engaged in improving \nthe lives of others.\n  Kansas City, in fact, lost one of their greatest champions when Adele \nHall passed away. Adele was a longtime resident of Kansas City and was \nwell known and well loved, highly respected for her acts of service and \nkindness to others. When she wasn't serving on a board of a nonprofit, \nshe was raising funds for a worthy cause or volunteering with children. \nMy guess is that she probably was doing all of those things at once.\n  Adele, I am sure, had the financial resources to live a life \ndifferent than in service to others, but she chose to commit her life \nto making sure others had the chance for the success that she had.\n  She grew up in Lincoln, NE, and she was--I read today, in her honor, \nthat she was an avid Nebraska fan.\n  In Nebraska, Adele learned the importance of giving back by watching \nher own parents volunteer, especially with the Salvation Army. As a \nyoung woman, she developed a love for children and later became \ninvolved in so many organizations that cared for their health and \neducation and well-being. Adele never lost faith in the potential of a \nyoung person's life. One of her greatest passions was working with \nchildren at Children's Mercy Hospital. Adele served as chairman of the \nboard there and together with the help of professional golfer Tom \nWatson, she established the Children's Mercy Golf Classic, which over a \nquarter of a century has raised more than $10 million for Children's \nMercy. Adele also used her expertise to bless children nationwide \nthrough her work as a member of National Commission for Children.\n\n  Those boards and that service was important to her, but it was always \nthe personal touch, not just serving on a board and making decisions \nabout a hospital or the children it cared for, but personally caring \nfor the children in the hospital.\n  Her actions were guided by a belief in the value of each and every \nindividual. She lived out that Biblical teaching ``love your neighbor \nas yourself,'' through her service as the first woman president of the \nUnited Way of Greater\n\n[[Page S432]]\n\nKansas City. Adele always looked for the best in others and worked to \nbring people together. Her efforts were always at bringing a diverse \ngroup of opinionated people together in a way that would solve a \nproblem.\n  She was an inspiration for other women, and she cofounded the Central \nExchange and the Women's Public Service Network in Kansas City to help \nwomen embrace their careers and develop skills to pursue leadership \npositions.\n  She also served as the board chairman of the Greater Kansas City \nCommunity Foundation and actively participated on boards of the \nPembroke Hill School, Salvation Army, Starlight Theatre, and the \nAmerican Red Cross. To recognize Adele's years of service to the Kansas \nCity community, she was named Kansas Citian of the Year--the first \nwoman to hold that title.\n  In an era when we sometimes wonder what difference one person can \nmake, Adele proved that one person is all it takes to touch the lives \nof others. I have always believed that what we do here in the Nation's \nCapital is important, but the reality is we change the world one soul, \none person at a time. And Adele Hall lived that life and made that \ndifference each and every day.\n  By investing her time, talents, and treasure in the community where \nshe lived, she made a difference one life at a time. Her involvement in \nher community and her selflessness serve as an inspiration, a role \nmodel to every American.\n  Adele was loved. I never met a person who did not love and respect \nAdele Hall, and everyone who knew her loved and admired her and saw her \nas a special person. No doubt, especially she was loved by her family. \nShe was known by a saying, ``Leave the dishes in the sink and play with \nyour kids,'' and her family benefited from that kind of philosophy, her \nwholehearted dedication to each of them.\n  She was married to her husband Don for nearly 60 years and was a \ndevoted wife and a loving mother to their three children. I ask the \nSenate to join me today in extending our heartfelt sympathies to her \nhusband Don, her sons Donald and David, her daughter Margaret, and her \nnine grandchildren. She was loved by them dearly, and she will be \ngreatly missed.\n  Adele once said that voluntarism is a ``belief in love,'' and her \nlove will be forever remembered by the lives she changed for the \nbetter. If your value in life is whether you made a difference while \nyou were here, Adele Hall lived that life and contributed so greatly to \nothers. God bless her for her life and let her be a role model for all \nof us.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/31/senate-section/article/S432-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S432-S433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, this past weekend I had the opportunity \nto attend a conference of the Wyoming American Legion. Many of the \nveterans I spoke with remain very concerned about their health care and \nspecifically about the impacts of the Obama health care law on their \nlives and on their health.\n  The men and women whom I met with are very worried they may lose \ntheir health coverage. Why? Because of the law. They wonder what \nhappened to the insurance premium cuts they were supposed to have \ngotten by now--not in the future but promised to have gotten by now.\n  These men and women have not gotten many of the benefits they were \ntold to expect, but what they are getting are all the costs. That is \nwhy the people I talk with every weekend at home in Wyoming understand \nwhat the Democrats in Washington still will not admit: that the \nPresident's health care law remains unworkable, unpopular, and \nabsolutely unaffordable.\n  Remember when the President promised that if you like your health \ncare plan, you can keep it? Well, all of America now knows it was an \nempty promise, just as when President Obama promised health insurance \npremiums would go down. Over and over, the President said that his law \nwould lower premiums by $2,500 a family by the end of his first term in \noffice. The President has not talked much about that lately. I did not \nhear anything about it in his inaugural address, and I do not expect to \nhear very much about it in his State of the Union Address. It is \nbecause average premiums across the country for families have not gone \ndown--not by the $2,500 that the President promised, not by even \n$1,000, not even by a cent. Instead, average family premiums have \nactually gone up by more than $3,000 during the President's first term. \nThat is a pretty big math error on the part of President Obama, and the \nAmerican people, unfortunately, are the ones who have to pay for his \nmistake.\n  Because of his policies, health insurance is a lot less affordable \nfor a lot of people and for a lot of small businesses. Now many small \nbusinesses are facing what is turning out to be an impossible decision. \nIf they expand their business and cross the law's threshold of 50 \nemployees, they will be subject to the employer insurance mandate. If \nthey choose not to expand, then they are holding back potential growth \nand the opportunities that come with it. In this current economic \nenvironment, the last thing we should be doing is making it more \ndifficult for businesses to expand and hire more people. But because of \nthe President's health care law, that is exactly what is happening.\n  The Wall Street Journal ran a piece recently about a small business \nowner named Carl Schanstra. He owns a parts assembly factory near \nChicago, IL. It is called Automation Systems LLC.\n  Sales have been growing, and the business is doing well, but he has a \nproblem because he already employs close to 50 people. That means he is \ngetting dangerously close to the law's threshold and the new health \ncare burdens it would place on him, including all the expenses.\n  As he puts it, he says: ``I'll be hammered for having more people at \nwork.'' The cost of providing insurance would be enormous. The cost of \npaying the tax penalty for not offering insurance would also be \nenormous.\n\n  That is not a good option for a small business such as Automation \nSystems--a small business that wants to expand, a small business that \nhas an opportunity to expand and hire more people. So he has to look \nfor ways to stay under the law's limits.\n  He plans to raise prices to give himself a buffer against the new \nhealth care law, and he may even have to break his company into two \ndifferent companies so they can stay below the limits. He may avoid \nhiring more people or buy more machinery to replace some of the \nworkers.\n  A rational and responsible business owner wants to make decisions \nbased on what is best for the business and its employees. Now we have \nbusiness owners having to make these decisions based on the crushing \nregulatory burden imposed upon them by Washington.\n  Carl is not the only business owner who is having to face tough \nchoices because of the health care law. According to a new survey \nGallup put out last week, more than half of small business owners say \nhealth care costs and taxes are hurting them a lot. Those two things--\nhealth care costs and taxes--led the list of their concerns by a wide \nmargin. When Gallup looked specifically at businesses that were not \nhiring, 61 percent of them--nearly two out of every three--said it was \nbecause of the potential cost of health care.\n  Washington should be creating policies that encourage businesses to \nhire and making hiring easier. Again, that is what our economy needs to \nrecover. Instead, this administration has been piling up more costs, \nmore regulations, and more ways to discourage hiring.\n  That is one person's story. But just down the road from where Carl is \ntrying to do what is best for his business and his workers, the city of \nChicago itself is facing some of the same concerns. Chicago has decided \nit cannot afford to pay the health care costs of its retired city \nworkers. So what is the whole city of Chicago going to do? Well, it is \nlooking at dumping those former workers into the ObamaCare exchange. It \nwould save the city a lot of money, but the taxpayers of Illinois and \nevery other State would have to make up the tab because the city is \ntrying to skip out on paying their own bill.\n  Federal subsidies for Chicago retirees would be $44 million in 2014, \nand that amount would only grow over time. Of course, we know the mayor \nof Chicago is Rahm Emanuel. He was one of the main figures in the room \nwhere ObamaCare was being written, and we\n\n[[Page S433]]\n\nall know--all of America knows--that room was behind closed doors. He \nknew exactly the kinds of incentives the law was creating. He also knew \nexactly how many people would be affected. And he knew how people such \nas him could use the law to push health care costs onto someone else.\n  Chicago takes that step today. Other cities might be right behind and \nwaiting to do the same thing tomorrow and the day after that, and so \non.\n  We need to reduce health care costs in America. But all we do and all \nwe see is cost-shifting, robbing Peter to pay Paul. We need businesses \nto hire people so our economy can grow. Those businesses are holding \nback because of the health care law. We need to reduce Washington's \nout-of-control spending. But cities such as Chicago are trying to shift \ntheir health care costs to hard-working taxpayers elsewhere.\n  Meanwhile, Democrats in the Senate and the White House refuse to \naccept that we have any problem at all with entitlement spending and \nthe budget deficits we are looking at. It is time for Democrats to take \ntheir head out of the sand, to admit that the President's health care \nlaw did not solve our problems; in fact, it made things worse.\n  Then I picked up the paper this morning--today's Wall Street \nJournal--and a front-page headline is: ``Some Unions Grow Wary Of \nHealth Law They Backed.'' We all remember the days when unions lobbied \nfor this health care law. Their Web sites said: We need this health \ncare law now. They came to Capitol Hill, lobbying here, members having \nrallies.\n  Well, let me read some of the beginning of the article that is on the \nfront page of today's paper.\n\n       Labor unions enthusiastically backed the Obama \n     administration's health-care overhaul when it was up for \n     debate. Now that the law is rolling out, some are turning \n     sour.\n       Union leaders say many of the law's requirements--\n\n  Many of the law's requirements--\n\n     will drive up the costs for their health-care plans and make \n     unionized workers less competitive.\n\n  So there we have it. We have what happens to a small business, why \nthe health care law is hurting it. We see how the city of Chicago is \nresponding to the perverse incentives in the health care law to force \nits costs onto other hard-working taxpayers, and now we see the very \nunions that supported the health care law during the lobbying phase and \nduring the time of the vote now saying the law's requirements are going \nto drive up the cost for their health care plans.\n  It just seems it is time for people on Capitol Hill to realize how \nbad this health care law is. We need real entitlement reform that \npreserves vital safety net programs for future generations. We need \nreal health care reform that gives people the care they need, from a \ndoctor they choose, at lower cost.\n  President Obama continues to give the American people and give all of \nus empty promises. Congress should give hard-working American taxpayers \nthe solutions they expect and they deserve.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I want to congratulate David Kappos, \nwhose last day as the Director of the Patent and Trademark Office, PTO, \nis today. Director Kappos's leadership of the PTO has been applauded by \nall segments of the intellectual property, IP, community. This is no \neasy feat. The IP community is as diverse as our economy, and the \ncommunity's views on IP law are hardly uniform.\n  I have known Director Kappos since well before he entered government \nservice, and I was particularly pleased to chair his confirmation \nhearing in July 2009. Director Kappos was well suited to understand \nboth how to manage a $2 billion office and meet the needs of inventors \nand innovators. He began his career as an engineer and worked in the IP \nlaw department of IBM in nearly all of its business units before \nfinally managing all of IBM's IP law interests as vice president and \nassistant general counsel. IBM is a large employer in Vermont and one \nof the reasons that Vermont receives more patents per capita than any \nother State.\n  Anyone who has met Director Kappos cannot help but be taken with his \nintegrity and his clear passion for an intellectual property system \nthat rewards inventors and creators. Those leadership qualities have \nmotivated the PTO staff, which has reduced the time it takes to receive \nresponses from the patent office on applications and, according to most \nexperts, simultaneously improved the quality of patents that the PTO \nissues.\n  Director Kappos played an instrumental role in the development and \npassage of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act--one of the few \nbipartisan, job-creating bills of the 112th Congress. Soon after being \nconfirmed as Director in August 2009, he sat down to work with me and a \nbipartisan, bicameral group of Members to work out a consensus on \npatent reform legislation.\n  Director Kappos's credibility within the patent community and his \nleadership was critical in bringing together the different interests to \nsupport the changes in the America Invents Act that will speed the time \nfor high quality patents to issue from the PTO while providing more \nefficient methods for challenging low quality patents. Since enactment, \nDirector Kappos and his team have set the PTO on course to implement \nthe key provisions of the act, which will improve the patent system for \ndecades.\n  The America Invents Act was the highest profile law on which I worked \nwith Director Kappos, but it was not the only one. Early in his tenure, \nthe PTO recommended legislation that ultimately became the Trademark \nTechnical Correction Act of 2010 and the Patent Law Treaties \nImplementation Act of 2012.\n  Director Kappos's full title is Under Secretary of Commerce for \nIntellectual Property and Director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark \nOffice. This is one of the longest titles in government and underscores \nthe vast responsibility he has had, and which is particularly important \nbecause IP is such a key driver of our economy.\n  I am saddened that Director Kappos has decided to step down but \nheartened by how he has energized the PTO. The President and the \nCommerce Department have lost a valuable member of their economic team. \nI wish Dave all the best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/31/senate-section/article/S434-2", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING SENATOR JOHN KERRY\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Throughout \nthat time, Senator Kerry has consistently shown a tremendous breadth of \nknowledge regarding the key foreign policy challenges of the day.\n  Most recently as chairman of the Committee, Senator Kerry championed \nSenate ratification of the New START treaty--making both our country \nand the world safer from the threat of nuclear proliferation.\n  And on a wide range of issues--from United States policy toward \nAfghanistan and Pakistan to efforts to achieve peace between Israel and \nthe Palestinians--he has offered thought-provoking insight and \nexpertise.\n  That is why I believe that no one is as prepared as Senator Kerry to \nserve as our Nation's top diplomat.\n  I am particularly proud of the many issues we have worked on \ntogether, including fighting HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, \naddressing climate change, and working to end human trafficking around \nthe globe.\n  I am also grateful that Senator Kerry worked with me to establish the \nfirst-ever Senate subcommittee dedicated to ending violence against and \npromoting the advancement of women and girls around the globe.\n  I look forward to continuing to work on these and the many other \nforeign policy challenges facing our country with our new Secretary of \nState, Senator Kerry, and wish him all the best in his new position.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/31/senate-section/article/S434-3", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S434-S435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            ANNUAL REPORT OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ETHICS\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

President Obama \nrecognizes this valuable partnership, hosting Indian Prime Minister \nManmohan Singh at his first state dinner in 2009 and traveling to India \nin 2010. As President Obama begins his second term, it is vital that \nthe United States remain committed to deepening our strategic \npartnership with India. In the coming decades, United States-India \nrelations will be among the world's most important.\n  It is clear that United States-India cooperation on commercial and \nsecurity initiatives over the past decade has resulted in greater \nopportunity for both nations. United States bilateral trade with India \nhas increased 4\\1/2\\ times in the last 10 years, and India is now one \nof the fastest growing export markets for the United States. Last year, \nIndia became the world's third largest economy in terms of purchasing \npower parity. In 2005, the United States and India signed a 10-year \ndefense framework agreement which has greatly expanded bilateral \nsecurity cooperation between our nations. India now conducts more \ndefense exercises and personnel exchanges with the United States than \nwith any other country.\n  As the world's largest democracy, India shares with the United States \na strong commitment to representative government and the rule of law, \nbut these are not the only values that bind us. It is my hope that the \nUnited States will continue to pursue a course with India that promotes \ncollaboration on security, encourages civic engagement and open \ngovernance, and expands bilateral trade and investment. I look forward \nto a strong United States-India relationship for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/31/senate-section/article/S435-2", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TERRY SANFORD HIGH SCHOOL 100TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. BURR.

As the oldest high school in \nCumberland County, Terry Sanford High School continually strives to \nprovide a global and multicultural educational experience to its \nstudents and its community.\n  The school originally opened its doors in 1913 as Fayetteville High \nSchool. In 1968, the school was renamed Terry Sanford High School after \nthe late Senator James Terry Sanford, who served as the 65th Governor \nof North Carolina before going on to honorably serve in this body for 7 \nyears.\n  The students, faculty, and staff at Terry Sanford High School are led \nby Principal David Haggerty, and all continue to reflect the proud \naccomplishments of the Fayetteville community. Throughout the last \ncentury, the school has served as a springboard for students interested \nin the successful pursuit of a variety of academic fields. It has been \nrecognized for its diverse student body, globally focused education, \nand ability to prepare students for future successes.\n  Additionally, the school's academic rigor sets it apart from others \nlike it. Its School of Global Studies offers courses that encourage \nglobal awareness among students and cultural and social growth. During \na time of such increasing globalization, academic institutions such as \nTerry Sanford High School are invaluable in our efforts to prepare our \nchildren for achievement in a 21st century world.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing and \ncongratulating Terry Sanford High School in Fayetteville, NC, for \nserving as a pioneer for secondary education in Cumberland County and \nfor continuing to uphold such high academic standards in its work to \neducate its students and community. May Terry Sanford High School's \noutstanding reputation for an engaging and enriching education be \nrecognized and appreciated by the citizens of North Carolina and this \nCongress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/31/senate-section/article/S435-3", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S435-S436]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO ED WATERSTREET\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, on February 9, theater lovers and \nperformers will come together at the Kirk Douglas Theatre in Culver \nCity, CA, to honor Ed Waterstreet, the retiring founding artistic \ndirector of Deaf West Theater.\n  Mr. Waterstreet founded the Deaf West Theater in 1991 with the goal \nof establishing the first permanent, resident American Sign Language \ntheater company on the west coast. Ed began--as he puts it--``with only \none chair, one desk and a typewriter in an office space shared with and \ndonated by the Fountain Theater in Hollywood.'' From those humble \nbeginnings, he inspired and led the creation of a theater company that \nhas produced 40 plays and 4 musicals, and has won more than 80 theater \nawards. Deaf West Theater's production of ``Big River: The Adventures \nof Huckleberry Finn'' opened in North Hollywood and ended up in New \nYork City, earning two Tony nominations and a Tony honor for excellence \nin theater. Equally important, he succeeding in creating a theater \nwhose productions are fully accessible to individuals who are deaf and \nhard of hearing, as well as others.\n  I have had the pleasure of attending both ``Big River'' and other \nDeaf West performances and, let me tell you, it is a thrilling and \nunique experience. Productions are presented in American Sign Language, \nwith simultaneous sign-to-voice translation for hearing members of the \naudience. As Ed explains: ``Our deaf audiences can have the pleasure of \nwatching the story unfold in our native American Sign Language. And on \nthe other side of the coin, our hearing audiences have the customary \ntheater experience, enhanced by the visual expressiveness of American \nSign Language.''\n  Ed Waterstreet has had a long and distinguished career in theater. \nBefore founding Deaf West Theater, he was a long-time member of the \nNational Theater for the Deaf. His Hollywood acting credits include the \nEmmy-winning 1985 drama ``Love Is Never Silent.'' Throughout his more \nthan two decades at the helm of Deaf West Theater, he has been \ndedicated to expanding opportunities for deaf artists. And he has \npioneered innovative approaches to integrating nonhearing and hearing \nperformers in stage productions.\n\n[[Page S436]]\n\n  Ed is now retired from Deaf West Theater, but he is by no means \nretiring. He says, ``The theater is still my baby.''

FRED HAWTHORNE\n\n Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, today I wish to honor Dr. Fred \nHawthorne, who recently was named as a recipient of the National Medal \nof Science for his important research involving the use of the chemical \nelement boron in the treatment of cancer, arthritis, and other \ndiseases. On February 1, 2013, Dr. Hawthorne will be one of only 22 \nrecipients from across the country receiving the award from President \nObama in a ceremony at the White House. This recognition certainly is \nwell-deserved.\n  As the director of the International Institute of Nano and Molecular \nMedicine at the University of Missouri, as well as the Curators' \nDistinguished Professor of Chemistry and Radiology, Dr. Hawthorne has \npioneered the field of boron research throughout his impressive career. \nThe National Medal of Science, the highest award the country can bestow \nupon our scientists, is a fitting recognition of his critically \nimportant and innovative work.\n  Having grown up in Missouri and Kansas, Fred Hawthorne enrolled in \n1944 as a chemical engineering student at the Missouri School of Mines \nand Metallurgy, now the Missouri University of Science and Technology. \nHawthorne later transferred to Pomona College in California, where he \ncompleted his degree in chemistry. In 1953, he earned his Ph.D. from \nUCLA for his work in organic chemistry. In the following years, \nHawthorne's work took him across the country--from Iowa to Alabama, \nPennsylvania to Massachusetts--before returning him to UCLA in 1969, \nwhere he continued his ground-breaking research for more than 37 years.\n  Upon retiring from his academic career at UCLA in 2009, Hawthorne \nreturned once again to Missouri to help build MU's International \nInstitute of Nano and Molecular Medicine. Thanks to Hawthorne's \ndirection, this research center is an international leader in the field \nof boron neutron capture therapy, the cell-selective radiation method \nhe helped pioneer. His work has shown incredible promise in developing \nnoninvasive treatments for cancer and other diseases. As a cancer \nsurvivor myself, I am especially grateful for the treatments Dr. \nHawthorne is exploring to help the many people whom the disease \naffects.\n  Fred Hawthorne's years of dedicated research certainly have made \nlasting contributions to the fields of science and medicine. I thank \nhim again for his important work and congratulate him on this hard-\nearned recognition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/31/senate-section/article/S436-2", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S436]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/31/senate-section/article/S436-3", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S436]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer, laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/31/senate-section/article/S436-4", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S436]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME\n\n  The following bills were read the first time:\n\n       S. 201.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor startup businesses to use a portion of the research and development \ncredit to offset payroll taxes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, each and every day the folks I represent in \nDelaware ask me why doesn't the Senate, why doesn't the Congress focus \non jobs and focus on getting our economy moving again instead of what \nseem to be endless partisan struggles over secondary issues.\n  What I wanted to speak to was a bipartisan bill, which I am \nintroducing, which focuses on how to help create innovation-focused \njobs again in the United States.\n  As you know all too well, our economic recovery has been slower than \nwe had hoped. Although it has been steady, there are still far too many \nAmericans out of work in my home State of Delaware, more than 30,000, \nbut we are building our way back.\n  The task before us is to think not just about an immediate economic \ncrisis but to take a breath and, instead, focus strategically on the \nlong-term future, to take account of what kind of an economy we want to \nbuild for our children and our grandchildren for the America of today \nand tomorrow.\n  The engine of our Nation's greatest economic successes has always \nbeen innovation. From the light bulb to the search engine, American \ninventors and innovators, those who have taken risks and started \ncompanies, have created jobs by the thousands and changed lives by the \nmillions. Before new ideas scaled to market and reach out to change the \nworld, they first have to start in a lab or garage.\n  I know from my own 8 years in the private sector, my work for a \nmaterials-based science company in Delaware, the products we take for \ngranted that are today household items in the world marketplace, often \nstarted as just the sliver of an idea, an idea that\n\n[[Page S440]]\n\nneeded refining through determined investment in research and \ndevelopment.\n  If we want to fuel the next generation of innovation, if we want to \nlay a strong foundation for job creation through invention, I think we \nhave to start by supporting research and development. Research and \ndevelopment is the lifeblood of great American companies and is what \nwill allow us to make things in this country and to be a leading \nmanufacturer in the world and deserves focused investment.\n  If we look at it, nearly 70 percent of America's private sector R \nand about 90 percent our patents are actually in manufacturing, a \nsector that deserves particular attention. Revitalizing American \nmanufacturing will create high-quality, middle-class jobs for the long \nrun, but doing so depends on our ability to take great ideas and turn \nthem into marketable products or improvements in manufacturing \nprocesses that can and will result in things being made right here in \nAmerica. Startups and small businesses all across this country are \nalready taking chances to do just that, and I think it is time for all \nof us in Congress to take a chance on them.\n  Last year, I worked in a bipartisan way with Senator Enzi, Senator \nRubio, Senator Schumer, and others to introduce a bill that would make \nstartup companies eligible for the existing research and development or \nR tax credit. I am proud to reintroduce that legislation as the \nStartup Innovation Credit Act of 2013 with our original cosponsors, as \nwell as Senator Blunt, Senator Stabenow, and Senator Moran.\n  This broad bipartisan support suggests a bill whose time has come. \nAlthough we represent, among the cosponsors, very different parts of \nour country, very different backgrounds, all of us know that to \nstrengthen our economy we have to support innovation and \nentrepreneurship. Each of us is committed to fostering the kind of \nenvironment which supports the private sector and which turns ideas \ninto innovations, innovations into products, and products into \ncompanies that help create good jobs.\n  Under current policy, one way we do that federally is by supporting \nresearch and development through the existing R tax credit. Companies \nthat invest in R generate new products, which sparks new industries \nwith spillover benefits for all kinds of sectors. That is why there has \nlong been strong bipartisan support for the existing R tax credit. By \nall accounts it is working. The R has helped tens of thousands of \nAmerican companies succeed and create jobs.\n  But there is a critical gap in the existing R credit. It isn't \navailable to startups because they are not yet profitable, and thus \nthey don't have an income tax liability against which to take a credit. \nIn fact, more than half the R credit last year was taken by companies \nwith revenue over $1 billion, well-established, profitable companies. \nThere is nothing wrong with that; it is just not targeting these tax \nexpenditures toward the sector of our economy that is taking the \ngreatest risk and in some ways has the greatest potential.\n  This gaping hole in our policy around R can be fixed with a \nrelatively simple tweak. I have been working on finding this solution \nsince I first came here. In fact, the very first bill I introduced \nincluded an expanded version of the R credit.\n  Today, we take another step toward seeing this solution implemented \nwith the reintroduction of this bipartisan Startup Innovation Credit \nAct. It says in order to spur research and development, we should allow \ncompanies to claim the R tax credit against their employment taxes, \nagainst their W-2 instead of their income tax liability. That opens \nthis credit to new companies that don't yet have an income tax \nliability.\n  There lots of companies we could choose. Let me pick one example, \nDeNovix, a small company based in my home State of Delaware that is \ndeveloping instrumentation for bioresearch with a team that includes \nmolecular biologists and engineering professionals.\n  The managing director of DeNovix, Fred Kielhorn, said the legislation \nwe are introducing would help that company to offset some of the costs \nof bringing new, innovative, technology-based products to market and \nfor that this bill earned his strong support.\n  He is just one of many. There is a remarkable list of outside groups, \ncompanies, and organizations that have supported it. I will mention a \nfew: Silicon Valley Leadership Group; Revolution, led by Steve Case of \nAOL; Delaware Chamber of Commerce; the Association for Manufacturing \nTechnology Policy; American Small Manufacturers Coalition; and BIO, a \nnational organization that supports companies doing research and \ndevelopment in the biotechnology space.\n  Supporting small innovative companies in critical early stages of \nresearch and development, in my view could unleash untold innovations \nfor growth and create new jobs for America. At its heart, today's \nlegislation is a jobs bill.\n  Between 1980 and 2005, all net new jobs created in the United States \nwere created by firms 5 years old or less, all of them, about 40 \nmillion jobs over those 25 years. This credit is specifically designed \ntoward those new, young, risk-taking firms. It does not pick winners \nand losers, it doesn't focus on a specific area of the economy or \ntechnology, but instead supports all private sector investments, \njudgments, and decisions that prioritize investment in research and \ndevelopment. Cash in the pocket of small startup companies, such as \nthis tax credit, can make a real difference, especially with financing \nand credit so hard to come by.\n  It was once said the States are the laboratory of democracy. In fact, \nthat is where this idea has come from. Credits just like this have been \ndone before in Iowa, Arizona, New York, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and \nthey have been game changers, helping companies get off the ground and \nkeep their doors open during those demanding first years where they \ninvest and spend so much on hiring and growth.\n  We know this can work. We also know more than half our current \nFortune 500 companies were launched during a recession or a bear \nmarket. The next great American company that may redefine whole \ncategories that may be known worldwide for its products, its services, \nmay be starting right now in a garage or lab somewhere in this great \ncountry. It is an exciting prospect.\n  In fact, we are depending on our inventors, our innovators, and our \nsmall business owners to help innovate our way to a stronger economy \nand fuel a new generation of job creation. Let's give them the support \nthey need and they deserve at a time when they need it the most.\n  I am grateful for all the cosponsors of this bipartisan legislation \nin this Chamber and as well to Congressman Gerlach of Pennsylvania and \nCongressman Kind of Wisconsin, who will introduce the House version of \nthis legislation next week.\n  Rather than shutting our startups out of the R tax credit, let's \nopen the doors to these innovators and see what they can do. I am \nconfident they will surprise us yet again with how high they can reach \nand how far they can go. I think this is a wise investment in opening \nthe doors of innovation, invention, and job creation for our future.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Lautenberg, and Mr. Blumenthal):\n  S. 194.

A bill to authorize improvements to flood damage reduction \nfacilities adjacent to the American and Sacramento Rivers near \nSacramento, California, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce the \nNatomas Basin Flood Protection Improvements Act of 2013.\n  This legislation authorizes the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to \nimprove the flood control infrastructure in the Sacramento area. The \nimprovements will safeguard hundreds of thousands of homes and \nbusinesses.\n  There is a pressing need to improve levees in Sacramento.\n  The Army Corps perpetually cites the city as one of our nation's most \nat-risk for severe flooding. A quick review of the Corps' National \nLevee Database will tell you why. Of the nearly 300 miles of levees \nwithin 10 miles of Sacramento the Corps has deemed 94 miles of levees, \nor 32 percent, ``unacceptable.'' An unacceptable designation means the \nlevee is deficient to the point where it does not provide the \nprotection it is supposed to.\n  The Corps has deemed 29 miles of levees, only 10 percent, ``minimally \nacceptable.''\n  The Corps has yet to even review the remaining 172 miles, 58 percent.\n  None of the 300 miles of levees within 10 miles of Sacramento \nreceived the passing grade of ``acceptable.''\n  But even in this high-risk city, there are priority areas. And the \nNatomas basin, which lies between the American and Sacramento rivers, \nis the top priority for Sacramento flood control.\n  More than 100,000 people in the Natomas flood plain are at high or \nmoderate risk of flooding.\n  The vast majority of these homes would be inundated with more than 10 \nfeet of water should a levee break.\n  In some places, inundation levels would exceed 20 feet.\n  The risks are clear. The Army Corps of Engineers estimates the damage \nfrom a single flood could top $7 billion.\n  Recognizing the need to upgrade the Natomas levees, the Corps of \nEngineers completed a Chief's Report in December 2010 that identified \n$1.1 billion in essential levee improvements.\n  According to the report, the principal levee modifications include \nthe widening of 41.9 miles of existing levees; installation of about \n34.8 miles of soil bentonite cutoff wall; installation of 8.3 miles of \nseepage berms, and bridge remediation on State Route 99.\n  In addition, the report recommends the creation of 75 acres of canal \nhabitat, 200 acres of marsh habitat, and 60 acres of woodland habitat \nto ensure the project complies with the Endangered Species Act.\n  The cost of these improvements will be significant, but the burden \nwill be shared.\n  Understanding the urgency of this work, the Sacramento Area Flood \nControl Agency, SAFCA, and the California Department of Water Resources \nhave begun work on the levee. They have invested more than $400 million \nin the Natomas Basin project, far more than their share, and completed \nabout 18 miles of the basin's 42 miles of levees.\n  I want to recognize SAFCA and the people of Sacramento for this good \nwork. They have done the right thing, moving ahead before the federal \nauthorization, because people's lives and property are in danger.\n  I am proud to say the people of Sacramento have really stepped up and \ncontributed. On two occasions county voters approved special tax \nassessments to begin paying for the repairs on the levee system, first \nin 2007 and again in 2011.\n  The most recent assessment passed overwhelmingly with 84.5 percent of \nvoters supporting the measure.\n  This kind of local commitment should be a model for the Nation. When \nsuch major vulnerabilities exist that threaten a community, it is \nimperative to act quickly.\n  If the Sacramento levees fail, the results will be devastating \nSacramento International Airport, which serves 4.4 million passengers \nper year and is the primary air-cargo hub for the region, will be \nlargely underwater.\n  Interstate 5, Interstate 80 and State Route 99 will be closed or \nrestricted. These roads serve as freight arteries and facilitate the \npassage of more than 2,500 trucks per day.\n  Access to the Port of West Sacramento, the city's primary seaport, \nwill be jeopardized.\n  Just months ago Super-storm Sandy slammed into the East Coast. The \ndestruction in New York and New Jersey reminded us that unpredictable \nweather events can overwhelm our infrastructure with devastating \nconsequences.\n  But with well-placed timely investments, much of worst damage can be \naverted. That's why even during the worst economic downturns in a \ngeneration, Sacramento voters stood together and passed the local tax-\nmeasure to fund this critical project.\n  We don't know when the next flood will occur, but we do know \nSacramento has a well-documented history of catastrophic flooding.\n  Record-breaking storms hit the region in 1956, 1964, 1986 and 1997.\n  During the 1997 storm, levee failures in the nearby cities of \nOlivehurst, Arboga, Wilton, Manteca and Modesto caused mass evacuations \nand millions of dollars in damage.\n  Going back even further, an even more devastating flood in 1861 \noccurred when the American River Levee failed. California's newly \nelected Governor, Leland Stanford, was forced to take a row-boat to his \ninauguration at the State Capitol. The flooding was so bad the state \ngovernment was temporarily relocated to San Francisco.\n  U.S. Geological Survey scientists now believe that the 1861 storm may \nhave been an atmospheric river storm, or ``ARkStorm.'' These events, \nwhich occur every 200 to 400 years, can produce truly devastating \nfloods.\n  In 2011, the USGS conducted a study about the impacts of a large \nARkStorm in California's Central Valley. The results were shocking.\n\n[[Page S442]]\n\n  The storm would cause a 300 mile long, 20 mile wide flood zone across \nmuch of our nation's most productive agriculture lands. It would force \nthe evacuation of 1.5 million residents and cause hundreds of \nlandslides damaging roads, highways, and homes. The study estimates the \ncost to private homeowners and businesses would be $725 billion, nearly \nthree times the cost of a major earthquake in the State.\n  The bottom line is this: the infrastructure currently in place will \nnot stand up to a storm of this magnitude.\n  And the Natomas Basin Flood Protection Improvements Act of 2011 is \none small step toward preparing for such a disaster.\n  This legislation is nearly identical to the bill I introduced with my \nfriend and colleague Senator Boxer, the Chairwoman of the Environment \nand Public Works Committee, last Congress. The only change is that the \ncurrent bill does not include language from the previous bill that \nspecifically allowed ``credits'' for non-federal work on the project.\n  This modification should not be interpreted to reflect a change my \nsupport for the work of the local entities; I believe they have done \nthe right thing by beginning construction on this project, and I \nsupport them receiving credit for their work.\n  Instead, the modification was included to comport with work being \ndone by Chairwoman Boxer on the upcoming Water Resources Development \nAct, or WRDA. That bill will generically address non-Federal crediting \nprovisions and I will work with Chairman Boxer to ensure that \nSacramento can still receive credits for the work they have completed.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 197\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Natomas Basin Flood \n     Protection Improvements Act of 2013''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PROJECT MODIFICATION, AMERICAN AND SACRAMENTO RIVERS, \n                   CALIFORNIA.\n\n       The project for flood damage reduction, American and \n     Sacramento Rivers, California, authorized by section \n     101(a)(1) of the Water Resources Development Act of 1996 \n     (Public Law 104-303; 110 Stat. 3662; 113 Stat. 319; 117 Stat. \n     1839; 121 Stat. 1947), is modified to authorize the Secretary \n     of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, to \n     construct improvements to flood damage reduction facilities \n     adjacent to the American and Sacramento Rivers in the \n     vicinity of Sacramento, California, substantially in \n     accordance with the report of the Chief of Engineers entitled \n     ``American River Watershed (Common Features) Project, Natomas \n     Basin, Sacramento and Sutter Counties, California'', and \n     dated December 30, 2010, at an estimated total cost of \n     $1,389,500,000, with an estimated Federal cost of \n     $921,200,000 and an estimated non-Federal cost of \n     $468,300,000.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BEGICH:\n  S. 199. A bill to amend the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to \nrequire that oil produced from Federal leases in certain Arctic waters \nbe transported by pipeline to onshore facilities and to provide for the \nsharing of certain outer Continental Shelf revenues from areas in the \nAlaska Adjacent Zone; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I wish to speak about legislation I am \nintroducing today that would restore basic fairness to how our Nation \nshares revenue from energy produced Federal waters.\n  The Alaska Adjacent Zone Safe Oil Transport and Revenue Sharing Act \nwould provide Alaskans with the same share of Federal bonus bid and \nroyalty revenue, 37.5 percent, as residents of Gulf Coast States. This \nis about fairness and a fix that is long overdue. Alaskans deserve to \nbe treated as well as residents of the Gulf Coast. We bear the risks \nand the responsibilities of offshore development. It is only fair that \nwe share in the proceeds.\n  Revenue sharing will provide funding for the State of Alaska, local \ngovernments and tribes to mitigate effects of development and provide \nsupport for public sector infrastructure required to both develop the \nresources and respond in terms of emergency.\n  The measure distributes to Alaska 37.5 percent of the Federal bonus \nbids and royalty share from any energy development, fossil or \nrenewable. Of that 37.5 percent; 25 percent is directed to local \ngovernments; 25 percent is directed to Alaska Native corporations; 10 \npercent is directed to tribal governments; and 40 percent is directed \nto the State of Alaska.\n  Additionally, the Federal share is subdivided with 15 percent of the \nFederal royalties directed, without further appropriation, to the Land \nand Water Conservation Fund; and 7.5 percent directly to deficit \nreduction.\n  In addition, this legislation requires oil produced in the Federal \nwaters of the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas to be brought ashore by \npipeline, a method that is safer than tanker transport and secures \nfuture throughput for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline.\n  I am committed to putting in place all the pieces necessary to \nresponsibly develop oil and gas from the Arctic Ocean. Beyond better \npermit coordination, that I have worked on in other legislation and \nwith the administration, this includes more accurate marine science and \nthe two main features of this bill: sharing revenue with the state and \ncoastal communities as well as keeping Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, \nTAPS, flowing into the future.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 199\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Alaska Adjacent Zone Safe \n     Oil Transport and Revenue Sharing Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PRODUCTION OF OIL FROM CERTAIN ARCTIC OFFSHORE \n                   LEASES.\n\n       Section 5 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 \n     U.S.C. 1334) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(k) Oil Transportation in Arctic Waters.--The Secretary \n     shall--\n       ``(1) require that oil produced from Federal leases in \n     Arctic waters in the Chukchi Sea planning area, Beaufort Sea \n     planning area, or Hope Basin planning area be transported by \n     pipeline to onshore facilities; and\n       ``(2) provide for, and issue appropriate permits for, the \n     transportation of oil from Federal leases in Arctic waters in \n     preproduction phases (including exploration) by means other \n     than pipeline.''.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to expand the use of E-Verify, to hold employers \naccountable, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today, along with several colleagues, I \nam introducing legislation to permanently authorize and expand the E-\nVerify program. My bill, the Accountability Through Electronic \nVerification Act, wil1 be a tool for employers who want a legal \nworkforce and it will enhance our ability to hold employers accountable \nfor their hiring practices.\n  Known as the Basic Pilot Program, E-Verify currently provides \nemployers with a simple, web-based tool to verify the work eligibility \nof new hires. In 1986, Congress made it unlawful for employers to \nknowingly hire or employ aliens not eligible to work in the United \nStates. Under current law, if the documents provided by an employee \nreasonably appear on their face to be genuine, the employer has met its \nobligation to review the worker's documents.\n  Because identity theft and counterfeit documents became a thriving \nindustry after the 1986 bill, Congress looked to create a program to \nhelp employers verify the work eligibility of its new hires. We created \nthe Basic Pilot Program in 1996. Employers in this program can \nelectronically verify a new hires' employment authorization by checking \ndata of employees with records maintained by the Department of Homeland \nSecurity and the Social Security Administration.\n  Currently, the E-Verify program is voluntary and free for all \nemployers to use. It is a proven tool in combating illegal immigration. \nToday, I am proposing that the program be a staple in every workplace \nso that American workers are on a level playing field with cheaper \nforeign labor.\n  My legislation would increase penalties on employers who continue to \nhire people unauthorized to work in the country. Employers would be \nrequired to check the status of current employees within 3 years, and \nwould allow employers to run a check prior to offering a job, saving \nthat employer valuable time and resources. Employers will also be \nrequired to re-check those workers whose authorization is about to \nexpire, such as those who come to the United States on temporary visas.\n  My bill also addresses identity theft concerns. The Social Security \nAdministration would be required to develop algorithm technology that \nwould flag social security numbers that are being used more than once. \nFor those who find themselves victim of identity theft, this bill would \namend the criminal code to clarify identity fraud is punishable \nregardless if the defendant did not have knowledge of the victim. This \nprovision stems from the 2009 Supreme Court decision holding that \nidentity theft requires proof that an individual knew the number being \nused belonged to an actual person.\n  While everyone may not agree with every aspect of this bill, it \nserves as a starting point for a much-needed conversation about \nworksite enforcement. The President and many members in Congress are \ngoing to make it a priority to pass an immigration reform bill this \nyear. We need to act. We need change. We need a better system in place \nfor future generations.\n  Part of the discussion on immigration will be on a reliable \nemployment verification program. People back home want employers to be \nheld accountable. And, employers want to be responsible. People want to \nsee our government do more to reduce the magnet for people to cross our \nborders illegally. We must take this opportunity to make sure that \nemployers are abiding by, and able to abide by, the rules. Let us give \nthem the tools they need to do that. I hope more colleagues will join \nme in my effort to achieve accountability through electronic \nverification and by making E-Verify a permanent program.\n\n[[Page S444]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Mr. King):\n  S. 206. A bill to expand the HUBZone program for communities affected \nby base realignment and closure, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nexpand the geographic boundaries of HUBZones located at former U.S. \nmilitary installations closed through the so-called Base Closure and \nRealignment--or BRAC--process. This legislation mirrors S. 3675, the \nHUBZone Expansion Act of 2012, which I introduced with Senator Snowe \nlast session.\n  I am pleased to have my new colleague from Maine, Senator Angus King, \njoin me in offering this legislation. Senator King knows the impact a \nbase closing can have on a local community all too well, coming as he \ndoes from Brunswick, ME, which recently lost a major military \ninstallation through the BRAC process. Military bases are often the \neconomic heart of the towns and cities in which they are located, and \ncommunities can struggle for years to overcome the closure of those \nfacilities.\n  In recognition of this fact, Congress passed legislation providing \nHUBZone status for 5 years to military facilities closed through the \nBRAC process. This allows small businesses located within the HUBZone \nto obtain certain federal contracting preferences. The HUBZone program \nis also available to small businesses located in ``economically \ndistressed communities,'' that suffer from low income, high poverty \nrates, or high unemployment.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, there are currently \n127 BRAC-related HUBZones in the United States. Unfortunately, for many \nof the military bases that have been closed, HUBZone status has not \nbrought the benefits we had hoped for. One of the reasons is simple--\nthe law defines the geographic boundaries of a BRAC-related HUBZone to \nbe the same as the boundaries of the base that was closed. When that is \ncombined with the requirement that 35 percent of the employees of a \nqualifying business must live within the HUBZone, the problem is clear: \nvery few people live on these former bases, so it is difficult or \nimpossible for businesses to get the workers they need to meet the \nrequirements of the HUBZone program.\n  As I mentioned, one of these HUBZones is located at the former \nBrunswick Naval Air Station, in Brunswick, Maine. This facility closed \nin 2011, as a result of the 2005 BRAC round. When the Navy left, \nBrunswick and its neighbor, Topsham, lost more than 2400 military and \ncivilian personnel. These two towns have a combined population of just \n22,000, so losing the Naval Air Station has had a significant economic \nimpact on them. Because so few people actually live within the \nboundaries of the former base, its HUBZone designation does not provide \nthe help they need, and that we had hoped for.\n  My legislation would expand the geographic boundaries of BRAC-related \nHUBZones to include the town or county where the closed installation is \nlocated, or census tracts contiguous to the installation, up to a total \npopulation base of 50,000. This would provide a large enough pool of \npotential workers to enable qualifying businesses to locate within the \nHUBZone, and to help host communities overcome the loss of military \ninstallations closed through the BRAC process.\n  The Association of Defense Communities has endorsed the concept of \nexpanding BRAC-related HUBZones in this manner. In December, the ADC \nwrote to Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Levin and Ranking \nMember McCain, noting how important it is that ``Congress restore its \nintent to support BRAC-impacted communities attracting small businesses \nto help build and strengthen their local economies.''\n  Steve Levesque, the Executive Director of the Midcoast Regional \nRedevelopment Authority, or ``MRRA,'' which oversees the redevelopment \nof the former Brunswick Naval Air Station, has also urged Congress to \nmodify the HUBZone program. In a letter to me last month, Steve \nexplained that BRAC facilities do not have the residential areas needed \nto support the 35 percent residency requirement for businesses located \nwithin the HUBZone. As a consequence, these businesses cannot ``realize \nthe HUBZone benefits for BRAC'd installations as envisioned by \nCongress.''\n  This point was underscored in a letter from Heather Blease, an \nentrepreneur who is hoping to locate a new business at the former \nBrunswick Naval Air Station. Ms. Blease describes the HUBZone law as \n``flawed,'' because the 35 percent residency requirement makes it \nimpossible for businesses like hers to achieve HUBZone status.\n  I ask my collegues to consider the legislation we are offering today \nto help communities get back on their feet after the loss of a military \ninstallation closed through the BRAC process.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    Association of\n\n\n                                          Defense Communities,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 11, 2012.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member McCain: The \n     Association of Defense Communities (ADC) admires your \n     longstanding support of current and former military \n     communities. ADC, the leading organization representing those \n     communities, always appreciates the opportunity to share \n     information with you and your staff that may help strengthen \n     communities with active installations and those that continue \n     to redevelop following base closure or realignment.\n       Communities that have been impacted by Base Realignment and \n     Closure (BRAC) often face severe economic distress for years, \n     especially during times of national economic difficulty. To \n     assist in these communities' recovery, Congress authorized in \n     the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 1997 that BRAC-\n     impacted communities would receive Small Business \n     Administration HUBZone certification, a federal initiative \n     that further helps small businesses in disadvantaged areas to \n     compete for federal contracts. The designation gives small \n     businesses relocating to closed military installation areas \n     equal footing with businesses in other disadvantaged areas \n     that receive the designation because of their location in \n     under-utilized census tracts.\n       While the intent of Congress was to provide the HUBZone \n     designation to help closed military installations attract \n     small businesses, one aspect of the HUBZone program actually \n     works against these redevelopment areas. To maintain HUBZone \n     status, 35 percent of a business' employees must also live in \n     a HUBZone area. Because a military installation's HUBZone \n     area encompasses only the base itself, many closed military \n     installations do not have a substantial number of HUBZone-\n     certified residential areas from which to draw sufficient \n     future employees for the businesses desiring to locate on \n     those properties. Thus, it is often impossible for a business \n     to qualify for HUBZone status and compete fairly against \n     other small businesses.\n       Many defense community leaders are hopeful this issue can \n     be resolved without additional spending, creation of a new \n     government program or a change in government contracting \n     goals. Senator Susan Collins is also working to address this \n     issue during the final stages of the FY 2013 National Defense \n     Authorization Act. We look forward to sharing further \n     information with your office and hers to help explain why it \n     is important to defense communities that Congress restore its \n     intent to support BRAC-impacted communities attracting small \n     businesses to help build and strengthen their local \n     economies.\n       As always, ADC appreciate your service and support and \n     hopes you will contact us if we may be of further assistance.\n           Respectfully,\n\n                                            Robert M. Murdock,\n\n                                         President, Association of\n     Defense Communities.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 Midcoast Regional\n\n\n                                      Redevelopment Authority,\n\n                                 Brunswick, ME, December 11, 2012.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senator, Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: I represent the Midcoast Regional \n     Redevelopment Authority, which is charged with redeveloping \n     the former Naval Air Station Brunswick, Maine that closed in \n     2011 and is now known as Brunswick Landing.\n       We seek your assistance in modifying the current federal \n     program related to SBA HUBZones to make it a more effective \n     tool for businesses locating at Brunswick Landing. Over the \n     past several years, we have had several companies inquire \n     about the current HUBZone status of the former NAS Brunswick. \n     In fact, we are currently working with one company who is \n     willing to locate here and create upwards of 200 jobs, if we \n     are successful in getting the current HUBZone program for \n     closed military installations broadened.\n\n[[Page S445]]\n\n       With the implementation of the latest 2005 BRAC round, a \n     number of military installations have been closed across the \n     country resulting in severe economic distress for those \n     communities and States that have realized these closures. \n     Redeveloping these BRAC'd properties proved quite difficult \n     in good economic times, and now it is made even more \n     difficult with the national and State economic recession we \n     are experiencing.\n       While it would seem that the HUBZone designation for a \n     closed military installation would be an aid to its \n     redevelopment efforts, the 35% residency rule in the existing \n     law actually makes the program not a very effective \n     redevelopment tool for these properties at all. With the \n     exception of closed military installations, most of the \n     HUBZones in the Country are census tract based. Under current \n     law, only the closed military base itself (i.e., the \n     geographic area which used to be the former base) is \n     designated as a HUBZone, which is a much smaller area than \n     the census tract basis. Furthermore, many closed military \n     installations do not have a substantial amount of residential \n     areas from which to draw sufficient future employees (35%) \n     for the businesses desiring to locate on those properties.\n       In addition the above, the Small Business Act established a \n     five year time-frame for the duration of the HUBZone from the \n     actual date of base closure. This is of particular concern \n     given that the actual transfer of properties from the \n     military services to the base closure communities often \n     occurs many years following closure. Thus, these properties \n     are not available for business development until actually \n     transferred.\n       The net effect is that eligible HUB businesses seeking new \n     or expanded opportunities on closed installations cannot meet \n     these requirements and thus are not able to realize the \n     HUBZone benefits for BRAC'd installations as envisioned by \n     Congress. This issue exacerbates the difficulties for us and \n     other similar communities to overcome the devastating \n     economic effects of base closures.\n       In order to make the BRAC HUBZone designation an effective \n     economic development tool for Brunswick Landing, as well as \n     all the other closed installations across the country, the \n     attached amendment language to the existing law is \n     recommended. It should be noted that these recommendations do \n     not create a new program, require additional government \n     spending, or increase federal contracting goals.\n       Thank you for your service to our Country and the State of \n     Maine and your thoughtful consideration of this request.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Steven H. Levesque,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                            Heather D. Blease,\n\n                                  Freeport, ME, December 12, 2012.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senator, Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: I have established a new contact \n     center business that focuses on providing service to the \n     federal government. A key strategy for our success hinges \n     upon the establishment of my business as a HUBZone certified \n     entity.\n       As a native of Brunswick, Maine, I am keenly interested in \n     locating my business at the former Brunswick Naval Air \n     Station, now called Brunswick Landing. As a BRAC facility, \n     the SBA rules limit the boundary of the HUBZone \n     geographically to base property which has very few housing \n     units.\n       In order to achieve HUBZone certification, 35% of my \n     employees need to reside within the HUBZone.\n       As the law is written, I cannot locate at Brunswick Landing \n     and hope to achieve HUBZone status. The BRAC HUBZone law is \n     flawed as written. Our Congress attempted to create an \n     economic development vehicle to help communities recover from \n     base closures, but unless the law is tweaked, the HUBZone \n     designation is meaningless.\n       Please help modify the existing definition for BRAC \n     HUBZones by broadening the boundary of the HUBZone for closed \n     military installations to include the surrounding community. \n     In the case of my company, it provides me with HUBZone \n     employees to put to work so I can meet the HUBZone \n     certification requirements.\n       If the law is changed, I will locate my business at \n     Brunswick Landing and provide hundreds of jobs to the \n     economically depressed area.
