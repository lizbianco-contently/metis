Mr. President, I won't use a lot of time here this morning \nbecause we have a lot to do.\n  We worked for a long time yesterday, into the late hours of the \nnight, trying to secure an agreement to vote on a long-term government \nfunding bill. I was last talking to the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee at 11 o'clock last night.\n  Regrettably, a small group of Senate Republicans has determined it is \nin their political interests to hold this legislation hostage. They \nobjected to an agreement that would allow us to vote on Monday night. \nWe are now relegated to watching time tick away on our clocks just so \nwe can keep the government open and funded. I remind everyone that at \n12 o'clock midnight--12 a.m.--the U.S. Government, tonight, runs out of \nmoney.\n  We even tried to get an agreement last night to extend government \nfunding for a few extra days while we worked to pass the long-term \nfunding bill, but the Republicans wouldn't let us do that.\n  So now we wait. But while we wait, we shouldn't waste time. \nRepublicans and their leader have known for weeks, if not months, that \nwe intend to vote on the President's nominations. So it is clear that \nthis impasse we are having here today is not about nominees, it is \nabout preventing us from funding the government. So now, on the eve of \nour government running out of funding, Senate Republicans are forcing \ncompletely unnecessary procedural votes just to waste time and slow us \ndown from funding the government.\n  It doesn't have to be this way. We can still come to an agreement to \ntake care of funding for our great country right now.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the majority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I will yield for a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask the majority leader for some \nclarification.\n  Is my understanding correct that at midnight tonight officially the \nfunding of our government ceases?\n  Mr. REID. Absolutely true.\n  Mr. DURBIN. And the majority leader asked the Republican side of the \naisle to at least extend it several days while we completed our work on \nthe omnibus budget bill sent to us by the House?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, we had yesterday evening a piece of legislation from \nthe House doing just that--extending the time for a few days.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Was there an objection by the Republicans to the short-\nterm extension so our government would continue operating?\n  Mr. REID. We were told it wouldn't be necessary to do that because we \ncouldn't get agreement to do it. So the answer is yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Late last night, the junior Senator from Texas came to \nthe floor. Is he part of the group that is objecting to moving forward \non the omnibus bill?\n  Mr. REID. Well, it appears so. At 10 o'clock or so last night he gave \na relatively extended speech. If someone looks at that speech, he \nwasn't critical of me. Most of his criticism was for the Speaker and \nthe Republican leader here. He was challenging whether they were people \nof their word as to what they were going to do.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I might just ask the majority leader, this is the same \nSenator who shut down the government last year in protest over the \nAffordable Care Act?\n  Mr. REID. The very same man. Now he is hung up on not only the \nAffordable Care Act but the President's action to give 5 million people \nrelief in this country so they can come out of the shadows and make our \ncountry a more productive place.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the majority leader and hope we can find some \nsupport to moving forward to fund the government and accept our \nresponsibilities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/13/senate-section/article/S6796-5", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6796]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nGrassley be recognized for 5 minutes for debate only.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The senior Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I rise to correct the Record on the \nclaim that we typically confirm judges during a lameduck session. \nHowever, we do confirm judges during a lameduck if those judges were \nreported to the floor before the election. What we typically don't do \nis report judges out of committee during a lameduck and then also \nconfirm them that same year, and that is what the majority is \nattempting to do here, and, of course, I object.\n  We need to follow precedent on these nominees. I will use 12 years as \nan example to illustrate what really happened.\n  In 2002, 20 judges were confirmed during the lameduck, but 18 of \nthose judges had been reported out of committee before the midterm \nelection. Only two of those judges were reported during the lameduck, \nand that was because these two judges waited for more than a year for a \nhearing.\n  In 2004, four judges were confirmed during the lameduck session, but \nnone were reported out during that lameduck session.\n  In 2006, one judge was confirmed, but again, that judge was not \nreported out of committee during the lameduck session.\n  In 2008, there were no confirmations in the lameduck session.\n  In 2010, again, no judges were confirmed, but that year 15 judges \nwere reported out of committee during the lameduck and every one of \nthose 15 judges was returned to the White House.\n  Finally, in 2012, no judges were confirmed. That year, again, five \njudges\n\n[[Page S6807]]\n\nwere reported out of committee during the lameduck, but all five were \nreturned to the White House. That is the raw data.\n  The data confirms that since 2002, with only two exceptions for \nspecial circumstances, no judges have been reported out and confirmed \nduring the lameduck session. The reason is simple. It gives our newly \nelected Senators the opportunity to have their voices heard, and that \nis what this is all about. That is the reason the judicial nominees, \nwhich are lifetime appointments, are typically returned to the \nPresident if they come out of committee during a lameduck session. It \ngives the new Members an opportunity to have their voices heard.\n  I am raising this objection today, although I know we are going to \nproceed, to protect the prerogatives of newly elected Members. Frankly, \nI am disappointed that the Members are not willing to stand up and \nprotect those rights and prerogatives. I believe I have a pretty good \nreputation for working across the aisle on a lot of issues, and I \nexpect that somebody would realize that next year these people would \nget a fair hearing just as they did before they were reported out of \ncommittee.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/13/senate-section/article/S6807-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6807]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a \ncolloquy with my colleague, Senator Mikulski.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to discuss an important matter \nrelated to H.R. 83, the omnibus bill, with my colleague from Maryland, \nSenator Mikulski. As you know, section 111 of this bill for the Corps \nof Engineers discusses the agricultural exemptions under section \n404(f)(1)(A),(C) of the Clean Water Act.\n  There has been some confusion as to exactly what this provision does \nand doesn't do. I would like to clarify that this provision does not \nexpand or modify the current agricultural exemptions that are contained \nin the Clean Water Act nor does it impact the ``recapture'' provision \nin section 404(f)(2).\n  Mr. President, can the Senator from Maryland provide a further \nexplanation of the issue?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. First and foremost, I wish to thank the Senator from \nCalifornia for her efforts in negotiating the difficult issues within \nthe Energy and Water portion of the omnibus bill.\n  As the Senator knows, the original House language would have kept the \nCorps of Engineers from regulating the agricultural exemptions as well \nas essentially eliminating the recapture provision where permits are \nneeded if an exempted activity impacts waters of the U.S. by impairing \ncirculation of or reducing the reach of such waters.\n  I was pleased that the language that we were able to work out with \nChairman Rogers and include in the omnibus dropped the language in the \noriginal House provision. The compromise language does not change \ncurrent law and preserves the current scope of agricultural exemptions. \nThe simple fact remains that if you needed a permit before, you will \nneed to get a permit under this provision; if you didn't need one \nbefore, you won't under this provision.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank my colleague so much for this clarification. \nThis is a very important clarification.\n\n\n                        lead content regulation\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a \ncolloquy with my colleage, Senator Mikulski.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am joined by the chair of the \nAppropriations Committee to discuss a provision in the fiscal year 2015 \nOmnibus appropriations bill, which we will vote on shortly in the \nSenate.\n  The provision is section 425 of division F of the fiscal year 2015 \nOmnibus appropriations bill, which preserves the status quo with regard \nto the regulation of the lead content of certain items. As House Report \n113-551 and the Omnibus Joint Explanatory Statement each explain, \nsection 425 prohibits the use of funds to regulate the lead content of: \n(1) ammunition, (2) ammunition components, and (3) fishing tackle. The \nToxic Substances Control Act regulates the chemical content of \nproducts. However, the Environmental Protection Agency has denied \npetitions to regulate the lead content of ammunition and fishing tackle \nunder this statute. The omnibus provision simply reaffirms EPA's \ndecision not to regulate the lead content of ammunition or fishing \ntackle under TSCA.\n  While I oppose restricting EPA's ability to regulate the content of \nbullets and fishing tackle, I think it is important to be clear about \nwhat this provision does. I would ask my colleague, Senator Mikulski, \nif she agrees with this interpretation of section 425.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank Senator Boxer. As chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee and lead author of the fiscal year 2015 \nOmnibus appropriations bill, I agree with her understanding of section \n425.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today we face a difficult choice. The \nappropriations bill before us today contains a lot of good for Michigan \nand for our country, and it will provide most of our Federal agencies, \nand the people who rely on them, with the certainty needed to plan and \ninvest. But it also contains some very troubling provisions.\n  We shouldn't use appropriations bills like this one to weaken our \nfinancial protection laws and to open the floodgates to campaign \ndonations from millionaires. We shouldn't fund our financial regulators \nfar below what they need to do their jobs. We shouldn't meddle with the \nwill of the majority of residents in our Nation's Capital. And we \nshouldn't let tax cheats walk free by funding the IRS at the lowest \nlevel in years. I could go on and on about the flaws in this bill, and \nthere is one in particular that I will highlight further.\n  But despite these significant flaws, the alternatives to this bill \nare also deeply problematic. Passage of a continuing resolution, which \nwould put the Federal Government on autopilot, or worse, a government \nshutdown, are the two alternatives to passage of this bill. So that \nleaves us with the terrible decision we face today. So this bill \nappears poised to pass because it must and because it is better than \nthe terrible alternatives I just discussed. If my vote were needed to \npass this bill, I would, grudgingly, vote in favor. But it appears that \nthis bill will pass regardless, and so I will not vote in favor of it \ntoday because I wish to express my deep concern about a number of \nprovisions.\n  That provision, which guts the swaps pushout rule, will repeal an \nantibailout section of the Dodd-Frank act and risk putting taxpayers \nback on the hook for Wall Street banks' risky bets. As chairman of the \nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations, just last month I held a \nhearing on bank involvement in the commodities markets. As chairman of \nthe Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, just last month I held a \nhearing on bank involvement in the commodities markets. We found that \nWall Street had huge, wide-ranging ownership and control of and inside \ninformation about oil, copper, aluminum, uranium, and electricity \nmarkets at the same time they were engaging in financial transactions \nrelated to those same commodities posing big risks to the banks and, as \na result, to the taxpayers who could be called on to bail them out in \nthe event that those bets go awry.\n  Less than 14 years ago, the seeds of our financial crisis were \nplanted in a derivatives provision planted in the 2001 appropriations \nbill. This provision, which like the provision in the bill before us, \nwas added at the last minute and not subject to debate on its own, \nexempted derivatives from regulatory scrutiny, and left regulators, \nbanks, and the American public on the hook when risky bets went bad.\n  As a result, Congress voted to enact a prohibition against Federal \nGovernment bailouts of swaps entities, or the swaps pushout rule, as \npart of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. \nThis provision bans big banks from conducting risky derivatives trading \nin their insured banking units--the units that taxpayers would have to \nbail out if their bets went wrong.\n  Now we risk repeating the same mistake of 2001.\n  The language of the provision was written--literally written--by \nlobbyists for the big banks. According to a New York Times report, 70 \nof the 85 lines of the provision came directly from Wall Street's \nrecommendations. Even more surprisingly, according to the Times, ``two \ncrucial paragraphs, prepared by Citigroup in conjunction with other \nWall Street banks, were copied nearly word for word.''\n  The Senate has long operated under rules that prevent legislative \nchanges from being made on an appropriations\n\n[[Page S6811]]\n\nbill. This provision runs completely against that longstanding \nprecedent. The swaps pushout provision is bad policy, and it is bad \nprocedure. And if I could vote against that provision by itself, I \ncertainly would.\n  But, unfortunately, because of where we are today and because of the \ndecision to insert the unrelated, lobbyist-drafted provision into this \nbill at the last minute, we won't be able to considering that provision \non its merits. Instead, we are considering this as part of an all-or-\nnothing package, with the threat of a continuing resolution or a \ngovernment shutdown looming.\n  So, I will vote against this bill despite much good that it would do \nfor my State and for our country in hopes that the next Senate will \nheed the warnings of myself and many of my colleagues that the \nprovision in this bill weakening our country's banking regulations may \nsow the seeds of another taxpayer funded bank bailout and another \nfinancial crisis.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I wish to speak on the fiscal year 2015 \nConsolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act that is \ncurrently before the Senate.\n  For the last year, members of the Appropriations Committee have \nworked hard to develop bipartisan bills that establish priorities and \nresponsibly fund the government. While I would have much preferred each \nof these bills to have been brought to the floor individually so they \ncould be debated and amended, passage of this compromise legislation to \nkeep government open and provide vital services to Americans who depend \non them is essential.\n  While the legislation funds nearly all government operations, \nprograms, and agencies through the remainder of the fiscal year, \nnotably, this bill funds the Department of Homeland Security only \nthrough February 27, 2015, giving Congress time to thoughtfully respond \nto the President's unilateral action on immigration. While I supported \nthe bipartisan legislation to reform our immigration laws that passed \nthe Senate last year, I believe President Obama's recent Executive \naction on immigration circumvents Congress and undermines the \nseparation of powers in our Constitution. This bill gives Congress time \nto formulate an appropriate response.\n  In addition to the regular funding contained in this bill, the \nlegislation also provides more than $5 billion in emergency funding to \naddress the Ebola crisis at home and abroad. The scope and urgency of \nthis crisis require continued attention, and this funding will build on \nthe important initial investment for the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention and the Department of Health and Human Services that \nCongress provided in September.\n  I want to highlight the important work that Chairman Murray and I \nhave accomplished as the leaders on the Transportation and Housing and \nUrban Development Subcommittee on Appropriations. Over this past year, \nSenator Murray and I worked together to craft a bipartisan bill that \nincludes input from Members on both sides of the aisle and provides the \nnecessary resources to meet our nation's transportation and housing \nneeds. Every Member of Congress has unmet transportation and housing \nneeds in his or her home State, from crumbling roads and bridges to a \ngrowing population of low income families, elderly, and disabled \nindividuals in need of housing assistance.\n  There are a number of key programs that I would like to highlight. \nWith regard to transportation infrastructure, we secured funding to \naddress the safe transportation of crude oil and other hazardous \nmaterials by rail, strengthening three components: prevention, \nmitigation, and response. These safety measures will help to prevent \ndisasters like the horrific derailment in Lac-Megantic, Quebec, last \nyear--so very close to the Maine border.\n  We also provide $500 million for the TIGER program, an effective \ninitiative that helps advance transportation infrastructure projects. \nWe all have seen firsthand how TIGER projects create jobs and support \neconomic growth in our home States. In fact in Maine this highly \ncompetitive program has supported more than $90 million in funding for \nroads, bridges, ports, and rail projects.\n  Turning to air travel, the aviation investments included in the bill \nwill continue to modernize our Nation's air traffic system and keep \nrural communities connected to the transportation network. These \ninvestments are creating safer skies and a more efficient airspace to \nmove the flying public.\n  Also included in the bill are provisions I authored, which were \nadopted by the Appropriations Committee by a bipartisan vote of 21 to \n9, to respond to potential safety concerns related to DOT regulations \ngoverning truck drivers. As a result of unintended consequences of \nthese regulations, more trucks have been forced on our Nation's roads \nduring the most congested morning hours--when commuters are traveling \nto work and children are traveling to school. The bill provides \ntemporary relief until the DOT Secretary conducts a comprehensive study \non the impacts of these unanticipated outcomes.\n  In addition to these transportation programs, our bill provides \nsufficient funding to keep pace with the rising cost of housing \nprograms for our most vulnerable families. More than four million \nfamilies will continue to receive critical rental assistance for \nhousing. Without it, many of these families would otherwise become \nhomeless.\n  The bill reflects our strong commitment to reduce homelessness and \nincludes more than $2 billion for Homeless Assistance Grants. Since \n2010, we have reduced overall chronic homelessness by 21 percent and \nveterans' homelessness by 33 percent. This program works. That is why \nwe build on these successes and provide an additional 10,000 HUD-VASH \nvouchers to serve our Nation's veterans.\n  While we continue to help families in need, we also recognize the \nstruggles facing our local communities. Boosting local economies is \ncritical to job creation and helping families obtain financial \nsecurity. Our bill supports these local development efforts by \nproviding $3 billion for the Community Development Block Grants \nprogram. This is an extremely important program for States and \ncommunities because it allows them to tailor the Federal funds to \nsupport local economic and job creation projects.\n  Other provisions of the bill make equally important investments in \nour national security, energy infrastructure, veterans, and health and \nhuman services.\n  For our military and our national security, I particularly appreciate \nthat the bill fully funds the Arleigh Burke-class DDG-51 and Zumwalt-\nclass DDG-1000 destroyers. The destroyers are known as the real \nworkhorses of the fleet and are critical to maintaining the robust \nforward naval presence our nation requires especially in a time of \nincreasing threats to our security. The continued support of the \ndestroyer programs is also a strong testament to the hard work and \ndedication of the men and women at Bath Iron Works in Maine. Bath-built \ntruly is best built.\n  The bill also includes funding for the procurement of 38 F-35s and \nfor four additional aircraft. The F-35 is vital to maintaining air \nsuperiority, and components of the aircraft are built by skilled \nworkers at Pratt & Whitney in North Berwick, General Dynamics Ordnance \nand Tactical Systems in Saco, Hunting Dearborn, Inc. in Fryeburg, and \nFairchild Semiconductor in South Portland. Neither the bill, nor the \nreport, recommends an unnecessary study of an extra engine for the F-35 \nfighter, which would have wasted billions of dollars.\n  Turning to our Nation's public shipyards, I am pleased that this bill \nfunds our Navy's facility maintenance and modernization efforts, \nincluding projects at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, ME. The \nagreement contains language I secured that ensures the capital \ninvestment for the Navy's four public shipyards, including the \nPortsmouth Naval Shipyard, is funded at the level required by law.\n  For the men and women serving in uniform all over the world, the bill \nalso rightly rejects many of the President's proposals that would have \nimposed burdens on many servicemembers and their families.\n  For our Veterans, I am pleased that this bill provides funding for \nthe highly successful Access Received Closer to Home program, or ARCH, \nwhich provides critical care to our veterans living in rural areas, \nincluding those living in Northern Maine. The ARCH pilot\n\n[[Page S6812]]\n\nprogram provides VA-covered health care services through non-VA \nproviders and has been crucial to increasing access to care for rural \nMaine veterans.\n  The funding bill also provides additional resources to implement the \nreforms included in the recently enacted Veterans Access to Care \nthrough Choice, Accountability, and Transparency Act.\n  We must increase our investment in biomedical research, and this bill \nprovides $72 million in new funding for Alzheimer's Disease research, \ntreatment, and caregiver programs. This important step takes us closer \ntoward the goal of doubling funding for Alzheimer's research and \neventually reaching the level of $2 billion a year in federal \ninvestment. This is the amount that the chairman of the Alzheimer's \nAdvisory Council has said will be necessary if we are to reach our goal \nof having a way to prevent or effectively treat Alzheimer's Disease by \n2025. At a time when Alzheimer's is costing our Nation $214 billion a \nyear, including $150 billion in costs to Medicare and Medicaid, we are \nspending less than $600 million a year on Alzheimer's research. While \nthis bill does take a step forward, clearly we need to do more given \nthe tremendous human and economic toll this devastating disease takes \non our Nation.\n  In addition, this funding bill makes important investments in \nagricultural research and extension activities, from potatoes to wild \nblueberries to aquaculture and forest products, while maintaining a \ncommitment to nutrition and food security. The agreement finally allows \nall fresh vegetables, including the fresh, white potato, to be included \nin the WIC program while USDA carries out an evaluation of the nutrient \nvalue of all vegetables, helping to ensure that any long-term policy is \ntransparent and reflects the latest science.\n  This bill also makes important commitments to our energy \ninfrastructure and provides robust funding for the Department of Energy \nwind program. This program funds the offshore wind demonstration \nprojects, including the R project being carried out by the University \nof Maine. Federal seed money is helping overcome barriers to the \ndevelopment and implementation of new and innovative technologies, such \nas deepwater offshore wind, which can position the U.S. as a global \nleader in innovative clean energy.\n  To help address the high cost of residential energy, particularly for \nthose living in northern, rural States like Maine, funding is provided \nin this bill for the Weatherization program. This program plays an \nimportant role in permanently reducing home energy costs for low-income \nfamilies and seniors. Moreover, the funding included for LIHEAP will \nhelp ensure that many of our most vulnerable families and seniors do \nnot have to choose between paying for heat and paying for other \nnecessities such as food or medicine.\n  Helping to meet the water infrastructure needs of smaller states and \nregions is another vital piece of our National infrastructure. This \nbill includes funding for the operation and maintenance of Army Corps \nprojects at smaller harbors, which are the economic lifeblood for many \nrural communities, a fact not fully accounted for under the Corps' \nbudget metrics, which tend to favor larger ports.\n  The bill also continues to support our nation's fisheries, which are \nso important to the economies of our coastal communities, particularly \nin Maine. From funding for annual stock assessments, surveys and \nmonitoring, and cooperative research, the bill supports key State and \nFederal partnerships. It provides funding to ensure fisheries data \ncollection accurately reflects stock sustainability and funding for \nNOAA to invest in the science and research necessary to sustainably \nmanage our fisheries in a way that continues to support our fishing \nfleets.\n  Finally, I am pleased to see that the bill includes full funding for \nthe Trade Adjustment Assistance programs that are so important in \nMaine, and for which Senator King and I both advocated. As we continue \nto deal with the recent job losses at paper mills in Maine, this \nassistance to displaced workers is extremely important.\n  Completing action on this bill will keep government open and provide \nessential services to Americans who depend on them. While there are \naspects of this compromise legislation that should have been subject to \ndebate and amendment in an open process by the full Senate, including \nprovisions that affect significantly multi-employer pensions and our \ncampaign finance laws, we simply cannot allow a government shutdown. \nFor that reason, I will be voting for this compromise legislation, and \nI urge my colleagues do so as well.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my opposition to \nthe spending bill we are being forced to vote on. I am not voting to \nshut down the government. I am voting to negotiate on a bill where we \nare at least able to participate. I am voting to stay here, work with \nall my colleagues on a better bill, and put an end to the dysfunctional \nprocess we are forced to endure every year. I have read through the \nbill, and I am sure everyone can find something in here that they like.\n  I certainly have some items in the bill that will help my little \nState of West Virginia. But there is just too much waste, too much \ntaxpayer risk, and too little transparency for me to stomach.\n  In the 4 years I have been in the Senate and on the Armed Services \nCommittee, I have heard from officials on the damage done by the \nsequester and how it has cannibalized the Armed Forces. And yet, while \nDOD officials were forced to absorb across-the-board cuts in 2013, I \nhave made it a point to ask if they are being forced into projects they \ndon't want or need. This bill, however, completely ignores what the \nDepartment of Defense has said.\n  We are wasting $5 billion on Department of Defense spending that the \nPentagon did not ask for and does not need. They didn't ask for some of \nthese ships, tanks and airplanes, but we are forcing them to purchase \nthose projects anyway. And not only are we wasting this money, but we \nare denying it from other important programs that desperately need \nthose funds.\n  In this bill, we gut hard-working Americans' pensions, and instead of \nusing the $5 billion to fund the Care Act, which ensures that the \nUMWA's Pension Plan remains solvent to benefit miners who have helped \npower this Nation, we give the Pentagon tanks and ships and planes they \ndon't need or even want. We have seen our political process become more \ncorrosive than ever in recent years.\n  We have already seen the negative effects that the Citizens United \nruling has had on our elections. It has allowed unlimited and dark \nmoney to distort the records of our colleagues, flood our airwaves with \nnegative advertisements and shrink our campaigns to sound bites instead \nof ideas.\n  And what does this bill do to address this? It increases the limits \nfor individual contributions to political parties by 10 times the \ncurrent limit--10 times. The current limit of $32,400 was already too \nhigh for most West Virginians and Americans to be able to take full \nadvantage. The new limit of $324,000 is inconceivable for the vast \nmajority of Americans. That means that our political process will only \nbe available to a small number of wealthy individuals who will have \nmore influence on our government than the hard-working Americans we are \nsent here to represent.\n  Main Street America is still hurting from the fallout of Wall \nStreet's greedy behavior. Americans lost 8.8 million jobs and our GDP \nfell by at least $7.2 trillion. We lost a generation of jobs and \neconomic progress. And while our economy is still trying to recover and \nmillions of Americans are still out of work, Wall Street has seen \nrecord profits.\n  Instead of working to help our small businesses, community banks, and \ncredit agencies, this bill allows Wall Street banks to go back to the \nsame risky behavior that drove us into the great recession in the first \nplace. If we pass this bill, we will allow Wall Street banks to trade \nrisky derivatives and once again force American taxpayers to bail them \nout if they lose their bets.\n  Haven't we learned our lesson yet? If big banks want to trade in \nrisky derivatives and act with greed, then they should bear the cost of \ntheir mistakes, not the American taxpayer.\n  Mr. President, I understand omnibus bills are made out of negotiation \nand compromise, but negotiations start\n\n[[Page S6813]]\n\nwith participation. Here, most Members of the Senate were not even \nconsulted on this bill, nor was there an opportunity to offer \namendments.\n  Senator Robert C. Byrd, a man who defined what it meant to be a \nrepresentative of the people and one of the most dedicated and \npassionate United States Senators to date, told me what it was like to \nwork in the Senate before the process was broken. Upon arriving in the \nSenate, I assumed those same rules of conduct applied until Members \nhere in this body explained to me just how much has changed.\n  We used to consider individual appropriations bills that were \ncarefully deliberated by committee members, and then we brought those \nsmaller bills to the floor and were given an opportunity to offer \namendments and debate the bill in a timely, proper manner. Somehow, the \nSenate process has gotten away from the days of regular order. Instead, \nhere we are today, where we were given two days to read a 1,600-page \nbill loaded with provisions that we cannot even amend.\n  Since we are forced to consider this bill as a whole, I have \ndetermined that it is simply too flawed for me to support.\n  I urge my colleagues to stay here another week and truly draft a \nbipartisan omnibus package that fairly represents American values.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, 1 month ago President Obama announced \nunprecedented Executive amnesty, in direct conflict with the \nimmigration laws passed by Congress. Tonight is the first opportunity \nthat Congress has to express its disapproval.\n  A dozen Democrats have publicly criticized the Executive amnesty. \nTonight, both Democrats and Republicans will have the opportunity to \nshow America whether they stand with the President, who is defying the \nwill of the voters, or with the millions of Americans who want a safe \nand legal immigration system.\n  This point of order is targeted not to the entire omnibus but \nspecifically to the DHS funding that the President has announced will \nbe spent unconstitutionally.\n  If you believe President Obama's amnesty is unconstitutional, vote \nyes. If you believe President Obama's amnesty is consistent with the \nConstitution, then vote no. Accordingly, I raise a constitutional point \nof order against Division L of the pending House amendment, on the \ngrounds that it violates the following provisions of the Constitution: \nthe separation of powers embodied in the vesting clauses of article I, \nsection 1, and article II, section 1; the enumerated powers of \nCongress, stated in article I, section 8; and the requirement that the \nPresident take care that the laws be faithfully executed as stated in \narticle II, section 3.\n  It is incumbent on this body to resolve those constitutional \nquestions and to honor and protect the constitutional authority of the \nUnited States Congress.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the junior Senator from Texas raises a point \nof order attacking the pending legislation on the grounds that the \nPresident has acted unconstitutionally. The junior Senator from Texas \nis wrong, wrong, wrong on several counts. But most importantly for us \nthis evening, it is an attack on this bill because this is not an \nappropriate place to debate the constitutionality of any executive \nbranch action. Under the precedents of the Senate, the Senate \ndetermines whether it is constitutional to consider the legislation \nbefore it.\n  The House of Representatives passed this legislation before us in an \nexercise of its powers under article I of the United States \nConstitution. This bill has, thus, originated in the House within the \nmeaning of the origination clause of the Constitution.\n  Voting on this measure is no different from thousands of other \nmeasures on which the Senate has voted. The Constitution objection is \ncompletely--completely--without merit and should be rejected.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield back all time.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. All time has expired.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, regular order.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. All time has expired. Regular order has \nbeen requested.\n  Under the precedents and practices of the Senate, the Chair has no \npower or authority to pass on such a point of order.

Mr. President, the intent of division N, section 101 is to \nestablish separate limits for funds raised into separate, segregated \naccounts established by national political party committees for certain \nspecified purposes. All of these funds are ``hard money'' subject to \nall of the source limitations, prohibitions, and disclosure provisions \nof the act.\n  The first account, described in section 315(a)(9)(A) of the Federal \nElection Campaign Act of 1971, ``FECA'', as amended, is intended to \nallow a national committee of a political party--other than a national \ncongressional campaign committee--to defray expenses related to a \nPresidential nominating convention using funds raised under separate, \nincreased limits. Section 315(a)(9)(A) also caps the aggregate amount \nof expenditures a national political party committee may make from such \naccount with respect to any convention at $20,000,000. This section is \nintended to provide national political party committees with a means of \nacquiring additional resources to be used specifically in connection \nwith the funding of Presidential nominating conventions because such \nconventions may no longer be paid for with public funds. It is the \nintent to allow these funds to be used in the same manner as the former \npublic funds could have been used, as well as to pay for the costs of \nfundraising for this segregated account.\n  The second account, described in section 315(a)(9)(B) of FECA, as \namended, is intended to permit a national committee of a political \nparty--including a national congressional campaign committee of a \npolitical party--to defray expenses incurred with respect to the \nconstruction, purchase, renovation, operation and furnishing of party \nheadquarters buildings located throughout the United States, including \nthe cost of fundraising for this segregated account, using funds raised \nunder separate, increased limits. Funds in these accounts also may be \nused to repay loans and other obligations incurred for the purpose of \ndefraying such building expenses, including loans and obligations \nincurred 2 years before the date of the enactment of this act.\n  The third account, described in section 315(a)(9)(C) of FECA, as \namended, is intended to permit a national committee of a political \nparty--including a national congressional campaign committee of a \npolitical party--to defray expenses incurred with respect to the \npreparation for and the conduct of election recounts and contests and \nother legal proceedings, including the costs of fundraising for this \nsegregated account, using funds raised under a separate limit. Section \n101 of division N is not intended to modify Federal Election Commission \nprecedent permitting the raising and spending of funds by campaign or \nState or national party committees. See FEC Advisory Opinions 2006-24, \n2009-4. Section 101 is also intended to permit the national parties to \nuse such funds for costs, fees, and disbursements associated with other \nlegal proceedings.\n  Finally, under current law coordinated limits do not apply even \nabsent these provisions to the existing accounts as described in \nsection 315 of FECA and therefore it is the intent of the amendments \ncontained herein that expenditures made from the accounts described in \nsection 315(a)(9) of FECA, many of which, such as recount and legal \nproceeding expenses, are not for the purpose of influencing Federal \nelections, do not count against the coordinated party expenditure \nlimits described in section 315(d) of FECA.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/13/senate-section/article/S6814-5", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6814-S6815]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  FIRST STATE HISTORICAL NATIONAL PARK\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a \ncolloquy with the chair of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, \nSenator Landrieu, concerning the authorization of the First State \nNational Historical Park that was included within H.R. 3979, the \nNational Defense Authorization Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. As the chairman is aware, our staffs worked diligently \nwith property owners and other stakeholders in the drafting of the \nlanguage authorizing the First State National Historical Park within \nH.R. 3979. The authorization includes language that redesignates the \nsites currently within the boundary of the First State National \nMonument and authorizes four additional sites--the Old Swedes Church, \nFort Christina, the John Dickinson Plantation, and the Ryves Holt \nHouse--to be included within the boundary of the new First State \nNational Historical Park. The language authorizes the National Park \nService to acquire the listed additional sites only under very specific \nparameters, including by purchase from a willing seller; by exchange, \nwhich can only be achieved if the property owner consents; or by \ndonation. No lands or interests in land can be acquired by \ncondemnation, so no landowner can be forced to sell their property for \ninclusion in the park. To further clarify our intent, the legislation \nreferences a map outlining the boundaries for each of the eligible \nsites.\n  I would like to ask the Chair of the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources whether she agrees with my intent and understanding of the \nlanguage authorizing the First State National Historical Park within \nH.R. 3979 in that no additional property can be included in the \nboundaries of the park until the U.S. government has acquired the \nproperty, and furthermore, that no property can be acquired--either in \nfee title or an interest in land, such as an easement--unless acquired \nfrom a landowner who willingly desires to sell or\n\n[[Page S6815]]\n\ndonate. I would also like to ask the chairman if it is her \nunderstanding that none of these properties could be acquired for \ninclusion within the boundaries of the park by the exercise of Federal \npower of eminent domain?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I want to thank the Senator from Delaware for raising \nthese important issues. I agree with his understanding and description \nof the land acquisition provisions for the First State National \nHistorical Park within H.R. 3979, that the language does not permit \ncondemnation, so that the only way a specific property can be acquired \nby the Federal Government is through a voluntary sale by the landowner.\n  Mr. CARPER. I thank the Senator from Louisiana for her comments and \nher leadership on this issue. I also would like to thank the committee \nstaff, especially David Brooks, for all the hard work they have done \nover the years to make a national park a reality in Delaware.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/13/senate-section/article/S6815-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6815-S6816]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BUDGETARY REVISIONS\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, which \nCongress passed a year ago this month, not only provided relief to \nfamilies, servicemembers, and the economy from the harmful effects of \nsequestration, but also put an end to the recent fiscal crises and \nuncertainty by establishing a bipartisan budget for two years.\n  Pursuant to section 116 of the Bipartisan Budget Act, I previously \nfiled budgetary aggregates and committee allocations for budget year \n2015. Today, I am adjusting those levels to account for H.R. 83, the \nConsolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015.\n  Section 251 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act \nof 1985 establishes statutory limits on discretionary spending and \nallows for various adjustments to those limits, while sections 302 and \n314(a) of the Congressional Budget Act allows the Chairman of the \nBudget Committee to establish and make revisions to allocations, \naggregates, and levels consistent with those adjustments.

Mr. President, the omnibus appropriations bill that the \nSenate approved today includes the Labor, Health and Human Services, \nand Education, and Related Agencies bill. Or, as we like to refer to \nit, the Labor-HHS bill. Most people didn't think that would happen. \nThey thought Labor-HHS was too controversial. There was no way the \nSenate and House could work out a compromise on this bill. But we did, \nand as the Senate clerk of the Labor-HHS bill, Adrienne Hallett is the \nstaffer who deserves the greatest credit. More than any other staffer, \nthe burden of completing this bill fell on her. Despite what so many \npeople expected, she made it happen.\n  Adrienne has been an outstanding staff director of my Labor-HHS \nsubcommittee. She has served the Appropriations Committee and the \nSenate extraordinarily well during her 15 years of Senate service. I \nbelieve she will continue to serve it well after my term expires. I \nthink a bit of background will help you understand why I have this \nview.\n  First of all, Adrienne has strong Iowa roots. She hails from Cedar \nRapids, where her mom still lives and enjoys the company of dozens of \nrelatives throughout the State. Her father left us too soon after a \nbattle with ALS ended over a decade ago. However, before his untimely \ndeath he had already helped Adrienne develop a strongly held view on \nservice and a can-do spirit that propels her forward in pursuit of \nsolutions to challenges that seemingly can't be overcome. He also had \nalready supported Adrienne in her pursuit of higher education.\n  That higher education started with a degree in philosophy from the \nUniversity of Northern Iowa, UNI. Now, you might say that such a degree \nis perfect for the ponderous Senate. What I have noticed is that the \nethical decisionmaking skills she honed there have enabled her to more \neffectively find agreements that help the Senate and Congress advance \ngood public policy. I will discuss some of that policy in a moment.\n  After earning her degree from UNI she went on to divinity school at \nVanderbilt University, where she earned a master's degree and then went \non to work for the Vice Chancellor for Health at Vanderbilt University \nMedical Center. Fortunately for me, Adrienne did not stay long before \nshe joined my staff in Washington, DC in 1999.\n  Adrienne quickly demonstrated what an asset she was to me through her \nhard work and dedication to serving my Iowa constituents. I realized \nshe could help me serve them and all Americans even better by joining \nmy labor-HHS subcommittee staff which she agreed to do in 2001.\n  Now, I frequently am thanked and recognized for the things I have \ndone as one of Iowa's Senators and in my role leading the labor-HHS \nsubcommittee. What most people don't always know is the role that \nAdrienne Hallett has played in helping make those accomplishments a \nreality.\n  I think of community health centers from Clinton to Council Bluffs. \nThat is thousands of families in Iowa receiving critical medical care \nthey need to stay healthy or recover from injury or illness.\n  There is the Job Corps Center in Ottumwa that will give hundreds of \nyouth another chance at education and training that will enable them to \nbe self-sufficient and positively contribute to society.\n  There is the National Civilian Community Corps campus in Vinton. \nHundreds of young men and women are being trained for service projects \nin local communities throughout the North Central region of the United \nStates.\n  I could go on and on in naming centers and programs around Iowa where \nsomeone has thanked me for something that Adrienne helped make \npossible. But it is not just Iowa that has benefitted from her service.\n  It is also the expansion of community health centers throughout the \nUnited States. There are millions of families being served by those \ncenters.\n  Something so close to my heart is the significant role she has played \nin advancing public health systems in the United States and throughout \nthe world. These all are things where I am recognized for something \nAdrienne helped make possible.\n  Adrienne, I join with the entire Senate family in thanking you for \nyour outstanding service and offering best wishes to you for the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/13/senate-section/article/S6816-3", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6816-S6817]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING RUFUS JONES\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN.

He was a dear friend, a devoted \nhusband and father of six, and a WW II veteran who was a member of the \n``greatest generation.'' In fact, he signed up for the Navy straight \nout of high school. He went back to school at Purdue after the war and \ngot a degree in mechanical engineering and went on to a career in \nbusiness. He also served his community in many ways, including being a \nmember of the vestry at his church and a member of the Worthington, OH \nSchool Board.\n  I remember him as an uncle who always had a smile on his face and \nnever had an unpleasant word for anyone, as a friend later in life, and \nas a stalwart supporter of mine.\n  Today, I was home in Ohio to attend the visitation and funeral of my \nuncle. I regret that I was absent from procedural votes, but had I not \ngiven him a proper farewell, I would have regretted that more. He will \nbe missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/13/senate-section/article/S6817-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6817]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                         enrolled bills signed\n\n  The President pro tempore (Mr. Leahy) announced that on today, \nDecember 13, 2014, he had signed the following enrolled bills, \npreviously signed by the Speaker pro tempore of the House (Mr. Wolf):\n\n       S. 1353.
