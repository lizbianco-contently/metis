The \ndebate will be until 10:15 a.m. Senators Grassley, Cornyn, and Shaheen \nwill control 10 minutes each of that time and Senator McCaskill will \ncontrol any remaining time.\n  We have moved the time up, and I appreciate very much the cooperation \nof the Republicans because this is so one of our Senators can attend \nthe funeral of one of his best friends. But we are not going to extend \nthe time past 10:15 a.m. In light of that I am not going to give any \nstatement today.

Mr. President, there will be an all-Senators briefing at \n5:30 p.m. this afternoon, and it is all related to the emergency \nsupplemental request to\n\n[[Page S4514]]\n\naddress the child and adult migration from Central America to the \nSouthwest border.\n\n\n                   Recognition Of The Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                      Protecting Everyone's Rights\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, Members of Congress do not always see \neye-to-eye on everything. It is fairly obvious. There are often strong \nand principled disagreements about taxes, the size and scope of \ngovernment, ObamaCare, foreign policy--you name it. But let's be clear: \nWhen it comes to decisions about contraception, both parties believe a \nwoman should be able to make her own decisions.\n  Now, some on the other side would like to pretend otherwise. They \nthink they can score political points and create divisions where there \nare not any by distorting the facts. And that is why their increasingly \noutlandish claims--claims one nonpartisan fact-checker described as \n``simply wrong''--just keep getting debunked. Even worse, our friends \non the other side are now on record as saying we should protect the \nfreedoms of some while stripping away the freedoms of others.\n  Republicans continue to insist that we can and should be in the \nbusiness of protecting everyone's rights. We think that, instead of \nrestricting Americans' religious freedoms, Congress should instead work \nto preserve a woman's ability to make contraception decisions for \nherself. And the legislation Senator Ayotte, Fischer, and I filed \nyesterday would do just that.\n  The Preserving Religious Freedom and a Woman's Access to \nContraception Act would clarify that an employer cannot block an \nemployee from legal access to her FDA-approved contraceptives. It is a \ncommonsense proposal. It reaffirms that we can both preserve America's \nlong tradition of tolerance and respect for people of faith while at \nthe same time preserving a woman's ability to make her own decisions \nabout contraception.\n  Our bill would also ask the FDA to study whether contraceptives could \nbe made available to adults safely without a prescription. And it would \nallow women to set aside more money in their flexible spending accounts \nso they can cover out-of-pocket medical expenses, many of which are \nskyrocketing under ObamaCare.\n  So if Democrats are serious about doing right by women--if they are \nnot just interested in stoking divisions in an election year--then they \nshould get on board with our legislation. That is a start. And then \nthey can work with us to undo the damage their policies--like \nObamaCare--have already caused to millions--millions--of middle-class \nwomen.\n  Research shows that American women make about 80 percent of the \nhealth care decisions for their families. Yet, thanks to ObamaCare, \nmillions of women lost the health insurance plans they had and they \nliked--causing enormous disruptions in their lives and in the lives of \ntheir families.\n  When women first spoke out about the betrayal they felt when they \nlost their plans, Washington Democrats said their plans were ``junk'' \nor worse, that they were lying, because Democratic politicians thought \nthey knew better than all of these people we were hearing from. It was \ninsulting to many, including one constituent who wrote to me from \nWoodford County. She described herself as a ``lifelong self-employed \nprofessional'' who ``shopped hard'' for a policy that she liked and \nwanted to keep. Here is what she said after Washington Democratic \npolicies overruled her own personal choice of a plan:\n\n       The President has referred to my type of policy as \n     ``substandard.'' In fact, it is a good product for people in \n     my situation. It appears that the President does not \n     understand personal finance, and does not trust Americans \n     to choose products that are good for them. He also does \n     not appreciate people like me who are willing to accept \n     personal responsibility for a large part of my own routine \n     medical expenses.\n\n  She is not the only one who feels this way, and she is not the only \none who has been hurt by ObamaCare.\n  As a result of ObamaCare, too many women now have fewer choices of \ndoctors and hospitals.\n  As a result of ObamaCare, millions of Americans--nearly two-thirds of \nthem women--are now at risk of having their hours and their wages \nreduced.\n  As a result of ObamaCare, married women can face penalty taxes just \nfor working.\n  As a result of ObamaCare and other changes by the Obama \nadministration, a woman on Medicare Advantage could see her average \nbenefits reduced by more than $1,500 a year.\n  And thanks to ObamaCare, millions of women have had their flexible \nspending accounts limited and can no longer use tax-preferred medical \nsavings to purchase all the medications they use--a wrongheaded policy \nthat the bill we introduced yesterday seeks to address.\n  But that is just a start. Washington Democrats need to work with us \nto pass real health reform--actual, patient-centered reform that will \nnot hurt women the way ObamaCare does. Because we have seen the letters \nfrom our constituents--letters such as the one I received from a woman \nin Mount Sterling who says ObamaCare did more than just cause her \npremiums to nearly double--it might make her medications unaffordable \nas well: ``I am on three medications, [and] two years ago the copay was \n$60 for each one,'' she said. ``Now, my medications are costing me a \nlittle over $700 a month.''\n  That is not fair. It is not right. And this is just the kind of \nchallenge both parties should be working together to address.\n  So let's do away with the false choices. Let's focus on actually \nhelping women instead. Let's work together to boost jobs, wages, and \nopportunity at a time when women are experiencing so much hardship as a \nresult of this administration's policies.\n  Republicans have been asking Washington Democrats to do all of this \nfor years now. It is about time they started showing they really care.\n\n\n                       Reservation Of Leader Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

WHITE TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR \n                    THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF MISSOURI\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to executive session to consider the following \nnomination, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Ronnie L. \nWhite, of Missouri, to be United States District Judge for the Eastern \nDistrict of Missouri.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 10:15 a.m. will be controlled as follows: 10 minutes for the \nSenator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley; 10 minutes for the Senator from Texas, \nMr. Cornyn; 10 minutes for the Senator from New Hampshire, Mrs. \nShaheen; and any remaining time under the control of the Senator from \nMissouri, Mrs. McCaskill.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, the Senate will vote today to try to end \nthe unjustified filibuster against Judge Ronnie White, who has been \nnominated to serve on the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District \nof Missouri. Many Senators will remember Judge White from 15 years ago, \nwhen the Senate denied his confirmation by a partyline vote after an \nugly campaign by Republican Senators to caricature him as a jurist who \nwas soft on crime. Today, the Senate has an opportunity to reject that \nunjust characterization and confirm a well-qualified and principled man \nwho has demonstrated his ability to be a fair judge and who is faithful \nto the law.\n  Throughout his exceptional career, Judge White has been a trail \nblazer in the legal community. In 1995, he became the first African \nAmerican to serve on the Missouri Supreme Court and later became the \nfirst African American to serve as its Chief Justice. He previously \nserved for 2 years as a judge on the Missouri Court of Appeals. Outside \nof his distinguished judicial service, Judge White has broad experience \nin the law, working in private practice as a partner in Missouri-based \nlaw firms both before and after his time on the bench, serving as City \nCounselor and Public Defender for St.\n\n[[Page S4515]]\n\nLouis, MO and serving as a State representative in the Missouri General \nAssembly. He has been honored for his achievements and commitment to \npublic service by organizations such as the Federal Defense Bar of the \nEastern District of Missouri and the St. Louis branch of the NAACP.\n  I supported Judge White when he was first nominated to the U.S. \nDistrict Court and I support him now. In 1999, by the time the Senate \nvoted on his nomination, Judge White had upheld the implementation of \nthe death penalty 41 times as a state Supreme Court justice. Yet, then-\nSenator Ashcroft of Missouri claimed Judge White was ``soft on crime'' \nand was ``the most anti-death penalty judge on the Missouri Supreme \nCourt.'' These claims should have been easily dismissed years ago, and \nshould be easily dismissed today.\n  Judge White's nomination is supported by law enforcement, legal \nprofessionals, and the civil rights community. The elected President of \nthe Missouri Fraternal Order of Police, Kevin Ahlbrand, wrote on behalf \nof his organization's 5,400 members: ``As front line law enforcement \nofficers, we recognize the important need to have jurists such as \nRonnie White, who have shown themselves to be tough on crime, yet fair \nand impartial. . . . We can think of no finer or more worthy nominee.'' \nI ask consent that this letter, and others, be made a part of the \nCongressional Record.\n  Unfortunately, rather than admit that they made a mistake in voting \nagainst Judge White's nomination before, some Senators are now saying \nthey may oppose his nomination because in 2003 he joined the Missouri \nSupreme Court's majority opinion in Simmons v. Roper holding that the \nEight Amendment prohibits the execution of individuals who commit a \ncapital crime when they are under 18 years of age. In 2005, in Roper v. \nSimmons, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed. The criticism, I gather, is \nthat Judge White's decision to join the majority opinion was contrary \nto then-existing U.S. Supreme Court precedent. While I have heard some \nMembers of the Senate criticize a nominee for having asserted a \nposition that is ultimately rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court, this \nmay be the first time I have heard a nominee criticized for actually \ngetting it right.\n  At his confirmation hearing earlier this year, Senator McCaskill \nintroduced Judge White as someone who ``continues to be a shining star \nto thousands of Missourians because of his career, which has really \nbeen emblematic of hard work, courage, dedication and service to public \nbefore self. . . . I can think of no one in the State of Missouri who \nis more deserving of this appointment to the Federal bench than my \nfriend, Ronnie White.'' I thank Senator McCaskill for her leadership in \nrecommending that President Obama nominate Judge White for this \nposition.\n  Today Senators have an opportunity to right a wrong. This chance is \nlong overdue. I am confident Judge White will serve on the Federal \nbench with distinction, and with fidelity to our Constitution. I thank \nthe Majority Leader for bringing this nomination up for a vote, and I \nurge my fellow Senators to vote to defeat this filibuster and to \nconfirm this well qualified nominee without further delay.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        Fraternal Order of Police,\n\n\n                                         Missouri State Lodge,\n\n                                 Jefferson City, MO, May 13, 2014.\n     Senator Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy, As the elected representative of over \n     5,400 law enforcement officers across the State of Missouri, \n     I am urging your committee to vote out the nomination of \n     Ronnie White for the open judicial seat in the U.S. District \n     Court for the Eastern District of Missouri.\n       We would then be hopeful that the Senate confirms his \n     nomination.\n       We do not take such stances lightly. As front line law \n     enforcement officers, we recognize the important need to have \n     jurists such as Ronnie White, who have shown themselves to be \n     tough on crime, yet fair and impartial.\n       As a former justice on the Missouri Court of Appeals and as \n     the Chief Justice of the Missouri Supreme Court, Ronnie White \n     has proven that he has the experience and requisite \n     attributes to be a quality addition to the U.S. District \n     Court.\n       We can think of no finer or more worthy nominee.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Kevin Ahlbrand,\n     President, Missouri Fraternal Order of Police.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         The Leadership Conference\n\n\n                                    on Civil and Human Rights,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 16, 2014.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of The Leadership Conference on \n     Civil and Human Rights, we write to express our strong \n     support for the nomination of Ronnie L. White to be a U.S. \n     District Court Judge for the Eastern District of Missouri. As \n     one of Missouri's leading legal minds, Mr. White has devoted \n     his life to serving the citizens of Missouri. Throughout his \n     career, he has demonstrated a steadfast commitment to \n     enforcing the rule of law with objectivity, thoughtfulness \n     and impartiality, and he would be an outstanding addition to \n     the federal bench. We urge you to vote yes on cloture and yes \n     on his nomination.\n       Mr. White is eminently qualified, as evidenced by the \n     ``Unanimously Qualified'' rating he received from the \n     American Bar Association and by his long career in service to \n     the public. After graduating from the University of Missouri-\n     Kansas City Law School in 1983, Mr. White worked as a public \n     defender in St. Louis and served three terms in the Missouri \n     House of Representatives. In 1993, he was appointed as City \n     Counselor for the City of St. Louis; the following year, \n     Governor Mel Carnahan appointed him as a judge for the \n     Eastern District of the Missouri Court of Appeals. In 1995, \n     Mr. White became the first African American to sit on the \n     Supreme Court of Missouri, and he served as chief justice \n     from July 2003 to June 2005. He retired from the bench in \n     2007.\n       As a judge, Mr. White served with distinction on the \n     Missouri Court of Appeals and the state Supreme Court, \n     gaining a reputation as a fair, intelligent jurist who \n     commanded the respect of his fellow judges. When President \n     Clinton nominated him in 1997 to a seat on the U.S. District \n     Court for Missouri, Mr. White received support from his \n     colleagues on the Supreme Court and many in law enforcement. \n     However, his nomination was defeated in October 1999 in a \n     disappointing party-line vote engineered by then-Senator John \n     Ashcroft.\n       Mr. Ashcroft led a vigorous smear campaign against Mr. \n     White based on spurious claims about his record as a judge on \n     death penalty cases. For instance, the senator claimed that \n     White voted against the death penalty more than any other \n     judge on the Missouri Supreme Court. But the facts proved \n     otherwise. Of Mr. Ashcroft's seven appointees to the court, \n     four voted to reverse death penalty decisions more often than \n     Mr. White. In fact, Mr. White upheld the majority of death \n     penalty convictions that came before him as a judge, and in \n     the rare case in which he did vote to reverse, the majority \n     were unanimous decisions.\n       Further, Mr. Ashcroft used false data and misleading \n     interpretations to solicit opposition from law enforcement \n     and to bolster his assertion that Mr. White was ``soft on \n     crime.'' Even so, two major law enforcement groups--the \n     Missouri State Fraternal Order of Police and the Missouri \n     Police Chiefs Association--endorsed White wholeheartedly and \n     refuted the ``soft on crime'' allegation. Carl Wolf, then \n     president of the Missouri Police Chiefs Association, revealed \n     that Mr. Ashcroft had actively solicited opposition from law \n     enforcement groups and that any such opposition was not \n     spontaneous. It is worth pointing out that Mr. White's \n     current nomination has again garnered the endorsement of the \n     Missouri State Fraternal Order of Police.\n       In the aftermath of the 1999 vote against Mr. White's \n     confirmation, many saw the vilification of him as unfair and \n     the charges against him unfounded. In ``The Smearing of a \n     Moderate Judge,'' Stuart Taylor of The Legal Times wrote: \n     ``In short, the record shows that Judge White takes seriously \n     his duty both to enforce the death penalty and to ensure that \n     defendants get fair trials. It suggests neither that he's \n     `pro-criminal' nor that he's a liberal activist. What it does \n     suggest is courage. And while White may be more sensitive to \n     civil liberties than his Ashcroft-appointed colleagues are, \n     his opinions also exude a spirit of moderation, care, and \n     candor.'' Ultimately, many in the media viewed the fight as \n     one of political expediency rather than of judging a \n     candidate on the merits. As the Washington Post wrote, ``This \n     vote was politics of the rawest sort. It was the politics of \n     an upcoming Missouri Senate race, in which Sen. Ashcroft \n     apparently intends to use the death penalty as a campaign \n     issue.''\n       It is apparent that the opposition to Mr. White's previous \n     nomination was baseless and that he fell victim to political \n     posturing. The Leadership Conference believes Mr. White's \n     record makes him an exceptionally qualified nominee with the \n     ability to make objective decisions on the multifaceted and \n     prominent cases that will surely come before the court. His \n     impeccable credentials and the support he has garnered from \n     people across the political spectrum make him an excellent \n     choice for a federal judgeship on the U.S. District Court in \n     the Eastern District of Missouri. This malicious and \n     unwarranted attack on a unanimously qualified nominee must \n     not happen again.\n       For these reasons, we urge you to vote in favor of cloture \n     and in favor of his nomination. Thank you for your \n     consideration. If you have any questions, please feel free to\n\n[[Page S4516]]\n\n     contact Nancy Zirkin, Executive Vice President, at \n     Zirkin@civilrights.org or Sakira Cook, Counsel, at \n     cook@civilrights.org.\n           Sincerely,\n     Wade Henderson,\n       President and CEO,\n     Nancy Zirkin,\n       Executive Vice President.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n         Protect Women's Health from Corporate Interference Act\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am here today to express my concerns \nwith the Supreme Court's recent decision in the Hobby Lobby case and \nthe steps we are taking--hopefully, this week--to protect a woman's \nright to make her own health care decisions. I want to thank Senators \nMurray and Udall for their leadership on this issue and for introducing \nthe Not My Boss's Business Act.\n  I appreciate hearing from the Republican leader about their interest \nin supporting women's access to contraceptive care, and I hope that is \nsomething we can all agree on. But the issue here is not just access to \nthat care, it is the cost of that care. When you charge women more for \ncontraceptive coverage, then you are denying them access to that care.\n  The legislation that has been introduced by Senators Murray and \nUdall, and of which I am a cosponsor, will prevent employers from being \ninvolved in an employee's health care decisions and it will reverse the \nSupreme Court's decision.\n  Throughout my career in office, I have fought to ensure that women \nhave access to important contraceptive services and that women are able \nto make their own decisions about their health care with their doctors \nand with their families.\n  In 1999, when I was Governor of New Hampshire, I signed into law a \nbipartisan bill that required insurance companies to cover prescription \ncontraceptives--the issue we are debating right now. I signed that law \nwith strong bipartisan support because both Republicans and Democrats \nknew it was the right thing to do. In fact, that legislation passed in \nthe New Hampshire House with 121 Democratic votes and 120 Republican \nvotes and 2 Independents.\n  That law, passed in 1999, has now provided thousands of New Hampshire \nwomen with the ability to access the medications they and their doctors \ndecide are right for them because they have that insurance coverage to \npay for those medications. The Affordable Care Act also established \nthat women would have access to prescription contraceptive services \nwith no copays, just as New Hampshire did in 1999.\n  Do you know what is interesting? We are having this debate about \nreligious objections. Back in 1999 the legislature appointed a \ncommittee to look at whether there were any religious concerns about \nwhat we had done. They came back and reported that this was not an \nissue.\n  A recent analysis by the Department of Health and Human Services \nreports that because of the Affordable Care Act, more than 30 million \nwomen are now eligible to receive preventive health services, including \ncontraception, with no copays. In fact, since 2013 women have saved \nnearly $500 million in out-of-pocket costs because of the ACA's \nrequirement to cover contraceptive care.\n  The Supreme Court's decision has a real financial bearing on women \nand their families throughout the country because this ruling will have \na profound impact on the health and economic security of women \nthroughout this Nation. As noted by Justice Ginsburg in her dissent in \nthe Hobby Lobby case, when high cost is a factor, women are more likely \nto decide not to pursue certain forms of health care treatments that \ninvolve contraceptive care.\n  There are many reasons why a doctor may decide to prescribe \ncontraceptives for a woman's health care needs. Contraceptives can be \nused to treat a broad range of medical issues--hair loss, \nendometriosis, acne, irregular menstrual cycles. Contraceptives have \nalso been shown to reduce the risk of certain cancers. But just a few \nweeks ago the Supreme Court jeopardized that access to affordable \npreventive health care for too many women. As a result of the Hobby \nLobby case, some employers now have the ability to claim religious \nobjections as a justification for not providing contraceptive health \ncare with no copay.\n  I understand the host of issues employers face on a daily basis. I \nappreciate the complexity they face when they decide to offer health \ninsurance coverage to their employees. For example, take Jane Valliere, \nwho owns Hermanos Mexican restaurant in Concord, NH. I recently had the \nopportunity to sit down with Jane and to discuss the Hobby Lobby case. \nJane made it clear that while she has many choices and decisions to \nmake on a daily basis to keep her business running, she never expected \nto be put in a position where she could be responsible for making a \nhealth care decision for her employees at the restaurant.\n  Like Jane, I do not think it makes sense for employers to make those \npersonal, private health care decisions for their employees. Critical \nhealth decisions are simply not an employer's business. Where a woman \nworks should not determine whether she gets insurance coverage that has \nbeen guaranteed to her under Federal law.\n  While we do not yet know the full extent of the impact from this \nruling, we do know the Supreme Court's decision turns back progress \nwomen across the country have fought for years to achieve.\n  We must ensure that women have access to the health care services and \nmedications they need. That means making them affordable, that they are \nable to make their own decisions about their care with their doctors \nand their families.\n  Thankfully, we have an opportunity this week to correct the Supreme \nCourt's shortsighted decision. This week the Senate can stand for women \nand pass the Not My Boss's Business Act. A woman's health care decision \nshould be made with her doctor, with her family, with her faith, not by \nher employer and with her employer's faith. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, later we will be voting on a judge for \nthe Eastern District of Missouri. I come to the Senate floor today to \nexplain why, regrettably, I am unable to support the nominee.\n  As my colleagues know, Justice Ronnie White was originally nominated \nby President Clinton during the 105th Congress. This body voted on and \nrejected his nomination in 1999. After careful consideration of his \nrecord, I voted against Justice White's nomination at that time. Since \n1999, Justice White completed a term as chief justice of the Missouri \nSupreme Court and has returned to private practice. So today I would \nlike to revisit a few aspects of Justice White's legal and judicial \ncareer that first led me to vote against his nomination. I will also \ndiscuss developments since 1999. Unfortunately, his record since that \ntime has only reinforced my concerns.\n  First, I begin with some troubling aspects of Justice White's record \nduring his days on the Missouri Supreme Court in the 1990s. I only need \nto point to a few cases to illustrate my concerns.\n  In the 1998 Johnson case, Justice White was the sole dissenter on the \nState's high court. It was a capital appeal case involving a claim of \nineffective assistance of counsel. The case was heartbreaking. The \ndefendant shot four people to death--three Missouri sheriffs and one of \nthe sheriffs' wives. The facts were stark and very clear-cut. This was \nnot a close case.\n  The defendant was convicted based upon the overwhelming evidence of \nhis guilt. Justice White conceded there was more than sufficient \nevidence to sustain the conviction on appeal, but he went out of his \nway to create a standard that was not based on Missouri law when he \nevaluated the conduct of the defense attorney. Unsurprisingly, not a \nsingle member of the State court agreed with Justice White's dissenting \nopinion. That is because it was obvious there was no reasonable \nprobability that anything the defense attorney did would have\n\n[[Page S4517]]\n\nchanged the outcome of the trial. That is the applicable legal \nstandard. It is straightforward--very straightforward. In that case, \nevery member of the State supreme court applied it correctly, except \nJustice White.\n  Unfortunately, Justice White's dissent in that case was not an \nisolated example. On a number of other occasions throughout his \njudicial career, Justice White misapplied standards of review or \nconsidered issues that were not germane to the law when he was deciding \ncases. Justice White has even admitted as much. Discussing his judicial \nphilosophy, he said in 2005 that he thinks it is appropriate for judges \nto let their opinions be ``shaped by their own life experiences.'' I \nthink the personal characteristics of any judge--what this nominee \ncalls his ``own life experiences''--should play absolutely no role \nwhatsoever in the process of judicial decisionmaking. I know my \ncolleagues on our Judiciary Committee share that view as well.\n  Let me get back to the nominee's judicial track record. Justice White \nwas the sole dissenter in another case that the Missouri Supreme Court \ndecided in 1997. That case raised the question of whether the defendant \nwas entitled to an additional evidentiary hearing. In his dissent, \njoined by none of his colleagues, Justice White again ignored a \nstraightforward standard of review and wrote that the defendant should \nhave the hearing because Justice White thought it would cause ``little \nharm.'' Here again we see Justice White's personal preferences creeping \ninto what should be objective, law-based decisionmaking--something \npretty elementary to being a judge at any level, Federal or State, in \nour system of jurisprudence.\n  Those are just two examples of what led me, after consideration of \nthe nominee's record as a whole, to vote against his nomination in \n1999.\n  Unfortunately, my concerns about Justice White's first nomination \nhave only been reaffirmed by his subsequent record. For instance, I am \ntroubled by Justice White's concurrence in the Eighth Amendment case of \nRoper v. Simmons. That case was first heard by the Missouri Supreme \nCourt, was appealed to the Supreme Court, and was eventually affirmed. \nBut the affirmance is not what my colleagues should focus on. What \nshould concern my colleagues is the opinion that Justice White \nconcurred in, which ignored binding Supreme Court precedent. That \nprecedent was the Stanford v. Kentucky case. I will explain.\n  In 2003, when Justice White's court decided Roper, binding Supreme \nCourt precedent at that time permitted applying the death penalty to \nindividuals if they committed their crimes when they were under 18. \nNonetheless, Justice White concurred in the State court opinion that \nsimply ignored that precedent. Justice White concurred even though the \nSupreme Court had reaffirmed the Stanford principle twice in 2002, the \nyear before Justice White's state court decision.\n  Moreover, in 2003 the Supreme Court rejected an appeal raising legal \narguments that were identical to the ones Justice White endorsed. That \nis the very same year Justice White's court ruled in Roper and ignored \nStanford outright.\n  My colleagues on our Judiciary Committee often ask nominees about \ntheir commitment to Supreme Court precedent and their faithfulness to \nthe doctrine of stare decisis. Nominees who appear before us routinely \nrepeat the mantra that they will unfailingly apply precedent and \nnothing else--in other words, leave out personal views. Justice White \ndid as much at his hearing as well. But--and this is what I find so \ntroubling--when I asked him about the Stanford case, he admitted that \nStanford was, in fact, binding on his state court at the time he \nconcurred in Roper. What he did not explain--what he could not \nexplain--was why he ignored that binding precedent as a State supreme \ncourt justice. He could not explain why he thought it was appropriate \nfor him to concur in a State court opinion that, in effect, overruled \nU.S. Supreme Court precedent.\n  I do not doubt that Justice White has always done what he thought was \nright and that he ruled the way he thought best to achieve justice for \nthe litigants before him. But in my view that is not an appropriate \nrole for a Federal district judge. Judicial decisionmaking requires a \ndisinterested and objective approach that never takes into account the \njudge's life experiences or policy preferences. From the careful look I \nhave taken at Justice White's 13-year track record as a judge, I have \ntoo many questions about his ability to keep his personal \nconsiderations separate from his judicial opinions.\n  Finally, it is worth noting that there continues to be opposition to \nthis nominee from law enforcement.\n  Specifically, both the National Sheriffs' Association and the \nMissouri Sheriffs' Association oppose this nominee.\n  I always try to give judicial nominees the benefit of doubt when I \nhave questions about their records, but in this nominee's case, I \nsimply can't ignore so many indications that the nominee isn't the \nright person to occupy a lifetime appointment to the Federal bench.\n  I sincerely hope I am wrong about Justice White, and I reluctantly \nvote no on the nominee.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nMissouri Sheriffs' Association Training Academy and National Sheriffs' \nAssociation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[From the Missouri Sheriffs' Association and Training Academy, May 10, \n                                 2014]\n\nMissouri Sheriffs' Association Opposes Confirmation of Ronnie L. White \n                          to the Federal Bench\n\n       On behalf of the 115 Sheriffs in the State of Missouri, the \n     Missouri Sheriffs' Association vehemently opposes the \n     confirmation of Ronnie L. White to the federal bench.\n       Victims of crime, families of victims and law enforcement \n     deserve a better federal judge than Ronnie L. White. As we \n     explained to Senators Blunt and McCaskill last year, Ronnie \n     L. White proved himself an activist judge who sought \n     protection for criminals from punishment given to them by a \n     jury even in cases where criminals performed unforgiveable \n     acts of violence against our fellow citizens and law \n     enforcement.\n       Ronnie L. White's actions and beliefs doomed his \n     confirmation in 1999. In 1999, fifty four Senators knew \n     Ronnie L. White was not the right person for the job based on \n     the merits of his decisions on the bench. Nothing has changed \n     since 1999 warranting Ronnie L. White's confirmation this \n     year.\n       Senators who want to protect our citizenry from activist \n     judges like Ronnie L. White should vote against confirmation \n     just as was done in 1999.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               National Sheriffs' Association,\n\n                                    Alexandria, VA, April 2, 2014.\n     Hon. Claire McCaskill,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Roy Blunt,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCaskill and Senator Blunt: I write on behalf \n     of the National Sheriffs' Association (NSA) and the more than \n     3,000 elected Sheriffs nationwide to express our support for \n     the efforts of the Missouri Sheriffs' Association to prevent \n     the nomination of Ronnie L. White to a federal judgeship in \n     St. Louis. The Missouri Sheriffs' Association was outspoken \n     in its opposition to Judge White's previous nomination by \n     President Bill Clinton and continues to be outspoken against \n     any further consideration to the federal courts. I \n     respectfully request that, as you examine candidates for the \n     federal judgeship in St. Louis, you carefully consider the \n     concerns presented by the Missouri Sheriffs' Association \n     regarding any judicial nomination of Ronnie L. White.\n           Respectfully yours,\n                                                 Michael Leidholt,\n                                            Sheriff NSA President.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican whip.\n\n\n                             Border Crisis\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, over the past several weeks, I have spoken \nabout the ongoing crisis on our southern border--the President has \nacknowledged as a humanitarian crisis--with tens of thousands of \nunaccompanied minors making a perilous journey from Central America and \nending on our doorstep, most often in my State, the State of Texas.\n  In this year, the numbers are skyrocketing again. Starting in 2011 we \nsaw the numbers, roughly, about 6,000 unaccompanied minors. They \ndoubled from 2011 to 2012, they doubled again from 2012 to 2013, and \nthey look as though they are going to double again from 2013 to 2014. \nWe can only wonder at what might happen thereafter unless we come up \nwith a solution to the problem.\n  A majority of these children, as I indicated, come from Central \nAmerica--El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. Under current law when \nthese children are detained by the Border Patrol, they are processed by \nthe Border Patrol and\n\n[[Page S4518]]\n\nthen given a notice to appear at a future court hearing and turned over \nto the Department of Health and Human Services for safekeeping.\n  Health and Human Services tries to identify a guardian to pick up the \nchild and, not surprisingly, most of them are never heard from again. \nCertainly they don't show up for this court hearing in response to the \nnotice to appear. Thus, the transnational criminal organizations, the \ncartels--the people who make money from transporting these children and \nother migrants across Mexico and the United States--have discovered an \neffective business model. In other words, they are able to deliver \nthese children to their families--at least the ones who survive--from \nCentral America through Mexico and into Texas.\n  The majority of them will make it, because they will be placed with a \nfamily member or some other relative, and never appear at the court \nhearing for which they have been notified to appear.\n  For children detained from bordering nations such as Mexico or \nCanada, the process is different than it is from noncontiguous \ncountries such as Central America. Border Patrol, under the current \nlaw, can determine whether the children are eligible to stay in the \nUnited States or give these children the choice to be safely \ntransferred to officials from their home countries.\n  Our country simply does not have the current capacity to deal with \n50,000, much less 90,000 or 100,000, unaccompanied minors appearing on \nour Nation's doorstep.\n  As a result, these children are being kept at Border Patrol \nfacilities, such as I witnessed in McAllen, TX, that have capacity for \na few hundred people, but they are currently holding well over double, \nmany times triple and beyond, their current capacity.\n  I and other Members of Congress, unlike the President, have seen \nthese facilities firsthand and talked to some of the children. The \nconditions they are kept in are unacceptable by any standard: babies in \ndiapers sleeping on cement floors and dozens of children crammed into \none cell with a single toilet.\n  In addition to these overcrowded detention facilities, there is an \noverburdened judicial system. Minors in custody of the Department of \nHealth and Human Services are released to family members or guardians \nor sponsors in the United States, but they are given a notice to appear \nbefore an immigration judge if they wish to make a claim for relief \nunder our immigration laws.\n  Those who show up will not see a judge, on average, for more than 1 \nyear--leaving, as I said, plenty of incentive to simply disappear and \nnever return for a court date. As the law is currently written, in \n2008, there are few other options available.\n  For that reason I have, along with my friend and colleague from \nTexas, Henry Cuellar from the House of Representatives, introduced a \nclear, commonsense change to the 2008 law to address the immediate \ncrisis.\n  This is, I hasten to add, not a complete fix to our broken \nimmigration system, but it does target this particular crisis and \noffers a commonsense solution.\n  We call this the Helping Unaccompanied Minors and Alleviating \nNational Emergency Act, or the HUMANE Act. It would amend the William \nWilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008. \nThat law had good intentions, because it was focused on the victims of \nhuman trafficking, and we preserve those protections for the victims of \nhuman trafficking, but it needs to be improved so that thousands of \nchildren who now make this perilous journey in the hands of these \ncriminal organizations up these smuggling corridors from Central \nAmerica to the United States--we must make sure they are deterred from \nmaking this life-threatening journey.\n  Our changes to the law maintain all of the safeguards built into the \n2008 law, and so there should be no objection on that basis. But what \nwe would go further to do is the HUMANE Act would treat all \nunaccompanied minors the same and ensure an orderly legal process.\n  A majority of these children would be reunited with their parents in \ntheir home countries. Those who choose to appear in front of an \nimmigration judge will have every opportunity to do so on an expedited \nbasis. In those cases where they qualify for removal under our current \nlaws, they would be placed in safekeeping with federally screened \nsponsors while additional hearings are scheduled.\n  This expedited process would alleviate overburdened Border Patrol and \nHHS facilities, as well as the local officials who have been \ndisproportionately affected--although I would add that I read newspaper \nstories about officials in places such as Massachusetts, Arizona, \nCalifornia, and others expressing concern about these large numbers of \nunaccompanied children who are being warehoused in their States.\n  Most importantly, this legislation would send a message to people in \nCentral America that the dangerous journey to the United States in the \nhands of ruthless smugglers and cartel operatives is simply not worth \nit.\n  Central American families would hear loudly and clearly that not only \nwill the journey place their children at risk of sexual assault and \neven death, they will by and large not be permitted to stay in the \nUnited States once they arrive under current law.\n  Some will. If you are a victim of human trafficking, you may be \neligible for a T-visa. If you have a colorable claim to asylum, you can \nmake that claim to an immigration judge under our legislation. But if \nyou don't have a claim to relief under our current immigration laws, \nyou will be returned safely to your home country.\n  Tackling this crisis is a significant challenge that requires \nPresidential leadership. But, in the meantime, these children are \nsleeping in overcrowded cells, Texas communities are reeling from the \nimpact, and we need action. With this legislation we try to target a \ncommonsense solution that will take immediate steps to help stem the \ntide of the growing crisis.\n  I hope my colleagues will join us in cosponsoring this legislation. \nIt sounds as if the House of Representatives is probably going to be \nmoving next week. I know there is a lot of controversy anytime we talk \nabout circumstances such as this. Some people think it should be \ntougher, others think it is too tough to enforce current law. But the \nfact is, the drug cartels, the transnational criminal organizations, \nhave created a business model based on a loophole they found in the \n2008 law.\n  Our bipartisan, bicameral legislation seeks to fix that and to give \nthese children the benefit of the law if they qualify under the law as \ncurrently written. But to continue to leave the law as it exists now \nwith this loophole in it, and continue to see it exploited by the Zetas \nand other cartels that traffic in human beings, is simply an invitation \nto continue to see these numbers double year after year and our \ncapacity to deal with these children on a humane basis further \ndiminished.\n  We need to have immigration laws that protect these children and all \nof us, and it does not mean that anybody and everybody under every \ncircumstance can qualify to come to the United States and stay. That is \nsimply an invitation to chaos.\n  We can treat these children humanely, we can give them the benefit \nthat the law allows as written, but if they don't qualify, we need to \nreturn them home.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. I ask unanimous consent that the order for quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, it is not often the Senate has a \nchance to go back and fix a grievous error that occurred in our \nhistory, and that error occurred in 1999 when a good and qualified man \nwas defeated in the Senate for a position on the eastern district court \nof the Federal bench in Missouri.\n  At that time there was an attack on Ronnie White for being soft on \ncrime. The record, as it stands today, flies in the face of that \nassertion.\n\n[[Page S4519]]\n\n  At the time of his defeat, he had voted to uphold the death penalty \nalmost 70 percent of the time. In fact, in his career on the Missouri \nSupreme Court, being the first African American appointed to the \nSupreme Court, he voted with the majority on death penalty cases 90 \npercent of the time.\n  This is a mainstream jurist. This is not someone who is outside of \nthe mainstream. That is why the Fraternal Order of Police has endorsed \nhis nomination. That is why he is considered in the State of Missouri \nas an iconic leader in the legal community. He went back to Missouri, \nwas the chief justice in the Supreme Court after he was defeated on the \nfloor of the Senate, retired from the Supreme Court, and has gone on to \nbe an established and respected lawyer in the St. Louis community--\nfrankly, part of many big cases, especially the appellate work, because \nhe served on both the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court.\n  I think Ronnie White handled what happened to him with as much \ncharacter as could possibly be required of any individual. I look \nforward to finally righting the wrong and allowing Ronnie White his \nwell-deserved place on the Federal bench.\n  I ask all my colleagues to support the confirmation of Ronnie White.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                             Women's Health\n\n  Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, I rise to speak on an issue of vital \nimportance to all who value true liberty in the United States.\n  Last month the Supreme Court issued its decision in the Hobby Lobby \ncase. In 2010, in the Citizens United case, the Court said corporations \nhave a First Amendment right to participate in elections. In the Hobby \nLobby ruling, the Court took it a step further and said that since a \ncorporation can be a person, it can also have religious views and \nbecause a corporation is a person, it can impose its religious beliefs \non an employee and deny a woman insurance that protects her health by \nproviding contraception. So the folly of the Supreme Court has come \nfull circle, where an actual person will be denied their rights because \nthe views of a corporation have been given priority under the U.S. \nConstitution as interpreted by this Supreme Court.\n  Instead of ``we the people,'' it is now ``I the CEO of a \ncorporation'' who has the right to exercise their constitutional \nprivileges as interpreted by this Supreme Court that truncates the \nright of individual women in America to exercise theirs.\n  The Supreme Court majorities have continued to extend our basic \nconstitutional rights--the inalienable rights held by individuals--to \ncorporations. Corporations are not people.\n  Supporters of the Hobby Lobby ruling have accused Democrats of \nhyperbole. They say we are making the Hobby Lobby case seem more dire \nthan it truly is. The corporate personhood supporters say the ruling \ndoesn't mean women can't use the contraception of their choice, just \nthat the insurance provided by their employer doesn't have to cover it \nor they say the ruling doesn't mean a boss is imposing his or her \nreligious views on their employees. That is just wrong. It says that \nthe boss doesn't have to subsidize health care that violates the boss's \nreligious views.\n  What happens when the religious views of a CEO are imposed on the \nreal life of a working woman?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order.\n  Mr. MARKEY. In real life working women earn their insurance coverage. \nIt is part of their pay, and they depend on insurance to pay for their \nhealth care--including contraception--for themselves and their \nfamilies. If that employer's choice of insurance doesn't pay for a \nparticular type of contraception, a woman will be forced to give up her \nright to use it.\n  If one form of contraception is--just as Ginsburg explained in her \ndissent--$1,000, and insurance won't cover even a penny, a working \nwoman is going to be forced to make medical decisions based on the \nreligion her employer practices, not on what she and her doctor \ndetermine is best for her from a medical perspective. The religion of \nthe employer trumps the recommendation of a physician to a woman, and \nthis is just a step that changes the whole relationship between an \nindividual and their country.\n  If a corporation's insurance doesn't cover any contraception because \nall contraceptives violate the employer's religious beliefs, then their \nemployee's religious views are especially burdened, and she will have \nto pay for contraception out of her own pocket. Keep in mind that the \naverage woman makes 77 cents on the dollar to a man, but if you are an \nAfrican-American woman, then it is 66 cents on the dollar, and Latina \nwomen earn 59 cents on the dollar compared to what a white man makes in \nthe United States of America.\n  In the Hobby Lobby case, the Supreme Court transformed religion from \na personal choice into a corporate decision, and the corporate world--\nin real life--can impose its religious views on its employees. That is \nwhy I am an original cosponsor of S. 2578, the Protect Women's Health \nfrom Corporate Interference Act, or as supporters call it the Not My \nBoss's Business Act.\n  Let's be clear. Corporations are not people, period. For-profit \ncorporations do not have religious views. For-profit corporations \nshould not be able to deny their employees critical health care or \nforce American taxpayers to pay for it\n\n[[Page S4520]]\n\nbecause of the owner's personal religious views.\n  The Not My Boss's Business Act will fix the Hobby Lobby decision by \nmaking it illegal for corporations to deny their employees health care \nbenefits--including contraception--that are required to be covered by \nFederal law. It will protect employees from having their health care \nrestricted by bosses who want to impose their religious belief on \nothers.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote to restore true liberty by voting to \npass S. 2578. I thank all of my colleagues.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, last month, as my friend from \nMassachusetts just mentioned, the Supreme Court ruled that the Obama \nadministration's Health and Human Services mandate infringes on the \nFirst Amendment guarantee of religious freedom. This is a guarantee \nthat Americans have enjoyed for the entire history of our country. It \nis the first freedom in the First Amendment to the Constitution. The \nfirst sentence has the words ``freedom of religion.''\n  In the very recent past, the Congress of the United States voted for \na bill that protected freedom of religion unless there was some \nextraordinary reason not to have freedom of religion in our country. It \nis important to try to maintain some sense of good humor and be willing \nto work with people on other issues. As it is, people come to the floor \nand just say the same things over and over that are not true.\n  Everybody is entitled to their own opinion on religious freedom. \nEverybody is entitled to their own opinion on the President's health \ncare bill. Everybody is not entitled to their own facts. If we were \ndealing with the facts as they truly exist right now, this would be a \nmuch different debate.\n  In fact, just a couple of days ago the Washington Post Fact Checker \nsaid that what the Senate Democrats are saying in their rhetoric is \njust wrong. He said: They are simply wrong. He said the court ruling \ndoes not outlaw contraceptives. The court ruling does not prevent women \nfrom seeking birth control. The court ruling does not take away a \nperson's religious freedom. In fact, all the court ruling does is say \nthat although many people are exempted from this law, we are going to \nfind a way to have people's religious rights upheld.\n  In America you should not be forced to choose between giving up your \nbusiness for your faith or giving up your faith for your business. \nUnder the Constitution and under the political heritage of this country \nand the foundation this country was built on, the government has no \nright to ask people to make that choice. There are plenty of \nprotections in the Religious Restoration Freedom Act that passed just a \nfew years ago that don't allow this to be taken to some unacceptable \nextreme.\n  Religious freedom has historically been a bipartisan issue. In fact, \nthe law the Court based their decision on was introduced in the House \nby then-Congressman Chuck Schumer--now Senator Schumer who sits right \nover there--and the late Senator Ted Kennedy. They were the people who \nproposed this legislation. President Clinton signed the bill into law. \nThe Vice President of the United States, Joe Biden, voted for the bill. \nThe minority leader of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, was \na cosponsor of the bill, and this was just considered something that \nwas easily done.\n  It was unanimously passed in the House. It got three no votes--the \nvote was 97 to 3 in the Senate. This was in 1993, not 1893. This was a \ndozen years ago when the understanding was clear that there was a \nprinciple in our country that if you are going to violate that \nprinciple, you better have taken every step possible not to violate the \nprinciple of religious freedom. People on the other side would say it \nwas only a handful of years ago when the bill passed and they didn't \nknow that was what it meant.\n  Of course they knew that was what it meant. One of the reasons they \nknow that is what it meant is because they knew at the time that this \nprinciple was a principle the government would adhere to.\n  In fact, the specific language in the Respect for Rights of \nConscience Act that I introduced in the 112th Congress plus the \nspecific language that Senator Kennedy put in the Health Insurance \nConsumer's Bill of Rights Act in 1997 exempted the protected religious \nfaith. It says that based on the religious or moral convictions of the \nissuer, the issuer didn't have to do things they thought were wrong.\n  In the 103rd Congress Senator Moynihan introduced the Clinton health \ncare package--sometimes called Hillary care--which said that nothing in \nthis title should be construed to prevent any employer from \ncontributing to the purchase of a standard benefits package which \nexcludes coverage for abortion or other services if the employer \nobjects to such services on the basis of a religious belief or moral \nconviction. It can't get much clearer than that.\n  According to Senator Schumer--when the Religious Freedom Restoration \nAct was introduced it said the government shall not substantially \nburden a person's exercise of religion even if the burden results from \na rule of general applicability unless it demonstrates such a burden \nis, one, in the furtherance of a compelling governmental interest or, \ntwo, is the least restrictive means of furthering that governmental \ninterest.\n  This is not a law--the Affordable Care Act--that people are not \nexempted from. In fact, every woman and man in America who works for an \nemployer that has fewer than 50 people employed is exempted from this \nact. There are entire religious faith groups exempted from this act if \nthey don't believe in government health care. There are waivers the \nPresident has issued over and over that exempt people from this act--\nmany of whom were employees of fast-food restaurants and other places \nthat had minimal packages. The President said we are going to exempt \nthem for a while.\n  People who work for employers with under 50 employees are exempted \nforever until the law changes. There are millions more people who work \nfor employers with under 50 employees than work for employers that will \nhave a sincere faith-based interest in not doing the wrong thing.\n  The majority of people who worship in this country in a given week go \nto worship in a church where they say this practice is wrong. It \ndoesn't mean it is illegal. It doesn't mean anybody who hears them or \nappreciates them can't do whatever they want to do. But it does mean \nyou can easily go to church and be told this is the wrong thing to be a \npart of.\n  The companies involved in the court case have a great tradition of \nfollowing their faith. When you get a full-time job at Hobby Lobby, \nyour starting wage is $14 an hour--almost twice the minimum wage. You \nhave to work a couple of hours to have the extra $10 a month that some \nof these particular medicines, procedures, and birth control pills \nwould cost. They are closed on Sunday. They close earlier at night than \ntheir competitors so people who work there can have a family life. In \nfact, the government conceded these were companies that were clear in \ntheir belief.\n  Now, if you have millions of people who are not covered by the law, \nwhy can't you find a way to exempt people from providing a small \nportion of health coverage that they feel is the wrong thing to do? \nWhat did the government say? The government said: Well, you have a way \nout; you don't have to provide insurance at all. So if you are an \nemployer of faith and you want to do everything you can to provide the \nbest benefit--probably in excess of the government-required benefits in \nalmost all areas you want to provide--your choice is to not provide \ninsurance at all.\n\n  In fact, the suggestion was made that they would save money by not \nproviding insurance at all because it would cost $2,000 per employee \nnot to provide insurance at all. That was the penalty in the law, and \nthe government suggested that was probably a lot less than these \ncompanies were paying for insurance.\n  They said: Why not just pay the penalty? You don't have to violate \nyour faith. You can just violate your belief to take special \nresponsibility for your employees. You can pay the $2,000 penalty and \nsave money.\n\n[[Page S4521]]\n\n  While I'm on the $2,000 penalty, I will say that one of the egregious \noverreaches of what the government was trying to do here is to say if \nyou don't provide insurance at all, your penalty is $2,000. If you \ndon't provide the exact insurance the government says you have to \nprovide--whether it is based on your faith or otherwise--your penalty \nis $36,500 per employee.\n  You can provide better insurance in every other area than what the \ngovernment says, you can provide insurance in areas that the government \ndidn't even require you to provide insurance, you can do anything you \nwant to do beyond what the government says to do, but if you don't do \neverything the government says, you have to pay $36,500 per employee \nper year. And that was in the regulation.\n  That is the law that Members of the House and Senate voted for. I was \nnot one of them. I was against this law. But the law said you have to \npay $2,000 if you don't do anything at all. But the Obama \nadministration said you have to pay $36,500 if you didn't do exactly \nwhat they said you have to do. It is the wrong application of religious \nfreedom. The idea that people could not have access to any FDA-approved \nproduct is just wrong. Somehow if your employer can keep you from \nhaving access to anything you want to have access to that has been \napproved by the FDA is wrong as the millions of women and men who work \nfor companies who aren't covered under the law prove every day. They \nprove it every day. If we listen to our friends on the other side, one \nwould think we would be driven backward--we are talking about on behalf \nof religious freedom, being driven back into the dark ages of December \n2013--when everybody who could buy a product in December of 2013 can \nbuy that same FDA-approved product today.\n\n  This is about religious freedom. It is not about money. In fact, this \nbill proposed in the last Congress--I had a provision in that bill that \na few Democrats voted for--more Democrats voted for the bill than \nRepublicans voted against it. There was bipartisan support for the \nbill. I offered an amendment that said if the Department of Health and \nHuman Services wants to, they can promulgate a rule that requires an \nemployer to add a benefit of equal value for any benefit the government \nrequires that they don't want to offer. That is an easy way to say \nthere is no economic motive at all. Maybe the government doesn't \nrequire mental health coverage, and if an employer can offer that \nmental health coverage of equal value to a benefit the employer's faith \nprohibits being a part of--the bill that most Democrats in the Senate \nvoted against had that provision in there.\n  This is not about our pocketbooks. This is not about what something \ncosts. This is about whether the government has done everything \npossible to accommodate people's deeply held religious beliefs. The \nfirst freedom in the first sentence in the First Amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution mattered when it was put in there, it mattered when 16 or \nso of the current Members of the Senate voted for the Religious Freedom \nAct, it mattered when Ted Kennedy and Senator Moynihan put this exact \nsame ability in the health care laws they proposed less than 20 years \nago, and it matters today.\n  I hope we move on to solving problems based on the real facts rather \nthan continuing to talk about facts as my friends would like them to be \nrather than facts as they really are.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I rise in strong support of the \nProtect Women's Health Care from Corporate Interference Act.\n  I thank my colleague Senator Murray from Washington and my colleague \nSenator Udall from Colorado for introducing this bill and Senator \nMurray for her long championed efforts on women's health. I am very \nproud to support this bill.\n  I guess I would say to my colleague, who I know feels passionately \nabout these issues, that the issue is really how important prescription \nbenefits are to women's health and particularly how important \ncontraception is to women and the fact that it is not an add-on to our \nhealth care but, rather, an essential part of our health care. So I \nhope it doesn't really take us getting a majority of women on the \nSupreme Court to convince people how central this issue is to the \nhealth care of women and why we don't want to deal with a boss who \ndecides to say: I don't want to cover that in employee benefit \npackages.\n  I hope I and my colleagues will get a chance to vote on this \nlegislation because I think the Supreme Court's ruling in this case 2 \nweeks ago really set us on a slippery slope. In a 5-to-4 decision they \nheld that corporations can deny contraceptive coverage for women who \nare their employees if the owner--if the owner--professes a religious \nobjection.\n  I know my colleagues think, why don't we just make this product more \navailable so that women can pay an out-of-pocket amount for it?\n  It is an essential part of women's health and should be part of an \nemployee's package and should not have to be a component she has to add \non later.\n  This precedent by the Court is a troubling precedent. The decision \nthreatens access to critical preventive health services for women, and \nit opens the door for employers to deny other health care services just \nbecause of the owner's religious beliefs.\n  Many of my colleagues have come to the floor and articulated how this \nis not about the religious exemption part of the Affordable Care Act \nthat can be sought by churches and religious organizations; this is \nabout employers who are corporations. So those exemptions for people \nwho do have religious beliefs and don't want to offer these health care \nservices are still preserved. But what is not preserved is a woman's \nability to say to her employer: Why are you discriminating against me \nand my health care insurance that you are going to provide when you are \nnot providing the full range of benefits for women?\n  So, as I said, it really is a slippery slope, and the question is, \nHow many other things are going to be thrown into this same area?\n  I am getting a lot of letters. I have heard from several people from \nthe Northwest. In fact, this one individual wrote to me saying, ``I am \nterrified that affordable access''--affordable access, not an add-on. \nJust because I am a woman and I work for an employer, now I have an \nadd-on because you are discriminating against what my health care \nservices are. She said, ``I am terrified that affordable access to my \nmedically indicated preferred method of birth control may be in \njeopardy due to the recent Supreme Court decision.''\n  So, yes, we are hearing from a lot of people that the decision \nimperils the ability of women to access evidence-based, clinically \neffective contraceptive methods in their health care plans. These are \nhealth care plans they pay for through their hard-earned wages as part \nof their benefit package when they sign on to work for a company.\n  We know this is a vital component of health care, and it helps women \nwith everything from family planning to reducing risks of ovarian \ncancer and other medical conditions. So we want to make sure these \nrecommendations, such as the recommendations of the U.S. Preventive \nServices Task Force, which says to include reproductive health care \nmethods as preventive services--we want those services to be offered. \nAs a result of those recommendations, about 675,000 women in Washington \nState now have robust access to a set of 20 FDA-approved contraceptive \nmethods as part of a preventive services package. These services are \ncovered free of coinsurance, free of copays, and free of deductibles.\n\n  Now we are basically saying that because a person is a woman and even \nthough this is an essential part of health care, all of a sudden, \nbecause of the Supreme Court decision, a woman might work for an \nemployer who is going to ask her to pay for that instead out of her own \npocket.\n  I think this decision threatens real progress for our health care \ndelivery system. We know this well because in Washington State \nemployers denying women basic health coverage is not a new issue. In \nfact, women in my State have been fighting for decades.\n  In 1999 Jennifer Erickson was supervising as a pharmacist at Bartell \nDrugs in Bellevue, WA. Upon starting her job, she learned that her \ncompany didn't\n\n[[Page S4522]]\n\ncover one prescription that she needed--birth control pills--so she \nappealed to the company asking them to cover that benefit. She was \ndenied. She went on to file a class action lawsuit on behalf of the \ncompany's nonunionized employees. In a landmark ruling, the Federal \ndistrict court--Judge Robert Lasnik--held that Ms. Erickson had the \nlegal right to access birth control under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. \nWhat is more, the decision was based on a Supreme Court precedent.\n  Unlike the district court, though, the Supreme Court has gotten this \nwrong, and the ruling is a dangerous precedent to allow employers to \ndeny other health care benefits just because the owner wants to \nproclaim that his religious beliefs don't want him to offer those \ncoverages.\n  As Justice Ginsburg said, would the exemption the Court holds that \nhas been used on contraceptives based on religious grounds--would there \nbe other examples, such as blood transfusions because they are a \nJehovah's Witness or antidepressants because they are a Scientologist \nor medications derived from pigs, including anesthesia and other \nthings, because certain other ethnic groups--Muslims, Jews, or Hindus--\nsaid they didn't want to provide those services?\n  Does it set us up for a lot of medical necessities not being covered \nby corporations simply because the CEO or many owners of that company \ndecide it is in their religious beliefs not to offer those important \nservices?\n  It is very important that we vote to make sure we speak on behalf of \nthese women who are writing to us now, that we give them the kind of \ncoverage for health care they deserve and that ensures every employer \nwho sponsors a health care plan has these same benefits included in the \npackage.\n  The good news is that 60 percent of working women in Washington State \nget their coverage through their employers. But we need to make sure \nthe employers--just because the CEO all of a sudden has now become the \njudge of whether they want to cover important health care services, we \nhave to make sure we pass this legislation to protect those employees.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this legislation.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor. I ask that the time during \nthe quorum call be equally divided between both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, I rise today to set the record \nstraight. Since the Supreme Court ruled on the Hobby Lobby case, a \nflood of misinformation has spread, distorting the true meaning of the \nCourt's decision. We have seen a misrepresentation of the case, I think \nto divide the American people, and I find these scare tactics very \ndisappointing.\n  It is time to move away from the overheated rhetoric and it is time \nfor us to discuss the facts. The Washington Post Fact Checker has \nsystematically rebutted a series of misleading claims from my friends \non the other side of the aisle. The Fact Checker concluded that, \n``Simply put, the court ruling does not outlaw contraceptives, does not \nallow bosses to prevent women from seeking birth control and does not \ntake away a person's religious freedom.''\n  In other words, under this ruling, no boss has the right to tell an \nemployee that they cannot use birth control. Nothing in the decision, \nnothing takes away women's access to birth control. All women continue \nto hold the constitutional right that was first articulated in Griswold \nv. Connecticut to use contraceptives. The Court's Hobby Lobby opinion \nreaffirms Griswold and unequivocally states, ``under our cases, women \n(and men) have a constitutional right to obtain contraceptives.'' \nDiscrimination based on gender continues to be illegal. Employers may \nnot punish, retaliate, or discriminate against women who choose to use \ncontraception.\n  Moreover, current privacy laws prevent employers from even asking if \nan employee uses birth control.\n  The Court went on to state that its decision ``provides no such \nshield'' against discrimination in hiring. An employer cannot prohibit \na woman from purchasing any form of contraception. Moreover, women can \ncontinue to have broad access to safe, affordable birth control.\n  Even before the Affordable Care Act was passed, 28 States already had \nlaws or regulations on the books to provide for contraceptive coverage. \nOver 85 percent of large businesses provide contraceptive coverage for \ntheir employees. For women without such coverage, the U.S. Department \nof Health and Human Services administers five separate programs to \nensure affordable access to contraception, including Medicaid.\n  The bottom line: All women continue to have the ability to purchase \nor use a wide variety of contraceptives. It is both possible to stand \ntall for the principle of religious freedom and also to support safe \naccess to birth control. The two are not mutually exclusive. The issue \nin Hobby Lobby is not whether women can purchase birth control, it is \nwho pays for what. Those of us who believe that life begins at \nconception have moral objections to devices or procedures that destroy \nfertilized embryos.\n  The Green family, the owners of Hobby Lobby, have similar objections. \nThey do not want to use their money to violate their religious beliefs. \nI think most Americans would believe that is reasonable. In fact, the \nGreens offered health coverage that pays for 16 out of 20 forms of \ncontraception, including birth control pills.\n  The Court narrowly ruled that the Green family's decision was \nprotected by the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a bill led by \nDemocrats and passed with overwhelming support by both the Senate and \nthe House of Representatives. The bill requires the government to show \na high level of proof before it can interfere with the free exercise of \nreligion. The Court ruled that in this case the government failed to \nmeet that burden. Accordingly, it could not abridge the Green family's \nlegitimate religious views.\n  While not all Americans share these particular views, I do believe \nall Americans understand the importance of preserving religious \nliberty. Indeed, our Nation was largely founded by men and women \nseeking that religious freedom. The Court's decision was a narrow one, \napplying only to closely held, mostly family-owned companies. Some have \nsuggested the ruling could open the door to objections over blood \ntransfusions or vaccines. We heard similar fears when the Religious \nFreedom Restoration Act was passed over 20 years ago. None of those \nfears have been realized.\n  Finally, I would like to state my strong support for the legislation \nI introduced with Senator Kelly Ayotte and Senator Mitch McConnell that \nreaffirms the dual principles of religious freedom and safe access to \ncontraception for all women.\n  Rather than seeking to divide Americans, our legislation brings \npeople together around ideas that we all can support. I would \nespecially like to commend Senator Ayotte for her strong leadership on \nthis issue. I have enjoyed working with her to push back against those \nmisleading claims about the Hobby Lobby ruling and ensuring that women \nacross America know the truth.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I rise today to talk about the assault \non women's health that has come from a majority of our Supreme Court in \nrecent weeks. It is unfortunate and frankly shocking that in the year \n2014 we are still debating the issue of access to birth control. But \nhere we are. Millions of Americans are looking to the Senate today and \ncounting on us to stand for women's rights. They are counting on us to \nput health care back between a woman and her doctor. They are counting \non us to stand for millions of Americans' access to affordable, \npreventive health care of every kind. They are counting on us to say \nthat birth control is not your boss's business.\n  In short, they are counting on us to right this huge wrong from the \nSupreme Court. We have that ability to\n\n[[Page S4523]]\n\nright this wrong. We have that ability here in this room. The Court, in \nits decision, lays out a structure in which Congress does have the \npower to overturn this misguided decision. The Court based its decision \non an act of Congress, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Now \nCongress can respond. Congress can pass a new law that says: That is \nnot what the Religious Freedom Restoration Act was meant to mean. The \nCourt got it wrong. We are going to make it right. We should all \nremember that the act was set up to protect the religious choices of \nemployees. The Supreme Court has stood that on its head.\n  But for us to right the wrong we have to be willing to debate. We \nhave to be willing to go to the bill. We have to be willing to consider \neach other's viewpoints, listen to each other. We have to be willing to \nvote. But we cannot get to the bill if the majority is thwarted by a \nminority which uses its filibuster power in a way never envisioned in \nthe past, never utilized until recent history, which has prevented \nCongress from actually debating bills.\n  So let's all join together and say: Wherever you stand on this issue, \nthis issue is important enough to debate. Women's health care is \nimportant enough to debate. Access to contraceptive care is important \nenough to have that issue before this body. So let's all say yes to \ndebate this bill. The bill is formally titled The Protect Women's \nHealth from Corporate Interference Act or, as it is commonly known, the \nNot My Boss's Business Act.\n  I hope we will all join collectively in saying this is an important \nissue, because it really is about women's access to fundamental health \ncare. Whether contraceptives are used for family planning or for \npainful medical conditions such as endometriosis, birth control is \nessential health care for millions of Americans. While some are trying \nto say this case has nothing to do with access to birth control, that \nis simply not true. For most working families, affordability is access. \nWithout insurance, birth control can cost tens of thousands of dollars \nover a lifetime. One-third of women in America say they have struggled \nwith the cost of birth control at some point in their lives. For \nworking families, getting by month to month, often paycheck to \npaycheck, these costs, though they might be dismissed by Washington \npundits and even politicians here across the aisle, add up. They can \nput contraception out of reach.\n  A loss of insurance coverage can certainly make certain types of \ncontraception totally unaffordable. As Justice Ginsburg noted in her \ndissent, the upfront cost of an IUD is equivalent to nearly a month's \nwages for a minimum wage worker. In the blue-collar community I live \nin, in working America, a month's wage is a very big deal.\n  Not having insurance coverage equals not having access. Although our \nRepublican colleagues would have you believe otherwise, this dangerous \nprecedent could apply to all sorts of basic, essential health care. \nWhat is to stop a boss from claiming a religious objection to \nvaccinations under the theory espoused in this decision or from access \nto a blood transfusion or to surgery or to HIV and AIDS, because all of \nthose fit the same pattern in that various religions have a strong \nreligious objection to those health care benefits.\n  I am not sure what is more troubling, the path charted by five \nJustices that allows a boss to trump essential personal, preventive \nhealth care choices or the Court's notion that it is okay to single out \nwomen's health care in this decision.\n  The bottom line is this: The bill before us that we would go to on \nthe vote this afternoon, the Murray-Udall bill, is about putting women \nback in charge of their own health care. Women do not want politicians \ninterfering in their health care. They certainly do not want their \nbosses and CEOs interfering in their health care. Bosses belong in the \nboardroom. They do not belong in employees' bedrooms or their exam \nrooms. Let's send a message to all Americans who are watching this \nbody, this great deliberative body today, that the Senate is listening, \nthat we hear the concerns of millions of women across this land and \nthat we are ready to put women back in charge of their own health care \nand get the bosses out of the exam rooms.\n  I urge my colleagues to join in voting yes to open debate on this \nbill.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, whenever any Americans' religious \nliberty is infringed, every American should be concerned. Religious \nliberty is a part of the American character. Before our Constitution \nwas adopted, religious freedom was a part of the American character. It \nwas the reason the first Europeans settled on our shores. It was a \ngreat source of the American Revolution.\n  My Scotch-Irish Presbyterian ancestors came here to escape religious \npersecution from two churches, and when they came here they objected to \npaying taxes to support another church.\n  So our very foundation as a country has in it the guarantees of \nreligious freedom.\n  That is why after the States created our Constitution, the people \ncame back and said: Wait a minute. You forgot something. You forgot the \nBill of Rights.\n  The Bill of Rights begins with guarantees of religious liberty. They \nare emblazoned on the wall at the Newseum at the corner of Pennsylvania \nAvenue and 6th, the guarantees of liberty. They were spoken by \nPresident Roosevelt when he talked about World War II and why we were \nfighting that great war.\n  So whenever any American's religious liberty is trampled upon, every \nAmerican should be concerned.\n  That is why I am so disappointed that Senate Democrats are proposing \nto carve a giant hole out of America's religious freedom.\n  This is very different than what has consistently been the attitude \nin this body. Twenty-one years ago Congress voted to pass the Religious \nFreedom Restoration Act, an act which reflects the American character \nas well as any other act that Congress has passed. It created a very \nhigh hurdle for government to burden a person's religious beliefs.\n  That legislation says that if the government is going to take an \naction that creates a burden on a person's faith, the government must \nprove there is a compelling national interest and that burden must be \nas light as possible.\n  That bill passed nearly unanimously. It became law nearly \nunanimously, with support from many in the Senate today, many on the \nother side of the aisle who are supporting this carve-out for religious \nfreedom.\n  When he signed the bill into law, President Bill Clinton was eloquent \nand said:\n\n       We all have a shared desire here to protect perhaps the \n     most precious of all American liberties, religious freedom.\n\n  President Clinton continues:\n\n       Usually the signing of legislation by a President is a \n     ministerial act, often a quiet ending to a turbulent \n     legislative process. Today this event assumes a more majestic \n     quality because of our ability together to affirm the \n     historic role that people of faith have played in the history \n     of this country and the constitutional protections those who \n     profess and express their faith have always demanded and \n     cherished.\n\n  But here we are debating a Democratic proposal to gut the law \nPresident Clinton was describing and require Americans who own \nbusinesses to provide insurance coverage for any health care item or \nservice that is required by Federal law or regulation, whether or not \nit violates the employer's sincere religious beliefs.\n  So what has changed?\n  On June 30, the Supreme Court of the United States found that the law \nmeant what Congress and the President said it did when it was enacted.\n  They held that the Federal Government could not order the owners of a \nclosely held corporation to violate the basic tenets of their faith. \nThe company in question in this case, Hobby Lobby--and having been a \nlaw student, I know that over time this will be known in law schools \nacross the country as the great case of Hobby Lobby because of its \nimportance and because of its name--is owned by the Green family, who \nmake their faith central to their business. They close their stores\n\n[[Page S4524]]\n\non Sunday. They refuse to engage in profitable transactions that \nfacilitate or promote alcohol use. They contribute profits to Christian \nmissionaries and ministries.\n  No one doubts those are sincerely held religious beliefs. The Green \nfamily offers health insurance which covers 16 of 20 forms of \ncontraception. It does not cover four forms of contraception that \nprevent implantation of the embryo but employees are free to purchase \nthose four forms themselves.\n  The company in no way interferes with its employees' lives. It does \nnot tell them what to do with their bodies. It does not tell them how \nto live their lives. It simply does not offer in the company's \ninsurance plan, coverage for the four forms of contraception that \nviolate the faith of the owners of the business.\n  Obamacare regulations tried to mandate 20 forms of contraception, but \nrecognizing this violated the beliefs of those who believe in life at \nconception, they created a carve-out for several organizations, \nCatholic hospitals for example. They could have created a similar \ncarve-out for closely held companies, but they did not.\n  Instead, the Green family and others were forced to defend their \nfreedoms in court, which fortunately ruled that the family was entitled \nto protection from the government's mandates under the Religious \nFreedom Restoration Act. This ought to have been a victory for everyone \nif it is true in our country that when any American's religious freedom \nis upheld, all of us benefit.\n  In 1993, the passage of the legislation was hailed as a momentous \nachievement of religious freedom. The New York Times editorialized in \nsupport of it. My friend Senator Reid from Nevada--now the majority \nleader--said:\n\n       I am proud to be a cosponsor of this important legislation. \n     I congratulate the authors and the committee for creating a \n     fine bill.\n\n  The distinguished Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer--then a Member \nof the House and the lead Democratic sponsor--said: ``This is a good \nmoment for those of us who believe in the flower of religious freedom \nthat so adorns America. . . . ''\n  But here we are debating a bill that would fundamentally undermine \nthat very act spoken of so eloquently by the Democratic leaders of \nCongress and by the Democratic President of the United States.\n  What has changed? If they are successful, an American who opens a \nbusiness in this country will know that he or she will forfeit their \nright to religious freedom. That is not consistent with the American \ncharacter. That is not the American way.\n  Why would Democrats who felt so strongly about this in 1993 feel so \ndifferently today? Why would they be willing to do such damage to the \ncause of religious freedom they so ardently proclaim? Because the \nDemocrats ``believe they have a powerful campaign weapon'' in this \nissue, according to a report in Politico.\n  The Democrats charge that under the Supreme Court decision, an \nemployer's personal views can interfere with women's access to \nessential health care services.\n  They say that under this decision corporations can limit their \nemployees' health care options and restrict their freedoms. That is not \ntrue. It is patently false. It is absurd. It is wrong.\n  In the words of the Washington Post's nonpartisan Fact Checker Glenn \nKessler:\n\n       Nothing in the ruling allows a company to stop a woman from \n     getting or filling a prescription for contraceptives . . .\n\n  Second, the Fact Checker says:\n\n       Democrats need to be more careful in their language about \n     the ruling. All too often, lawmakers leap to conclusions that \n     are not warranted by the facts at hand. Simply put, the court \n     ruling does not outlaw contraceptives, does not allow bosses \n     to prevent women from seeking birth control and does not take \n     away a person's religious freedom.\n\n  Today, women have the same rights they did before Obamacare--at least \nin terms of religious freedom. The Supreme Court decision did nothing \nto change or alter a woman's ability to access birth control or other \ncontraceptive care.\n  Hobby Lobby's insurance today already covers 16 of 20 forms of \ncontraception for the company's employees. A Hobby Lobby employee who \nwishes to use a drug or device not covered by the company's insurance \nis in no way prohibited from purchasing it. Nothing in the Hobby Lobby \ndecision prevents a woman from making her own decisions about \ncontraception. The only effect of the decision is that certain \nemployers cannot be forced to include it in their insurance coverage \nagainst their religious objections.\n  The Supreme Court decision covered certain closely held, for-profit \ncompanies--meaning they are controlled by five or fewer individuals--\nwhere the owners have sincere religious beliefs. The Court's decision \ndoes not mean all Americans of faith who own businesses and ask for \nreligious exemption from a general law will receive that exemption.\n  The Court's decision does not mean employers will be able to use the \nReligious Freedom Restoration Act as a reason to refuse to cover \ncritical health services, such as vaccines, blood transfusions, and HIV \ntreatment. In fact, such fears were raised by opponents of the \nReligious Freedom Restoration Act before it became law in 1993. The \nDemocrats didn't believe those objections then, and they shouldn't \nbelieve them now because 21 years later these doomsday predictions have \nnot come true. Courts are well-equipped to dispel spurious or frivolous \nclaims.\n  I think the Democrats know all of this. I think they are just trying \nto win an election.\n  This Supreme Court decision was about individual freedoms that do not \ndisappear if you decide to open a business. It was not about \ncontraceptive rights.\n  What is really happening is my friends on the other side of the aisle \nare trying to change the subject. They want to talk about health care, \nbut they don't want to talk about Obamacare and what it is doing to the \nwomen of this country. Let me tell a story that gives an example of \nwhat it is that really concerns me.\n  First, what concerns me is the destruction of anyone's religious \nfreedom.\n  While we are talking about women and health care, let me talk about \nEmilie of Lawrenceburg, TN. She is 39 years old. She came to see me. \nShe has lupus. Under Tennessee's laws, she had an insurance policy \ngranted by something called CoverTN. It was created by our then-\nDemocratic Governor and Blue Cross. It gave her the policy she needed \nat a cost of about $50 a month. When Obamacare arrived, it canceled \nEmilie's policy. She went on the exchange to try to replace it, \naccording to Washington's wisdom.\n  This is Emilie. This is a real woman in Tennessee who is really hurt \nby the Obamacare law. We should be talking about her. This is what she \nwrote to me:\n\n       I cannot keep my current plan because it doesn't meet the \n     standards of coverage. This alone is a travesty. CoverTN has \n     been a lifeline [for me]. . . . With the discontinuation of \n     CoverTN, I am being forced to purchase a plan through the \n     Exchange. . . . My insurance premiums alone will increase a \n     staggering 410 percent. My out-of-pocket expenses will \n     increase by more than $6,000 a year--that includes subsidies. \n     Please help me understand how this is ``affordable.''\n\n  Here is an American woman who has been hurt by ObamaCare. She lost \nher policy--a policy that she could afford, that fit her health care \nneeds and her budget--but all of the wise people in Washington said: \nThis is the policy you need. So she got the policy Obamacare says she \nshould have, and her insurance premiums went up to approximately $400 a \nmonth, and she got an insurance policy that does not fit her budget and \ndoes not fit her health care needs. She is the one who has been hurt.\n  Unfortunately, Emilie is not the only one experiencing rate shock. \nMillions of Americans are losing their insurance plans. They are being \nforced to buy new plans, many of them with higher premiums, many with \nhigher deductibles, many of them with coinsurance.\n  Let me talk about a Tennessee woman whose name is Carol, a single mom \nwith a son starting at Austin Peay University in the fall. She is an \noffice administrator in an office that used to have CoverTN insurance \nthat cost less than $100 a month in premiums and covered all of her \nhealth care needs. Carol said:\n\n       Now, thanks to Obamacare, I must pay over $300 per month \n     [compared to $100 a month] in insurance premiums for a policy \n     that has a $2,500 deductible and a $4,000 out of pocket \n     limit.\n\n\n[[Page S4525]]\n\n\n  If we want to talk about a war on women, let's talk about the war on \nEmilie and Carol in Tennessee and millions of other women who are hurt \nby ObamaCare. Carol earns too much to qualify for a subsidy, so now she \nputs a big chunk of her income toward her premiums--such a big chunk \nthat now she can't afford to help pay for her son's education.\n\n  These are the kinds of stories all of us hear from people who are \nbeing harmed by Obamacare. These are the kinds of stories our friends \non the other side don't want repeated, so they even go so far as to \nbring up carving big chunks out of America's character by trampling on \nreligious freedom--the freedom that is talked about in the First \nAmendment.\n  We have proposals to help Americans like Carol and Americans like \nEmilie. We have offered them on the Senate floor repeatedly since 2010 \nwhen the ObamaCare law was passed. They would move our country in a \ndifferent direction toward health care as rapidly and as responsibly as \nwe could go--a direction toward more freedom, more choices, and lower \ncosts for Emilie and Carol and for millions of women and millions of \nmen and millions of younger people across this country.\n  Our bills would allow Americans to keep more of their insurance \nplans, as the President promised.\n  Our bills would allow people to buy insurance in another State if it \nfits their budget and fits their needs. Let's say Emilie, who has \nlupus, finds a policy regulated in Kentucky that fits her budget and \nfits her needs. We would allow Emilie to buy that.\n  We would allow small business employers to combine purchasing power \nwith other employers and offer their employees lower cost insurance. \nMore freedom, more choices, lower costs.\n  We would allow Americans to buy a major medical plan to insure \nthemselves against a catastrophe--today, some Americans can, but under \nObamacare all Americans cannot--buy a major medical plan to insure \nagainst catastrophe--that is what a lot Americans would like to do--and \nthen open a health savings account that is expanded to pay for everyday \nhealth expenses. More freedom, more choices, lower costs.\n  We would like to repair the damage Obamacare has done. We would like \nto prevent future damage. Republicans want to move in a different \ndirection that provides more freedom, more choices, lower costs. We \ntrust Americans to make decisions for themselves. That is the American \nway. That is what we believe in. Religious freedom and health care \nfreedom--that is the American way.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record the article from the Washington Post by the Fact Checker.\n  In addition, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an \nexcellent editorial today in the Wall Street Journal, an op-ed by two \nof my colleagues, the Senator from New Hampshire and the Senator from \nNebraska, Senators Ayotte and Fischer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        [From The Washington Post--Fact Checker, July 14, 2014]\n\n  Democrats on Hobby Lobby: ``Misspeaks'' ``Opinion'' and Overheated \n                                Rhetoric\n\n                           (By Glenn Kessler)\n\n       ``Really, we should be afraid of this court. The five guys \n     who start determining what contraceptions are legal. Let's \n     not even go there.''--Houe Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-\n     Calif.), at her weekly news conference, on July 10\n       In the wake of the Supreme Court's 5-to-4 ruling that, as a \n     closely held company, Hobby Lobby was not required to pay for \n     all of the birth-control procedures mandated by the \n     Affordable Care Act, Democrats have rushed to condemn the \n     court. But in some cases the rhetoric has gotten way ahead of \n     the facts.\n       Here's a round-up of some of the more noteworthy claims. In \n     some cases, lawmakers concede that they make a mistake; in \n     others, they are argue that they are offering what amounts to \n     opinion, even though the assertion was stated as fact.\n       Statements on Supreme Court cases are notoriously difficult \n     to fact check because rulings are open to interpretation--and \n     the full impact is often difficult to judge until lower \n     courts begin to react to the ruling. Both Democrats and \n     Republicans use adverse Supreme Court rulings to rally their \n     respective bases, but lawmakers have a responsibility not to \n     succumb to overheated and inaccurate rhetoric.\n       Nothing in the ruling allows a company to stop a woman from \n     getting or filling a prescription for contraceptives, but \n     that salient fact is often lost as lawmakers jump to \n     conclusions that the cost will be prohibitive. That may or \n     may not be the case depending on circumstances. Moreover, it \n     is worth remembering that when the Affordable Care Act was \n     passed, 28 states already had laws or regulations that \n     promote insurance coverage for contraception. The law sought \n     to extend that across the country--and even with this ruling, \n     that will remain the case for the vast majority of workers.\n       ``Really, we should be afraid of this court. The five guys \n     who start determining what contraceptions are legal. Let's \n     not even go there.''--Pelosi\n       This is a very odd statement from the House Democratic \n     leader, given that the majority opinion flatly states that \n     ``under our cases, women (and men) have a constitutional \n     right to obtain contraceptives,'' citing the 1965 ruling in \n     Griswold v. Connecticut, which under the right to privacy \n     nullified a law prohibiting the use of contraceptives.\n       Drew Hammill, Pelosi's spokesman, acknowledged that she \n     ``misspoke.'' ``Obviously the impact of the court's decision \n     is not to make these four contraceptive methods illegal--i.e. \n     no longer allowed to be sold'', he said. ``But the overriding \n     point here is that the decision does in fact limit access, \n     which is the key point Pelosi made.''\n       Hammill cited Justice Ruth Ginsburg's dissent that women \n     have a compelling interest in being able to plan their \n     pregnancies and that they need reliable birth control.\n       Later, in the same news conference, Pelosi decried that \n     ``five men could get down to specifics of whether a woman \n     should use a diaphragm and she should pay for it herself or \n     her boss.''\n       Hobby Lobby involved the owners' objection to four types of \n     birth control but not diaphragms, but here Pelosi adhered \n     closer to the essence of the case (and a related temporary \n     injunction the court awarded to Wheaton College): the \n     question of who should pay for contraceptives. (The court \n     also vacated a decision by an appeals court that had ruled \n     against a Michigan company that objected to providing any \n     contraceptives under its employee health plan, so that would \n     include diaphragms.)\n       Ginsburg's dissent pointed out that it costs $1,000 for the \n     office visit and insertion procedure for intrauterine devices \n     (IUDs)--``nearly the equivalent to a month's full-time pay \n     for workers earning the minimum wage.''\n       Our colleagues at PolitiFact gave Pelosi a rating of \n     ``false'' for her comments, and we certainly agree, though we \n     generally do not award Pinocchios when politicians fess up to \n     a mistake.\n       Still, we note that despite her office's admission of a \n     mistake, the transcript of the news conference had not yet \n     been corrected three days later. ``It will be,'' Hammill \n     said. ``We're migrating to a new site in the next two weeks, \n     so everything is a little slow.''\n       ``The one thing we are going to do during this work period, \n     sooner rather than later, is to ensure that women's lives are \n     not determined by virtue of five white men. This Hobby Lobby \n     decision is outrageous, and we are going to do something \n     about it.''--Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), \n     remarks to reporters, on July 8\n       The Hobby Lobby decision was written by Justice Samuel \n     Alito, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices \n     Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy and Clarence Thomas. That's \n     certainly five men, but Thomas is African American.\n       ``That was a mistake, and he knew it right away,'' \n     spokesman Adam Jentleson said. He noted that on other \n     occasions Reid has simply said ``five men.'' (The four \n     dissenters included three women.)\n       ``This is deeply troubling because you have organized \n     religions that oppose health care, period. So if you have an \n     employer who is a member of an organized religion and they \n     decide, you know, I wouldn't provide health care to my own \n     family because I object religiously, I'm not going to allow \n     any kind of health-care treatment.''--Rep. Debbie Wasserman \n     Schultz (Fla.), Democratic National Committee chair, \n     appearing on MSNBC, June 30\n       While there are some religions that object to certain \n     medical procedures, Wasserman Schultz goes to quite an \n     extreme to suggest that employers could block an employee \n     from seeking any kind of health-care treatment. (Again, the \n     issue was who would pay for contraceptives, not whether \n     someone was barred from getting contraceptives.)\n       ``The Chair was referring to the Justice's ruling which \n     puts employers' religious beliefs ahead of the medical needs \n     of employees,'' spokesman Michael Czin said. ``We \n     fundamentally disagree with the logic behind that ruling.''\n       ``[In Griswold v. Connecticut,] the Supreme Court said that \n     the right of privacy of individuals and families trumped any \n     state right to ban contraceptives. It was a breakthrough. \n     They found privacy, at least the inference of privacy, in the \n     Constitution. I\n\n[[Page S4526]]\n\n     asked that question repeatedly of Justice Roberts and Justice \n     Alito to make sure that they would honor that same tradition \n     of privacy. The Hobby Lobby decision violates that \n     fundamental premise. [While both justices were careful in \n     their answers before confirmation,] they both said they stood \n     by the Griswold decision.''--Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), \n     quoted in ABC's ``The Note,'' July 10\n       Durbin serves on the Judiciary Committee and is the second-\n     ranking Democrat on the Senate. Here, he appears to come \n     close to saying what Pelosi asserted--that the ruling \n     signaled a possible ban on contraceptives. He specifically \n     mentions the Griswold decision, which as we noted was cited \n     by Alito in the majority opinion as settled law.\n       But a Durbin spokeswoman said he was not trying to say the \n     court was on a path to overturn Griswold. ``He was saying \n     Hobby Lobby was out of line with the general `tradition of \n     privacy' that permitted women to make their own choices about \n     birth control,'' she said, asking not to be identified. ``He \n     was critiquing this ruling and its impact on women's access \n     to contraceptive coverage, not making a prediction about \n     future cases.''\n       ``The U.S. Supreme Court's Hobby Lobby decision opened the \n     door to unprecedented corporate intrusion into our private \n     lives. Coloradans understand that women should never have to \n     ask their bosses for a permission slip to access common forms \n     of birth control.''--Sen. Mark Udall (D-Colo.), in a news \n     release, July 9\n       Udall's remarks were contained in a news release he issued \n     with Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) about a bill that seeks to \n     overturn the Hobby Lobby decision. There is a bit of an irony \n     here: Udall voted for the Affordable Care Act, which built \n     upon the employer-based health-care system in the United \n     States and thus led to a ruling by the Supreme Court in the \n     first place. So it's a chicken-or-egg question about how the \n     door was opened in the first place.\n       Again, the issue is not whether women will have access to \n     birth control, but whether the health plan will cover the \n     cost. Spokesman Mike Saccone argues that this is, in effect, \n     ``a permission slip.''\n       ``Following the court's decision, women will need to \n     effectively ask their employers if they will continue to \n     cover contraception,'' Saccone said. ``They will need to \n     determine if their boss will give permission for their \n     insurance plans to cover birth control.''\n       He added: ``Without insurance coverage, IUDs (what Hobby \n     Lobby objects to covering) cost up to $1,000, which poses a \n     huge barrier for women, especially if she is making the \n     minimum wage. Without her boss's permission to get coverage \n     for that service in her health plan, it becomes much more--\n     potentially prohibitively--expensive for that woman.''\n       ``Before the Hobby Lobby decision, the fight against \n     corporate influence was mainly about making sure real people \n     and their ideas were in charge of elections. But now it is no \n     longer just about a democracy; it is about keeping \n     corporations out of our private lives, out of our bedrooms, \n     and out of our religious decisions.''--Sen. Jon Tester (D-\n     Mont.), statement in the Congressional Record, July 10\n       Here again, a lawmaker mixes up the question of paying for \n     contraceptives with a broader prohibition against all \n     contraceptives.\n       ``If an employer doesn't cover contraceptive care, for many \n     women access to birth control is effectively blocked because \n     it becomes cost-prohibitive,'' argued spokesman Dan Malessa. \n     ``If an employer refuses to cover contraceptives based on its \n     religious views, then its religious views trump the religious \n     views of its employees.''\n       ``You know, what I am objecting to is that these bosses \n     should not be able to tell their employees that they cannot \n     use birth control. Motherhood is not a hobby. That is what I \n     am objecting to.''--Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Wisc.), speaking on \n     MSNBC, July 1\n       Moore also falls into the trap of claiming that corporate \n     bosses can now dictate whether women can have access to birth \n     control. No boss under this ruling has the right to tell an \n     employee that they cannot use birth control. That's simply \n     wrong, but Moore's spokeswoman argued this is open to \n     interpretation.\n       ``Congresswoman Moore was referring to the Supreme Court \n     decision that now allows certain employers to deny \n     contraceptive coverage to their employees through employer-\n     sponsored health care plans. By denying this coverage to \n     their employees, many workers may not have the financial \n     means to access this health care necessity,'' spokeswoman \n     Staci Moore said. ``To your point on the Hobby Lobby decision \n     concerning only certain forms of contraceptive coverage, the \n     congresswoman would argue that the ruling opens the door for \n     employers to challenge other vital health-care coverage, not \n     limited to the four contraceptives you mentioned.''\n       ``What they've done, Chris, is taken away the religious \n     freedom of their employees. They have to comply with the \n     religious freedom of their employers.''--Rep. Louise \n     Slaughter (D-N.Y.), interview on MSNBC, June 30\n       Is Slaughter really saying that the court has taken away an \n     employee's religious freedom because some contraceptives may \n     not be covered by insurance? Eric Walker, her spokesman, says \n     this is a matter of opinion.\n       ``By forcing an employee to live with the religious choices \n     imposed on them by their employer, the employee's own \n     religious freedom is infringed upon,'' Walker said. ``I think \n     it's fair to say that `freedom from religion' goes hand in \n     hand with `religious freedom.' The first amendment protects \n     Americans from having religion thrust upon them by others--a \n     standard the court failed to uphold, in the congresswoman's \n     opinion.''\n\n\n                           The Pinocchio Test\n\n       The Fact Checker generally does not award Pinocchios for \n     ``misspeaking'' or for statements of opinion. And we \n     obviously take no position on the Supreme Court opinion. But \n     this collection of rhetoric suggests that Democrats need to \n     be more careful in their language about the ruling. All too \n     often, lawmakers leap to conclusions that are not warranted \n     by the facts at hand. Simply put, the court ruling does not \n     outlaw contraceptives, does not allow bosses to prevent women \n     from seeking birth control and does not take away a person's \n     religious freedom.\n       Certainly, a case can be made that perhaps this is a \n     slippery slope (as Ginsburg argues in dissent) or that the \n     cost of some contraceptives may be prohibitively high for \n     some women who need them. But the rhetoric needs to be firmly \n     rooted in these objections--and in many cases the Democratic \n     response has been untethered from those basis facts.\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From The Wall Street Journal, July 16, 2014]\n\n              The Hobby Lobby Decision and Its Distortions\n\n\n  Nothing in the Supreme Court's recent ruling denies women access to \n                             birth control.\n\n                   (By Kelly Ayotte and Deb Fischer)\n\n       In the days since the Supreme Court's June 30 Burwell v. \n     Hobby Lobby decision, we have been troubled by those who seem \n     eager to misrepresent both the facts of the case and the \n     impact of its ruling on women--all to divide Americans and \n     score political points in a tough election year.\n       The biggest distortion: the #NotMyBossBusiness campaign on \n     which falsely suggests that under the ruling employers can \n     deny their employees access to birth control.\n       That's flat-out false. Nothing in the Hobby Lobby ruling \n     stops a woman from getting or filling a prescription for any \n     form of contraception. Those who distort the court's decision \n     insist that one cannot support religious liberty and also \n     support access to safe, affordable birth control. But these \n     are principles that we, and millions of others, support. \n     Americans believe strongly that we should be able to practice \n     our religion without undue interference from the government. \n     It's a fundamental conviction that goes to the very core of \n     our character--and dates back to the founding of our nation. \n     The Supreme Court's decision in the Hobby Lobby case, which \n     protects rights of conscience, reaffirmed our centuries-old \n     tradition of religious liberty.\n       Contrary to the misleading rhetoric, the Hobby Lobby ruling \n     does not take away women's access to birth control. No \n     employee is prohibited from purchasing any Food and Drug \n     Administration approved drug or device, and contraception \n     remains readily available and accessible for all women \n     nationwide. According to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll, \n     prior to ObamaCare over 85% of large businesses already \n     offered contraceptive coverage to their employees. And the \n     ObamaCare mandate under review in the case doesn't even apply \n     to businesses with fewer than 50 employees. For lower-income \n     women, there are five programs at the U.S. Department of \n     Health and Human Services that help ensure access to \n     contraception for women, including Medicaid.\n       The court's decision applies to businesses whose owners \n     have genuine religious convictions. In the Hobby Lobby case, \n     the company's owners--the Green family--offered health-care \n     plans that provide coverage for 16 of the 20 FDA-approved \n     contraceptive drugs and devices, including birth-control \n     pills, required under the Affordable Care Act.\n       The Greens only had moral objections to the remaining four \n     methods, which they consider to be abortifacients. The family \n     felt strongly that paying for insurance that includes these \n     methods would compromise their deeply held religious belief \n     that life begins at conception.\n       In its narrow ruling, the court agreed, basing its decision \n     on the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, which was \n     introduced in the Senate by the late Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., \n     Mass.) and in the House by then-Congressman Charles Schumer \n     (D., N.Y.), and supported by over a dozen current Democratic \n     senators, Vice President Joe Biden, and Secretary of State \n     John Kerry.\n       Kennedy and Mr. Schumer sponsored this bipartisan law in \n     the aftermath of the Supreme Court's 1990 decision in \n     Employment Division v. Smith, which held that ``generally \n     applicable laws'' that have nothing to do with religion could \n     effectively prevent Americans from fully exercising their \n     religious rights.\n       The Religious Freedom Restoration Act passed the \n     Democratic-controlled House by voice vote and was approved by \n     the Democratic-controlled Senate in an overwhelming vote of \n     97 to 3.\n       When President Clinton signed the bill, he said: ``What \n     this law basically says is that the government should be held \n     to a very high level of proof before it interferes with \n     someone's free exercise of religion.''\n\n[[Page S4527]]\n\n       In the Hobby Lobby decision, the Supreme Court ruled that \n     the government failed to make that case.\n       With misinformation now swirling, it's important to \n     understand what the court's decision doesn't mean.\n       The court's majority opinion explicitly states that the \n     ruling does not ``provide a shield for employers who might \n     cloak illegal discrimination as a religious practice.'' \n     Additionally, the court said that ``our decision should not \n     be understood to hold that an insurance-coverage mandate must \n     necessarily fall if it conflicts with an employer's religious \n     beliefs''--meaning, you must show a legitimate religious \n     objection.\n       While some Americans may disagree with the Green family's \n     views, nearly all Americans believe that religious freedom is \n     a fundamental right that must not be abridged. When President \n     Clinton signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, he \n     said: ``Our laws and institutions should not impede or \n     hinder, but rather should protect and preserve fundamental \n     religious liberties.''\n       Congressional Democrats used to share that view. What's \n     changed? We can preserve access to contraceptives without \n     trampling on Americans' religious freedom.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I rise to speak in support of the \nnomination of Ronnie White to serve on the U.S. District Court for the \nEastern District of Missouri. I was proud to chair Justice White's \nnomination hearing before the Judiciary Committee in May.\n  Justice White has the experience, the integrity, and the \nqualifications to be an outstanding district court judge.\n  He came from humble beginnings. He was born in St. Louis to teenage \nparents and grew up poor in a segregated neighborhood. He has worked \nsince age 11 to help make ends meet and to put himself through college \nat St. Louis University and law school at the University of Missouri-\nKansas City.\n  Justice White went on to accomplish great things in his legal \ncareer--most notably, becoming the first African-American Supreme Court \nJustice and Chief Justice in Missouri's history. It was a powerful \nmoment when Justice White was sworn in to the Missouri Supreme Court. \nThe ceremony took place at a courthouse where slaves were once sold on \nthe steps.\n  I am pleased that the Senate is voting today on Justice White's \nnomination to the Federal bench.\n  It is not often that the Senate gets the chance to correct a historic \nmistake, But by confirming Ronnie White to the Federal bench, we will \nbe able to do so.\n  Justice White's previous nomination to the district court was \ndefeated on the Senate floor in 1999 on a partyline vote. At the time, \nthe claim was made that Justice White was ``pro-criminal.'' This was a \ngrossly inaccurate claim, both then and now.\n  Over his long career as an attorney and a judge, Justice White has \nbeen widely recognized as fair, unbiased, and committed to the rule of \nlaw. Just read the letter from the Missouri State Lodge of the \nFraternal Order of Police in support of Justice White's nomination. The \nMissouri FOP said:\n\n       As front line law enforcement officers, we recognize the \n     important need to have jurists such as Ronnie White, who have \n     shown themselves to be tough on crime, yet fair and \n     impartial. As a former justice on the Missouri Court of \n     Appeals and as the Chief Justice of the Missouri Supreme \n     Court, Ronnie White has proven that he has the experience and \n     requisite attributes to be a quality addition to the U.S. \n     District Court. We can think of no finer or more worthy \n     nominee.\n\n  This is a compelling endorsement from the Missouri FOP.\n  In 2001 I had the opportunity to ask Justice White in a hearing \nbefore the Judiciary Committee about the allegation that he was somehow \nhostile to law enforcement. Here was his response. He said:\n\n       That is not true that I was opposed to law enforcement. \n     Senator Durbin, I have a brother-in-law who is a police \n     officer in St. Louis. I have a cousin who is a police officer \n     in St. Louis. I have served on boards and commissions with \n     police officers in the St. Louis community, and I also, when \n     I was city counselor for the city of St. Louis, was the \n     lawyer for the St. Louis City Police Department and we \n     defended police officers. As a judge, all I have tried to do \n     is to apply the law as best I could and the way I saw it.\n\n  Overall, Justice White's track record shows that his judicial \ndecisions were well within the legal mainstream and were supported by \nprecedent and legal authority. His decisions showed respect for the \nrule of law, even in hard cases that involved difficult or emotional \nfacts.\n  The bottom line is that Justice White is a man with integrity, a \nwealth of judicial experience, and a real respect for the law. He is \ngoing to be an outstanding Federal judge.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this nomination and to put this good \nman on the Federal bench.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of \nRonnie White to serve as a United States District Judge for the Eastern \nDistrict of Missouri.\n  In the Senate, as in life, there rarely is a chance for a do-over--to \nget something right that went wrong a long time ago.\n  For me, Ronnie White's nomination is a chance to do that. This year \nshould have been his fifteenth as a district court judge--he would be \nclose to senior status today had his nomination by President Clinton \nbeen confirmed in 1999.\n  I was very pleased this year to see him appear once again before the \nJudiciary Committee, and I believe he will distinguish himself as a \nFederal district judge.\n  Let me simply quote from a letter from the Missouri State Lodge of \nthe Fraternal Order of Police, which wrote a letter on May 13, 2014 in \nsupport of Judge White's nomination:\n\n       As a former justice on the Missouri Court of Appeals and as \n     the Chief Justice of the Missouri Supreme Court, Ronnie White \n     has proven that he has the experience and requisite \n     attributes to be a quality addition to the U.S. District \n     Court. We can think of no finer or more worthy nominee.\n\n  Ronnie White's confirmation is long past due, and I really am pleased \nit is likely to come to pass. I just wanted to say that, and to urge my \ncolleagues to support him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the confirmation of the nomination of Ronnie L. White, of \nMissouri, to be United States District Court Judge for the Eastern \nDistrict of Missouri?\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 2578.\n  Under the previous order, the time until 2 p.m. will be equally \ndivided and controlled between the two leaders or their designees.\n  Who yields time? Does any Senator yield time?\n  If no one yields time, the time will be charged equally to both \nsides.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, the most extraordinary feature of the bill \nbefore us today is the incongruity between the bill's title and its \ncontent. The title, the ``Protect Women's Health from Corporate \nInterference Act,'' is clear and straightforward. It suggests the bill \nis aimed at the important and worthy goal of protecting women's health. \nBut the text of the bill plainly demonstrates that the bill's true \nobjective is to circumscribe Americans' religious freedoms--the \nreligious liberties of individual Americans--within the narrow confines \nof the Democratic Party's partisan agenda and the whims of politicians \nand bureaucrats.\n  While maintaining the appearance of preserving all of the current \nlegal protections of religious freedom in America today, this proposal \nquietly adds to them a subtle yet deeply problematic and inappropriate \nqualification. The Federal Government will not prohibit the free \nexercise of religion until the Federal Government decides that it wants \nto do so. Under this bill, your religious liberties stop at the \ndoorstep of the Democratic National Committee.\n  So I rise today in opposition to this bill because it doesn't do \nanything to protect women's health and it does much to undermine the \nbulwarks of religious liberty enshrined in our Constitution that have \nmade America the most religiously diverse and tolerant Nation in human \nhistory.\n  Although this proposal is only the latest maneuver attempted by my \nDemocratic colleagues to assert their power and restrict religious \nfreedom in America, it also represents the culmination, at least for \nnow, of their opposition to the Supreme Court's recent ruling in \nBurwell v. Hobby Lobby.\n  On June 30 of this year, the Supreme Court ruled that the Federal \nGovernment may not force closely held businesses to violate their \nsincerely held religious beliefs in order to comply with the \ncontraceptive mandate issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human \nServices under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. This \ndecision has received a great deal of attention, but it has received \nthis attention for all the wrong reasons.\n  Contrary to what many critics have suggested, the Hobby Lobby \ndecision did not promulgate national health care policy nor did it \nrender any opinion on the virtues of contraception and religious faith. \nNo, the issue in Hobby Lobby involved not a dispute of competing rights \nbut a straightforward application of plainly written law.\n  As the Constitution states in Article III, Section 2, the role of the \nSupreme Court is to adjudicate legal disputes by hearing ``cases and \ncontroversies'' that arise when two laws or two parties come into \nconflict.\n  In Hobby Lobby, the two laws in dispute were the Religious Freedom \nRestoration Act, passed by an overwhelming bipartisan majority of \nCongress and signed into law by President Clinton in 1993, and a \nFederal mandate issued by the Department of Health and Human Services, \nacting under the powers delegated to it by the Affordable Care Act.\n  The Religious Freedom Restoration Act, or RFRA as it is sometimes \ncalled, reaffirmed Americans' commitment to the fundamental religious \nliberty already protected by our Constitution.\n  With RFRA, a Democratic Congress and a Democratic President, in \ncooperation with Republican minorities in both Houses, declared that \nwhen the Federal Government seeks to infringe on Americans' religious \nliberty, it must clear two thresholds. First, it must show that the law \nin question serves a compelling State interest. Secondly, if it does, \nthe law must do so by the least restrictive means possible.\n  Given that the government openly acknowledged that there was a \nsignificant number of far less intrusive means to ensure affordable \naccess to the drugs at issue, the Supreme Court rightly ruled that the \ncontraception mandate violated RFRA.\n  However unwarranted, the overheated response to the Hobby Lobby \ndecision among some ideological extremists on the left has led some of \nmy colleagues to introduce a bill that would not simply overturn that \nmodest and narrow decision but fundamentally rewrite America's social \ncontract as it pertains to matters of personal conscience.\n  Whereas, the Court's ruling was limited to ``closely held'' for-\nprofit companies such as Hobby Lobby, this bill would empower the \nFederal Government to coerce employers of all faiths and of no faith \ninto violating their deepest personal convictions. It would deny any \nemployer--devout or secular, individual or corporate, for-profit or \nnonprofit--conscience protection under RFRA against all present and \nfuture government mandates.\n  Perhaps most troubling is the warped theory of rights underlying the \ntext of this bill. This theory holds that the American people possess \nconstitutional and legal rights only when acting alone but not when \nacting in a group. These rights, along with any duties one may hold as \na person of faith, must be forfeited whenever acting in association \nwith others, on penalty of fines to be paid to the Federal Government.\n  This view of religious liberty might be summarized as an amendment to \nMatthew, chapter 18, verse 20: For where two or three are gathered \ntogether in My Name, there is the IRS in the midst of them.\n  This view is extreme. It is out of touch with the Constitution, with \ncommonsense, and with America's heroic history of religious tolerance.\n  From our earliest days as a country, one of the sources of our \nstrength as a people and one of the reasons for our success as a nation \nhas been our robust understanding of religious liberty. The breadth and \ndepth of that conception has allowed and encouraged people of all \nfaiths and all traditions to live here in friendship and in cooperation \nwith one another.\n  As two members of the U.S. Commission on International Religious \nFreedom put it:\n\n       . . . respect for the flourishing of people requires \n     respect for their freedom--as individuals and together with \n     others in community--to address the deepest questions of \n     human existence and meaning. This allows them to lead lives \n     of authenticity and integrity by fulfilling what they \n     conscientiously believe to be their religious and moral \n     duties. . . . It also includes the right to witness to one's \n     beliefs in public as well as private, and to act--while \n     respecting the equal right of others to do the same--on one's \n     religiously inspired convictions in carrying out the duties \n     of citizenship.\n\n  Expanding as wide as possible the space in which all people can \nwitness their faith alongside one another has for two centuries \nelevated, enriched, and united American society. This robust conception \nof religious liberty was so essential to American unity that not only \ndid the Founding generation reinforce its protection in a Bill of \nRights--which many Framers actually thought was redundant--but it was \nthe first freedom articulated in the First Amendment.\n  They understood, as most Americans still do, that the proper role of \ngovernment is not to define people's happiness but to protect all \nindividuals' equal rights, to pursue happiness according to their own \nhopes and values and conscience.\n  Yet for all its legal and constitutional protections, America's \nexceptional tradition of religious toleration rests ultimately on the \nuniquely American principle of equal dignity and respect for all women \nand all men, not simply as ``fellow passengers en route to the grave'' \nbut as fellow pilgrims in search of their own promised land.\n  The authors of this bill know all of this. They know the American \npeople reject their intolerance of diversity and indifference to the \nFirst Amendment. We know their bill cannot become law. Indeed, we know \nthis for a fact because if the regulations they support were actually \nwritten in the law, ObamaCare itself would never have passed. It was \nslipped in after the fact by bureaucrats who are not subject to public \naccountability and never stand for election.\n  This legislation is more than an insult to the people it would \ntarget; it is\n\n[[Page S4529]]\n\nan embarrassment to the party leadership that has embraced it.\n  I still hold fast to that principle and to the freedom it preserves \nand thus strongly urge my colleagues to vote against this bill.\n  Thank you.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, we are entering into a new era in which \nfive men in the Supreme Court are going to get to make the decisions \nabout what kind of health care you get as a matter of right, living \nunder the protection of the laws of the United States, and what kind of \nhealth care you get as an employee, at the whim of the decisions made \nby your boss.\n  These are the kinds of decisions that your boss should be making: \ndecisions about the direction of your company, decisions about the \nlevel of your salary, about new products that your business is going to \noffer.\n  This should not be your boss's decision. It should not be up to your \nboss as to whether you as a female employee get access to prescription \ncontraceptives. But that is the world we live in today after the \nSupreme Court, in a 5-to-4 decision, has given the power to particular \nemployers to deny women access to prescription birth control.\n  Prescription birth control, contraception, is used by 99 percent of \nwomen in this country at one point over their life. A big portion of \nthose prescriptions are actually for purposes related to complicated \nmedical treatments such as cancer therapy. No matter how the Supreme \nCourt tries to explain this, there is no way to effectively \ndifferentiate what the Supreme Court has done on birth control with a \nwhole other range of potential discrimination.\n  As Justice Ginsburg said in her dissent, this exemption the Supreme \nCourt has given for employers' religious beliefs would extend logically \nwith religiously grounded objections to blood transfusions held by \nJehovah's Witnesses; to religious objections to antidepressants held by \nScientologists; medications derived from pigs, including anesthesia, \nintravenous fluids, and pills coated with gelatin held by certain \nreligions; and even vaccinations, a belief held by Christian \nScientists, amongst others.\n  The idea that the Supreme Court is now going to get into the business \nof micromanaging which particular religious beliefs they are going to \nprotect and which ones they are not going to protect is unacceptable to \nthe majority of people I represent, so that is why I am here today to \nsupport the Protect Women's Health from Corporate Interference Act. \nPretty simple. All we are saying here is that employers should not be \nallowed to refuse health coverage that is guaranteed to their employees \nand their dependents under Federal law.\n  When we decide to pass a law with the majority of the House and the \nSenate agreeing to it, signed by the President, those protections \nshould be available to all employees. It is not easy to pass a law and \nget it signed by the President. The Senate has already set up a lot of \npretty significant barriers to the passage of any law, never mind a law \nthat guarantees a certain level of health care coverage.\n  Until the Hobby Lobby decision, the Supreme Court has stayed out of \nthat decision, said that if the Congress decides a minimum level of \ncoverage should be available to employees, then employers should not be \nable to get in the way. That precedent is now blown up. There is no \ngoing back, as Justice Ginsburg has said. I hope we pass it this week.\n  The reality is it is more important now than ever to protect this \ncoverage, because as a result of the Affordable Care Act, there are \nmillions more women, millions more families all across the country who \nhave access to prescription contraception. Twenty-four million more \nprescriptions for oral contraceptives were filled without a copay in \n2013 than in 2012. That is by virtue of the protections in the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  On this particular type of prescription alone, the Affordable Care \nAct has saved $483 million in out-of-pocket costs for oral \ncontraceptives. That saved a lot of families money, but that has also \ngiven access to this important medication for millions of women.\n  It is just another example, just another piece of evidence amidst a \nmounting pile, that tells us the Affordable Care Act is working today. \nI want to spend a few additional minutes going over the latest litany \nof good news when it comes to the implementation of the Affordable Care \nAct. Republicans have kind of gone quiet, silent even, in many parts of \nthe Nation, when it comes to their critique of the Affordable Care Act. \nThat is in large part because on both sides of the aisle, there is a \nquiet acceptance that the Affordable Care Act is working. It has \nvanished from most campaigns as a political issue this summer and this \nfall because it is increasingly impossible, aside from anecdotal \nevidence, to make the case on an empirical data-driven basis that the \nAffordable Care Act is not working.\n  Senator Reid did a little bit of this earlier this week, but I want \nto share again some of the new numbers we have. Here is maybe the most \nstunning number: The uninsured rate in the United States fell 2.2 \npercentage points in the second quarter of 2014. We now have the lowest \nquarterly rate of uninsured in this country since Gallup began tracking \nthis percentage in 2008. There are approximately 20 to 25 percent less \npeople and families in this country without insurance than 6 months \nago. That is absolutely stunning, that in 6 months of implementation of \nthis act, we have taken one-quarter off the rolls of the uninsured in \nthis country. Even the biggest optimists about how the implementation \nof the Affordable Care Act was going to go could not have guessed we \nwere going to take that big a chunk out of the rolls of the uninsured.\n\n  But here is more evidence that this is working. Fifty-seven percent \nof the individuals who purchased coverage through the exchanges were \nuninsured when they were enrolled. So a lot of Republicans said: Well, \nyou know, the big numbers you are seeing, 8 million people insured \nthrough the private health care exchanges, that may be people shifting \nfrom one kind of insurance to another.\n  Well, a Kaiser study says that, in fact, 6 out of 10 of the people \nwho got insurance in the exchanges, through Medicaid, through staying \non their parents' insurance, had no insurance beforehand. Frankly, to \nmy mind, it does not necessarily matter, because to the extent they \nwent on these plans coming off of another plan, it was for a reason: \nThey were saving money, by and large. That is a good thing in and of \nitself.\n  But you have 4 out of 10 people going onto the new plans to save them \nmoney, 6 out of 10 people coming onto the new plans because they had no \ninsurance at all. They are getting care as well. A new Commonwealth \nFund survey says that 60 percent of the adults with this new coverage \nthrough the marketplace or Medicaid reported that they had visited a \nhospital or a doctor or filled a prescription. Sixty-two percent of \nthose people said they could not have had access or afforded this care \npreviously.\n  That was the theory. All of these people who were waiting to get so \nsick that they had to go to the emergency room, costing us all sorts of \nmoney in the long run, now can get preventive care. Of the 60 percent \nof the people who went out and saw a doctor because of the new coverage \nthey had by virtue of the Affordable Care Act, 60 percent of them said \nthey would have never gotten that care had they not had that coverage. \nThat is millions of people, millions of people all across the country \nwho are going to have an injury or an illness, who were going to sit at \nhome and live with it until it got so bad they had to show up at the \nemergency room--they are now getting care.\n  What about the premiums? People said: Well, you know, these presume \nare going to be unaffordable and people are going to start paying them \nand then stop paying them. HHS did a survey of the premiums and found, \non average, that the monthly premium people are paying is $82 per \nmonth, after a tax credit is factored in.\n\n[[Page S4530]]\n\n  Listen, $82 a month is not pocket change. There are a lot of families \nout there who have trouble coming up with $82 a month. But for somebody \nlike Susie Clayton, a breast cancer survivor from North Canaan, CT, \nthat is a big deal. She is paying right about that number, $90 per \nmonth. But prior to the Affordable Care Act, because she had a \npreexisting condition, Susie Clayton was spending $1,600 per month. \nThere are hundreds of thousands of Susie Claytons out there. Premiums \nare pretty affordable.\n  The critics said: All right, we will concede that more people are \ngetting covered. We will concede they are using the care. We will \nconcede premiums are affordable, in part because you are spending all \nof this money on premium assistance. But you are going to just start \nspiraling health care costs. Well, that did not come true either. With \nApril's updated CBO projections, spending on major Federal health care \nprograms--Medicare, Medicaid, and the ACA subsidies--has now been \nrevised downward by $900 billion. That is a half a percent of GDP since \nthe 2011 projections. So in 3 years, CBO has pushed down its \nprojections of 10-year spending by $900 billion.\n  Here is an even more stunning way to think about this. If you look at \nwhat CBO said we were going to spend on a per-Medicare recipient basis \nin 2010 versus what they now say we are going to spend on that \nrecipient today over the next 10 years, that per-Medicare recipient \nspending level has been decreased by $1,000. We are spending $1,000 \nless per Medicare recipient.\n  That does not have anything to do with the private exchanges. That \nhas to do with all of the other provisions in the bill that start to \nshift health care spending away from a system that rewards volume: How \nmuch medicine you practice to a system that rewards outcomes: How good \nis the medicine you are practicing. Are you keeping your patients \nhealthy?\n  The reality is that spending is remarkably low, historically low on \nhealth care. Listen, admittedly, some of that is because of an economy \nthat has been slow to recover over the course of the last 6 years. But \na lot of that is because of the Affordable Care Act, so much so that I \nsaw an article in the Wall Street Journal the other day that said the \nPresident was to blame for the slow economy because he had been so \nsuccessful in pushing down the rate of health care spending that now it \nwas an economic catastrophe that we were spending so much less than we \nhad initially projected on health care. There is no way for the \nPresident to win. If health care expenses spiral and premiums spiral, \nit is his fault. But if he does something to control health care \npremiums and health care costs, than it is a drag on the economy.\n  In the long run, the truth is if we get health care spending down, \nreally just a transfer payment within our economy, then we have room to \nspend more money on much more necessary investments, in our \ninfrastructure, in our scientific edge over other countries.\n  I am here today to support the underlying bill, because I think it is \nthe right thing to do for women in this country, but also because it is \npart of a growing success story of the Affordable Care Act: $500 \nmillion saved on prescription contraception alone. But add that to all \nof the other evidence, and we are living in a world in which it is \nincreasingly hard to argue that the Affordable Care Act is not working: \nmillions more people covered, huge chunks out of the uninsured rolls \nbeing eliminated, costs for overall health care expenses decreasing. I \nwill not even get into it this afternoon, but quality is improving as \nwell. That is people having hospital-acquired infections, having to be \nreadmitted to the hospital.\n  The stories just keep on coming in. I certainly understand that on an \nanecdotal basis you can find people who have had negative experiences \nwith the health care system under the Affordable Care Act. I could find \nmillions of other people before the Affordable Care Act was passed as \nwell. But there are many more people like Sean and Emilie Hannon, who \nare two freelancers from Weston, CT, who were looking for coverage \nprevious to the Affordable Care Act being passed. The best they could \ndo was $1,500 per month from Golden Rule. When they heard about the \nAffordable Care Act, they called the Connecticut exchange and they \nfound a plan through ConnectiCare that was going to cost them $309 a \nmonth. This is a fairly young couple, a savings of nearly 80 percent \ncompared to what they used to pay. That is a story that can be \nreplicated millions of times all across this country.\n  We would be wise this week to restore this protection to women across \nthis country so they have access to affordable prescription birth \ncontrol. That is just one part of a growing, overwhelming array of both \nsuccess stories and positive data about the implementation of the \nAffordable Care Act, proving that the ACA works.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to respond to \nsome of the comments by the Senator from Connecticut and specifically \nwith regard to the health care law. I come with an interest because I \ndid part of my medical training in that State, still have many friends \nwho practice medicine in Connecticut, and feel from the comments I hear \nfrom them that they see a very different side of the picture than what \nwe hear from the Senator from Connecticut.\n  For some time now Republicans have been talking about the terrible \nside effects of the President's health care law. The Senator from \nConnecticut made some references to a family who certainly may have \nbeen helped by the health care law, but there are clearly people in \nthat State who are being harmed by the health care law.\n  In the past I have spoken on this floor about a story in the \nWashington Post about how the health care law is hurting families all \nacross Connecticut. The article said that two insurance carriers in the \nSenator's home State of Connecticut have proposed increasing their \nhealth insurance premiums by an average of about 12 percent. I didn't \nhear the Senator from Connecticut make reference to that today. So some \npeople will have smaller increases than the average, but many people in \nConnecticut are going to pay much more. That is an expensive side \neffect families are going to have to deal with because of the \nPresident's health care law for which the Democrats in the Senate have \nvoted.\n  There was another article a week or so ago in The Hill newspaper with \nthe headline ``Personal data on ObamaCare enrollees may be \ncompromised.'' It says:\n\n       Connecticut's health insurance exchange acknowledged Friday \n     that the personal information of some enrollees may have been \n     compromised.\n\n  Someone found a backpack on a street in Hartford, CT, containing \npersonal information of about 400 people, and it looks as if some of \nthe information is connected to the exchange.\n  It is interesting. There was a story in the Danbury, CT, newspaper. \nThe headline is ``Affordable Care Act could cost schools big bucks.'' \nSo it is not just health care; the Affordable Care Act itself could \ncost the schools big bucks. I haven't heard the Senator from \nConnecticut make reference to that. This could cost school districts \nhundreds of thousands of dollars they didn't expect to pay.\n  The Senator from New York is here, and I don't know if the Senator \nhas time locked in. If not, I wanted to speak for a few more moments \nbecause this continues to be a major impact.\n  The law includes a special tax on what are called the Cadillac plans. \nThese are generous health insurance plans that some people--such as \nunion workers, police, and school employees--get in some places.\n  Another big thing is the way the law defines full-time workers, and \nthis is a problem we are seeing in a lot of places. Employees are \nconsidered full time under the health care law if they work 30 hours a \nweek. So schools--schools that are being impacted--are having to \nprovide insurance for those people or cut back their hours.\n  It is hurting a lot of folks in the Senator's home State and \nspecifically in the school districts in Connecticut.\n\n[[Page S4531]]\n\nWhat they are finding is that they are having to pay more money to buy \ninsurance for the people whom they can't cut back. So the school \nsuperintendent in Danbury, CT, wrote to the congressional delegation \nfrom Connecticut asking for help. According to a newspaper story from \nDanbury, he wrote:\n\n       Unless there is some reasonable modification to the ACA \n     [the President's health care law] there will be a tremendous \n     drain on our limited resources.\n\n  So when I see the Senator from Connecticut with a sign that says the \nhealth care law works, I would say: Not for many people, and it is \nharming people, including students in our schools. The law is a drain \non resources of schools, towns, and counties across the country--a very \ncostly side effect of the health care law at the local level.\n  I hear the same from my constituents in Wyoming who are seeing \nsimilar decisions having to be made, tough choices. I know the Senator \nfrom Connecticut is hearing it from his constituents, such as the \nsuperintendent of schools in Danbury.\n  Middle-class families are getting smaller paychecks because of the \nlaw. School districts are getting stretched thin by the health care \nlaw. Families are having to pay higher premiums because of the health \ncare law, and on top of that they are being exposed to potential fraud \nand identity theft in the exchanges created by the health care law, as \nevidenced by a backpack found on a street in Hartford, CT, containing \nnames, Social Security numbers, home addresses, and birth dates of \npeople who signed up for the exchange.\n  Republicans are going to keep talking about these devastating, \ndangerous side effects of the Democrats' health care law. We are going \nto keep pushing for real health care reform that gives people the care \nthey need from a doctor they choose at a lower cost.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Protect \nWomen's Health From Corporate Interference Act of 2014, introduced by \nmy friends and colleagues Senator Murray and Senator Udall. I am proud \nto be a cosponsor of this legislation.\n  We are at a critical moment when it comes to women's health care \nrights. We just witnessed a Supreme Court decision that curtailed \nimportant access to health care for employees across the country. The \nHobby Lobby case has now opened the door for the vast majority of \ncompanies and bosses to start denying their employees contraceptive \ncoverage if the owners have a religious objection. We must slam the \ndoor shut. To do that this body must set the record straight about the \nlaw the Supreme Court used to make their decision, the Religious \nFreedom Restoration Act.\n  As one of the original authors of the Religious Freedom Restoration \nAct, I was the lead sponsor in the House of Representatives. Senator \nKennedy was the lead sponsor in the Senate.\n  I can say with absolute certainty that the law has been unwisely \nstretched by the Supreme Court to extend religious protections to \ncorporations Congress never intended to be covered under the bill. I am \ncompelled to do so because several of my colleagues on the other side \nhave come to the floor to defend the Hobby Lobby decision using my \nwords. These were arguments I made in 1993 when we first passed the \nRFRA and we were dealing with the protection of individual--underlining \nindividual--liberties. The quotation they used dealt broadly with the \nimportance of religious freedom of expression in our country. I said \nthe RFRA would help restore the American tradition of allowing maximum \nreligious freedom. That is as true today as it was then. I believe as \nstrongly in RFRA as it was written then as I do now, but it was \nmisinterpreted and wrongly expanded by the Supreme Court.\n  When my colleagues used this quotation as a point of argument, they \ncompletely missed the point of the debate. The debate is not about the \nconflict between freedom of religious expression and government-\nmandated health coverage. That is a false choice. The debate is really \nwhether the Supreme Court appropriately interpreted the RFRA in \napplying it to profit-making corporations.\n  As the author of the bill, I can say again with absolute certainty \nthat the Supreme Court got the Hobby Lobby case dead wrong.\n  When we wrote RFRA back in 1993, we did so to protect that which \nindividuals with strong religious beliefs had always enjoyed--the \npresumption that they should be able to exercise their religious \nbeliefs without interference from the government. But the Court took \nthat protection and misapplied it to for-profit companies that exist \nfor the purpose of benefiting from the open market.\n  The Hobby Lobby decision marks a sharp departure both from the intent \nof RFRA and from prior judicial interpretations of RFRA. The Supreme \nCourt got it wrong. That is why this bill, authored by my colleagues \nfrom Washington and Colorado, is of paramount importance--to clarify \nthe law and to restore protections for employees that were stripped \naway by this wrongheaded Supreme Court decision.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle will continue to assert \nthat this is just another assault by Democrats on free exercise of \nreligion or peddle other falsehoods. So I would like to clearly explain \nwhat this bill will and won't do.\n  This bill will ensure that companies cannot deny their workers any \nhealth benefits, including birth control, as required to be covered by \nFederal law.\n  This bill will make it clear that bosses cannot discriminate against \ntheir female workers, ensuring equal treatment under the law for tens \nof thousands of workers whose coverage hangs in the balance.\n  This bill is not only about birth control. The Hobby Lobby decision \nhas implications for other health services, and now this bill will \nensure that all covered employees have access to all necessary health \ncare--not only contraceptives but also blood transfusions, \nantidepressants, and vaccines.\n  The bill does not require churches or nonprofit organizations to \nprovide contraceptive coverage even when they object on religious \ngrounds. The Affordable Care Act exemption process for nonprofit \norganizations with a religious mission is unchanged by this bill.\n  This bill will not allow new laws that can target specific religious \ngroups.\n  The bill only applies to health care.\n  Most importantly, this bill does not restrict the Constitution's \nFirst Amendment right to free exercise of religion. The bill only \nclarifies the relative weight the Court should give when two Federal \nstatutes--such as the Affordable Care Act and the Religious Freedom \nRestoration Act--come into conflict.\n  As I continue to say, RFRA was intended to give individuals who \nprofess strong religious beliefs what they had always enjoyed--the \nstrong presumption that they should be able to exercise their religious \nbeliefs without government interference. RFRA was not intended to \nextend the same protection to for-profit corporations the very purpose \nof which is to profit from the open market.\n  The Supreme Court's cavalier decision to grant religious rights to \nclosely held corporations could curtail the health care freedom of \nwomen at as many as 90 percent of American businesses. By putting \nhealth care decisions in the hands of a woman's boss instead of a woman \nand her doctor, the decision creates a slippery slope that could affect \ntens of millions of Americans--our daughters, our wives--in the future.\n  We need this bill to clarify the law and firmly protect a woman's \nright to access essential health care.\n  I thank my colleagues Senator Udall and Senator Murray for offering \nthis legislation. I urge my colleagues to support this effort to \nprotect women's health care and religious freedom.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about one of the \nsaddest developments in the Senate--namely, the all-out assault on the \nFirst Amendment being led by Senate Democrats.\n  It is important to clarify what the issue before this body is not \nabout. The issue before this body is not about access to \ncontraceptives, despite a whole lot of politicking by Senate Democrats \nwho suggest to the contrary.\n  In this body the number of people who would do anything to restrict \naccess to contraceptives to anybody is\n\n[[Page S4532]]\n\nzero. Let me repeat that. There is no one in this body, there is no one \nI am aware of across the country who is advocating restricting anyone's \naccess to contraceptives.\n  My wife and I are blessed with two little girls. I am very glad we \ndon't have 17.\n  Nobody, nobody, nobody is talking about restricting access to \ncontraceptives.\n  What are we talking about? What we are talking about is the Federal \nGovernment using brute force to force people to pay for the abortion-\ninducing drugs of others against their religious faith. That is \nextraordinary. It is remarkable and it is dismaying.\n\n  I am sorry to show what the current First Amendment looks like in the \nwake of the Democrats' assault on the First Amendment.\n  In the Senate Judiciary Committee we have been debating on amendments \nsome 47 Democrats have supported that would repeal the free speech \nprotections of the First Amendment. Sadly, every Senate Democrat in the \nJudiciary Committee supported it.\n  Today, this body is considering another provision that would \neffectively cross out the free exercise rights.\n  Where have we entered when the Bill of Rights has become a partisan \nmatter? What kind of world is it? It used to be the case that we would \nfind bipartisan agreement that the First Amendment is part of our civil \ncompact--that we will stand together with one voice in support of the \nfree speech rights of individual citizens, in support of the religious \nliberty rights of individual citizens.\n  The proposal we are going to vote on in just a few minutes would go \ndirectly after the religious liberty rights of Americans.\n  Let me talk a little bit about one group of people who will be \naffected by this bill if this bill were to pass. Let me talk about the \nLittle Sisters of the Poor, a group of Catholic nuns.\n  The Little Sisters of the Poor are an international congregation of \nRoman Catholic women founded in 1839 by St. Jeanne Jugan. Their mission \nis to:\n\n       . . . offer the neediest elderly of every race and religion \n     a home where they will be welcomed as Christ, cared for as \n     family and accompanied with dignity until God calls them to \n     himself.\n\n  The bill that is being voted on on this floor would shut these nuns \ndown. The bill that is being voted on on this floor, if it were \nadopted, would fine the Little Sisters of the Poor millions of dollars, \nunless these Catholic nuns are willing to pay for abortion-producing \ndrugs for others.\n  When did the Democratic Party declare war on the Catholic Church? And \nlet me note, this is not hypothetical. I am not suggesting in theory \nthis might be applied to the Little Sisters of the Poor. Right now--\ntoday--the Obama administration is litigating against the Little \nSisters of the Poor, trying to force them to pay for abortion-producing \ndrugs and threatening to shut the Little Sisters of the Poor down.\n  How far have we come from the basic bipartisan agreement in favor of \nreligious liberty? Faith fines should have no place in American \nsociety.\n  The Little Sisters of Denver, which provides approximately 67 full-\ntime jobs, has said it will incur penalties of roughly $6,700 per day--\nnearly $2.5 million per year--if it chooses to stay true to its \nreligious beliefs; that is, $2.5 million a year in faith fines--fines \nto Catholic nuns who are devoting their time to caring and providing \nhealth care for the elderly. That is more than one-third of their $6 \nmillion budget each year.\n  What has become of the Democratic Party? When did they become so \nextreme that they would actually propose fining nuns millions of \ndollars if they are unwilling to pay for the abortion-producing drugs \nof others? That is not a mainstream position. That is a radical, \nextreme position.\n  I would encourage every one of my colleagues on the Democratic side \nof the aisle to ask themselves: How are they going to answer their \nconstituents when they say: Senator, why did you vote in favor of a law \nthat would fine Catholic nuns millions of dollars if they refuse to pay \nfor the abortion-producing drugs of others?\n  Let me make a basic suggestion. If you are litigating against nuns, \nyou have probably done something wrong. And the Obama administration is \ndoing so right now.\n  Mr. President, drop your faith fines.\n  Mr. Majority Leader, drop your faith fines.\n  To all of my Democratic colleagues, drop your faith fines. Get back \nto the shared values that stitch all of us together as Americans.\n  I call upon my Democratic colleagues to stop playing election-year \npolitics. I recognize scaring women by suggesting someone is coming at \ntheir birth control may be good politics. It is false. Even the \nWashington Post has said it is false and a lie.\n  But election-year politics should not trump religious liberty. Senate \nDemocrats should not wage war on the Catholic Church.\n  It is not just the nuns who are dismayed. The Catholic bishops have \nsaid the proposed bill ``does not befit a nation committed to religious \nliberty'' and would allow the government to ``override religious \nfreedom rights of Americans regarding health coverage.''\n  So it is not just the nuns. It is to the Catholic bishops that the \nDemocratic party has said: Your free exercise of religious rights has \nno place in a Democratic Senate.\n  The Catholic bishops went on to say:\n\n       If, in the future, the executive branch chose to add the \n     abortion pill RU486, or even elective surgical abortion, \n     including late-term abortion, to the list of ``preventative \n     services,'' those who object to providing or purchasing such \n     coverage would appear to have no recourse.\n\n  Think about that for a second. The Catholic bishops just said the \nbill this body is getting ready to vote on, if passed, would enable the \nFederal Government to try to force Catholic nuns to pay for and carry \nout partial-birth abortion. That is staggering.\n  If we want to talk about mainstream positions, there are mainstream \npositions, there are far-left positions, and then there is extreme \nradical fringe, which is the Federal Government forcing Catholic nuns \nto pay for partial-birth abortions. And that is where virtually every \nSenate Democrat is today.\n\n  Under the legislation before this body, the Catholic University Ave \nMaria would be forced to make the same choice: Authorize abortion-\ninducing drugs right now or pay millions of dollars in fines to the \nU.S. Government.\n  As Ave Maria President Jim Towey has said:\n\n       Ave Maria University pays 95 percent of the cost of the \n     health plan we offer our employees. Under the federal mandate \n     Ave Maria University would be paying for these drugs if we \n     complied with the law. So we will not.\n\n  Every Senate Democrat who votes yes in a few minutes will be voting \nto fine Ave Maria Catholic University millions of dollars simply for \nstanding true to their faith. That is a vote that should embarrass any \nMember of this body.\n  Mr. Towey went on to say:\n\n       We are prepared to discontinue our health plan and pay the \n     $2,000 per employee, per year fine rather than comply with an \n     unjust, immoral mandate in violation of our rights of \n     conscience.\n\n  Belmont Abbey College is another proud religious school--founded by \nBenedictine monks--that the Democrats have put in the same predicament. \nThe Democrats' legislation would force Belmont Abbey College to pay \n$20,000 a day in faith fines. Faith fines have no place in our \ndemocracy.\n  Let me ask again: Why are Democrats so hostile to the Catholic \nChurch? Why are Democrats trying to use the Federal Government to fine \nCatholic institutions for holding true to their religious beliefs? It \nall comes down to a hard-line, extreme, out-of-touch position on \nabortion.\n  Just yesterday we had a hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee \nabout legislation so broad that it would set aside State laws providing \nparental notification for abortion, prohibiting late-term abortions, \nmandating taxpayer-funded abortions. These are extreme radical views \nheld by a tiny percentage of the American people but yet held by a \nlarge percentage of Democratic activists.\n  This position would also rip apart the bipartisan legislation that \nPresident Clinton signed into law in 1993. The Religious Freedom \nRestoration Act passed the Senate 97 to 3. When President Clinton \nsigned that Act, he said:\n\n       What [RFRA] basically says is that the Government should be \n     held to a very high level of proof before it interferes with \n     someone's free exercise of religion. This judgment is shared \n     by the people of the United States\n\n[[Page S4533]]\n\n     as well as by the Congress. We believe strongly that we can \n     never, we can never be too vigilant in this work.\n\n  We should listen to the words of Bill Clinton in 1993, and the Senate \nshould back away from this assault on religious liberty.\n  I will finally note two simple things.\n  In 1997, when the Senate considered another assault on the free \nspeech protections of the First Amendment, then-Senator Ted Kennedy, \nliberal lion of the Senate, stood and said:\n\n       We haven't changed the Bill of Rights in over 200 years and \n     now is no time to start.\n\n  Senator Ted Kennedy was right in 1997.\n  Likewise, President John F. Kennedy, in a historic speech to the \nNation, said:\n\n       I would not look with favor upon a president working to \n     subvert the First Amendment's guarantees of religious \n     liberty.\n\n  Where are the Kennedys today? Does any Democrat have the courage to \nstand and speak for the First Amendment today? Does any Democrat have \nthe courage to stand and speak for the constitutional rights of \npracticing Catholics? Does any Democrat have the courage to stand and \nspeak for the Little Sisters of the Poor? Does any Democrat have the \ncourage to listen to the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and speak \nfor religious liberty?\n  It saddens me that there are not 100 Senators here unified, \nregardless of our faith, standing together, protecting the religious \nliberty rights of everyone.\n  Faith fines have no business in our democracy. I urge every Member of \nthis body to vote no on this assault on basic religious liberty of \nevery American.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I have come to the floor every \nday this week to talk about my commonsense bill to keep corporate \ninterference out of women's private health decisions.\n  On Monday when I was on the floor, I shared the concerns of a Denver-\nbased OB/GYN who said that in light of the Supreme Court's split \ndecision in the Hobby Lobby case, physicians might now have to consider \nan employer's religious beliefs when making a medical recommendation to \nensure their patients are covered for very basic contraceptive \ntreatments.\n  Yesterday I spoke about a Colorado mother whose college-aged daughter \ndepended on contraception--prescribed by her doctor--to help her manage \na debilitating health condition that often kept her from attending \nclass. She told me that without that contraceptive coverage through her \nfamily's health plan, her daughter would not have had the coverage for \na medically necessary treatment.\n  Women are sharing these stories with me every day. And Coloradans \nagree--they should not have to ask for a permission slip to be covered \nby the method of contraception that is best for them.\n  Women should be in charge of their health care, not their boss, and \ncertainly not a corporation.\n  This week my colleague from Washington State and I called on our \ncolleagues to join us in supporting our bill--the Protect Women's \nHealth From Corporate Interference Act--or the ``Not My Boss's Business \nAct.'' Our bill is straightforward. It is common sense. It ensures that \nno boss can come between a woman and her access to affordable health \ncare.\n  I thank my colleagues who have come to the Senate floor this week to \nhighlight the importance of passing this bill. In just a few moments, \nwe will be casting our votes as to whether we should bring this bill to \nthe floor. So I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle can \nat least agree this is a debate worth having. It is a discussion I know \nwomen and men in every State are encouraging their representatives to \nhave.\n  After bringing this legislation to the floor for a proper debate, if \nmy colleagues then believe that this simple bill to keep a boss's \nreligious beliefs from impacting access to essential health care for \nmillions of American women is misguided, then they can vote against it.\n  Bosses have no business interfering in women's private health \ndecisions. Women have asked us to act. Let's act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last month five conservative justices on \nthe Supreme Court decided that a corporation's rights can trump a \nfemale employee's right to make her own health care decisions. This is \njust the latest of several rulings from a thin majority of justices \nthat diminish the rights of hardworking Americans and have a direct \neffect on their economic security. I am proud to be a cosponsor of the \nProtect Women's Health from Corporate Interference Act, which the \nSenate is considering today. It is needed to overturn the Court's most \nrecent expansion of corporate rights.\n  For far too long, women were priced out of health care simply because \nof their gender. The very fact of being a woman, in effect, was \nbrandished against women as a pre-existing condition. Thanks to the \nAffordable Care Act, much of the discrimination women faced in the \nhealth insurance market was eliminated. It is unthinkable that as \nrecently as last year, a woman's health care premiums could cost 45 to \n140 percent more than a man's. No wonder over half of women identified \ncost as a barrier to health coverage and why so many women went without \ninsurance. Women could be denied coverage for something as simple as \nhaving had a C-section, or for being a victim of domestic violence. It \nis a travesty that in a country as great as ours this inequity survived \nas long as it did.\n  Unfortunately, in the Hobby Lobby decision, which this legislation \nwould address, the Supreme Court set back these advances in equality in \nhealth coverage by sanctioning the very discrimination in health care \naccess and services that the Affordable Care Act remedied. By ruling \nthat the owners of corporations may impose their religious beliefs on \ntheir employees, women are no longer guaranteed the right to make their \nown health care decisions. Additionally, this ruling could have far \nreaching consequences beyond access to contraception. Unless Congress \nacts, we could see employers restricting the right to other health care \nservices, including vaccines or blood transfusions.\n  This ruling comes on the heels of another decision that also \nthreatens women's access to health care. In McCullen v. Coakley, the \nCourt ruled that a 35-foot buffer zone protecting women from harassment \nwhen entering women's health clinics was not justified and was \ntherefore unconstitutional. This was yet another decision where the \nRoberts Court allowed other's rights--whether an employer or a stranger \non the street who holds a different view point--to trump that of a \nwoman seeking health care.\n  In addition to the Supreme Court narrowing the rights of American \nwomen, we have seen many legislative efforts across the country to cut \naway at the progress we have made in women's health over the last few \nyears. We have seen Federal bills and amendments introduced that would \ntake decisions out of the hands of patients and doctors, and place them \nwith businesses and insurance companies. States have followed suit by \npassing laws limiting women's access to health care services. I believe \nour focus should be on improving access to quality and affordable \nhealth care for all Americans, not arbitrarily restricting the \nimportant treatments needed by millions of women.\n  The Protect Women's Health from Corporate Interference Act would \nrestore Congress' intent by preventing any company from denying their \nworkers specific health coverage, including birth control, as required \nto be covered by Federal law. Without this legislation, for-profit \ncorporations that otherwise offer preventative health benefits can \nchoose to deny their employers contraception coverage based on their \nbosses' religious beliefs. The bill before the Senate would once again \nprohibit bosses from discriminating against their employees based on \ntheir gender and would ensure that women's health care decisions are \nput back in the hands of those women and their doctors, where they \nbelong.\n  At the core of the Affordable Care Act is the principle that all \nAmericans, regardless of health history or gender, have the right to \naccess health care services and make their own decisions about their \nhealth care. As chairman of the Judiciary Committee--and as a husband, \na father, a grandfather, and as a Vermonter--this is a principle I take \nseriously. I will continue to fight\n\n[[Page S4534]]\n\nagainst efforts to roll back protections for women, minorities, or any \ngroup that has faced discrimination.\n  I hope that instead of focusing on ways to limit health care options \nfor women, we can join together to promote the interests of women \nacross America by supporting this bill. Nothing less than the economic \nsecurity of our families is at stake.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/16/senate-section/article/S4534-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4534-S4545]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         PROTECT WOMEN'S HEALTH FROM CORPORATE INTERFERENCE ACT\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to allow us to begin \ndebate on the Protect Women's Health From Corporate Interference Act of \n2014, of which I am a cosponsor.\n  One of this Nation's founding principles is respect for religious \nfaith. Most all of us agree that one American should not be able to \nimpose his or her religious convictions upon another. Yet the outcome \nof the Supreme Court's recent decision in the Hobby Lobby case is that \nthousands of Americans may lose the ability to make the most personal \nchoices about what health care meets their religious or ethical \nstandards and hand those decisions over to an employer.\n  The Court's reasoning in the Hobby Lobby decision was deeply flawed. \nAs I and several colleagues argued in a brief to the Court, applying \nthe Religious Freedom Restoration Act as the Court did seriously \nmisconstrues the language of the statute and ignores the intent of \nCongress in passing it. Giving for-profit corporations the power to \nimpose the religious beliefs of managers or owners upon employees is \nwhat violates basic religious freedom.\n  It is a central feature of our health care system that millions of \nAmericans receive health insurance through employer-sponsored plans and \nthose employers are most often, as was the case with Hobby Lobby, \ncorporations. Business owners choose to incorporate because forming a \ncorporation means access to limited liability and other government-\nconferred privileges.\n  But corporations don't have faiths. People do. That includes the \nwomen who have now lost their ability to make the most important and \npersonal decisions about their health care.\n  If we are to say we truly value the freedom to practice any religion \nor no religion, as we see fit, surely that includes the freedom for \nAmerican women to make choices about their own health care without the \nimposition of their employer's religious convictions. The Supreme \nCourt's decision has elevated the religious faith of a business's \nowners above the values of that business's employees. That is not what \nthe law envisions, and it is not what Americans believe.\n  I strongly support this legislation to repair the damage the Supreme \nCourt has done. We should proceed to this bill, debate it, vote on it, \nand hopefully pass it. America's women and their families deserve \nnothing less.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nProtect Women From Corporate Interference Act, and I praise Senator \nMurray and Senator Udall (of Colorado) for their work on this bill.\n  Let me first discuss the Supreme Court's 5-4 decision in Hobby Lobby \nv. Burwell--a decision that in my view is deeply disappointing. In the \nHobby Lobby case, the Supreme Court found that large, closely-held, \nfor-profit corporations have religious-freedom rights under the \nReligious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA). Major corporations \ncan now assert a religious objection to generally applicable federal \nlaw.\n  It is possible such corporations will not get most exemptions they \nseek. This will be examined on a case-by-case basis. But the point is \nthe Court has opened the door to granting these sorts of exemptions to \nlarge, for-profit corporations.\n  This is a far-reaching result that Congress never intended when it \nenacted the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\n  As 18 other senators and I made clear to the Court in an amicus brief \nin the Hobby Lobby case, Congress's purpose in passing the Religious \nFreedom Restoration Act in 1993 was simple. Congress wanted to \nstrengthen individuals' free-exercise protections, after a Supreme \nCourt decision in Employment Division v. Smith (1990) limited those \nrights. But Congress never intended to grant new free-exercise \nprotections to artificial, for-profit business corporations.\n  The Court's decision in Hobby Lobby went far beyond what Congress \nintended in passing the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. The Federal \nlaw limited by Hobby Lobby was the Affordable Care Act's requirement \nthat preventive health services including contraceptives are covered \nwithout cost-sharing in both individual and employer-provided health \nplans. Preventive health services include contraception because it is \nbasic health care for women. This is an important benefit secured by \nfederal law for all American women, 99 percent of whom have used \ncontraception at some point in their lives. The medical community has \nalmost unanimously recognized contraception as basic and essential \nhealth care. As the Guttmacher Institute explained in 2011: \nContraceptive use ``help[s] women avoid short intervals between births, \nthereby reducing the risk of poor birth outcomes.'' ``[S]hort birth \nintervals have been linked with numerous negative perinatal outcomes,'' \nincluding ``low birth weight, pre-term birth and small size for \ngestational age.'' Contraceptives can also be used to treat common \nmedical conditions including ``menstrual-related migraines, the \ntreatment of pelvic pain that accompanies endometriosis, and of \nbleeding due to uterine fibroids.''\n  The Institute of Medicine also recognized the importance of these \nbenefits when it recommended that all FDA-approved contraceptives \nshould be covered without cost-sharing, pursuant to the Women's Health \nAmendment to the health care law, which I strongly supported.\n  Yet the Court's decision in Hobby Lobby means a woman's employer can \nfor religious reasons ignore the federal requirement to include this \nimportant health benefit in its health plan.\n  To me, that is wrong. A woman's employer-provided health plan should \ninclude basic preventive services required by law, without the owners \nof the corporation she works for imposing their own personal religious \nviews upon her health care decisions.\n  I understand some have argued that this decision doesn't impact \nwomen's access to contraception because it doesn't allow a corporation \nto bar a woman from buying contraception. That's ridiculous. Of course \nhealth insurance coverage impacts access to care. That is the whole \npoint of insurance. No one would argue that if an employer decided not \nto cover antibiotics that patients would still have the same access to \nneeded medication on their own. When insurance coverage is limited, \naccess is limited as well, particularly for those of lower financial \nmeans.\n  According to a 2009 study from the Guttmacher Institute, 23 percent \nof women surveyed reported having a harder time paying for birth \ncontrol during the economic downturn, and this number rose to one out \nof three among those who were financially worse off compared to the \nyear before. In fact, my Republican colleagues felt that prescription \ndrug coverage was so important to ensuring patient access to medication \nthat they led the creation of Medicare Part D, which was signed into \nlaw by President Bush. I supported that legislation and still believe \nthat health insurance coverage is critical to ensuring patient access.\n  It is also important to note that contraception is not the only issue \nhere. The Hobby Lobby decision means that other Federal health laws--\nincluding other benefits required by law, or even coverage itself--\ncould be the subject of a religious objection by a corporate employer.\n  In the United States more than half of all individuals get insurance \nthrough their employer, and estimates suggest that more than half of \nAmericans work for a closely-held corporation.\n  In the Affordable Care Act Congress recognized the importance of \npreventive care. We included coverage without a copay for effective \nprevention services as determined by independent medical experts. I \nwill just name some: Blood pressure and cholesterol screening, \ncolonoscopies, immunizations, HIV tests, mammograms and cervical cancer \nscreening, diabetes screening, autism screening for children, hearing \ntests for newborns and screening for sickle-cell anemia.\n  The point is certain essential, preventive services for adults and \nchildren\n\n[[Page S4535]]\n\nmust be part of employer-provided health care under the law. But the \nHobby Lobby decision grants for-profit corporations the ability to seek \na religious exemption from providing them. Those exemptions may or may \nnot be granted, but the Supreme Court has now opened the door to those \nclaims.\n  In my view this is at odds with the fundamental principle that health \ncare decisions should be made by patients in consultation with their \ndoctors.\n  This bill is simple: it would protect elements of employer-provided \nhealth care plans that are already required by law against challenge on \nthe basis of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\n  It would not infringe any individual's constitutional right to the \nfree exercise of religion, nor would it alter existing exemptions and \naccommodations for religious organizations and non-profits.\n  I urge my colleagues to defend the critical health protections that \nwe have created and join me in supporting this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 2:10 \np.m. will be equally divided and controlled between the two leaders or \ntheir designees.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to reserve the \nlast 3 minutes of debate for my time, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, in a few minutes we are going to vote \nto proceed to debate on the Protect Women's Health from Corporate \nInterference Act--or, as we call it, the Not My Boss's Business Act--\nstraightforward, simple legislation that would ensure that no CEO or \ncorporation can come between you and your guaranteed access to health \ncare, period.\n  Women across the country are watching. Affordability of care equals \naccess to care, and we know that millions of Americans lacked health \ninsurance prior to the Affordable Care Act because they couldn't afford \nit, not because it wasn't available to them to purchase. Contraceptives \nshould be a part of the options in women's health care because it is an \nessential part. We don't single out other benefits for employees. Why \nshould we single out benefits that are so important to women in this \ncountry?\n  Now is the time for our colleagues to answer a few basic questions. \nWho should be in charge of a woman's health care decision? Should it be \nthe woman making those decisions with her partner and her doctor and \nher faith or should it be her boss making those decisions for her based \non his own religious beliefs? To me and to the vast majority of people \nacross the country, the answer to that question is obvious: Women \nshould call the shots when it comes to their health care decisions, not \ntheir boss, not the government, not anyone else, period.\n  But we are here today because five men on the Supreme Court \ndisagreed. Five men on the Supreme Court rolled back the clock on women \nacross America. We are here today because we simply cannot allow that \nto stand.\n  In the aftermath of that decision, women across America turned up \nhere in Congress and demanded we fix it. That is why I worked with my \npartner, the senior Senator from Colorado, to introduce this bill, and \nwe have 46 cosponsors in the Senate and over 120 organizations that \nhave voiced their support now. So I sincerely hope our Republican \ncolleagues will join us in allowing us to proceed to debate on this \nimportant bill.\n  I wish to remind them that women across the country are watching. In \nfact, we have a number of them here in the Nation's Capitol today, and \nI believe they will be very interested in seeing who is on their side.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor, and I ask unanimous \nconsent to yield back all remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, all time is yielded back.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before \nthe Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to Calendar No. 459, S. 2578, a bill to ensure that \n     employers cannot interfere in their employees' birth control \n     and other health care decisions.\n         Harry Reid, Patty Murray, Mark Udall, Richard J.

Madam President, over the years I have frequently spoken \non the Senate floor about refugees. I have asked my fellow Senators to \nsupport our humanitarian refugee efforts in farflung corners of the \nworld. In doing so, I cite America's role as a human rights leader and \nour long history of providing refuge to those fleeing persecution and \nviolence. I also remind people of a time in the past, around World War \nII, when this country unwisely closed its borders to people who were \nfleeing the Holocaust in Germany. They came here, they were turned \nback, sent back, many of them to certain death in the death camps. That \nwas a sorry part of our history. Usually our history reflects what we \nsee in the Statue of Liberty: a beckoning torch to refuge. But now the \nrefugee crisis has come back again and to our own border.\n\n[[Page S4536]]\n\n  It is a complicated problem. I hope we will stop trying to react to \nwhatever was in the latest news cycle 12\\1/2\\ seconds ago so we can get \nto the next sound bite 12\\1/2\\ seconds from now and resist the urge to \nlet politics shape our response. Critics are arguing that the increase \nin unaccompanied children arriving at the southwest border is driven by \nrecent changes in our immigration policy. This is a sound bite. The \nfacts, of course, are a lot different. They tell a different and more \ncomplicated story.\n  The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has found over 50 \npercent of the children ages 12 to 17 arriving from Guatemala, El \nSalvador, and Honduras have been forcibly displaced and have claims to \ninternational protection because of the violence they have encountered. \nIf changes in immigration policy were the primary factor, we would \nexpect to see an across-the-board increase in children arriving from \nMexico and Central America.\n  What Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras have in common is \nwidespread corruption and weak governments that have failed to \nimplement effective social and economic programs or to protect their \nmost vulnerable citizens from record levels of violence. This reality, \nmore than any change in U.S. policy, is responsible for the massive \nincrease in unaccompanied minors arriving on our southwest border.\n  It is true that many of these children do not have claims to \nimmigration relief and they are going to be returned. For them, the \ndangers of this trip are not worth it, and we must discourage them from \nmaking the arduous journey alone. But others are fleeing murder or \nbeing forced into gangs or girls in their early teens are being raped \nand impregnated. This is what they are escaping.\n  There is no doubt that simply maintaining the status quo is not an \noption. We should take up and pass the administration's emergency \nsupplemental request without delay. But instead of supporting the \nsupplemental, Republicans are trying to use the crisis to promote fear \nand their enforcement-only agenda. It has not worked in the past. It \nwill not work now. These children coming across the border are not \ntrying to flee from enforcement. If they see somebody in uniform, they \nrun to them, thinking that finally they are escaping the gangs and the \nmurderers and the rapists, and now they suddenly feel safe because they \nsee an American in uniform. As we know from the experience of other \ncountries facing far greater refugee crises, increased detention and \nother messages of deterrence do not persuade desperate people from \ntaking dangerous journeys.\n  Some Members of Congress are proposing that the way to solve this \nproblem is by amending the Trafficking Victims Protection Act to make \nit easier to deport these children by rushing them through a \nsuperficial hearing--and it would be superficial--without access to \ncounsel or child welfare specialists, in a country strange to them and \nin a language different than theirs. That is unacceptable. We are \ntalking about young children--6 and 7 and 8 years old--who have \nexperienced horrific violence and now are in a country where they don't \neven speak the language. It is unconscionable to push them through our \ncomplicated legal system terrified and alone, without a lawyer, and \nwith the ultimate idea that they will be summarily deported back to the \nvery danger they fled. I will vote against anything that would allow \nsuch a travesty.\n  The Trafficking Victims Protection Act is not a windfall for these \nchildren. It hasn't been from the time President George W. Bush signed \nit into law until today. It simply provides commonsense protections \nsuch as requiring the children who arrive alone to be interviewed by a \nchild welfare specialist and have a meaningful opportunity to tell \ntheir story to a judge. That is how we identify victims of trafficking \nor sexual violence or persecution. If improving the efficiency of the \nprocess is the goal, the administration already has the discretion to \ndo that. The funding for immigration judges and legal assistance in the \nsupplemental will further help. We can address this humanitarian crisis \nwithout watering down our law. We don't have to turn our backs on our \nown basic values as Americans--the basic values that brought my \ngrandparents to Italy from Vermont and my great-great grandparents from \nIreland to Vermont. It is our humanitarian values. Let's not turn our \nbacks on them.\n  The problem, in fact, we are facing now could be alleviated in part \nif the Republican-controlled House of Representatives would allow a \nvote on the Senate's comprehensive immigration reform bill, S. 744. We \nhad hundreds of hours of hearings, of markups, of debate, sometimes \ngoing late into the evening, and then days of debate on the floor, and \nwe passed it by a strong bipartisan majority. We passed this bill 1 \nyear ago, and the Republican leadership in the House will not even \nallow it to come to a vote, even though it would probably pass in the \nsame form as we did. They will not let it come to a vote because \nwhether people vote for or against it, there are some people who will \ndisagree with the vote, so it is easier to vote maybe. No matter what \nthe humanitarian crisis we have, vote maybe. Don't vote yes, don't vote \nno; vote maybe by not voting, but then blame it on the President, blame \nit on everybody else.\n\n  The Senate stepped up and we passed a bill the President said he \nwould sign. The Senate-passed bill calls for nearly 20,000 new Border \nPatrol agents, 3,500 additional Customs and Border Protection officers, \nand 700 miles of fencing. We have heard people stand and say--as though \nthey suddenly found this out--we need tougher laws to fight back \nagainst coyotes and cartels that want an opportunity to exploit these \nvulnerable children. I have heard some of the same people refuse to \nvote on a bill and say we need this protection. Read the bill. S. 744 \ndoes that too. It has tougher provisions to fight against human \nsmuggling and enhanced penalties in situations that result in serious \nbodily injury, death, bribery or corruption.\n  We have done it. We have done it in the Senate. Why isn't there a hue \nand cry? I understand it is very easy, if you are going to do a sound \nbite for the evening news or something, to stand up and say: Why \nhaven't Obama and the Democrats acted? It takes a little bit more time \nto say: Why haven't you voted for a bill that does everything you say \nis needed? Why won't the Republican leadership even allow the House \nMembers--Republicans and Democrats--to vote on a bill that does \neverything they say they need?\n  I want to thank Senators Harkin and Feinstein and Durbin for their \ncomments at the last week's Appropriations Committee hearing. It is \nclear to me that they, too, understand our Nation is at a crossroads \nwith this crisis. The world is watching how we are going to respond. \nHow is the greatest Nation on Earth going to respond?\n  I know one person who spoke out: Pope Francis. He has urged us to \nprotect these children. Well, I think the Pope is right.\n  We have a choice. We can either make good on the promises we have \nalready written into our law and Republicans and Democrats have voted \nfor, or we can decide: Gosh, we didn't mean it. We voted for it, we \ngave great press conferences, but we did not mean it. Now, gee whiz, it \nis complicated--as though life is always easy--so let's just rewrite \nthe law. If we do that, just send these children back. Send these \nchildren back to the murderers, the rapists, the gangs. Doesn't that \nturn our back on the very principles on which this Nation was founded--\nthe principles that brought my grandparents here from Italy, my great-\ngrandparents here from Ireland?\n  Where are those principles? We forgot them at the beginning of the \nHolocaust. We look at the people who died, the number of Jews who went \nto the ovens because we had forgotten our principles.\n  Well, President George W. Bush was right in signing the bill. The \nRepublicans and Democrats who voted for it were right. Let's not turn \nour backs. If we want to do something beyond the sound bites, something \nrealistic, pass the supplemental for the people we need to do it for \nand allow the House of Representatives to vote up or down on the bill \nthat Republicans and Democrats voted for here in the Senate a whole \nyear ago. But do not let the supplemental request be a political \nfootball. It should be passed clean, without delay. Do not try to \nremove all the protections for victims of human trafficking.\n\n[[Page S4537]]\n\n  Pass the supplemental, and then have the courage to stand up and vote \nyes or no on S. 744. We did here in the Senate. Republicans and \nDemocrats came together. A large majority of us passed it in the \nSenate. Why can't the House of Representatives do the same thing? I \nwill tell you why. They are afraid whichever way they vote, it might be \nunpopular. Well, that is what you expect. I have cast more votes than \nall but a half dozen Senators in the history of this country. Can \nanybody go back through all those thousands upon thousands of votes and \nfind some they could attack me on? Of course. I could give them a list \nmyself. Can I find some that I probably on second thought wish I had \ncast differently? Of course I can. But I had the courage to vote yes or \nno. I was criticized when I became the first Vermonter--in fact, the \nonly Vermonter--to ever vote against the war in Vietnam. The \nauthorization was cut off by one vote. Today it would be hard to find \nanybody who supported that war.\n  My point is not whether as a Senator from Vermont I vote right or \nwrong or any one of us as a Senator from our State votes right or \nwrong--but at least vote. That is what we said we would do when we were \nelected: vote. So I am talking about what is wrong with immigration law \nwhen you are afraid to even vote one way or the other. But let's not \nturn our back on the principles this country stands for. Let's not say \nto 7- or 8- or 9-year-old children--trying to escape a fate that my \nchildren or my grandchildren would never face--sorry, we are too great \nand big and busy a country to worry about you. Go back and face your \nfate, whatever it might be, because we don't care. That is not the \nAmerica I serve. That is not the America I love. That is not the place \nwhere the Senate should be if we are going to be the conscience of the \nNation.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I want to spend a few minutes discussing \nthe effect and the premise of the legislation on which we just decided \nnot to move forward.\n  I have spent 25 years of my life caring for women. There is not a \ncomplication of pregnancy I have not handled. I have seen every aspect \nof it. I have delivered babies the size of my little finger and watched \nthem move their little arms, not yet far enough along to survive. I \nhave cared for women in the midst of lost pregnancies and the tragedy \nand trauma and the heartbreak. I have cared for women who have had \nabortions and the complications that has completed and exacerbated in \ntheir own lives from psychological to real physical problems. I have \nactually performed abortions to save women's lives who had severe \ncongenital heart defects and would have died had their pregnancy \ncontinued.\n  But the premise under which this bill was brought forward is an \nabsolute false premise. You see, I come from Oklahoma. David Green and \nhis family come from Oklahoma. They are the owners of Hobby Lobby. They \nare one of the finest groups of people I have ever met in my life. They \nare responsible corporate citizens. But everything they have done in \ntheir life is guided by their faith and their ethics. Therefore, they \nare not open on Sunday because they feel their employees have a right \nto a restful weekend. They pay a very livable wage. They have always \nhad health insurance.\n  The Supreme Court decision was about religious freedom and whether I, \nas a private businessperson, am still entitled to that as I carry on \ncommerce in this country.\n  What has been described--maybe not specifically but negatively--is \nthat Hobby Lobby and the Green family do not appreciate women or their \ncontributions or their rights or their freedoms. Nothing could be \nfurther from the truth. They had a very personal objection to four \nabortifacients--not birth control pills--four medicines, devices that \nactually kill a living human being. See, what we do not think about \nvery often--and I think about all the time--is that when an egg and a \nsperm unite, there is created something that has never been created \nbefore: a unique human being. The genetic material will be no different \nat conception than it is when you are 85 years old. It is unique. It \nhas never before been here; it will never again be here.\n  So based on these deeply held beliefs and ethics--and what I would \nsay is morals--they chose to supply their entire employee network with \n16 different methods of birth control. But the four that actually kill \na baby that has been formed--they thought it was their religious right \nto be able to say they should not have to take money out of their \npocket to pay for something that goes against their strongly held \nmoral, ethical, and faith beliefs.\n  So we have had a reaction. It is political in nature. It does not \nhave much to do with the facts. It has a lot to do with darkness, of \nsaying something is so that is not true, and saying it often enough so \nwe can tell people that here are those terrible Republicans and they \nwant to hurt women.\n  I dedicated 25 years of my life to helping women in every type of \ntragedy, every type of disease, whether it is cancer or diabetes or \nhypertension or pregnancy or miscarriages or just the common cold. \nBefore the Senate forced me to stop delivering babies, I was delivering \nbabies that I delivered; in other words, it was the third generation. \nThat is how crazy the Senate ethics rules are.\n  So the very undercurrent of what we heard could not be further from \nthe truth. What we heard--the implications were that the Green family \nis somehow this negative corporate monster who wants to take women's \nrights away--is absolutely untrue.\n  The other falsehood we hear is that if you do not have health care, \nyou do not have available birth control. We spend $400 million a year \non title 19, most of which is in birth control pills that are given out \nto women who do not have access. It costs $7 a month to buy birth \ncontrol pills, and most physicians, like myself, who had women who \ncould not either access title 19 or who did not have $7 a month, gave \nthe pills themselves out of their stocks, their samples.\n  So there is a reality other than what has been painted in the Senate, \nand I could not sit by and let this hang out, this terrible untruth. I \ndo not know of a family business, I do not know of a business in \nAmerica that cares more about its employees than Hobby Lobby, and it is \nmanifested through the employee loyalty and also the success of their \nbrand because they really have a team. And you do not have a team if \nyou do not feel as if you are being cared for--that you are not one of \nthe group.\n  There are a lot of problems in front of this country. But the one \ndescribed in this last piece of legislation is not one of them. The \nGreen family does not keep anybody from buying abortifacients if they \nwant them. They are not all that expensive. The morning-after pill is \nover the counter. But to force a person of faith to pay for an action \nagainst what they believe is morally wrong. It is far away from the \nreligious liberties our Constitution guarantees.\n  I know we can get hyped up on emotion, but the emotion we ought to \nget hyped on is preserving the rights our Founders guaranteed when they \nstarted this country. They were based on the same set of beliefs the \nGreen family inculcates into everything they do with Hobby Lobby. It is \npretty ironic to me that we have become so post-modern, so smart, so \n``for'' what the government can do and mandate that we are willing to \ndestroy the very freedoms that created this country in the first place.\n  This bill was a cynical attack on truth. I am glad it is not \nproceeding. It is time to quit wasting the Senate's time on political \ngames and start addressing the very real problems this country has, \nsuch as the fact that Social Security disability will run out of money \nnext month; the fact that one-third of those on disability who are not \ntruly disabled are threatening the livelihood of those who truly are; \nthe fact that Medicare, 17 years from now or 16 years from now, will be \nout of money; the fact that Social Security will be out of money in 18 \nyears; the fact that we are having corporations leave this country in a \nmass flood because we\n\n[[Page S4538]]\n\nhave a Tax Code that is not competitive with the rest of the world; the \nfact that we are wasting $250 billion a year on duplicative programs \nthat do not accomplish the goals which the Congress set out for them. \nYet we have no leadership that says we are going to address the very \nreal problems in front of the country. It is not a great record to be \nproud of.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I ask to be recognized to speak as if in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Honoring Our Armed Forces\n\n                     Second Lieutenant Noah Harris\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I wish to share an experience I had a \ncouple of weeks ago while riding the mountains of North Georgia to my \nhome. I was in the pickup truck alone, driving my red Silverado from a \nplace in the mountains. I spent a lot of time thinking--which I try to \ndo when I get a few moments to myself--about all the difficult \npositions we are now in as a country. I thought about our border with \nMexico and all the Central American children who are coming through, \nhuddled on the border, and the crisis there. I thought about Syria and \nthe tragedy of that civil war. I thought about the fact that the \nIsraelis and Hamas are firing rockets back and forth from Gaza and into \nthe mainland of Israel. I thought about the fact that we are now \nnegotiating with Iran, our archenemy. I thought about the fact that \nVladimir Putin decided to take advantage of the vacuum that has been \ncreated in world leadership and moved into Crimea, threatening Kiev and \nthreatening Ukraine. I thought about all the crises we have along the \nway.\n  Then I came to Ellijay, GA, a little town known for its apples and \nits population of 2,000 great Georgia citizens.\n  I came to Poole's Bar-B-Q, which is a landmark along the highway in \nEllijay, GA. I stopped, and all of a sudden all those thoughts I had of \nthe wars going on, the conflicts going on, the strife and the trouble \ngoing on all culminated in Gilmer County, because in Gilmer County in \n2005 I attended the funeral of Noah Harris. Noah Harris was killed in \nIraq in 2005.\n  I thought about his story, and I thought about our position now, and \nI thought about some message I want to send to my country and to this \nbody of the Senate.\n  Let me talk about Noah Harris. Noah Harris was a cheerleader at the \nUniversity of Georgia. On the Saturday before 9/11 in 2001, he was in \nSanford Stadium with 92,000 fans of the Georgia Bulldogs cheering on \nthe team.\n  Then, like the rest of the world, he saw the terrible attack of 9/11 \nin 2001--in New York City, in Shanksville, PA, and in Washington, DC.\n  On the morning of the 12th, he got out of bed in the dormitory and he \nwent straight to the Army ROTC building in Athens, GA, and told them he \nwanted to sign up for an ROTC commission because he wanted to go fight \nwhoever it was who killed those 3,000 citizens of the world tragically \nin New York City.\n  They said: Noah, you can't get a commission in just a year. You only \nhave a year left.\n  He said: I can double up and do it. I want to go for my country. I \nwant to go for what is right. I want to go fight for America.\n  He became a second lieutenant in the 3rd Infantry Division, and, sure \nenough, 3 years after that, he was in Iraq. He became known as the \nBeanie Baby soldier because he had his pockets stuffed with Beanie \nBabies. And as he would go through Ghazaliya, where he was stationed \nnear Baghdad, he would hand out Beanie Babies to the Iraqi children. He \nwas like a pied piper. Unfortunately, in the 11th month of his tour, a \nrocket-propelled grenade his hit humvee and he and two of his buddies \nwere killed instantly in Iraq.\n  I didn't know Noah Harris, but I went to the funeral that day \nbecause, as a Senator from Georgia, I wanted to pay my respects to a \nsoldier who paid the ultimate sacrifice in the war on terror.\n  So as I was riding through Gilmer County a couple weeks ago, thinking \nabout the crises we have today around the world and then thinking about \nNoah Harris, I thought to myself, there is a message all of us need to \nremember: Those soldiers should never have died in vain, and we have to \nmake sure they did not.\n  In Iraq 4,486 American soldiers were killed in Operation Iraqi \nFreedom. In Afghanistan, to date, 2,319--a total of 6,805--most of them \nAmericans, some of them immigrants seeking their citizenship in America \nand fighting for America in our Armed Forces--fought for the rights and \nfreedoms that all our Founding Fathers stood for, fought for all the \nreasons we serve in this body today, fought for all the reasons that \nAmerica is the great and noble country it is around the world.\n  But right now there is an absence of leadership in the world, and \nbecause of it we are seeing one crisis come up after another. I worry \nthat Noah Harris, who died in Iraq in 2005, might--and I underscore the \nword ``might''--have died in vain if we don't recognize our \nresponsibilities and see to it that we try and prevent what has been \nhappening lately from continuing to happen.\n  There is a decision point coming to the United States of America--it \nis coming next year. It is one I want to encourage the President to \nthink about deeply and for all of us to think about deeply.\n  We have lost Iraq to ISIS. ISIS is a renegade group of terrorists who \nhave basically taken over that country and partnered with some of the \nterrorists in Syria to control Iraq.\n  One of the reasons they did that is we left a huge vacuum in Iraq \nwhen we pulled out. We pulled every American soldier out. I know it was \nour goal to leave after the surge worked--and that was the right thing \nto do. But it wasn't the right thing to pull out every single soldier, \nbecause we abandoned all the infrastructure that we had built. We \nabandoned the image of American strength and power. We abandoned the \nability for us to be agile in a dangerous part of the world.\n  In Afghanistan, we are supposed to pull our troops out at the \nbeginning of next year. Some of them should come home but not all of \nthem. We have invested billions of dollars in American hardware and \nAmerican money to see to it we had the best support in the world for \nour soldiers in Afghanistan. If we abandon Bagram, if we abandon \nKabul--if we abandon Afghanistan, the same thing will happen in \nAfghanistan as happened in Iraq. And those soldiers, the 2,319 who died \nin Afghanistan, will have in part died in vain because we abandoned \nwhat they built. We abandoned what they protected. We abandoned the \ninvestment they made.\n  We need also to remember what happened on 9/11 of 2001, when we \ndecided to go into Iraq and then later into Afghanistan. We didn't have \nenough infrastructure in that part of the world to make an invasion. We \nhad to rent the Kyrgyzstan airport near Russia to be able to fly our \ntroops in to begin positioning outside of the Tora Bora area in \nAfghanistan.\n  We have built tremendous infrastructure, we have built tremendous \nbases, and we have tremendous assets for which the taxpayers of the \nUnited States have paid. We should maintain a presence there so we are \nagile; so our SEALs teams, if needed, can be positioned; so that the \nrest of the world knows that while the war may be over and America has \ncome home, it hasn't left. It hasn't abandoned us. An American presence \nwill remain--just as we have in Germany, just as we have in Japan, just \nas we have in South Korea. Our best friends today were our enemies 40, \n50, and 60 years ago, because America didn't leave when the fight was \nover. We need to make sure that relationship happens in Afghanistan so \nwe can begin to build our presence in that part of the world and be \nthat somebody who prohibits and inhibits terrorism and people like ISIS \nfrom taking over countries.\n  Make no mistake about it. Vladimir Putin has been encouraged by an \nabsence of leadership, and ISIS took advantage of an absence of \nleadership. What is going on between Hamas and Israel in the Gaza Strip \nis an absence of leadership, in part on our part. We can't sit around \nand be bystanders. We have to recommit ourselves to the effort in that \npart of the world because\n\n[[Page S4539]]\n\nin the end the peace and security of America from terrorism and from \nthose who would bring us down is not our looking the other way and not \nliving up to our responsibility to the Noah Harrises of the world who \ngave the ultimate sacrifice in Iraq in 2005--all because he watched \nwhat we all watched that morning of 9/11 in 2001, and said: This shall \nnot stand. I want to volunteer to fight for my country. And he joined \nour Army and did so.\n  God bless Noah Harris. God bless his parents, Rick and Lucy. God \nbless the United States of America. May we remember our responsibility \nnot to leave what we have built and remain a beacon of peace, liberty, \nand democracy around the world.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                          Veterans Health Care\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I wanted to inform the Members about an \nimportant hearing that was held this morning in the Senate Veterans' \nCommittee. I also wish to thank the Members of the Senate who, in the \nmidst of a very partisan environment last month, voted with 93 votes--\noverwhelming support--to pass a very significant piece of legislation \nto help the men and women who put their lives on the line to defend our \ncountry--legislation that was written by Senator McCain and myself, and \nI thank him very much for his help in this effort.\n  One of the important provisions in that legislation was an \nunderstanding that the needs of our veterans are a cost of war. They \nare a cost of war just as much as guns and tanks and planes and \nmissiles are a cost of war. It seems to me to be fairly obvious that if \nwe spend trillions of dollars fighting the wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, it is absolutely appropriate to make sure we have money \navailable on an emergency basis to take care of the men and women who \nuse those guns and tanks and missiles and who put their lives on the \nline and, in some cases, never come home.\n  So the first point I wish to make is that if we send people to war, \nwe should always understand that a cost of that war is taking care of \nour veterans.\n  I recall--and I see the chairperson of the Appropriations Committee \nand she will recall this as well--that when this country went to war in \nIraq and after in Afghanistan--and let me be clear, I voted against the \nwar in Iraq--but when we went to war in Iraq and in Afghanistan, the \nunderstanding was that this is emergency funding; that our troops, no \nmatter how one voted on the war, needed the equipment to take care of \nthemselves, to protect themselves, and to win the mission. That is \nexactly where we are today. We want to win this mission. The mission we \nare involved in now is making sure the men and women who served this \ncountry in the military get quality care in a timely manner. That is \nthe mission we have to win now, and that, in my view, is a cost of war.\n  I think there is not widespread awareness of what the cost of war is, \nand I hope, A, we never get into more wars in the future, but that if \nwe ever do, people understand that any budget for war must include the \nneeds of veterans--not 2 years after the war but 70 years after the \nwar. When some veteran is sitting in some room in an apartment without \nlegs, without arms, without eyesight, that is a cost of war and we \ndon't desert those people--not tomorrow, not 50 years from now, not 70 \nyears from now. Our moral commitment is to make certain we provide for \nthose who defend us.\n  I think there is not sufficient understanding about what the cost of \nwar truly is. I wish to mention just a few facts people should \nunderstand. Over 2 million men and women served this country in \nAfghanistan and in Iraq. Studies are very clear that 20 to 30 percent \nof those men and women have come home with post-traumatic stress \ndisorder or traumatic brain injury. That is between 400,000 to 500,000 \nmen and women who are coming home with PTSD or TBI. What that \ntranslates into is men and women who are struggling every single day. \nIt translates into outrageously high rates of suicide for younger \nveterans, substance abuse, inability to hold on to a job and earn a \nliving; many of these folks have a difficult time being around people. \nIt translates into divorce. It translates into emotional problems for \nkids and for other family members.\n  Since fiscal year 2006, the number of veterans receiving specialized \nmental health treatment has risen from over 927,000 to more than 1.4 \nmillion in fiscal year 2013. Today, and every day, approximately 49,000 \nveterans are receiving outpatient mental health appointments. Let me \nrepeat that. Today, some 49,000 veterans in 50 States in this country \nare receiving mental health appointments. That is a staggering number. \nDuring the last 4 years, VA outpatient mental health visits have \nincreased from $14 million a year to more than $18 million a year. This \nis just one of the problems facing the veterans community. How do we \nprovide the psychiatrists, the social workers, the psychologists, the \ncounselors we need? It is a huge issue because PTSD and TBI are very \ntough illnesses.\n  In addition, what we are looking at now--and every Member of the \nSenate is familiar with this--is outrageously high waiting periods for \nveterans to get into the VA. Time and time again I hear from veterans \nin Vermont and I hear from veterans all over the country; I hear from \nveterans organizations and I read independent surveys which tell me \nthat when veterans get into the VA, the quality of the care they get is \ngood. I just met 2 hours ago with a veterans organization--same thing: \nOnce people get into the system, the quality of care is generally good; \nthe problem is accessing the care. The problem is appointments.\n  I will not read to my colleagues all of the statistics, but trust me \nthe waiting lines all over this country are much too high in many parts \nof America. There are other people who never even made it to the \nwaiting lines. This has to do with a whole lot of issues that we have \ndiscussed.\n  The bottom line is we must address the waiting time issue and make \nsure that in the very near future, every veteran who is in need of \nhealth care gets that health care in a timely manner.\n  Sloan Gibson, who is the Acting Secretary of the VA----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is informed that the \ntime is under Republican control, if the Senator would suspend.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Could I ask my colleague just for 3 more minutes?\n  Mr. RISCH. The Senator may do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from Vermont is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, Senator \nSanders is speaking. Senator Risch, I believe, is going to speak. The \ntime now is on unaccompanied children; am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The unanimous consent agreement was that the \nRepublicans control the time until 4:30.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. OK.\n  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. RISCH. I ask unanimous consent that----\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I haven't yielded the floor. I reserved my right to \nobject. I am just clarifying. So Senator Sanders wishes to speak, and \nas I understand it, I have time--this is not in any way to interfere \nwith the Senator from Idaho, but at 4:30 I am supposed to have the time \nunder the time controlled by the Democrats; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We already agreed to the unanimous consent \nrequest that the Republicans control the time until 4:30.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. How much time is--all I am trying to do is know when I \nam going to be able to speak.\n  If I could turn to the Senator from Idaho, how long does he intend to \nspeak?\n  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I intend to speak for about 4\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I withdraw my objection. I think we deserve to hear \nSenator Sanders, and I will wait patiently for my turn.\n  Mr. RISCH. I thank the Senator from Maryland.\n\n[[Page S4540]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I thank very much the Senator from Idaho.\n  Let me wrap it up by making the point that Acting Secretary Gibson \nmade this morning which was a very simple but important one. What he \nsaid is we must address the immediate crisis of ending these \noutrageously long waiting periods that veterans are now experiencing in \norder to get into the VA. Right now--and I am proud of what he is \ndoing--they are moving very aggressively to get veterans all over this \ncountry into private health care when necessary and any other form of \nhealth care, to make sure those waiting periods go down. I think they \nare doing a pretty good job. They have to continue to do that, but we \nshould be mindful that this is going to be a very expensive process.\n  The other point he made, which is equally important, is that long \nterm, if the goal is to end these unacceptable waiting periods, we have \nto give the VA the staffing and the space and the facilities and the \ninfrastructure they need.\n  He came forward with what I recognize is a very big pricetag. His \npricetag was $17.6 billion, so we can get the 10,000 more staff we \nneed, the doctors, the psychiatrists, the primary health care \nphysicians, the mental health counselors we need, get the space we \nneed, because in many facilities around the country the staff can't \noperate because they don't have adequate space.\n  So what I would say to my colleagues, if we are serious about \naddressing this very important problem, we will go forward in two ways. \nNo. 1, immediate crisis, let's end those waiting lists. Let's contract \nout when necessary to private physicians.\n  Long term, it is absolutely imperative that the VA have the \ninfrastructure it needs so we don't have this crisis again 2 years from \ntoday.\n  The last point, I reiterate. If we send people off to war--if we make \nthat enormously difficult, painful decision--I hope every Member in \nthis body understands that taking care of veterans is a cost of that \nwar and that we have a moral responsibility to do everything we can \nwith them and for them and their families.\n  Before I yield the floor, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record a memorandum submitted by Acting Secretary Sloan Gibson at \nour committee hearing earlier today.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 16, 2014.\n\n                    Memorandum for Chairman Sanders\n\n     From: Sloan D. Gibson, Acting Secretary of Veterans Affairs.\n     Regarding: Testimony at July 16, 2014 Senate Committee on \n         Veterans' Affairs Hearing.\n\n       Per your request, attached for your information is a \n     summary of additional resource needs through FY2017 that I \n     outlined in my testimony today before the Senate Committee on \n     Veterans' Affairs.\n       In developing the resource requirements, the overarching \n     goals were to:\n       Support the work of the Senate-House conference committee \n     to improve Veterans' access to medical care and services.\n       Ensure that VA has the resources necessary to deliver \n     timely, high quality care and benefits to Veterans enrolled \n     in the VA system.\n       Schedule all Veteran appointments within standards of \n     acceptable care.\n       Enhance and reform infrastructure that enables VA medical \n     care (i.e. facilities construction/IT improvements) to \n     modernize VA's operations and provide access to care when and \n     where Veterans want it.\n       Further, the resource requirements were shaped by \n     principles that the Administration believes should be key to \n     any discussion of VA resource needs. These principles \n     include:\n       Leverage contract care where necessary, but focus efforts \n     on incentivizing improvements in the VA system itself--\n     Consider referrals to non-VA care to address burgeoning \n     workload as a temporary stop-gap to immediately address the \n     current problem, but concurrently look to strengthen the VA \n     system by including incentives and resources for VA to \n     deliver care in-house.\n       Require cost-effective, coordinated care--Make efficient \n     use of taxpayer dollars by ensuring quality care is delivered \n     in a cost-effective way. Require VA to actively coordinate a \n     Veteran's care across all care environments.\n       Modernize VA infrastructure and processes--Ensure that VA \n     facilities and IT infrastructure are modernized and equipped \n     to meet increasing demand for services; reform VA IT delivery \n     and procurement to make it more effective in delivering \n     services to Veterans.\n       Support VA system without undercutting other national \n     priorities--Given that VA is required to provide quality care \n     to Veterans--and faces serious resources needs not \n     contemplated when budget caps were negotiated--funding to \n     support the ramp-up of VA medical care contemplated below \n     must be provided outside of current base discretionary \n     resources.\n       If you need any additional information, please do not \n     hesitate to contact me.\n\n                                       VA RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS FACT SHEET\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n               Investments to Address VA Access to Care and Modernize Infrastructure and Processes\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                  Resource                     Cost ($Billions)              Summary of Use of Funds\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIncreasing Veterans' System-wide Access to                $10.0   Access: $8.2B for approximately 10,000\n Care.                                                            primary care and specialty care physicians,\n                                                                  and other clinical/medical staff including\n                                                                  physicians, nurses, social workers, mental\n                                                                  health professionals, and others--and funds\n                                                                  other associated expenses such as equipment,\n                                                                  supplies, and other overhead costs\n                                                                  Hepatitis-C Drugs: $1.3B for critical\n                                                                  new therapies over the next 2 years for higher\n                                                                  than expected costs for two new Hepatitis C\n                                                                  drug therapies that are significantly more\n                                                                  effective and carry fewer side effects\n                                                                  Caregivers Program: $186M is estimated\n                                                                  to support higher-than-expected demand for the\n                                                                  Caregivers program (over approximately 22,000\n                                                                  Caregivers in total)\nIT Enhancements.............................               $1.2   IT Infrastructure: Additional funding\n                                                                  is needed to provide IT support in new space\n                                                                  generated by major and minor construction and\n                                                                  Non-Recurring Maintenance (NRM).\n                                                                  Project Development: Additional\n                                                                  funding is needed for the development of OIT\n                                                                  programs.

The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Risch pertaining to the introduction of S. 2616 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. RISCH. I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time between now \nand 5:30 p.m. will be controlled by the majority party.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n\n\n                             Refugee Crisis\n\n  Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, for the next hour a number of us from \nthe Democratic Caucus will be talking about the Central American \nrefugee crisis. We are lucky to be joined by Senator Mikulski, the \nchairwoman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, to get us started \ntoday. So I look forward very much to hearing what she has to say and \nyou will be hearing from me in a little bit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about an urgent \ncrisis at our border in which over 250 children a week are coming from \nCentral America, fleeing horrific gang violence--horrific gang \nviolence--to seek refuge and asylum in the United States of America.\n  This is being called a crisis at the border. Well, it is a border \ncrisis, but the crisis actually begins in Central America, where \nbrutal, violent gangs, based on organized crime, are either trying to \nrecruit the boys into organized crime, drug smuggling, human \ntrafficking, or to recruit the girls into human trafficking in other \njust dangerous and repugnant circumstances.\n\n[[Page S4541]]\n\n  But when you go to the border the way I have, you will see that the \nsituation is dire. It is dire because, as these children come to the \nborder, crossing the Rio Grande--probably within really almost a 50-\nmile stretch of the Grande; it is not over the 1,900 miles of the \nGrande--they come and, actually, they do not try to sneak in, they come \nright up to where the border control is and they have pieces of paper \nwith their name on it. They are then taken into custody by border \ncontrol. They are placed into holding cells that are designed for adult \nmales. They were designed to hold drug smugglers, narcotraffickers, and \nnow they hold as many as 20 or 30 or 40 children, while under the law \nthey are to be placed in the hands of the Health and Human Services \nAgency while their legal and asylum status is being verified.\n  Well, I am telling you, the entire infrastructure for dealing with \nthese children--from the way the border control is trying to take care \nof them, the overrunning of the capacity of these holding cells, to the \nbacklog on processing their legal and asylum determination, to really \ntrying to place them in facilities under the care of Health and Human \nServices--the situation is dire.\n  The President of the United States has asked for emergency funding to \ndeal with it. I hope we consider this emergency funding. The amount of \nmoney the President is seeking is $3.7 billion. This is to care for the \nhumanitarian needs of the children, the enforcement at the border, the \nidentifying of their legal status under a law passed under the \nadministration of President Bush to deal with the trafficking of \nchildren, both boys and girls, and also for robust deterrence in the \nhome countries where these children are coming from. But the deterrence \ncomes from breaking down and prosecuting organized crime syndicates of \nthe smugglers and the traffickers.\n  We are also asking for money to conduct a massive educational \ncampaign advising Central American families against the dangers and \nfalse hopes of this journey. The journey is, indeed, dangerous. They \ncome on foot. They come by car. They ride the tops of a train that is \nreferred to as The Beast. There was one little girl who I spoke to with \nSecretary Johnson. She had stayed awake for 2 days on the rooftop of a \ntrain, terrified that she would fall off and be mutilated, just to be \nable to make it into the United States of America. And why did she make \nsuch a perilous, dangerous journey? It was because they were trying to \nrecruit her into these violent and vile ways.\n  We need to make sure Central America, with our help, goes after the \nseven organized crime units that we know are sparking this, that are \ntrying to recruit these kids; giving them false promises too, that if \nthey come to this country, they will be able to get a free pass somehow \nfor getting into this country. We need to be able to stop this and be \nable to deal with it in the most effective way.\n  The President's program actually does outline the money to be able to \ndo that. When the children do come, as I said, while they are awaiting \ntheir legal status to be determined, they are placed in the hands of \nHHS. Now, HHS does not run group homes. HHS does not run foster care. \nHHS funds it, and they need to be able to turn to local communities to \nbe able to have these children be able to stay.\n  I saw fantastic work being done while the children were being placed \nat Lackland Air Force Base and the social services were being run by--\nunder contract of a faith-based organization--the Baptist church. I \nknow the distinguished Presiding Officer knows a lot about human \nservices. I myself am a social worker, and I will tell you that faith-\nbased organization is really running a good program for these kids.\n  But we are running out of money. We need money for food and shelter \nfor the children. We need money for the border agents. We need money \nfor transportation to shelters and also transportation, when we can, \nreturning these children home. We need money for immigration judges and \nlegal services for the children to determine their asylum status, and, \nas I said, we need the muscular deterrence in the home country breaking \nup the organized gangs that then create the violence that then sets \nthese children on this journey.\n  The best way to make sure the surge of children is stopped is not by \nharsher immigration laws. It is by making it hard on the drug dealers \nand the human traffickers, the smugglers, the coyotes. Because they are \nthe ones who are the reason they are coming.\n  Looking at the data--looking at data--we see that these children are \ncoming not only where there is high poverty, but that children are \ncoming where there is a high level of crime, particularly homicide, \nmurder, and other recruitment of children. These children are almost \nbeing recruited by child soldiers in their own country to engage in \nviolent criminal activity.\n  So we need to be able to look at this emergency supplemental and be \nable to meet the human needs while the children are here, make sure we \nfund the judges, the immigration judges and the legal services, to \ndetermine their asylum status, and be able to take care of them.\n\n  Already, 60,000 unaccompanied children have come into our country \nduring this last year. In the 2 weeks I toured the border, I saw young \nchildren as young as 5 with one instruction: Cross the border, turn \nyourself in, and try to get as safe as you can. Border agents find \nthese children often dehydrated, malnourished, and usually a victim of \nsome type of trauma. Also, they have heard false promises from the \nsmugglers about what it will be when they come here.\n  These smugglers--as part of these dangerous gangs and cartels--see \nwomen and children as a commodity to be bought, sold, transported, as \nif they were cargo. Children leave these homes based on lies. They \nthink they are coming to an area where they will never have to go home \nor that they will be safe. I hope we then pass this appropriations. I \nhope in passing the appropriations we will be able to protect the \nsafety of the children, we determine their legal and asylum status, and \nwe have this muscular deterrent strategy in the home country.\n  There are those who want to have a new immigration policy or want to \nrepeal the George Bush law. I would caution that because, remember, our \nproblem is not the children; our problem is what causes the children to \ncome. We have to go after what causes the children to come; and that is \nthe drug dealers, the smugglers, the coyotes, those who are engaging in \nsuch violent crime.\n  The host countries, along with Mexico, need to help deal with this, \nand we need to marshal our law enforcement resources to be able to help \nthem do this. Now they say: Let's bring in the National Guard at the \nborder. What is our National Guard going to do? When these little kids \ncross the Rio Grande, they are going to go right up to that soldier, \nput their arms around his or her leg, and say: I need to be safe. Can \nyou help me? What is the National Guard going to do? It is not a border \nenforcement problem; it is a criminal gang problem in Central America.\n  So we need to be able to be sure we are targeting the right areas in \norder to solve this problem. The children are not the threats. They are \ncoming here because they are threatened themselves. We need to meet \nthese urgent humanitarian needs, and we need to focus on our hemisphere \nto break up the gangs and crime.\n  Later on today we are going to have a briefing for every single \nSenator so they can ask the questions about this situation. Who are the \nchildren? Why are they coming? What are their legal rights under the \nlaw? But how can we effectively deal with this children's march, where \nthe children are in danger in their host country and on the long \njourney to this one?\n  We are also asking that this $3.7 billion be designated as an \nemergency.\n  There are those who will want to take from other domestic programs. I \nwould caution that. In fact, I would object to the very idea. The \nPresident has said this is an emergency because under the Budget \nControl Act of 2011 it meets the criteria that it is sudden, urgent, \nunforeseen, and temporary, deals with the loss of life, property, or \nour national security interests. I think it meets that test. I do not \nwant to take offsets from existing programs to do this. It is \nunexpected. It is significant. We can deal with it, but let's not do it \nat the expense of other programs designed to help the American family \nand the American middle class.\n  I know there are others who want to speak on this issue. I will have \nmore to\n\n[[Page S4542]]\n\nsay later, but for now let's examine the urgent supplemental and let's \nreally solve the problem at the border and what causes it to be a \nproblem for us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, let me start by thanking my colleague \nfrom Maryland for her leadership on the Appropriations Committee and \nher leadership on this difficult issue. She said something in caucus \nthe other day that really struck me. She said: Every Senator has an \nopinion on this, but not every Senator has the facts. Facts matter. \nThey make for good policy.\n  Last week I had the opportunity, along with Secretary Johnson, to \nvisit a temporary facility for refugee mothers and their children that \nis in my home State of New Mexico. The holding area at this facility in \nArtesia, NM, is one of several ways that DHS is increasing its capacity \nto process the increasing number of families with children from Central \nAmerica who are crossing our southwest border.\n  On Monday, 40 individuals were repatriated back to Honduras. It is \nreported that more mothers and their children will be sent back to \ntheir countries of origin.\n  While I was at this facility, I saw firsthand the remarkable \ninteragency effort that it took to take a Federal law enforcement \ntraining center, a campus, and turn it into a safe and humane place for \nfamilies to stay while their cases are being processed.\n  But that is not all I saw while I was there. I watched a young boy \nplay soccer with his little brother, both of them clearly happy to be \nin the kind of secure environment where they could just be kids. I saw \na lot of mothers. I saw mothers whose faces were worried, who reflected \nthe clear concern about what the future would be for them and for their \nchildren. What I did not see at that facility--I did not see cartel \nmules. I did not see drug runners. I did not see criminals or gang \nmembers. Those were mothers and little kids. Most of those families \ncome from one of the most violent regions in the world today.\n  This current crisis is of grave concern to all of us. I know I have \nheard from a number of my constituents who wanted to know what they can \ndo to help. I have to give great credit to our local chamber of \ncommerce in Artesia, NM, as they worked hard as they received hundreds \nof donations from compassionate New Mexicans across the State hoping to \nmake a difference in these people's lives. They understand that this is \nfirst a humanitarian crisis. They also understand that we are a nation \nof laws, that our immigration system has been broken for a long time \nand needs to be fixed.\n  The Senate worked for months to address this, but the Republican-led \nHouse of Representatives refuses to even debate immigration reform, \nmuch less allow a vote on it. Instead, Republicans claim that the \nPresident's immigration policies, including deferred action for \nchildhood arrivals--or DACA, as it is known--caused a crisis at the \nborder. That could not be further from the truth. The increase in \nunaccompanied children started before President Obama created the DACA \nprogram 2 years ago. The United Nations High Commission on Refugees has \ndocumented an increased number of asylum seekers from El Salvador, \nHonduras, and Guatemala since 2009--a full 5 years ago. What is more, \nchildren crossing the border would not be eligible for DACA. In fact, \nthey would not be eligible for the Senate version of immigration \nreform.\n  These asylum seekers are not only fleeing to the United States but \nalso to the other neighboring countries in the region. They are fleeing \nto Panama, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Belize. In fact, those countries \nsaw a 712-percent spike in asylum cases from El Salvador, from \nHonduras, and Guatemala from 2008 to 2013, further demonstrating that \nchildren are not coming to the United States to apply for DACA. They \nare coming because their lives are at risk back home.\n  In interviews with over 400 children, the United Nations High \nCommission on Refugees found that no less than 58 percent of them were \nforcibly displaced because they suffered or faced harm that indicated a \npotential or actual need for international protection--an increase of \nmore than 400 percent from 2006.\n  Less than 1 percent of these kids spoke of immigration reform or some \nnew program or policy as the basis for coming to the United States. In \nfact, out of the 404 children who were interviewed, there were only 4--\n4 children who expressed a reason for coming that related to some part \nof the U.S. immigration system.\n  The reality is, as we heard from Senator Mikulski, what is driving \nchildren to our borders is unimaginable violence, corruption, extreme \npoverty, and instability in their home countries.\n  This picture was taken in Tegucigalpa in Honduras. This is frankly an \nall-too-common sight in Honduras today. Not only is the poverty \nunimaginable, but the violence we have seen is like nothing in recent \nhistory. Honduras has now the world's highest murder rate, with over 90 \nmurders per 100,000 persons annually. Last year approximately 1,000 \nyoung people under the age of 23 in Honduras were murdered--murdered in \na nation of only 8 million, 1,000 young people.\n\n  In a report published by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, \nthey found that 93 percent of crimes perpetrated against youth in \nHonduras go unpunished--completely unpunished.\n  The National Observatory of Violence reported that violent deaths of \nwomen increased by 246 percent between 2005 and 2012.\n  This is all the more unsettling to me because I know firsthand that \nHonduras did not always look this way. In the 1990s I traveled to \nHonduras with my wife Julie. We were on our honeymoon. We flew into San \nPedro Sula. The only time I felt any fear was trying to drive in a city \nthat moves a lot faster than I do when I try to drive on country roads \nin New Mexico. But we never had any fear for violence when we were in \nHonduras. We traveled around the country. We went to many places off \nthe beaten path.\n  That is very different today. Today San Pedro Sula is a city \nsynonymous with murder.\n  To understand just how bad it is, you can look at pictures like this \none of literally body bags getting ready to go to mass graves from \nmurders happening in these neighborhoods in San Pedro Sula. You can \nread a recent article in the New York Times by Frances Robles that \ntells the chilling story of Cristian, an 11-year-old sixth grader from \nHonduras who lost his father in March after he was robbed and murdered \nby gangs while working as a security guard protecting a pastry truck. \nIt is kind of hard to imagine needing a security guard to protect a \npastry truck. Three people he knows were murdered this year alone, and \nfour others were gunned down on a nearby corner in the span of 2 weeks \nat the beginning of the year. A girl his age resisted being robbed of \nthe sum of $5. She was clubbed over the head, dragged off by two men \nwho cut a hole in her throat and stuffed her underwear in it and left \nher body in a ravine across the street from Cristian's house.\n  Then there is Anthony, a 13-year-old from Honduras, who disappeared \nfrom his gang-ridden neighborhood. His younger brother Kenneth hopped \non his green bike to search for him, starting his hunt at a notorious \ngang hangout in the neighborhood. They were found within days of each \nother, both dead. Anthony, 13, and a friend had been shot in the head.\n  Kenneth, age 7, had been tortured and beaten with sticks and rocks. \nThey were among seven children murdered in the La Pradera neighborhood \nof San Pedro Sula in April alone--in 1 month.\n  El Salvador and Guatemala are the world's fourth and fifth highest in \nmurders. The Center for Gender and Refugee Studies found that in 2011, \nEl Salvador had the highest rate of gender-motivated killings of women \nin the entire world. In Guatemala, the Department of State reports \nwidespread human rights problems, including institutional corruption, \nparticularly in the police, in judicial sectors, kidnapping, drug \ntrafficking, execution, and often lethal violence against women.\n  We have a human crisis at our southern border that requires an \nimmediate but compassionate response. Yet instead of supporting the \nsupplemental which seeks to address the root causes of the crisis and \nprotect these vulnerable children, Republicans are trying to use the \ncrisis to promote fear and their border-enforcement-only agenda.\n\n[[Page S4543]]\n\n  Recently, a Republican Governor suggested that the President send the \nNational Guard to ``secure the border once and for all'' and that ``the \nborder between the U.S. and Mexico is less secure today than at any \ntime in the recent past.'' As I mentioned at the beginning of my \nremarks, facts are stubborn. This is simply not the case. In fact, the \nnotion that lax border policies are somehow responsible for this latest \ncrisis is not just a myth; it is a, well, full misrepresentation driven \nby politicians who would rather create a political issue than to solve \na very real problem.\n  The border today is more secure than it has ever been. There are more \nBorder Patrol agents on the ground. There are more resources. There is \nmore technology deployed on the border than at any time in our Nation's \nhistory--at any time. In fiscal year 2012, the Federal Government spent \nalmost $18 billion--$17.9 billion--on immigration enforcement. That is \n$3.5 billion more than the budgets of all the other Federal law \nenforcement agencies combined--$3.5 billion more than the FBI's budget, \nplus the DEA's budget, the ATF budget, plus the Secret Service, plus \nthe U.S. Marshals Service. These resources have made a difference. From \nfiscal year 2009 to 2012, the Department of Homeland Security seized 71 \npercent more currency, 39 percent more narcotics, 189 percent more \nweapons along the southwest border as compared to the last 4 years of \nthe Bush administration.\n  It is important to remember that this crisis from refugees in Central \nAmerica is not about children and families sneaking across our border \nlike criminals. As we heard from the Senator from Maryland, many of \nthese refugees seek out the first Border Patrol agent they can find in \norder to turn themselves in. Many of these children have walked across \nthe border or across the Rio Grande with identification literally \nsafety-pinned to their shirts. But that image does not serve the \npolitical interests of those who prefer a border crisis to a refugee \ncrisis.\n  Let's step back and remember that the Senate passed a comprehensive \nimmigration bill more than a year ago now--a bill that included \nincredibly important provisions to further strengthen our border but \nthat would also protect refugee children and crack down on the \nsmugglers and the transnational criminal organizations that are at the \nroot of the current crisis.\n  Notably, this bill was widely supported by both Democrats and \nRepublicans in the Senate Chamber.\n  Public support and good economics have not been enough to convince \nthe House leaders to hold a vote on immigration reform, but they cannot \nturn a blind eye to the current humanitarian crisis along our Nation's \nsouthern border.\n  Instead of attacking the President, Senate Republicans should work \nwith them to address the issue, and they should demand that their \ncolleagues in the House act to fix our broken immigration system.\n  Additionally, passing the $3.7 billion supplemental sends a clear \nsignal that we are aggressively stemming the flow of children and \nfamilies from Central America while continuing to treat these refugee \nchildren humanely and as required under the law. This situation is an \nemergency and we need emergency funding.\n  Our immigrant communities have helped to write the economic, social, \nand cultural history of America. I know this firsthand. My own father \nis an immigrant who came to this country as a boy from Nazi Germany in \nthe 1930s.\n  As a nation we value the twin promises of both freedom and \nopportunity. Those ideals are important no matter where you are born.\n  The fact is, our immigration system is broken. Those of us who \nrepresent border communities understand the challenge we face, but \nthere are solutions--solutions before us that are pragmatic, \nbipartisan, and uphold our American values.\n  I am familiar with the promise America represents for families. I \nknow how hard immigrants work, how much they believe in this country, \nand how much they are willing to give back to this country.\n  A small group of faith leaders from New Mexico penned an op-ed in the \nAlbuquerque Journal over the weekend. In sharing their thoughts on this \nhumanitarian crisis they wrote:\n\n       While the current situation raises the issues in powerful \n     ways, expressing hatred toward, fear of, or anger with women \n     and children serves nothing to resolve national debate. \n     Rather, it engenders a destructive spirit of mistrust. Let us \n     seek to understand the immigrant's reasons for coming and to \n     work collaboratively for just and reasonable immigration \n     reform.\n\n  I could not agree more with these faith leaders.\n  It is time to fix our broken immigration system once and for all. Our \nshort-term solution is to approve the President's emergency \nsupplemental request now, and as part of our long-term solution we need \nHouse Republicans to put the Senate's immigration reform bill on the \nfloor for a vote.\n  Our Nation will be the better for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Ms. HIRONO. I rise today to speak about the ongoing humanitarian \ncrisis on our southern border. I thank my colleagues, Senator Heinrich \nand Senator Mikulski, for their eloquent words in speaking to this \nissue.\n  As a woman and as an immigrant, my heart breaks for these children. \nMy mother fled Japan, where I was born. She fled out of desperation to \nescape a terrible marriage. I came with her to this country as a young \ngirl, and I remember how uncertain I was about what was in store for \nme.\n  Although we came by boat in steerage, at least we traveled safely and \ntogether. We did not face the kind of danger as did these children who \nare risking everything to be here. Their journeys to our border are \nlined with smugglers and traffickers. Children are arriving injured and \nmalnourished. Yet they continue to come, not only to the United States \nbut to other nearby countries, fleeing their countries out of \ndesperation.\n  These children don't care about the DREAM Act or the Senate \nimmigration reform bill. They are terrified of the violence, abuse, and \ndeath in their home countries. Young girls, who represent about 40 \npercent of the children who arrived this year, often face sexual \nassault and rape.\n  Let me share some recent stories from young girls who are fleeing. \nOne girl fled an area of El Salvador controlled by gangs. Her brother \nwas killed for refusing to join a gang that tried to forcibly recruit \nhim. She was raped by two men and became pregnant as a result. She fled \nEl Salvador and was attacked on her journey to the United States.\n  Another girl was kidnapped by a gang in Honduras that attempted to \ntraffic her into prostitution. She escaped and reported the kidnapping \nto the police. The gang then abducted her again, raped her, and burned \nher with cigarettes. She fled to the United States and is seeking \nasylum.\n  Yet another girl fled El Salvador when she was 8 years old. Gang \nmembers had kidnapped her two older sisters. The girl's mother did not \nwant her 8-year-old daughter to suffer the same fate, so she arranged \nfor her daughter to be brought to the United States.\n  These are horrific stories. It is clear that something needs to be \ndone.\n  I have worked with my colleague Senator Menendez to introduce a \ncomprehensive plan to address this issue. The plan aims to curtail \ntrafficking and smuggling, contain the violence and discord in Central \nAmerica, and ensure that these children have access to legal assistance \nand are in safe and humane conditions when they arrive.\n  This Friday I will also take some of my colleagues to McAllen and San \nAntonio, TX, to view facilities housing these children during the \nprocessing and removal process. We will see for ourselves the \nconditions that these children are in and meet with officials and \nleaders on the ground.\n  This crisis clearly demonstrates that inaction is not an option with \nregard to these children.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the supplemental funding needed for \nour country to meet their humanitarian needs. We have a responsibility \nto ensure that those in our custody are treated according to our values \nas a nation, and the President's request will allow our government to \nkeep these commitments.\n  I would also urge my colleagues to reject the idea that the solution \nis to speed up the deportation of these children back to the dangerous \nconditions\n\n[[Page S4544]]\n\nthey fled. Stripping away basic legal protections for children in these \nterrible situations will not solve this problem. As Senator Heinrich so \neloquently showed us, the conditions in their home countries are truly \nhorrific.\n  To really address this situation, we need to do more work with our \npartners in the region to reduce violence and improve opportunities in \ntheir home countries. We must provide resources so that we can safely, \nfairly, and timely process these children, including asylum \ndetermination, as provided by law.\n  We should all look to our conscience in seeking a path forward. \nSurely we can do better than sending these children back to the \nhorrific conditions that they are escaping. Out of sight is not out of \nmind. That is not what our country stands for.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support the President's supplemental \nrequest, and I urge my colleagues to work together toward resolving the \nunderlying process of this crisis.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I am very honored to follow my \ncolleague from Hawaii and her eloquent and powerful remarks, as well as \nthe Presiding Officer from New Mexico, who knows much firsthand about \nthis issue and has really been a leader in this body for me and others. \nI thank the Presiding Officer for that leadership.\n  My view of this issue concerning the tens of thousands of young \nchildren making the difficult and dangerous journey to the United \nStates from lands where they face violence and oppression is shaped by \nmy meeting with some of them in my home State of Connecticut.\n  I had the opportunity to do so recently on a number of occasions, and \nit has deeply affected my own approach because what I have seen in them \nreally inspires me. It inspires me because I understand better the \nreasons they have come here. The reasons they have come relate to the \nviolence, the threat of torture, and the oppression they see in the \nlands they are leaving. They are coming here, many of them, for family \nreunification.\n  What struck me in speaking with these young children is they are \ncoming here to reunify with relatives: their moms and dads, their aunts \nand uncles. They have come to be with members of their family and, of \ncourse, to seek education. They desperately want to go to school, and \nthey want the opportunity simply for the freedom they see this country \nas epitomizing and embodying, the beacon of opportunity that drew so \nmany of our forebears to this country, the lamp that is lit above the \nharbor of New York symbolically for all Americans, and the ideals this \ncountry embodies for the world. That is the reason people come and why \nour relatives, our own families came--one generation ago for me and \nperhaps more generations ago for others here.\n  So what we face is, in fact, a humanitarian crisis. It is a refugee \ncrisis of children seeking asylum, family reunification, and escape \nfrom oppression, torture, and death in intolerable conditions in their \nhome countries.\n  There is gang warfare that is a result of drug trading, pushed from \nColombia to Central America to service better their customers in the \nUnited States. Their markets are here. This country provides the demand \nthat fuels the trade--not only this country, of course, but all around \nthe world.\n  But these children are the innocent victims of the warfare--gang \nwarfare, market warfare that is fueled by a drug trade they have \nnothing to do with inciting or spurring. They are truly innocent \nvictims.\n  The values this country embodies that drew them and drew our \nancestors and our forebears to come are the values we must now remain \ntrue to serving. Among them is the ideal of due process and fairness to \njustice.\n  To say simply that we will deport all of them en masse, ask no \nquestions, and put them on a bus really is a disservice to those values \nand ideals that this Nation embodies for the world--a source of our \npower in dealing with the world. Our power is not the result only of \nour air superiority, our great naval fleet, our brave warriors on the \nground. It is truly the ideal that our military service and our \nmilitary might serves to safeguard around the world.\n  Speaking of security, safety, and safeguarding our Nation, our border \nis secure, more secure than ever before--perhaps not perfectly secure--\nand more has to be done for border security, which immigration reform \nwould help to accomplish.\n  The President has utilized an unprecedented level of resources in \nterms of both boots on the ground and advanced technology. There is no \nevidence to indicate any breakdown in border security.\n  What we have on our border is not a situation involving huge numbers \nof immigrants slipping into this country surreptitiously; they are \ncoming here openly, surrendering themselves to authorities or being \nimmediately apprehended by law enforcement.\n  This situation is entirely consistent with a fully effective border \nsecurity apparatus.\n  If the current situation were caused by lack of policies in the \nUnited States, we would expect to see a large number of immigrant \nchildren only in this country. After all, the United States' policies \napply only to the United States' borders but, in fact, that is not what \nwe see. There are children seeking asylum and refugee status in many \nother Western Hemisphere countries--including some of the poorest in \nthe world--a documented 712 percent increase in asylum seekers from El \nSalvador, Honduras, and Guatemala since 2009.\n  We have seen no increase in illegal immigration from Mexico, which \nalso would be happening if it were simply lax border security. Any way \nyou look at the situation, the facts simply do not support the theory \nthat America's border is in crisis. It is Central America that is in \ncrisis--El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras are the sources of this \nhumanitarian crisis.\n  Rolling back the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act \nwill not solve a border problem and it will not uphold the values and \nideals of this Nation. The protections of this law in fact are central \nto ensuring the United States of America does not send innocent \nchildren into situations where they would be harmed and killed.\n  So I would oppose a wholesale rollback of this law. We have to make \nsure that we do what is right and get this situation right, because the \nstakes are so very high. No one in this Chamber wants to be responsible \nfor sending one child to their death because we failed to consider the \ncomplexity and provide the humanity this situation demands.\n  Not only would rolling back the Trafficking Victim Protection \nReauthorization Act do harm--and we must first do no harm--but it would \nalso hurt law enforcement. This act helps enforcement and our law \nenforcement authorities to gain crucial actionable intelligence about \ntrafficking. This law reflects the fact that I learned during my law \nenforcement career, one of the keys to putting criminals behind bars is \nworking closely with victims. In fact, victims are essential, their \ncooperation is vital to making the law enforceable and making sure it \nis enforced.\n  The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act encourages \nvictims of trafficking to turn themselves in and cooperate with Border \nPatrol agents, and provide U.S. law enforcement with the information \nthey need. They are not interested in arresting children. They want to \narrest the traffickers, the drug lords, the top of the chain. That is \nso very important for our colleagues to understand.\n  The surge in drug trafficking and drug-related violence that has \nturned so many communities into war zones is driven by those gangs in \nCentral America that are in turn driving also the flood of young \nchildren to this country. We have this crisis in common with them. It \nis a humanitarian crisis and a law enforcement challenge. Let us move \ntoward immigration reform which will help to address that crisis by \nincreasing border security, by enabling millions of people now in the \nshadows to have a path to earned citizenship, to make sure our values \nand ideals are upheld by the greatest Nation in the history of the \nworld.\n  I thank all my colleagues who spoke today, and most especially thank \nSenator Leahy and Senator Feinstein for their decades of committed work \non this issue. I look forward to working with them, the Presiding \nOfficer, and\n\n[[Page S4545]]\n\nthe majority leader, who has led this Chamber and this Nation so well \non this issue.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday the Senate passed commonsense \nlegislation to help promote consumer choice and competition in the \nwireless phone marketplace. This legislation was a bipartisan effort to \nrestore consumers' rights to unlock their cell phones so they can take \ntheir phones to the wireless network of their choice. Last year, over \n110,000 consumers signed a petition calling for cell phone unlocking to \nbe permitted. Their call was heard. I am pleased that the Senate has \nacted to pass this commonsense, bipartisan legislation that I authored \nwith Senator Grassley to promote consumer choice.\n  Once every 3 years, the Library of Congress undertakes a rulemaking \nunder the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, DMCA, to establish \nexemptions to the DMCA's prohibition on circumventing technological \nmeasures that control access to copyrighted works. From 2006 to 2012, \nthe Library granted an exemption for cell phone unlocking that allowed \nusers to change wireless providers after complying with their \ncontracts. In its 2012 rulemaking, the Library did not recognize an \nexemption for new cell phones purchased after January 26, 2013. This \nact reinstates the Librarian's prior determination, ensuring that \nconsumers will be able to use their phones on the network of their \nchoice after satisfying their contracts without running afoul of our \ncopyright laws.\n  The act takes two further steps to benefit consumers. First, it \nensures that consumers who lack the technological savvy to unlock their \nphones themselves can authorize others to do the unlocking for them, in \norder for the owner or their family member to connect to a chosen \nwireless network. Second, in recognition of the growing importance to \nconsumers of other wireless devices, such as tablets, the act directs \nthe Librarian of Congress to determine whether such devices should also \nbe eligible for unlocking. That determination will be part of the \nLibrarian's next triennial rulemaking under the DMCA, which is set to \nbegin later this year.\n  This legislation addresses the specific question of permitting \nconsumers to unlock their cell phones to use on their chosen network \nconsistent with the terms of their contract. The legislation creates no \nnew obligations for cell phone manufacturers or wireless carriers, such \nas how a carrier may choose to process unlocking requests or provide \nunlocking codes. While there are larger ongoing debates about the DMCA, \nas well as other aspects of phone unlocking, those issues are not \naddressed by the bill. The bill takes a narrow, targeted approach to \nprotect consumer choice and promote competition in the wireless \nindustry.\n  I thank the Judiciary Committee ranking member, Senator Grassley, and \nour other bipartisan cosponsors for working with me on this bill. I \nalso thank the Republican and Democratic leadership of the House \nJudiciary Committee, who are continuing to work with us on this effort. \nI look forward to prompt consideration of the bill by the House and to \nthe President signing it into law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/16/senate-section/article/S4546-4", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4546-S4547]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                COLOMBIA\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on June 15, 2014, President Juan Manuel \nSantos was elected to a second term as Colombia's President. This is \nnot only a tribute to President Santos, who had staked his presidency \non a courageous and risky peace initiative with the FARC who have waged \na 30-year guerrilla war against the government, but also to the \nColombian people.\n  There was every reason to believe that if President Santos' opponent, \nOscar Ivan Zuluaga, had won the election the peace negotiations would \nhave been abandoned. Mr. Zuluaga had the strong backing of former \nPresident Uribe, whose aggressive leadership style and emphasis on \nsecurity contributed to significant battlefield advances against the \nFARC, but his administration was plagued by scandal and human rights \nabuses. He has been a vociferous critic of President Santos and the \npeace negotiations. Instead, the Colombian people wisely recognized \nthat the path to a more prosperous, secure country is through a peace \nprocess that addresses the underlying causes of the armed conflict, not \nan open-ended civil war fueled by cocaine that has already claimed \ncountless innocent lives, uprooted millions of people, and impeded \nforeign investment.\n  I know from my own conversations with Members of Congress that \nPresident Santos has the support of people here of both parties. Since \n2000, the Congress has supported billions of dollars in aid for social \nand economic development, counternarcotics, military, and humanitarian \nprograms in Colombia. While there have been disagreements in some \nareas, particularly the slow pace of Colombia's justice system in \nholding accountable members of the security forces and paramilitaries \nwho have been implicated in massacres of civilians and other human \nrights crimes, our support for Colombia has remained strong.\n  Colombia's greatest resource is its remarkable people. It is no \nwonder that Colombia, despite its many challenges, has remained a \nvibrant democracy while the governments of neighboring Venezuela and \nEcuador have been dominated by messianic leaders who have \nsystematically dismantled the institutions of democracy and a free \npress.\n  But another of Colombia's unique features is its biological and \ncultural diversity. The country is not only home to more species of \nflora and fauna than practically any other country in the world, it is \nalso inhabited by a multitude of indigenous groups who speak many \nlanguages and live in various stages of isolation.\n  Many of us have visited Cartagena and Bogota, but I suspect few \npeople here are aware that Colombia boasts one of the hemisphere's most \nextensive systems of national parks. They range from Caribbean islands \nand coral reefs, to glacier-covered mountain peaks, semi-arid desert, \nand tropical rainforest with dramatic rock outcroppings and cascading \nwaterfalls. The variety of Colombia's species of birds alone dwarfs \nthat of most countries.\n  I mention this to pay tribute to President Santos who has been a \nstrong supporter of Colombia's national parks and indigenous reserves,\n\n[[Page S4547]]\n\nand Julia Miranda who has ably led the National Park Service with \ntireless energy and unwavering commitment for a decade.\n  I also want to commend President Santos for his decision last week to \nprotect the Estrella Fluvial de Infrida under the Ramsar Convention on \nWetlands. This is one of the most important reserves of fresh water in \nthe world, covering an area larger than Florida's Everglades. It is \nhome to 415 of Colombia's bird species and 470 fish species, so this \ndesignation will play a crucial role in protecting Colombia's \nbiodiversity for future generations.\n  Coupled with last year's doubling in size of the extraordinary \nChiribiquete National Park, these steps to protect Colombia's natural \nenvironment will be even more important if a peace agreement is signed \nthat ushers in a period of greater security. While Colombia's oil and \ncoal reserves are finite and their extraction can cause lasting social \nand environmental harm, Colombia's national parks offer limitless eco-\ntourism potential that over the long term can bring far greater \nbenefits to the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/16/senate-section/article/S4547-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4547]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               CONGRESSIONAL RESEARCH SERVICE CENTENNIAL\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, there is no shortage of questions facing \nCongress today, and when Members and their staffs need additional \ninformation or detailed research on these complex topics, we often turn \nto the dedicated analysts at the Congressional Research Service, CRS. \nToday marks the 100th anniversary of CRS, and in the last century it \nhas grown to become one of the most valued resources on Capitol Hill.\n  Informed decisions are better decisions for the American people and \nfor the Nation. The Congressional Research Service provides research \nmaterials, historical snapshots, and confidential memoranda that help \nMembers of Congress and their staffs prepare for debates on vital--and \nsometimes historic--issues. The office also provides often insightful \nbriefings for Members of Congress and their staffs. Publicly, the \noffice provides summaries of proposed legislation, available through \nthe useful Thomas.gov website. In certain instances, the CRS provides \nuseful research tools which Members are able to make available to the \npublic.\n  One such example was a report that the Congressional Research Service \nproduced earlier this year at my request. Vermont is wrestling with how \nto effectively combat opiate abuse in our very rural State. Our State \nhas taken a community-based approach to the issue, involving not only \nlaw enforcement and health providers, but also faith leaders, local \nofficials, business owners, and nonprofit advocacy groups. In March, I \nwas pleased to take the Senate Judiciary Committee to Vermont to hear \nfirsthand how these approaches are having an impact in addressing \naddiction in the State. But equally important to Vermont is knowing how \nother States are dealing with heroin and opioid abuse. The \nCongressional Research Service prepared a useful document, ``Prevention \nand Treatment of Heroin and Other Opioid Abuse in the States,'' which \nhelped illustrate how other States are dealing with addiction.\n  Analysts for CRS include subject matter experts in such issue areas \nas American law; domestic social policy; foreign affairs; defense and \ntrade; government and finance and resources; and science and industry. \nI have in the past supported efforts to make many of the reports \nproduced by the CRS available to the public. It is an effort I continue \nto support. I believe students, researchers, and our constituents would \nbenefit from access to this useful information.\n  In the 100 years since Congress established the Legislative Reference \nService, the small office has evolved into the Congressional Research \nService of today, which encompasses a staff of 600 analysts, lawyers, \ninformation professionals, and management and infrastructure support \nstaff. On the occasion of its 100th anniversary, I thank the dedicated \nstaff of the Congressional Research Service--both past and present--for \ntheir public service and commitment to fulfilling the office's core \nvalue of providing objective and nonpartisan evaluations of policy \nmatters to Congress.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I recognize the Congressional \nResearch Service, CRS. The CRS is celebrating its centennial this week.\n  Established as the Legislative Reference Service in 1914, the CRS has \nbeen assisting Members of Congress in their legislative work by \nproviding reference information and nonpartisan policy analysis for 100 \nyears.\n  I wish to thank the diligent and professional staff of the CRS that \nprovide an invaluable service to Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/16/senate-section/article/S4547-2", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4547-S4548]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BUDGETARY REVISIONS\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, sections 114(d) and 116(c) of the \nBipartisan Budget Act of 2013, allow the chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee to revise the allocations, aggregates, and levels for a \nnumber of deficit-neutral reserve funds. These reserve funds were \nincorporated into the Bipartisan Budget Act by reference to S. Con. \nRes. 8, the Senate-passed budget resolution for 2014. Among these \nsections is a reference to section 319 of S. Con. Res. 8, which \nestablishes a deficit-neutral reserve fund for terrorism risk \ninsurance. The authority to adjust enforceable levels in the Senate for \nterrorism risk insurance is contingent on that legislation not \nincreasing the deficit over either the period of the total of fiscal \nyears 2014 through 2019 or the period of the total of fiscal years 2014 \nthrough 2024.\n  I find that S. 2244, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program \nReauthorization Act of 2014, as reported on June 23, 2014, fulfills the \nconditions of the deficit-neutral reserve fund for terrorism risk \ninsurance. Therefore, pursuant to sections 114(d) and 116(c) of H.

EWY\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I wish to remember the life and sacrifice \nof a remarkable young man, Army 2LT Jered W. Ewy. Along with one other \nsoldier, Jered died July 29, 2011, of injuries he sustained when his \nunit was attacked with improvised explosive devices in the town of \nJanak Kheyl, Paktia Province, Afghanistan, in support of Operation \nEnduring Freedom.\n  After graduating from Putnam City North High School, Jered enlisted \nin the Army Rangers in 1998 and was one of the first on the ground in \nAfghanistan after the tragic events of September 11, 2001. He served \nthree tours of duty and then joined the Oklahoma National Guard in 2003 \nand served as an instructor.\n  While serving in the National Guard, Jered attended the University of \nCentral Oklahoma pursuing a bachelor's degree in criminal justice. \n``What I wanted him to do was take the degree and get into law \nenforcement with the Department of Justice,'' his father, John Ewy \nsaid. ``He turned it down because he missed the camaraderie.''\n  While attending school he taught gymnastics in Edmond, OK. Although \nhe was very involved in the community and truly enjoyed coaching the \nkids, ``Gym was just kind of a side job while he could finish up \nschool,'' added Dena Edwards. ``I think the military was pretty much \nwhere his heart lies.''\n  In January 2011 he graduated from Officer Candidate School and was \nassigned to Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 1st Battalion, 179th \nInfantry Regiment, 45th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, Oklahoma Army \nNational Guard. He deployed to Afghanistan in June 2011.\n  ``This loss of life has shaken every member of the Oklahoma National \nGuard to their core,'' said MG Myles L. Deering, Adjutant General for \nOklahoma. ``We have lost two very brave men who once raised their hands \nand took an oath to defend our nation. They courageously gave \neverything they had to ensure our freedom and safety and their \nsacrifice will not be forgotten.''\n  ``Jered was a man of integrity, discipline and honor who put everyone \nelse first,'' family members wrote in his obituary. ``He cared deeply \nabout the men he served with but his true passion in his life was his \nwife Megan and infant daughter Kyla.''\n  On August 11, 2011, the family held church services at Henderson \nHills Baptist Church in Edmond, OK.\n  He is survived by his wife Megan of Edmond, daughter Kyla, mother \nMartha Nelson of Edmond, father and stepmother John and Ann Ewy of \nMoore, grandmother Harriet Ewy, siblings, Penny Clark and her husband \nRob of Moore, Michelle Davis and her children Hayden, Colton and Cody, \nand Chad Nelson of Edmond, and many uncles and cousins.\n  Today we remember Army 2LT Jered W. Ewy, a young man who loved his \nfamily and country and gave his life as a sacrifice for freedom.\n\n\n                   Sergeant Anthony Del Mar Peterson\n\n  Mr. President, it is my honor to also honor the life and sacrifice of \nArmy SGT Anthony Del Mar Peterson, of Chelsea, OK who died on August 4, \n2011, serving our nation in Paktya province, Afghanistan. Sergeant \nPeterson was assigned to B Company, 1st Battalion, 279th Infantry, 45th \nBrigade Combat Team, OK Army National Guard.\n  Sergeant Peterson died of wounds suffered during a dismounted patrol \nwhen a group of insurgents attacked his unit with small arms fire in \nthe Zurmat district of Paktya province, Afghanistan. Anthony had \npreviously been deployed to Afghanistan in 2006-2007.\n  My heartfelt prayers go out to Dakota Justice Peterson, the young son \nSergeant Peterson left behind. I remain confident he will grow to learn \nof his father's heroism; and pray the honor of his father may be \ncarried with pride and cultivate in him, the character of his father.\n  Upon hearing of Sergeant Peterson's death, MG Myles Deering, the \nAdjutant General for Oklahoma stated, ``Oklahoma has lost another brave \nson. Sergeant Peterson was an exceptional Soldier who worked tirelessly \nto protect the values that we as Americans hold close to our hearts.''\n  Sergeant Peterson has also been described as an excellent non-\ncommissioned officer and a committed soldier. Another friend has said \nthat he will remember his zest for life, and his passion to lead others \nto Christ.\n  Born December 8, 1986 in Sacramento, CA, Anthony graduated from \nChelsea High School in 2005 and Rogers State University in Claremore, \nOK in 2008. He was active in Campus Crusade for Christ, Baptist \nCollegiate, Rescue (Outreach Program), and Stop Child Trafficking, \nOATH.\n  He enjoyed hiking, camping, canoeing, hunting, and spending time with \nhis family and friends. The most important things in his life were: \nGod, family, and his country. Anthony's favorite quote was, ``Come home \nwith your shield--or on it.''\n  Anthony is survived by his son, Dakota Justice Peterson of Owasso, \nparents, Garth and Terra Peterson of Owasso, siblings: Robert Edward \nPeterson, and Brittany Nicole Louise Peterson both of Owasso, \ngrandparents: Ed and Gail Peterson of Chelsea, Paula and Richard Jones \nof Post Falls, ID, Les Marubashi of Chelsea, and Toni and Frank Trejo \nof Coquille, OR, nephew, Carter Myles Thomas of Owasso, and numerous \nextended family members who loved him.\n  I extend our deepest gratitude and condolences to Anthony's family. \nHe lived a life of love for his son, family, friends, and our country. \nHe will be remembered for his commitment to and belief in the greatness \nof our Nation. I am honored to pay tribute to this true American hero \nwho volunteered to go into the fight and made the ultimate sacrifice of \nhis life for our freedom.\n\n\n                     ARMY SERGEANT MYCAL L. PRINCE\n\n  Mr. President, I am also honored to remember Army SGT Mycal L. \nPrince. Sergeant Prince was tragically killed in action on September \n15, 2011, in Saygal Valley, Laghman Province, Afghanistan when enemy \nforces attacked his unit with rocket-propelled grenades and small arms \nfire.\n  Mycal was born July 16, 1983, in Chickasha, OK, to Harold and \nArnetta--Schoolfield--Prince. After graduating from Ninnekah High \nSchool in 2001, he completed cleet training and served as a police \nofficer in Rush Springs for 3 years. On October 25, 2001, he married \nSurana Smith in Chickasha, and they later moved to Minco in May 2009 \nwhere he served as a police officer with the K-9 Unit for 2 years.\n  Minco Police Chief Phil Blevins said, ``He was one of the most \nprofessional and squared away young men I've ever met. He had things \ntogether in his family life, in his professional life. It's \nunbelievable for a man who is 28 how mature he was in all areas of his \nlife.''\n  Mycal was a member of Alpha Company, 1st Battalion, 179th Infantry, \nOklahoma National Guard. He deployed to Afghanistan for his third tour \non July 29, 2011.\n\n[[Page S4549]]\n\n  ``Sgt. Prince served his nation and this great state for more than a \ndecade with honor and distinction,'' MG Myles L. Deering, Oklahoma's \nAdjutant General, said in a statement. ``He joined the Guard five days \nafter his 17th birthday. I think that says a lot about the kind of man \nSgt. Prince was. He deployed to help the people of New Orleans after \nHurricane Katrina in 2005 and went to Iraq in 2008. He could have \ngotten out of the service, but he chose to stay and serve his \ncountry.''\n  Mycal was preceded in death by his father, Harold Prince, one child, \nand his paternal and maternal grandparents. He is survived by his wife \nSurana of Minco, two daughters, Raelynn and Mycaela of Minco, mother, \nArnetta Prince of Stonewall, sister, Leslie Dickenson and husband Wade \nof Stonewall, sister, Kathy Prince of Stonewall, and Cody Prince as \nwell as many nieces, nephews, relatives, and friends.\n  Funeral services with full military honors were held on September 26, \n2011, at Bridge Assembly of God Church in Mustang, OK. Mycal was laid \nto rest in Bradley Cemetery in Bradley, OK.\n  Today we remember Army SGT Mycal L. Prince, a young man who loved his \nfamily and country, and gave his life as a sacrifice for freedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/16/senate-section/article/S4549-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4549]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECOGNIZING THE WAYNE FAMILY\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nrecognizing the distinguished Wayne family legacy in Louisiana. On \nApril 29, 2014, Guinness World Records officially recognized the Wayne \nfamily as having the most family members to graduate from Grambling \nState University.\n  Beginning in the 1940s, a total of 86 descendants of the Wayne family \nhave attended Grambling State University. More than five generations of \nthis Marion, LA family have studied at this storied institution and \npursued lasting careers as military administrators and officers, \ndoctors, lawyers, professors, professional athletes, and more. Through \ntheir years of service, this family has created enduring changes in a \nwide breadth of research and direction to impact and improve the lives \nof all those within their communities.\n  The Wayne family sets the Guinness World Record for ``Most family \nmembers to graduate from the same university'' with 40 approved \nrelatives from the Wayne record. This outstanding accomplishment is a \ntestament to the family's unparalleled devotion to education and to one \nof Louisiana's Historically Black College and Universities, Grambling \nState University. The continued commitment of this proud Louisiana \nfamily sets a new standard of both professional and educational \naspiration and leaves a lasting legacy of achievement for generations \nto come.\n  Among this family's graduates of Grambling State University are: Alma \nMcElroy Andrews, descendent of Matilda Wayne McElroy; Gloria Marie \nBrown, descendent of Ida Wayne Rivers; Claudine Williams, Dossie Roger \nWilliams Jr., Shelia E. Williams, Verjanis Andrews Peoples, Stevie \nAndrews, Tjuana T. Williams, and Marcus D. Andrews, descendants of King \nWayne; Rose Wayne, Ronald Wayne, Patricia Wayne Williams, and Stephanie \nWilliams, descendants of John Wayne Sr; Ellis D. Wayne, LaJeane Holley \nand Mary Will Johnikin, descendants of Moses Wayne; Shirley Wayne, \nRalph Wayne, and Larry Wayne, descendants of William Thomas Wayne, Sr.; \nHattie Wayne, Donald Wayne Tatum, Saundra Tatum, Rashia Tatum, Jr., \nRenee Tatum, Michael Tatum, Christopher Tatum, Dawn Michelle Tatum, \nNicholas Tatum, Kevin Parks, Cathy Denise Wasson Conwright, and \nVeronica Lee, descendants of Sandy Wayne, Sr.; John Earl Ellis, Willie \nRaymond Ellis, and Marcia N. Ellis, descendants of Sam Wayne; and Leola \nWayne Taylor, Willie B. Wayne, Albert Jackson, Debra Jackson Gilliard, \nMargaret Jackson Riley, and DaRandall D. Riley, descendants of Willie \nWayne. This family has promoted a continued dedication to education and \naccomplishment for all those who are a part of the communities that \ntheir exceptional careers have impacted.\n  This family has been and continues to be an inspiration to all those \nwho have benefitted from the contributions the Wayne descendants have \nmade. It is with my heartfelt and greatest sincerity that I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in recognizing the incredible legacy of the Wayne \nfamily at Grambling State University, as well as their lasting impact \nthroughout the State of Louisiana and the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/16/senate-section/article/S4549-2", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4549-S4550]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          FAYETTE COUNTY, IOWA\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the strength of my State of Iowa \nlies in its vibrant local communities, where citizens come together to \nfoster economic development, make smart investments to expand \nopportunity, and take the initiative to improve the health and well-\nbeing of residents. Over the decades, I have witnessed the growth and \nrevitalization of so many communities across my State, and it has been \ndeeply gratifying to see how my work in Congress has supported these \nlocal efforts.\n  I have always believed in accountability for public officials, and \nthis, my final year in the Senate, is an appropriate time to give an \naccounting of my work across four decades representing Iowa in \nCongress. I take pride in accomplishments that have been national in \nscope--for instance, passing the Americans with Disabilities Act and \nspearheading successful farm bills. But I take a very special pride in \nprojects that have made a big difference in local communities across my \nState.\n  Today, I wish to give an accounting of my work with leaders and \nresidents of Fayette County to build a legacy of a stronger local \neconomy, better schools and educational opportunities, and a healthier, \nsafer community.\n  Between 2001 and 2013, the creative leadership in your community has \nworked with me to secure funding in Fayette County worth over $4.7 \nmillion and successfully acquired financial assistance from programs I \nhave fought hard to support, which have provided more than $9 million \nto the local economy.\n  Of course my favorite memory of working together has to be the \nimplementation of a downtown geothermal project through Main Street \nIowa dollars, as well as funding to rehabilitate the Bus Barn building \nin West Union.\n  Among the highlights: Main Street Iowa: One of the greatest \nchallenges we face--in Iowa and all across America--is preserving the \ncharacter and vitality of our small towns and rural communities. This \nis not just about economics. It is also about maintaining our identity \nas Iowans. Main Street Iowa helps preserve Iowa's heart and soul by \nproviding funds to revitalize downtown business districts. This program \nhas allowed towns like West Union to use that money to leverage other \ninvestments to jumpstart change and renewal. I am so pleased that \nFayette County has earned $150,000 through this program. These grants \nbuild much more than buildings. They build up the spirit and morale of \npeople in our small towns and local communities.\n  School grants: Every child in Iowa deserves to be educated in a \nclassroom that is safe, accessible, and modern. That is why, for the \npast decade and a half, I have secured funding for the innovative Iowa \nDemonstration Construction Grant Program--better known among educators \nin Iowa as Harkin grants for public schools construction and \nrenovation. Across 15 years, Harkin grants worth more than $132 million \nhave helped school districts to fund a range of renovation and repair \nefforts--everything from updating fire safety systems to building new \nschools. In many cases, these Federal dollars have served as the needed \nincentive to leverage local public and private dollars, so it often has \na tremendous multiplier effect within a school district. Over the \nyears, Fayette County has received $2,145,041 in Harkin grants. \nSimilarly, schools in Fayette County have received funds that I \ndesignated for Iowa Star Schools for technology totaling $216,050.\n  Agricultural and rural development: Because I grew up in a small town \nin rural Iowa, I have always been a loyal friend and fierce advocate \nfor family farmers and rural communities. I have been a member of the \nHouse or Senate Agriculture Committee for 40 years--including more than \n10 years as chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. Across the \ndecades, I have championed farm policies for Iowans\n\n[[Page S4550]]\n\nthat include effective farm income protection and commodity programs; \nstrong, progressive conservation assistance for agricultural producers; \nrenewable energy opportunities; and robust economic development in our \nrural communities. Since 1991, through various programs authorized \nthrough the farm bill, Fayette County has received more than $3.2 \nmillion from a variety of farm bill programs.\n  Keeping Iowa communities safe: I also firmly believe that our first \nresponders need to be appropriately trained and equipped, able to \nrespond to both local emergencies and to Statewide challenges such as, \nfor instance, the methamphetamine epidemic. Since 2001, Fayette \nCounty's fire departments have received over $1.5 million for \nfirefighter safety and operations equipment.\n  Disability rights: Growing up, I loved and admired my brother Frank, \nwho was deaf. But I was deeply disturbed by the discrimination and \nobstacles he faced every day. That is why I have always been a \npassionate advocate for full equality for people with disabilities. As \nthe primary author of the Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA, and the \nADA Amendments Act, I have had four guiding goals for our fellow \ncitizens with disabilities: equal opportunity, full participation, \nindependent living and economic self-sufficiency. Nearly a quarter \ncentury since passage of the ADA, I see remarkable changes in \ncommunities everywhere I go in Iowa--not just in curb cuts or closed \ncaptioned television, but in the full participation of people with \ndisabilities in our society and economy, folks who at long last have \nthe opportunity to contribute their talents and to be fully included. \nThese changes have increased economic opportunities for all citizens of \nFayette County, both those with and without disabilities. And they make \nus proud to be a part of a community and country that respects the \nworth and civil rights of all of our citizens.\n  This is at least a partial accounting of my work on behalf of Iowa, \nand specifically Fayette County, during my time in Congress. In every \ncase, this work has been about partnerships, cooperation, and \nempowering folks at the State and local level, including in Fayette \nCounty, to fulfill their own dreams and initiatives. And, of course, \nthis work is never complete. Even after I retire from the Senate, I \nhave no intention of retiring from the fight for a better, fairer, \nricher Iowa. I will always be profoundly grateful for the opportunity \nto serve the people of Iowa as their Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/16/senate-section/article/S4550-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4550-S4551]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JACKSON COUNTY, IOWA\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the strength of my State of Iowa \nlies in its vibrant local communities, where citizens come together to \nfoster economic development, make smart investments to expand \nopportunity, and take the initiative to improve the health and well-\nbeing of residents.

According to the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers, each lock and dam produces $1 billion per year in \ntransportation cost savings to ship goods and raw materials, keeping \nthe economy in Iowa moving.\n  Among the highlights: School grants: Every child in Iowa deserves to \nbe educated in a classroom that is safe, accessible, and modern. That \nis why, for the past decade and a half, I have secured funding for the \ninnovative Iowa Demonstration Construction Grant Program--better known \namong educators in Iowa as Harkin grants for public schools \nconstruction and renovation.

Over the years, Jackson County has received $642,107 \nin Harkin grants. Similarly, schools in Jackson County have received \nfunds that I designated for Iowa Star Schools for technology totaling \n$82,500.\n  Disaster mitigation and prevention: In 1993, when historic floods \nripped through Iowa, it became clear to me that the national emergency-\nresponse infrastructure was woefully inadequate to meet the needs of \nIowans in flood-ravaged communities. I went to work dramatically \nexpanding the Federal Emergency Management Agency's hazard mitigation \nprogram, which helps communities reduce the loss of life and property \ndue to natural disasters and enables mitigation measures to be \nimplemented during the immediate recovery period. Disaster relief means \nmore than helping people and businesses get back on their feet after a \ndisaster, it means doing our best to prevent the same predictable flood \nor other catastrophe from recurring in the future. The hazard \nmitigation program that I helped create in 1993 provided critical \nsupport to Iowa communities impacted by the devastating floods of 2008. \nJackson County has received over $11 million to remediate and prevent \nwidespread destruction from natural disasters.\n  Agricultural and rural development: Because I grew up in a small town \nin rural Iowa, I have always been a loyal friend and fierce advocate \nfor family farmers and rural communities. I have been a member of the \nHouse or Senate Agriculture Committee for 40 years--including more than \n10 years as chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. Across the \ndecades, I have championed farm policies for Iowans that include \neffective farm income protection and commodity programs; strong, \nprogressive conservation assistance for agricultural producers; \nrenewable energy opportunities; and robust economic development in our \nrural communities. Since 1991, through various programs authorized \nthrough the farm bill, Jackson County has received more than $1.4 \nmillion from a variety of farm bill programs.\n  Keeping Iowa communities safe: I also firmly believe that our first \nresponders need to be appropriately trained and equipped, able to \nrespond to both local emergencies and to statewide challenges such as, \nfor instance, the methamphetamine epidemic. Since 2001, Jackson \nCounty's fire departments have received over $1 million for firefighter \nsafety and operations equipment.\n  Disability rights: Growing up, I loved and admired my brother Frank, \nwho was deaf.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of California calling upon the Congress and the \n     President of the United States to stabilize the federal \n     Highway Trust Fund by developing a long-term plan to promote \n     adequate federal Highway Trust Fund revenues; to the \n     Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 24\n\n       Whereas, A safe, efficient, and reliable surface \n     transportation network is vital to California's future \n     economic growth, quality of life, and security; and\n       Whereas, Inadequate investment in California's highway and \n     bridge infrastructure system is having a dramatic impact on \n     the citizens of California, causing them to spend too much \n     time idling on increasingly congested roads and bridges \n     rather than with their families; and\n       Whereas, The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century \n     Act (MAP-21), that authorized the federal highway and public \n     transportation programs, will expire September 30, 2014; and\n       Whereas, The federal Highway Trust Fund and its user fee-\n     based revenue stream supports all federal investment in \n     highway and bridge improvements and the vast majority of the \n     federal public transportation program; and\n       Whereas, The federal Highway Trust Fund experienced revenue \n     shortfalls in 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2012 that created \n     uncertainty about federal surface transportation investment \n     commitments; and\n       Whereas, The United States Department of Transportation \n     will begin slowing reimbursements to states for already \n     approved federal-aid projects as early as July of this year \n     to preserve a positive balance in the federal Highway Trust \n     Fund; and\n       Whereas, The Congressional Budget Office reports the \n     federal Highway Trust Fund will be unable to support any new \n     highway or public transportation spending in the 2015 fiscal \n     year absent congressional action to increase trust fund \n     revenues; and\n       Whereas, Eliminating federal highway and public \n     transportation investment in one year would threaten hundreds \n     of thousands of jobs nationwide and severely disrupt \n     California's long-term transportation improvement plans: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and the Assembly of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature urges timely action \n     by the President and the Congress of the United States to \n     stabilize the federal Highway Trust Fund by developing a \n     long-term plan to promote adequate federal Highway Trust Fund \n     revenues that achieves all of the following:\n       (a) Continues an appropriate role for the federal \n     government in sustaining a viable national transportation \n     system.\n       (b) Contributes to deficit reductions and economic growth.\n       (c) Ensures the integrity of the surface transportation \n     program and resists funding diversions that have been harmful \n     to public support.\n       (d) Allows the Congress to pass a reauthorization of the \n     federal highway and public\n\n[[Page S4554]]\n\n     transportation programs before MAP-21 expires; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate transmit copies \n     of this resolution to the President and Vice President of the \n     United States, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, \n     the Majority Leader of the Senate, each Senator and \n     Representative from California in the Congress of the United \n     States, and to the author for appropriate distribution.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-304.

A resolution .  .  .\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n       POM-306. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Michigan urging the President of the United States, the \n     Secretary of State, and the Congress of the United States to \n     invoke the participation of the International Joint \n     Commission under Article IX, Article X, or both, of the \n     Boundary Waters Treaty to evaluate the proposed underground \n     nuclear waste repository in Ontario, Canada, and similar \n     facilities; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 151\n\n       Whereas, Ontario Power Generation is proposing to construct \n     an underground, long-term burial facility for low- and \n     intermediate-level radioactive waste at the Bruce Nuclear \n     Generating Station. This site is less than a mile inland from \n     the shore of Lake Huron; and\n       Whereas, Placing a permanent nuclear waste burial facility \n     so dose to the Great Lakes shoreline is a matter of serious \n     concern for the inhabitants of the Great Lakes states and \n     provinces. A leak or breach of radioactivity from this waste \n     facility could damage the ecology of the lakes. Tens of \n     millions of United States and Canadian citizens depend on the \n     lakes for drinking water, fisheries, tourism, recreation, and \n     other industrial and economic uses; and\n       Whereas, Michigan recognizes the duty of the legislative \n     branch of government to protect the public health, safety, \n     and welfare of its citizens and the state's natural \n     resources. Article IV, Section 50 of the Michigan \n     Constitution authorizes the Legislature to regulate atomic \n     energy in view of the safety and general welfare of the \n     people. Article IV, Section 51 declares that the public \n     health and general welfare of the people of the state are \n     matters of primary public concern, while Article IV, Section \n     52 requires the Legislature to provide for the protection of \n     the air, water, and other natural resources of the state from \n     pollution, impairment, and destruction; and\n       Whereas, The Michigan Legislature has recognized the \n     inherent dangers of siting a radioactive waste storage \n     facility near the shores of the Great Lakes. Under Public Act \n     No. 204 of 1987, the final siting criteria for a radioactive \n     waste facility containing the same types of waste as would be \n     stored at the proposed Ontario repository includes a \n     prohibition on siting it within 10 miles of one of the Great \n     Lakes, the Saint Mary's River, Detroit River, St. Clair \n     River, or Lake St. Clair; and\n       Whereas, The Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement (GLWQA) is \n     a binational agreement to address critical environmental \n     health issues in the Great Lakes region, with the overall \n     purpose of restoring and maintaining the chemical, physical, \n     and biological integrity of the Great Lakes. Article 6 of the \n     GLWQA acknowledges the importance of anticipating, \n     preventing, and responding to threats to the Great Lakes and \n     recognizes that a nuclear waste facility sited close to the \n     Greg Lakes shoreline could lead to a pollution incident or \n     could have a significant cumulative impact on the waters of \n     the Great Lakes; and\n       Whereas, The 1909 Boundary Waters Treaty recognizes the \n     immense importance of the Great Lakes as a shared resource \n     between the United States and Canada. The wisdom of the \n     Treaty drafters is reflected in the creation of the \n     International Joint Commission (IJC), composed of three \n     members from the United States and three members from Canada, \n     to act as impartial watchdogs over the boundary waters \n     between the countries. Under Article IX of the Treaty, \n     questions or matters of difference between the countries \n     involving their rights, obligations, or interests along their \n     common frontier may be referred to the IJC for examination \n     and report, upon the request of either country. Under Article \n     X, the IJC may be asked to make a binding decision on an \n     issue of difference between the two countries, upon the \n     consent and referral by both the United States and Canada; \n     and\n       Whereas, The IJC has frequently been asked to weigh in on \n     major topics of concern to the Great Lakes region. In 1912, a \n     few years after the Treaty's ratification, the IJC was asked \n     to examine and report on the extent, causes, and location of \n     pollution in the boundary waters and to recommend remedies \n     and pollution prevention strategies. In 1999, the IJC was \n     asked to study the international export of bulk supplies of \n     Great Lakes water. The IJC provides an objective and \n     international forum to study Great Lakes issues that affect \n     both countries: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we urge the President of the \n     United States, the Secretary of State, and the Congress of \n     the United States to invoke the participation of the \n     International Joint Commission under Article IX, Article X, \n     or both, of the Boundary Waters Treaty to evaluate the \n     proposed underground nuclear waste repository in Ontario, \n     Canada, and similar facilities; and be it further\n       Resolved, That we urge the other Great Lakes states and \n     Canadian provinces to adopt appropriate regulations to \n     protect the Great Lakes region from radioactive waste and to \n     petition their respective federal governments to engage the \n     IJC under Article IX, Article X, or both, of the Boundary \n     Waters Treaty to evaluate the proposed underground nuclear \n     waste repository in Ontario, Canada, and similar facilities; \n     and be it further\n\n[[Page S4555]]\n\n       Resolved, That we urge the Prime Minister of Canada and the \n     Canadian Parliament to suspend the Joint Review Panel process \n     convened by the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency and \n     the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission to decide whether to \n     grant Ontario Power Generation a license to construct the \n     underground nuclear waste repository so that it can receive \n     input from the IJC, the Great Lakes Commission, and the state \n     of Michigan; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, the Prime Minister of \n     Canada, the United States Secretary of State, the President \n     of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States \n     House of Representatives, the members of the Michigan \n     congressional delegation, the Speaker of the Canadian Senate, \n     the Speaker of the Canadian House of Commons, and the \n     governors or premiers and the legislative majority leaders in \n     Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, \n     Wisconsin, Ontario, and Quebec.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-307. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of North Carolina urging the \n     United States Congress to enact legislation that will lead to \n     the recognition of World War II Coastwise Merchant Mariners \n     as veterans of the United States Armed Forces; to the \n     Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n                         House Resolution 1256\n\n       Whereas, during World War II, United States Merchant \n     Mariners who served along the coastline of the United States, \n     and were known as Coastwise Merchant Mariners, helped to \n     transport materials, including food, clothing, and weapons, \n     to members of the United States Armed Forces serving on three \n     continents; and\n       Whereas, the Coastwise Merchant Mariners bravely performed \n     their duties even as they were in danger of attack from \n     German U-boats operating along our nation's coastal waters; \n     and\n       Whereas, many of the Coastwise Merchant Mariners were \n     elderly, handicapped, women, and underage children who \n     stepped forward in the time of a national crisis to ensure \n     that the members of the United States Armed Forces were \n     sufficiently supplied as they fought enemy forces; and\n       Whereas, because of administrative rules and decisions made \n     by the United States Navy, many Coastwise Merchant Mariners \n     who served during World War II were not recognized as \n     veterans and thus were not eligible for the veterans benefits \n     they had earned; and\n       Whereas, in the years following World II, as a result of \n     some changes in federal law and federal rules and \n     regulations, some of the Coastwise Merchant Mariners \n     previously denied veterans benefits were finally recognized \n     as veterans and therefore entitled to the same benefits as \n     other veterans of the United States Armed Forces; and\n       Whereas, despite the past recognition of some Coastwise \n     Merchant Mariners as veterans, as many as 30,000 Coastwise \n     Merchant Mariners may never get that recognition due to the \n     documentation required to prove their service during World \n     War II; and\n       Whereas, through no fault of these courageous individuals, \n     much of the documentation proving they served their country \n     during World War II as Coastwise Merchant Mariners has been \n     lost or destroyed or was never recorded; Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives:\n       SECTION 1. The House of Representatives honors the brave \n     men, women, and children who valiantly served our country as \n     Coastwise Merchant Mariners during World War II.\n       SECTION 2. The House of Representatives urges Congress to \n     do the following:\n       (1) Conduct congressional inquiries into (i) the lack of \n     recognition given to the World War II Coastwise Merchant \n     Mariners who were lost in action without having been \n     recognized by our nation as veterans and (ii) the reason \n     World War II Coastwise Merchant Mariners records that are \n     known to exist have not been moved to the National Records \n     Center for use by families and researchers in accordance with \n     agreements between the National Archives and Records \n     Administration and the Department of Defense.\n       (2) Enact legislation that expands the types of acceptable \n     documentation that Coastwise Merchant Mariners may use to \n     prove their service during World War II, and to thereafter \n     require that those who can provide the documentation be \n     finally recognized as veterans entitled to the accompanying \n     benefits.\n       SECTION 3. The Principal Clerk shall transmit a certified \n     copy of this resolution to the President of the United \n     States, the Speaker and Clerk of the United States House of \n     Representatives, the President Pro Tempore and the Secretary \n     of the United States Senate, the members of the North \n     Carolina Congressional delegation, and the news media of \n     North Carolina.\n       SECTION 4. This resolution is effective upon adoption.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-308. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania expresging support for the \n     democratic and European aspirations of the people of Ukraine, \n     and calling on the United States and the European Union to \n     continue to work together to support a peaceful resolution to \n     the crisis; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 284\n\n       Whereas, A democratic, prosperous and independent Ukraine \n     is in the national interest of the United States; and\n       Whereas, Closer relations with the European Union (EU) \n     through the signing of an Association Agreement will promote \n     democratic values, good governance and economic opportunity \n     in Ukraine; and\n       Whereas, Millions of Ukrainian citizens support closer \n     relations with Europe and the signing of an Association \n     Agreement; and\n       Whereas, The Government of Ukraine has declared integration \n     with Europe a national priority and has made significant \n     progress toward meeting the requirements for the Association \n     Agreement; and\n       Whereas, Ukraine has the sovereign right to enter into \n     voluntary partnerships of its choosing, in keeping with its \n     interests; and\n       Whereas, Ukraine's closer relations with the EU do not \n     threaten any other country and will benefit both Ukraine and \n     its neighbors; and\n       Whereas, On November 21, 2013, following several months of \n     intense outside pressure, Ukrainian President Viktor \n     Yanukovych abruptly suspended negotiations on the Association \n     Agreement one week before it was due to be signed at the EU's \n     Eastern Partnership Summit in Vilnius, Lithuania; and\n       Whereas, This reversal of stated government policy \n     precipitated demonstrations by hundreds of thousands of \n     Ukrainian citizens in Kyiv as well as in cities throughout \n     the country; and\n       Whereas, The demonstrators were overwhelmingly peaceful and \n     have sought to exercise their constitutional rights to freely \n     assemble and express their oppositions to President \n     Yanukovych's decision, as well as their support for greater \n     government accountability and closer relations with Europe; \n     and\n       Whereas, On November 30, 2013, police violently dispersed \n     peaceful demonstrators in Kyiv's Independence Square, \n     resulting in many injuries and the arrest of several dozen \n     individuals; and\n       Whereas, On December 9, 2013, police raided three \n     opposition media outlets and the headquarters of an \n     opposition party; and\n       Whereas, On December 11, 2013, despite President \n     Yanukovych's statement the previous day that he would engage \n     in talks with the opposition, police attempted to forcibly \n     evict peaceful protesters from central locations in Kyiv; and\n       Whereas, United States, European and other leaders, as well \n     as three former presidents of Ukraine, urged restraint, \n     warned against the use of violence against peaceful \n     protesters and called for dialogue with the opposition to \n     resolve the current political and economic crisis; and\n       Whereas, On January 16, 2014, the Ukrainian parliament \n     passed, and President Yanukovych signed, legislation which \n     severely limited the right of peaceful protest, constrained \n     freedom of speech and the independent media and unduly \n     restricted civil society organizations; and\n       Whereas, The passage of these undemocratic measures and \n     President Yanukovych's refusal to engage in substantive \n     dialogue with opposition leaders precipitated several days of \n     violence and resulted in several deaths and hundreds of \n     injuries, as well as numerous allegations of police \n     brutality; and\n       Whereas, In the face of spreading demonstrations, Ukrainian \n     Government representatives and opposition leaders entered \n     into negotiations which on January 28, 2014, resulted in the \n     resignation of the Prime Minister and his cabinet and the \n     repeal of most of the antidemocratic laws from January 16, \n     2014; and\n       Whereas, On February 20, 2014, Ukrainian security forces, \n     including heavily armed snipers, fired on demonstrators in \n     Kyiv, leaving dozens dead and the people of Ukraine reeling \n     from the most lethal day of violence since the Soviet era, \n     and many of President Yanukovych's political allies, \n     including the major of Kyiv, resigned from his governing \n     Party of Regions to protest the bloodshed; and\n       Whereas, On February 22, 2014, the Ukrainian parliament \n     found President Yanukovych unable to fulfill his duties, \n     exercised its constitutional powers to remove him from office \n     and set an election for May 25, 2014, to select his \n     replacement; and\n       Whereas, On March 2, 2014, Russian troops invaded the \n     Ukrainian territory of Crimea, seizing control of the \n     peninsula, border crossings, government and administrative \n     buildings, key infrastructure and surrounding Ukrainian \n     military bases; and\n       Whereas, The military intervention by the Russian \n     Federation in Crimea is a violation of Ukraine's sovereignty, \n     independence and territorial integrity; and\n       Whereas, On March 16, 2014, Crimea held a referendum on \n     seceding from Ukraine and acceding to the Russian Federation, \n     which violated the Ukrainian constitution, occurred under \n     duress of Russian military intervention and was not \n     recognized by the international community; and\n       Whereas, On March 20, 2014, the Russian parliament noted to \n     annex Crimea and Russian President Putin signed the treaty of \n     accession annexing Crimea to the Russian Federation; and\n       Whereas, On April 7, 2014, protesters occupied government \n     buildings in Ukraine's eastern cities of Donetsk, Luhansk and \n     Kharkiv; and\n       Whereas, On April 18, 2014, the United States, Russia, \n     Ukraine and the European Union agreed at talks in Geneva on \n     steps to de-escalate the crisis in eastern Ukraine; and\n\n[[Page S4556]]\n\n       Whereas, On April 22, 2014, Ukraine's acting president \n     ordered the relaunch of military operations against pro-\n     Russian militants in the east after two men were found \n     tortured to death in the Donetsk region; and\n       Whereas, On May 25, 2014, Ukraine held a presidential \n     election, but most polling stations in the east remained \n     closed; and\n       Whereas, Pedro Poroshenko was elected President and vowed \n     to bring ``peace to a united and free Ukraine''; and\n       Whereas, The Senate greatly values the warm and close \n     relationship the United States has established with Ukraine \n     since that country regained its independence in 1991: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate of the Commonwealth of \n     Pennsylvania express support for the democratic and European \n     aspirations of the people of Ukraine and their right to \n     choose their own future free of intimidation and fear; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That the Senate call on the United States and the \n     European Union to continue to work together to support a \n     peaceful resolution to the crisis and to continue to support \n     the desire of millions of Ukrainian citizens for closer \n     relations with Europe through finalizing the signing of an \n     Association Agreement, as well as for a democratic future;

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Michigan urging the Congress \n     of the United States to approve the Presidents budget \n     proposal to provide 35 million dollars to help communities \n     process evidence from untested sexual assault kits; to the \n     Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 382\n\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S4556, July 16, 2014, in the first column, the following \nlanguage appears: House of Representatives No. 382\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: House Resolution \nNo. 382\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n       Whereas, Sexual violence continues to plague our nation and \n     destroy lives. Women and girls are the vast majority of \n     victims, and nearly one in five women, or about 22 million, \n     have been raped during their lifetimes. Men and boys are also \n     at risk and one in 71 men, or about 1.6 million, have been \n     raped during their lifetimes. Nearly one-half of all female \n     rape survivors were raped before I8 years of age, and over \n     one-quarter of male rape survivors were raped before 10 years \n     of age; and\n       Whereas, Effective collection of forensic evidence is of \n     paramount importance to successfully prosecuting sex \n     offenders, as is performing sexual assault forensic exams in \n     a sensitive, dignified, and victim-centered manner. Sexual \n     assault forensic examinations are intrusive, lengthy, and \n     complex medical examinations that take an average of three to \n     four hours. A victim who agrees to a sexual assault forensic \n     exam reasonably expects evidence collected from that exam, \n     also referred to as a rape kit, to be analyzed; and\n       Whereas, The federal government has estimated that hundreds \n     of thousands of rape kits sit untested in police and crime \n     storage facilities across the country in what is known as the \n     rape kit backlog. Crime labs have struggled over the past \n     decade to meet the demand for DNA testing for all types of \n     crimes. With demand continuing to outpace capacity--the \n     Joyful Heart Foundation estimates that every two minutes \n     someone is sexually assaulted in the U.S.--the backlog in \n     testing evidence collected from sexual assault forensic exams \n     will likely continue to grow; and\n       Whereas, Untested sexual assault kits mean lost \n     opportunities to develop DNA profiles, search for matches, \n     link cold cases, and bring justice and resolution to the \n     victim. DNA can help identify unknown offenders and when the \n     offender is known, it can result in ``cold hits'' connecting \n     the known suspect to other crimes. Failure to test evidence \n     collected from a sexual assault kit in a timely manner can be \n     tragic, from expired statutes of limitation that preclude \n     prosecution even if a suspect is later identified, to \n     additional rape and murder victims of serial rapists; and\n       Whereas, Local jurisdictions that have attempted to \n     alleviate the rape kit backlog have impressive results to \n     show for their efforts. With federal funding, the Wayne \n     County Prosecuting Attorney's Office along with the Detroit \n     Police Department, has begun to address a backlog of more \n     than 10,000 rape kits. Among those first 1,600 kits tested, \n     there were 455 matches in the DNA database, including matches \n     linking to crimes committed in 22 other states and the \n     District of Columbia. The Prosecutor's Office identified 127 \n     potential serial rapists and obtained 14 convictions of \n     potential serial rapists who are lied to rapes reported in 12 \n     other states and the District of Columbia; and\n       Whereas, Testing sexual assault kits provides essential \n     evidence. But, equally essential is the investigation and \n     prosecution of identified perpetrators, without which \n     survivors arc denied justice, rapists remain free to assault \n     with impunity, and our communities continue to suffer \n     emotionally and economically; and\n       Whereas, Reducing the rape kit backlog is a national \n     concern requiring a national response. Federal funding is \n     crucial to help communities in Michigan and other states to \n     test and follow up on untested sexual assault kits: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we urge \n     Congress of the United States to approve President Obama's \n     budget proposal to provide $35 million to help communities \n     process evidence from untested sexual assault kits; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That copies of the resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-310. A joint resolution adopted by the General Assembly \n     of the State of Colorado designating the month of October as \n     ``Safe Schools Month''; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution 14-031\n\n       Whereas, Colorado is committed to ensuring safe schools for \n     all students, from early learning to higher education; and\n       Whereas, Safe schools provide an environment where \n     effective teaching and learning can take place so that all \n     education goals can be achieved; and\n       Whereas, Safe schools interface with the larger community \n     by providing safe havens and distribution centers in the \n     event of greater community crisis; and\n       Whereas, Each school day, Colorado school personnel are \n     accountable for the safety of over 875,000 students, or about \n     one-sixth of the total population of the state; and\n       Whereas, Educators and school personnel are the first \n     responders in the schools, on the routes to and from school, \n     on field trips, and at school-related events; and\n       Whereas, Schools face a broad range of safety-related \n     threats, including human-caused hazards, technological \n     hazards, and natural hazards; and\n       Whereas, Schools must adopt guiding principles of readiness \n     and all-hazards emergency management, including prevention, \n     mitigation, protection, preparedness, response, and recovery, \n     in addressing these threats; and\n       Whereas, Educators and school personnel must communicate, \n     coordinate, and collaborate with professional responders and \n     other community partners in applying these guiding \n     principles; and\n       Whereas, Schools must keep pace with improvements and \n     changes in safe schools design, crime prevention through \n     environmental design, security systems, communications, \n     information management, training programs, and other \n     resources related to school safety; and\n       Whereas, Schools must continually evaluate and update \n     policies, standard operating procedures, memoranda of \n     understanding, best practices, lessons learned, and \n     fundraising activities related to school safety; and\n       Whereas, Schools can improve safety by making sure that \n     climates are welcoming and that responses to misbehavior are \n     fair, non-discriminatory and effective through training \n     staff, engaging families and community partners, and \n     deploying resources to help students develop the social, \n     emotional, and conflict resolution skills needed to avoid and \n     de-escalate problems; and\n       Whereas, The mission of the Colorado School Safety Resource \n     Center is to assist educators, emergency responders, \n     community organizations, school mental health professionals, \n     parents, and students in creating safe, positive, and \n     successful school environments for Colorado students in all \n     K-12 and higher education schools; and\n       Whereas, In 2013, the Colorado School Safety Resource \n     Center published nearly 800 announcements in its monthly \n     newsletters on school safety-related topics such as training, \n     grant information, prevention and protection resources, \n     current research and statistical resources, and youth-\n     specific information; and\n       Whereas, The members of the General Assembly believe that a \n     yearly commemorative month devoted to school safety and a \n     safe school climate can encourage activities that provide \n     awareness about school safety topics: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the Sixty-ninth General Assembly \n     of the State of Colorado, the House of Representatives \n     concurring herein:\n       That we, the members of the Colorado General Assembly:\n       (1) Believe that establishing a commemorative month devoted \n     to school safety and school climate can foster awareness \n     about these important topics affecting our state's children \n     and educators;\n       (2) Designate October as ``Safe Schools Month'' in \n     Colorado; and\n       (3) Encourage all educators, community partners, first \n     responders, subject matter experts, members of the private \n     sector, the media, and other stakeholders to coordinate their \n     activities with the Colorado School\n\n[[Page S4557]]\n\n     Safety Resource Center and to help promote a culture of \n     school safety and positive school climate, and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this Joint Resolution be sent to \n     the Honorable Barack Obama, President of the United States;

A joint memorial adopted by the General Assembly \n     of the State of Colorado urging the United States Congress to \n     provide statutory relief to grant Colorado research \n     institutions the authority to conduct controlled clinical and \n     objective medical research trials regarding marijuana's \n     medical efficacy; to the Committee on Health, Education, \n     Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                      Senate Joint Memorial 14-006\n\n       Whereas, Colorado is in a unique situation regarding \n     marijuana use in this country; and\n       Whereas, Colorado's constitution authorizes the legal use \n     of marijuana for both medical and private adult use, but the \n     use of marijuana is still illegal under federal law; and\n       Whereas, Because marijuana use has been illegal under \n     federal law since 1937, there is limited modern, scientific-\n     based research regarding the medical use of marijuana; and\n       Whereas, Without medical research, most information \n     regarding marijuana's medical efficacy is limited in clinical \n     or scientific evidence and is anecdotal or observational; and\n       Whereas, Several marijuana extracts seem to demonstrate \n     significant benefits for pain control, treatment of childhood \n     epileptic seizures, and other beneficial effects, often with \n     fewer side effects than prescription drugs, and without use \n     dependence; and\n       Whereas, Colorado has an unprecedented opportunity to \n     provide the United States with scientific-based, peer-\n     reviewed clinical medical research that could lead to a \n     medical consensus regarding marijuana's medical efficacy to \n     treat a number of chronic and debilitating medical \n     conditions; and\n       Whereas, Colorado is proposing to spend up to $10 million \n     studying marijuana's medical efficacy in Senate Bill 14-155; \n     and\n       Whereas, Federal law currently significantly restricts \n     state research institutions that receive federal funding from \n     conducting controlled clinical trials regarding marijuana's \n     medical efficacy: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the Sixty-ninth General Assembly \n     of the State of Colorado, the House of Representatives \n     concurring herein:\n       That the United States Congress is hereby memorialized to \n     provide statutory relief to grant Colorado research \n     institutions the authority to conduct controlled clinical and \n     objective medical research trials regarding marijuana's \n     medical efficacy, and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this Joint Memorial be sent to \n     each member of the Colorado Congressional delegation, the \n     speaker of the United States House of Representatives, and \n     the president of the United States Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/16/senate-section/article/S4557-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4557]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. MENENDEZ, from the Committee on Foreign Relations, \n     without amendment and with a preamble:\n       S.

A bill to require the Secretary of the Interior to convey \ncertain Federal land to Idaho County in the State of Idaho, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I rise on behalf of Senator Crapo and \nmyself to introduce the Idaho County Shooting Range Land Conveyance \nAct.\n  Idahoans deeply value their Second Amendment rights, and recreational \nuse of firearms for hunting and shooting sports is common. The use of \nfirearms in Idaho is a tradition often passed through the generations, \nand many use it as an opportunity to teach safe and responsible \npractices to their children.\n  We have been working on this matter and on this particular issue \nsince 2010 as it relates to this particular parcel of ground.\n  Idaho County needs adequate resources to provide this not only for \nits citizens but also for its law enforcement agencies. The Idaho \nCounty Sheriff's Office cannot effectively train their staff in \nfirearms use because they simply do not have the facilities.\n  Should the Idaho County Shooting Range Land Conveyance Act be \nenacted, a 31-acre parcel of land in Idaho will be transferred from the \nU.S. Government to Idaho County for use as a gun range which will be \nmaintained by the county.\n  It is enthusiastically supported by both the Idaho County Sheriff's \nOffice, the county commissioners, and the citizens of Idaho County.\n  Passing this legislation will fill the void in Idaho County for \nfirearm training, practice, and shooting sports for citizens and law \nenforcement by providing quality facilities that will ensure safe and \nresponsible use for years to come.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Senate Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee to pass this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/16/senate-section/article/S4559-2", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4559]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 503--DESIGNATING SEPTEMBER 2014 AS ``NATIONAL CHILD \n    AWARENESS MONTH'' TO PROMOTE AWARENESS OF CHARITIES BENEFITTING \n CHILDREN AND YOUTH-SERVING ORGANIZATIONS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES \n AND RECOGNIZING EFFORTS MADE BY THOSE CHARITIES AND ORGANIZATIONS ON \nBEHALF OF CHILDREN AND YOUTH AS CRITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE FUTURE OF \n                           THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. BURR (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Coburn, Mr. Enzi, and Ms. \nMikulski) submitted the following resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. VITTER submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by \nhim to the bill S. 2578, to ensure that employers cannot interfere in \ntheir employees' birth control and other health care decisions; which \nwas ordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n                   TITLE__--PRENATAL NONDISCIMINATION\n\n     SEC. _01. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Prenatal Nondiscrimination \n     Act (PRENDA) of 2014''.\n\n     SEC. _02. FINDINGS AND CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Women are a vital part of American society and culture \n     and possess the same fundamental human rights and civil \n     rights as men.\n       (2) United States law prohibits the dissimilar treatment of \n     males and females who are similarly situated and prohibits \n     sex discrimination in various contexts, including the \n     provision of employment, education, housing, health insurance \n     coverage, and athletics.\n       (3) Sex is an immutable characteristic ascertainable at the \n     earliest stages of human development through existing medical \n     technology and procedures commonly in use, including \n     maternal-fetal bloodstream DNA sampling, amniocentesis, \n     chorionic villus sampling or ``CVS'', and obstetric \n     ultrasound. In addition to medically assisted sex \n     determination, a growing sex determination niche industry has \n     developed and is marketing low-cost commercial products, \n     widely advertised and available, that aid in the sex \n     determination of an unborn child without the aid of medical \n     professionals. Experts have demonstrated that the sex-\n     selection industry is on the rise and predict that it will \n     continue to be a growing trend in the United States. Sex \n     determination is always a necessary step to the procurement \n     of a sex-selection abortion.\n       (4) A ``sex-selection abortion'' is an abortion undertaken \n     for purposes of eliminating an unborn child based on the sex \n     or gender of the child. Sex-selection abortion is barbaric, \n     and described by scholars and civil rights advocates as an \n     act of sex-based or gender-based violence, predicated on sex \n     discrimination. Sex-selection abortions are typically late-\n     term abortions performed in the 2nd or 3rd trimester of \n     pregnancy, after the unborn child has developed sufficiently \n     to feel pain. Substantial medical evidence proves that an \n     unborn child can experience pain at 20 weeks after \n     conception, and perhaps substantially earlier. By definition, \n     sex-selection abortions do not implicate the health of the \n     mother of the unborn, but instead are elective procedures \n     motivated by sex or gender bias.\n       (5) The targeted victims of sex-selection abortions \n     performed in the United States and worldwide are \n     overwhelmingly female. The selective abortion of females is \n     female infanticide, the intentional killing of unborn \n     females, due to the preference for male offspring or ``son \n     preference''. Son preference is reinforced by the low value \n     associated, by some segments of the world community, with \n     female offspring. Those segments tend to regard female \n     offspring as financial burdens to a family over their \n     lifetime due to their perceived inability to earn or provide \n     financially for the family unit as can a male. In addition, \n     due to social and legal convention, female offspring are less \n     likely to carry on the family name. ``Son preference'' is one \n     of the most evident manifestations of sex or gender \n     discrimination in any society, undermining female equality, \n     and fueling the elimination of females' right to exist in \n     instances of sex-selection abortion.\n       (6) Sex-selection abortions are not expressly prohibited by \n     United States law or the laws of 47 States. Sex-selection \n     abortions are performed in the United States. In a March 2008 \n     report published in the Proceedings of the National Academy \n     of Sciences, Columbia University economists Douglas Almond \n     and Lena Edlund examined the sex ratio of United States-born \n     children and found ``evidence of sex selection, most likely \n     at the prenatal stage''. The data revealed obvious ``son \n     preference'' in the form of unnatural sex-ratio imbalances \n     within certain segments of the United States population, \n     primarily those segments tracing their ethnic or cultural \n     origins to countries where sex-selection abortion is \n     prevalent. The evidence strongly suggests that some Americans \n     are exercising sex-selection abortion practices within the \n     United States consistent with discriminatory practices common \n     to their country of origin, or the country to which they \n     trace their ancestry. While sex-selection abortions are more \n     common outside the United States, the evidence reveals that \n     female feticide is also occurring in the United States.\n       (7) The American public supports a prohibition of sex-\n     selection abortion. In a March 2006 Zogby International poll, \n     86 percent of Americans agreed that sex-selection abortion \n     should be illegal, yet only 3 States proscribe sex-selection \n     abortion.\n       (8) Despite the failure of the United States to proscribe \n     sex-selection abortion, the United States Congress has \n     expressed repeatedly, through Congressional resolution, \n     strong condemnation of policies promoting sex-selection \n     abortion in the ``Communist Government of China''. Likewise, \n     at the 2007 United Nation's Annual Meeting of the Commission \n     on the Status of Women, 51st Session, the United States \n     delegation spearheaded a resolution calling on countries to \n     condemn sex-selective abortion, a policy directly \n     contradictory to the permissiveness of current United States \n     law, which places no restriction on the practice of sex-\n     selection abortion. The United Nations Commission on the \n     Status of Women has urged governments of all nations ``to \n     take necessary measures to prevent . . . prenatal sex \n     selection''.\n       (9) A 1990 report by Harvard University economist Amartya \n     Sen, estimated that more than 100 million women were \n     ``demographically missing'' from the world as early as 1990 \n     due to sexist practices, including sex-selection abortion. \n     Many experts believe sex-selection abortion is the primary \n     cause. Current estimates of women missing from the world \n     range in the hundreds of millions.\n       (10) Countries with longstanding experience with sex-\n     selection abortion--such as the Republic of India, the United \n     Kingdom, and the People's Republic of China--have enacted \n     restrictions on sex-selection, and have steadily continued to \n     strengthen prohibitions and penalties. The United States, by \n     contrast, has no law in place to restrict sex-selection \n     abortion, establishing the United States as affording less \n     protection from sex-\n\n[[Page S4561]]\n\n     based feticide than the Republic of India or the People's \n     Republic of China, whose recent practices of sex-selection \n     abortion were vehemently and repeatedly condemned by United \n     States congressional resolutions and by the United States \n     Ambassador to the Commission on the Status of Women. Public \n     statements from within the medical community reveal that \n     citizens of other countries come to the United States for \n     sex-selection procedures that would be criminal in their \n     country of origin. Because the United States permits abortion \n     on the basis of sex, the United States may effectively \n     function as a ``safe haven'' for those who seek to have \n     American physicians do what would otherwise be criminal in \n     their home countries--a sex-selection abortion, most likely \n     late-term.\n       (11) The American medical community opposes sex-selection. \n     The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, \n     commonly known as ``ACOG'', stated in its 2007 Ethics \n     Committee Opinion, Number 360, that sex-selection is \n     inappropriate because it ``ultimately supports sexist \n     practices''. The American Society of Reproductive Medicine \n     (commonly known as ``ASRM'') 2004 Ethics Committee Opinion on \n     sex-selection notes that central to the controversy of sex-\n     selection is the potential for ``inherent gender \n     discrimination'', . . . the ``risk of psychological harm to \n     sex-selected offspring (i.e., by placing on them expectations \n     that are too high)'', . . . and ``reinforcement of gender \n     bias in society as a whole''. Embryo sex-selection, ASRM \n     notes, remains ``vulnerable to the judgment that no matter \n     what its basis, [the method] identifies gender as a reason to \n     value one person over another, and it supports socially \n     constructed stereotypes of what gender means''. In doing so, \n     it not only ``reinforces possibilities of unfair \n     discrimination, but may trivialize human reproduction by \n     making it depend on the selection of nonessential features of \n     offspring''. The ASRM ethics opinion continues, ``ongoing \n     problems with the status of women in the United States make \n     it necessary to take account of concerns for the impact of \n     sex-selection on goals of gender equality''. The American \n     Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, an \n     organization with hundreds of members--many of whom are \n     former abortionists--makes the following declaration: ``Sex \n     selection abortions are more graphic examples of the damage \n     that abortion inflicts on women. In addition to increasing \n     premature labor in subsequent pregnancies, increasing suicide \n     and major depression, and increasing the risk of breast \n     cancer in teens who abort their first pregnancy and delay \n     childbearing, sex selection abortions are often targeted at \n     fetuses simply because the fetus is female. As physicians who \n     care for both the mother and her unborn child, the American \n     Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists \n     vigorously opposes aborting fetuses because of their \n     gender.''. The President's Council on Bioethics published a \n     Working Paper stating the council's belief that society's \n     respect for reproductive freedom does not prohibit the \n     regulation or prohibition of ``sex control'', defined as the \n     use of various medical technologies to choose the sex of \n     one's child. The publication expresses concern that ``sex \n     control might lead to . . . dehumanization and a new \n     eugenics''.\n       (12) Sex-selection abortion results in an unnatural sex-\n     ratio imbalance. An unnatural sex-ratio imbalance is \n     undesirable, due to the inability of the numerically \n     predominant sex to find mates. Experts worldwide document \n     that a significant sex-ratio imbalance in which males \n     numerically predominate can be a cause of increased violence \n     and militancy within a society. Likewise, an unnatural sex-\n     ratio imbalance gives rise to the commoditization of humans \n     in the form of human trafficking, and a consequent increase \n     in kidnapping and other violent crime.\n       (13) Sex-selection abortions have the effect of diminishing \n     the representation of women in the American population, and \n     therefore, the American electorate.\n       (14) Sex-selection abortion reinforces sex discrimination \n     and has no place in a civilized society.\n       (15) The history of the United States includes examples of \n     sex discrimination. The people of the United States \n     ultimately responded in the strongest possible legal terms by \n     enacting a constitutional amendment correcting elements of \n     such discrimination. Women, once subjected to sex \n     discrimination that denied them the right to vote, now have \n     suffrage guaranteed by the 19th amendment. The elimination of \n     discriminatory practices has been and is among the highest \n     priorities and greatest achievements of American history.\n       (16) Implicitly approving the discriminatory practice of \n     sex-selection abortion by choosing not to prohibit them will \n     reinforce these inherently discriminatory practices, and \n     evidence a failure to protect a segment of certain unborn \n     Americans because those unborn are of a sex that is \n     disfavored. Sex-selection abortions trivialize the value of \n     the unborn on the basis of sex, reinforcing sex \n     discrimination, and coarsening society to the humanity of all \n     vulnerable and innocent human life, making it increasingly \n     difficult to protect such life. Thus, Congress has a \n     compelling interest in acting--indeed it must act--to \n     prohibit sex-selection abortion.\n       (b) Constitutional Authority.--In accordance with the above \n     findings, Congress enacts the following pursuant to Congress' \n     power under--\n       (1) the Commerce Clause;\n       (2) section 5 of the 14th amendment, including the power to \n     enforce the prohibition on Government action denying equal \n     protection of the laws; and\n       (3) section 8 of article I to make all laws necessary and \n     proper for the carrying into execution of powers vested by \n     the Constitution in the Government of the United States.\n\n     SEC. _03.

FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS; PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Sean Goldman, a United States citizen and resident of \n     New Jersey, was abducted from the United States in 2004 and \n     separated from his father, David Goldman, who spent nearly 6 \n     years battling for the return of his son from Brazil before \n     Sean was finally returned to Mr. Goldman's custody on \n     December 24, 2009.\n       (2) The Department of State's Office of Children's Issues, \n     which serves as the Central Authority of the United States \n     for the purposes of the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil \n     Aspects of International Child Abduction (referred to in this \n     Act as the ``Hague Abduction Convention''), has received \n     thousands of requests since 2007 for assistance in the return \n     to the United States of children who have been wrongfully \n     abducted by a parent or other legal guardian to another \n     country.\n       (3) For a variety of reasons reflecting the significant \n     obstacles to the recovery of abducted children, as well as \n     the legal and factual complexity involving such cases, not \n     all cases are reported to the Central Authority of the United \n     States.\n       (4) More than 1,000 outgoing international child abductions \n     are reported every year to the Central Authority of the \n     United States, which depends solely on proactive reporting of \n     abduction cases.\n       (5) Only about one-half of the children abducted from the \n     United States to countries with which the United States \n     enjoys reciprocal obligations under the Hague Abduction \n     Convention are returned to the United States.\n       (6) The United States and other Convention countries have \n     expressed their desire, through the Hague Abduction \n     Convention, ``to protect children internationally from the \n     harmful effects of their wrongful removal or retention and to \n     establish procedures to ensure their prompt return to the \n     State of their habitual residence, as well as to secure \n     protection for rights of access.''\n       (7) Compliance by the United States and other Convention \n     countries depends on the actions of their designated central \n     authorities, the performance of their judicial systems as \n     reflected in the legal process and decisions rendered to \n     enforce or effectuate the Hague Abduction Convention, and the \n     ability and willingness of their\n\n[[Page S4564]]\n\n     law enforcement authorities to ensure the swift enforcement \n     of orders rendered pursuant to the Hague Abduction \n     Convention.\n       (8) According to data from the Department of State, \n     approximately 40 percent of abduction cases involve children \n     taken from the United States to countries with which the \n     United States does not have reciprocal obligations under the \n     Hague Abduction Convention or other arrangements relating to \n     the resolution of abduction cases.\n       (9) According to the Department of State's April 2010 \n     Report on Compliance with the Hague Convention on the Civil \n     Aspects of International Child Abduction, ``parental child \n     abduction jeopardizes the child and has substantial long-term \n     consequences for both the child and the left-behind parent.''\n       (10) Few left-behind parents have the extraordinary \n     financial resources necessary--\n       (A) to pursue individual civil or criminal remedies in both \n     the United States and a foreign country, even if such \n     remedies are available; or\n       (B) to engage in repeated foreign travel to attempt to \n     obtain the return of their children through diplomatic or \n     other channels.\n       (11) Military parents often face additional complications \n     in resolving abduction cases because of the challenges \n     presented by their military obligations.\n       (12) In addition to using the Hague Abduction Convention to \n     achieve the return of abducted children, the United States \n     has an array of Federal, State, and local law enforcement, \n     criminal justice, and judicial tools at its disposal to \n     prevent international abductions.\n       (13) Federal agencies tasked with preventing international \n     abductions have indicated that the most effective way to stop \n     international child abductions is while they are in progress, \n     rather than after the child has been removed to a foreign \n     destination.\n       (14) Parental awareness of abductions in progress, rapid \n     response by relevant law enforcement, and effective \n     coordination among Federal, State, local, and international \n     stakeholders are critical in preventing such abductions.\n       (15) A more robust application of domestic tools, in \n     cooperation with international law enforcement entities and \n     appropriate application of the Hague Abduction Convention \n     could--\n       (A) discourage some parents from attempting abductions;\n       (B) block attempted abductions at ports of exit; and\n       (C) help achieve the return of more abducted children.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the United States should set a strong example for other \n     Convention countries in the timely location and prompt \n     resolution of cases involving children abducted abroad and \n     brought to the United States.\n       (c) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to protect children whose habitual residence is the \n     United States from wrongful abduction;\n       (2) to assist left-behind parents in quickly resolving \n     cases and maintaining safe and predictable contact with their \n     child while an abduction case is pending;\n       (3) to protect the custodial rights of parents, including \n     military parents, by providing the parents, the judicial \n     system, and law enforcement authorities with the information \n     they need to prevent unlawful abduction before it occurs;\n       (4) to enhance the prompt resolution of abduction and \n     access cases;\n       (5) to detail an appropriate set of actions to be \n     undertaken by the Secretary of State to address persistent \n     problems in the resolution of abduction cases;\n       (6) to establish a program to prevent wrongful abductions; \n     and\n       (7) to increase interagency coordination in preventing \n     international child abduction by convening a working group \n     composed of presidentially appointed and Senate confirmed \n     officials from the Department of State, the Department of \n     Homeland Security, and the Department of Justice.\n\n     SEC. 3.

I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to S. Res. \n504.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 504) to direct the Senate Legal \n     Counsel to appear as amicus curiae in the name of the Senate \n     in Menachem Binyamin Zivotofsky, By His Parents and \n     Guardians, Ari Z. and Naomi Siegman Zivotofsky v. John Kerry, \n     Secretary of State.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There being no objection, the Senate proceeded \nto consider the resolution.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, next term the Supreme Court will take up a \ncase presenting the question whether a provision of the Foreign \nRelations Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003, which affects the \nofficial identification documents of some American citizens born \nabroad, is constitutional. In 2002, Congress enacted a law permitting \nU.S. citizens who are born in Jerusalem to have the Secretary of State \nspecify ``Israel'' as their birthplace on their passports and other \nconsular documents. Under existing State Department policy, passports \nand other documents of U.S. citizens born in Jerusalem may only record \n``Jerusalem'' as their place of birth, not ``Israel,'' regardless of \nthe wishes of the child or the parents.\n  Although the President signed the Foreign Relations Authorization Act \nfor fiscal year 2003 into law, in his signing statement he stated that, \nif the section of the law that included that provision, section 214, \nwere interpreted as mandatory, it would ``interfere with the \nPresident's constitutional authority to formulate the position of the \nUnited States, speak for the Nation in international affairs, and \ndetermine the terms on which recognition is given to foreign states.'' \nEmphasizing that ``U.S. policy regarding Jerusalem has not changed,'' \nthe Executive has continued to record solely ``Jerusalem'' as the \nbirthplace on passports of all U.S. citizens born in Jerusalem, \nregardless of their preference and notwithstanding the statute.\n  In accordance with the Executive's policy, the State Department \ndeclined a request to place ``Israel'' on the official documents of a \nyoung Jerusalem-born U.S. citizen despite the statutory directive. The \nboy's parents then sued the Secretary of State on his behalf and sought \nan order to have ``Israel'' recorded as their son's place of birth. \nTheir suit has been before the D.C. Circuit three times and is now in \nthe Supreme Court for the second time.\n  Both the district court and the court of appeals initially ordered \nthe suit dismissed. The D.C. Circuit held that the parents' claim under \nthe statute ``presents a nonjusticiable political question because it \ntrenches upon the President's constitutionally committed recognition \npower,'' which the court said, includes ``a decision made by the \nPresident regarding which government is sovereign over a particular \nplace.'' Siding with the Executive, the court explained, ``[E]very \npresident since 1948 has, as a matter of official policy, purposefully \navoided taking a position on the issue whether Israel's sovereignty \nextends to the city of Jerusalem. . . . The State Department's refusal \nto record `Israel' in passports and Consular Reports of Birth of U.S. \ncitizens born in Jerusalem implements this longstanding policy of the \nExecutive.''\n  The parents sought Supreme Court review, and in 2011 the Attorney \nGeneral advised Congress that the Department of Justice would defend \nthe court of appeals' judgment that the case was nonjusticiable, but \nthat it would also argue that, if the claim was found to be \njusticiable, section 214(d) of the Act unconstitutionally infringes on \nthe President's exclusive authority to recognize foreign states. A \nnumber of Senators and Members of the House appeared as amici curiae, \nor friends of the court, in support of the statute.\n  The Supreme Court granted certiorari and vacated the court of \nappeals' holding that the constitutional issue was a political \nquestion. The Court found that the case called for nothing more than \nperforming the ``familiar judicial exercise'' of ``deciding whether the \nstatute impermissibly intrudes upon Presidential powers under the \nConstitution.''\n  On remand, Members of both Houses again submitted amicus curiae \nbriefs in defense of section 214(d). One judge on the appellate panel \nfound that the plaintiff's argument was ``powerfully'' buttressed by \nbriefs submitted by Members of Congress, among other amici. However, \nthe panel majority observed, ``While an amicus brief has been submitted \non behalf of six senators and fifty-seven representatives, they of \ncourse do not speak for the Congress qua the Congress.''\n  Based on its review of constitutional text and structure, precedent, \nand history, the D.C. Circuit concluded, this time on the merits, that \nthe President ``exclusively holds the power to determine whether to \nrecognize a foreign sovereign'' and that the statute ``plainly intended \nto force the State Department to deviate from its decades-long position \nof neutrality on what nation or government, if any, is sovereign over \nJerusalem.'' The court found conclusive the Executive's view that, in \nso doing, ``section 214(d) would cause adverse foreign policy \nconsequences.'' Accordingly, the court found that the law \n``impermissibly intrudes on the President's recognition power and is \ntherefore unconstitutional.''\n  In April of this year, the Supreme Court again granted review in the \ncase, this time focused on the single question: ``Whether a federal \nstatute that directs the Secretary of State, on request, to record the \nbirthplace of an American citizen born in Jerusalem as born in `Israel' \non a Consular Report of Birth Abroad and on a United States passport is \nunconstitutional on the ground that the statute `impermissibly \ninfringes on the President's exercise of the recognition power reposing \nexclusively in him.' ''\n  This case, accordingly, now presents the Supreme Court with very \nimportant questions about the constitutional allocation of power \nbetween the branches over foreign affairs. The issues likely to be \naddressed include the claims of the Executive that the Constitution \ngives the President exclusive authority over recognition of foreign \ngovernments, that this law implicates such authority, and that the \nstatute infringes impermissibly on the President's recognition power.\n  Contrary to the Executive's claim and the reasoning of the D.C. \nCircuit,\n\n[[Page S4569]]\n\nthis statutory provision does not usurp any constitutional power of the \nPresident. In particular, it does not infringe on the President's \nexercise of the power to recognize foreign governments and to voice \npositions on matters of international sovereignty on behalf of the \nUnited States.\n  In legislating the content of identification documents available to \nAmerican citizens born abroad, Congress is exercising its plenary \npowers over immigration and naturalization and its constitutional \nauthority to regulate foreign commerce. The law does not alter the \nposition of the United States on the status of Jerusalem. Rather, it \ncontinues Congress's century-and-a-half-old exercise of legislative \nauthority over the contents and design of identification documents, \nsuch as passports, held by U.S. citizens. Congress does so in this case \nto respect the prerogative of American citizens to identify themselves \nas American citizens with a birth connection to the State of Israel, \nshould they choose to do so.\n  Mr. President, Title VII of the Ethics in Government Act authorizes \nthe Senate to appear as an amicus curiae in any legal action in which \nthe powers and responsibilities of the Congress under the Constitution \nare placed in issue. Appearance as an amicus curiae in this case would \nenable the Senate to respond to the Executive's contention that this \nlaw infringes on the President's constitutional power to recognize \nforeign governments and to present to the Court the basis for the \nSenate's conviction that the law is consistent with the Constitution.\n  This resolution would authorize the Senate Legal Counsel to appear in \nthis case in the Senate's name as amicus curiae to support the \nconstitutionality of the statute.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, \nthe preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be considered \nmade and laid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
