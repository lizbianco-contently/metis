Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, a warm thank-you to the Reverend Miniard Culpepper. \nHis words of faith and community are greatly appreciated here today.\n  For a long time now, Reverend Culpepper has been praying over me. \nLast winter, before I was sworn into office, Reverend Culpepper held a \nspecial Sunday prayer service for me in his church, Pleasant Hill \nBaptist, in Dorchester. That December evening the pews were packed with \nlocal preachers and churchgoers representing a dozen or so churches in \nthe area.\n  At the conclusion of the service, the ministers circled around me, \nwrapped their arms together and prayed to God to give me the strength \nto work for the poor and powerless among us.\n  I feel blessed to have received their prayers, and I have tried my \nbest to keep them in my heart in my work here. But I am just one of \nmany who appreciates the hard work Reverend Culpepper and Pleasant Hill \nBaptist have put into strengthening and protecting their community.\n  You see, Reverend Culpepper and his congregation understand that \ntheir community extends well beyond the walls of their church. When \nJahmol Norfleet, a former gang leader from Roxbury, left prison and \nshowed a desire to turn his life around as a peacemaker between rival \ngangs, it was Reverend Culpepper who reached out to him. Pleasant Hill \nBaptist welcomed him into their family. After Jahmol was tragically \nshot to death outside of his grandmother's home, Reverend Culpepper \nworked hard to implement antiviolence program methods that were based \non his conversations with Jahmol.\n  When in January of this year 13-year-old Gabriel Clarke suffered \ngrievous gunshot wounds just blocks from Pleasant Hill Baptist Church, \nReverend Culpepper and his congregation resolved to start their annual \nneighborhood patrols just a little earlier. After all, as Reverend \nCulpepper remarked, this is not somebody's problem down the street or \non the other side of town, this is my problem.\n  Pleasant Hill Baptist Church was founded more than 70 years ago by \nReverend Culpepper's grandfather, Rev. Samuel H. Bullock. Reverend \nBullock was deeply involved in his community working to educate \nchildren and to reduce juvenile delinquency. Reverend Culpepper and the \ncongregation at Pleasant Hill Baptist Church have carried on that \nlegacy of community involvement with spirit and determination.\n\n[[Page S3286]]\n\n  We thank Reverend Culpepper for his blessing. We thank him for \ngracing us with the same spirit that drives him and the Pleasant Hill \nBaptist Church family back home. We thank him and his church for \nreminding us that the problems that affect our neighborhoods, our \ncities, our Commonwealth, and our country aren't someone else's \nproblems, they are all of our problems.\n  I am honored to have Reverend Culpepper here today.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, by now the minority's tactics, the \nRepublican tactics of obstruction and delay are well known, but they \nare also well worn. Those methods were once again on display yesterday \nwhen Republicans delayed for the second time in 2 weeks a Senate HELP \nCommittee vote on the nomination of Tom Perez to lead the Department of \nLabor.\n  The able and considerate chairman Tom Harkin had already postponed \nthe vote 2 weeks at the request of one of the Republicans. They \nrequested more time to review documents related to Tom Perez's \nnomination. It was terribly disappointing that, after they were granted \nadditional time as a matter of courtesy, an anonymous Republican would \nemploy an arcane procedural tactic to prevent the committee from even \nmeeting, and, of course, voting on that nomination.\n  Republicans had 7 weeks, 49 days to consider this nomination. He was \nnominated on March 21. Since his confirmation hearing in April, he has \nresponded in writing to more than 200 questions.\n  He is an extremely qualified candidate for this job. The President \nwas smart in nominating him. He is what the American dream is all \nabout. He is the son of immigrants. He paid his way through college by \nworking as a garbage collector and at a warehouse. He went on to become \nthe first lawyer in his family.\n  Mr. Perez was appointed by Governor O'Malley of Maryland to be the \nsecretary of the Department Labor, where he helped implement the \ncountry's first statewide living wage law. In his current role as the \nhead of the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice, \nMr. Perez helped settle cases on behalf of families targeted by unfair \nmortgage lending.\n  As anyone can see, he is an extremely qualified nominee. His \nknowledge and experience will make him an outstanding Secretary.\n  Unfortunately, impressive qualifications and exceptional character \nare no longer enough to satisfy Senate Republicans. Instead of a fair \nand constructive confirmation process, Republicans have chosen to play \npartisan political games with dozens--scores--of President Obama's \nappointees.\n  They have also slow-walked the nomination of dedicated public servant \nGina McCarthy to lead the EPA, the Environmental Protection Agency. \nThis morning, just a few minutes ago, Republican members of the Senate \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee sent a letter to Chairman Boxer \nindicating they will boycott committee markup of Ms. McCarthy's \nnomination.\n  This type of blanket partisan obstruction used to be unheard of. Now \nit has become the pattern Republicans have adopted. They will use any \nprocedural roadblock or stalling tactic to deny President Obama \nqualified nominees.\n  My Republican colleagues can try every trick in the book--and they \nhave and they probably will--but I assure you he will have his day in \nthe Senate. I assure everyone Ms. McCarthy will have her day in the \nSenate, and I will do all I can to ensure these highly qualified are \nconfirmed, as the President has requested.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/09/senate-section/article/S3286-3", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3286]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Today the President plans to travel to Austin, TX. I \nunderstand his trip includes a visit to a technical high school and a \nchat with workers. The idea, I presume, is to show folks that the White \nHouse has once again pivoted to jobs. If you are someone who is all \nabout the visual, then, of course, putting on a pair of goggles or \nshowing up at a factory is a great way to at least look as though you \nare doing something about the situation.\n  Whether that means you are actually getting the job done is a \ndifferent story. Unfortunately, robust job creation has been talked \nabout a lot in this administration, even as millions remain out of work \nor stuck in part-time jobs.\n  Take a look at last month's jobs report. It was touted by the White \nHouse as proof of an economy on the mend, and surely we on this side \nhope that will soon be the case. We are not there yet. We only have to \ndrill down below the top line to find a lot to be concerned about. For \ninstance, the unemployment rate technically edged down to 7.5 percent, \nbut it actually moved up to 8 percent in my home State of Kentucky. \nWhile the Federal rate is still pretty high, even those numbers don't \ntell the full story. Because so many Americans have stopped looking for \nwork altogether, we now have the lowest labor force participation rate \nsince Jimmy Carter.\n  Our actual Federal unemployment rate is nearly 11 percent. That is \nquite a ways off from the 5 percent or so the administration boldly \npredicted we would have by now if only Congress would pass the \nstimulus.\n  Consider this. If all we did was match the average of recoveries \nsince World War II, we would have about 4 million more private sector \njobs than we do today. That is how much worse this recovery is than \nother recoveries since the war.\n  Unfortunately, that is the Obama economy. I hope the President is \ntraveling to Austin today because he is finally serious about turning \nthat around, about changing course and implementing policies that might \nactually work to get the economy moving again. Given that he will be in \nTexas, he might want to think about developing more jobs in the energy \nsector. It is a huge industry--huge--not just in Texas but all across \nour country. His administration has the power, if it chooses, to spur \nmore job-creating energy resource exploration and development.\n  There is a lot more Texas is doing right too. That is why it has been \ntouted as a national leader in job creation. One study showed Texas, \nwith less than 10 percent of the population, accounted for almost one-\nthird of private sector jobs created in high-paying sectors in recent \nyears. If the President is interested in duplicating that success at \nthe Federal level, he might take note of the fact that policymakers in \nAustin have taken a very different approach from Washington when it \ncomes to how they tax and spend.\n  Basically, they do less of it with no income tax, for instance, and a \nlow ratio of spending per capita. They don't ram through laws such as \nObamaCare.\n  I hear the President plans to hold another event tomorrow where he \nwill claim that ObamaCare is helping women. Let me tell a story of how \nObamaCare is affecting one woman, and I am sure there are many more \njust like her.\n  The Wall Street Journal recently profiled a businesswoman named \nElizabeth. She is in the clothing business, and she had been hoping to \nhire more employees. But thanks to ObamaCare, Elizabeth is now being \nforced to turn to independent contractors because if she brings on just \na few more people and exceeds 50 employees, the government could punish \nher business.\n\n[[Page S3287]]\n\n  There are many other small businesswomen who will see their dreams \ncrushed under the weight of ObamaCare's nearly 20,000 pages of \nregulations. There are many women in their twenties and thirties who \nwill be unable to afford the law's massive premium increases. There are \nmany mothers who will not be able to get by if their employers cut \ntheir hours due to ObamaCare or if they lose their jobs because of it.\n  Here is something else to consider. This morning, Speaker Boehner and \nI informed the President we will not be recommending individuals to \nserve on the Independent Payment Advisory Board. The IPAB, as some call \nit, is a commission set up by ObamaCare that is charged with reducing \nMedicare payments to health care providers and determining what \nservices should be available to seniors. Of course, we know that will \nlead to access problems, waiting lists, and denied care for seniors--\nwhat most people would call rationing. It threatens to \ndisproportionately affect women too.\n  According to the Department of Labor, women make approximately 80 \npercent of health care decisions for their families and are more likely \nto be the caregivers when a family member falls ill. That family member \ncould be a child, could be a spouse, or, more often these days, a \nparent who relies on Medicare. We want to know Medicare will be there \nto take care of them, and we want to know those decisions will be made \nbetween patients, their families, and their physicians, not an \nunaccountable board of bureaucrats such as the IPAB--one that even has \nthe power to overrule payment decisions made by Congress and signed \ninto law by the President. That is how powerful IPAB is.\n  So the President should rethink the purpose of this event. I hope he \nwill use it instead as a platform to prepare women for the actual \nconsequences many of them will soon face under ObamaCare.\n  More broadly, the President needs to get out in front of this train \nwreck before Americans--men and women alike--are completely blindsided \nby it. Polling suggests that almost half of Americans are unsure how \nObamaCare will affect their families. So he really needs to get out \nthere and prepare them for what is coming.\n  If the President is truly concerned about jobs, then it is time for \nhim to admit ObamaCare was a mistake and work with Congress to repeal \nit because we need reforms that lower the cost of care. What we don't \nneed is a 2,700-page law and a resulting tower of redtape that will \ncontinue to kill jobs and hurt our economy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/09/senate-section/article/S3287-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3287]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, back home in Indiana last week, I heard \nfrom many Hoosiers who are concerned about the impact of ObamaCare. I \nwent back to listen to the people, and almost invariably, no matter \nwhat subject was on the table, the impact of ObamaCare was what was \nbrought up first and discussed the most.\n  I particularly focused on those businesses which are in a position to \nexpand and hire but are simply not doing so, and the question is, Why? \nThe answer was that they are deeply concerned about the implementation \nof the so-called Affordable Care Act, basically saying that it is an \nunaffordable care act.\n  They also said they were confused about what it means and what it \ndoesn't mean. These regulations are continuing to come out, but many of \nthem are delayed, so there is a huge cloud of uncertainty over their \nfuture. As a consequence, Hoosier employers have to make decisions \nabout hiring or not hiring, about expanding or not expanding, about \nbuying new equipment or not buying new equipment, about building new \nfactories or not building new factories.\n  In Indiana, we have positioned ourselves to be a very business-\nfriendly State. In fact, a major survey came out a couple of days ago \nthat said Indiana is among the top five States in the Nation in terms \nof being business-friendly. As a result, we have a lot of inquiries \nfrom businesses in other States, and essentially what they are saying \nis that they would like to come to our State.\n  We have a lot of people in our State who are operating businesses and \nwould like to hire more employees, but they are frozen because of this \nhealth care bill, and all of the regulations, penalties, taxes, and \nuncertainty that surround what is going to play out is leaving them in \nlimbo. We are treading water. We can't make decisions. The word of the \nyear is ``uncertainty''--uncertainty about what Washington is going to \ndo, uncertainty about the impact of what Washington has already decided \nto do. The No. 1 topic that beats all the rest is the impact of the \nAffordable Care Act--the ObamaCare act--which is now starting to impact \nvarious businesses across the State.\n\n  These concerns have been expressed both by business owners and by \nemployees working in a wide range of occupations. Their concern has \nbeen confirmed by data released by the Labor Department last week. The \nrecent report revealed retailers appear to be cutting working hours at \na rate unheard of over the last 30 years.\n  We saw some positive news come out of the jobs report last week. \nUnemployment is coming down slightly. Of course, it doesn't begin to \naddress the issue or consider those who have literally dropped out of \nthe workplace or have literally given up trying to find a job because \nthey simply aren't there. But now we face another problem. More and \nmore Americans are being pushed into part-time work, which isn't enough \nto provide for a family. Last month, nearly 280,000 Americans \ninvoluntarily entered part-time employment. Weekly take-home pay \ncontinues to decline and, of course, the number of hours employees are \nworking continues to shrink.\n  Why is this change occurring? Investor's Business Daily reported that \n``all evidence points to the coming launch of ObamaCare as the reason \nfor this decline in the average retail workweek.''\n  Beginning next year, as we know, job creators will face fines of \n$2,000 and, in some instances, up to $3,000 for every full-time worker \nwho receives subsidized coverage in the exchanges created by ObamaCare \nif qualifying coverage isn't available in the employee's workplace, or \nif that employer is no longer able to afford the cost of government-\nmandated health plans. These are small businesses. We are not talking \nabout Fortune 500 companies. We are not talking about those firms that \ncan hire a back room full of lawyers and accountants to figure out how \nthis health care plan is going to impact them and what it is going to \ncost. We are talking about the service industry, we are talking about \nthe retail shops--those that employ anywhere from 30 to 40 to 60 to 70 \nto 90 or whatever. A lot of them are trying to stay under the 50 \nlevel--the exclusion for small businesses--50 and under. So a lot of \nthem are stuck at 45, 48, and they are not going to hire to go above \nthat and they are looking for ways to move employees to part-time \nemployment so they are not burdened with these fines.\n  Many Hoosier employers have told me they would like to expand and \nhire more full-time workers, but they simply cannot afford to do so \ngiven the fines, taxes, and regulations that will hit when the \nObamaCare act is implemented starting in 2014.\n  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has said 71 percent of small businesses \nsay\n\n[[Page S3288]]\n\nthis health care plan makes it harder to hire more employees. I heard \nfrom a small business owner in Indiana who runs an employment \nmanagement service. He told me small businesses such as his have \ndecided to use a combination of cuts to keep many of their employees \nunder 30 hours a week to avoid penalties, while pushing full-time \nworkers well over 45 hours a week. Well, that is fine for the full-time \nworkers who are getting some overtime pay, but it is denying job \nopportunities for new hires because employers are put in this position \nby the mandates of the health care act. It is not just limited to the \nprivate sector. I recently heard from a State representative in Indiana \nwho is concerned about how this law is going to affect school districts \nin his area. He says some schools are being forced to move nonteacher \npersonnel to part-time status, affecting food service providers, \nteacher's aides, bus drivers, substitute teachers, maintenance \npersonnel, as well as nonteacher coaches. People from all walks of life \nhave a dark cloud of uncertainty over their future plans to run a \nbusiness, to hire employees, and to do what is necessary to expand \ntheir business, and that is so desperately needed, given we are now \nentering the fifth year of underemployment in this country. So that \nincentive to employ part-time workers means fewer hours, lower wages, \nless economic growth, less production, and it means middle-class \nAmericans will continue to pay the price of Washington's ineptness.\n  One of our colleagues here said it best about the implementation of \nthe health care law: ``I just see a huge train wreck coming down.'' I \nthink it is becoming clear that we all see a huge train wreck coming \ndown. If both sides of the aisle here understand this is a train wreck, \nthen let's do something about it now before it hits. Let's stop the \ntrain from crashing before its full impact on the economy takes effect.\n  Americans want health care reform that is an improvement but not a \nburden. We need to replace ObamaCare with commonsense health care \nreforms that will lower costs without penalizing American workers and \njob creators. If we don't act--if we don't stop this train wreck from \nhappening--we will continue to see a struggling economy with anemic \ngrowth and the American people will continue to pay the high price.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today I and my colleagues are here to \nspeak about Syria. The strategic and humanitarian costs of this \nconflict continue to be devastating, not just for the people of Syria \nbut for vital American interests. As today's Washington Post editorial \nmakes clear, nearly all of the terrible consequences that those opposed \nto intervention predicted would happen if we intervened in Syria have \nhappened because we have not.\n  There is mounting evidence that chemical weapons have been used by \nthe Asad regime. As many of our colleagues have noted--including \nSenator Feinstein, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee--\nPresident Obama's redline on Syria has been crossed. But instead of \nacting, the Obama administration has called for additional evidence to \nbe collected by U.N. investigators who have not yet set foot in Syria \nand probably never will. In the absence of more robust action, I fear \nit will not be long before Asad takes this delay as an invitation to \nuse chemical weapons again on an even larger scale.\n  Moreover, as I have said before, by drawing a redline on chemical \nweapons, the President actually gave the Asad regime a green light to \nuse every other weapon in his arsenal with impunity. More than 70,000 \nSyrians have been killed indiscriminately with snipers, artillery, \nhelicopter gunships, fighter jets, and even ballistic missiles. Indeed, \naccording to a recent Human Rights Watch report, more than 4,300 \ncivilians have been killed by Syria's airstrikes alone since July 2012.\n  At the same time, Iran and its proxy Hezbollah are building a network \nof militias inside Syria and the al-Qaida-aligned al-Nusra Front has \ngained unprecedented strength on the ground. According to estimates \npublished in the media, some believe there were no more than a few \nhundred al-Nusra fighters in Syria last year, but today it is widely \nbelieved there could be thousands of extremist fighters inside Syria. \nThey are gaining strength by the day because they are the best, most \nexperienced fighters. They are well-funded and are providing \nhumanitarian assistance in the parts of Syria where people need it \nmost.\n  At the same time, this conflict is having increasingly devastating \nconsequences to the security and stability of our allies and partners \nin Israel, Jordan, Turkey, Iraq, and Lebanon. The U.N. High \nCommissioner for Refugees has characterized the situation in Syria as \nan ``existential threat'' for Lebanon, where the government estimates \nthat 1 million Syrians have entered the country--1 million Syrians have \nentered the country of Lebanon--which has a population of just over 4 \nmillion. Similarly, over the past 2 years, more than 500,000 Syrians \nhave flooded into Jordan, a country of only 6 million people. Consider \nfor a moment that in proportional terms this would be equivalent to 26 \nmillion refugees, or the entire population of Texas, suddenly crossing \nour own borders.\n  In short, Syria is becoming a failed state in the heart of the Middle \nEast overrun by thousands of al-Qaida-affiliated fighters, with \npossibly tons of chemical weapons, and poised to ignite a wider \nsectarian conflict that could profoundly destabilize the region.\n  Yesterday brought news that the administration plans to organize, \ntogether with Russia, an international peace conference later this \nmonth to seek a negotiated settlement to the war in Syria. All of us--\nall of us--are in favor of such a political resolution to this \nconflict. No one wants to see this conflict turn into a fight to the \ndeath and total victory for one side or the other. We all want to work \ntoward a political settlement that forms a new governing structure in \nSyria reflective of the democratic aspirations of the Syrian people.\n  But let's be realistic. One of the lessons of the past 2 years is \nthat such a negotiated settlement will not be possible in Syria until \nthe balance of power shifts more decisively against Asad and those \naround him. Until Asad, as well as his Iranian, Hezbollah, and Russian \nbackers no longer believe they are winning, what incentive do they have \nto come to the table and make a deal? This is what two well-meaning \nUnited Nations senior envoys have already learned.\n  Yes, Syrian opposition forces are gaining strength and territory on \nthe ground. But Asad still has air power--a decisive factor in that \nclimate, in that terrain--ballistic missiles, chemical weapons, and a \nhost of other advanced weaponry, and he is using all of\n\n[[Page S3289]]\n\nit. Furthermore, today's news reports that Russia has agreed to sell an \nadvanced air defense system to the Asad regime should lead us once \nagain to ask ourselves whether the path to peace in Syria runs through \nMoscow.\n  I know Americans are war-weary and eager to focus on our domestic and \neconomic problems and not foreign affairs. I also know the situation in \nSyria is complex and there are no ideal options. But the basic choice \nwe face is not complicated: Do the costs of inaction outweigh the costs \nof action? I believe they do.\n  No one should think the United States has to act alone, put boots on \nthe ground, or destroy every Syrian air defense system to make a \ndifference for the better in Syria. We have more limited options at our \ndisposal, including limited military options, that can make a positive \nimpact on this crisis.\n\n  We could, for example, organize an overt and large-scale operation to \ntrain and arm well-vetted Syrian opposition forces--a course of action \nthat was recommended last year by President Obama's entire national \nsecurity team. I am encouraged that Senator Menendez, the chairman of \nthe Foreign Relations Committee, has introduced legislation this week \non this very issue and that he is speaking out about the need for more \nrobust action in Syria, including addressing Asad's air power.\n  As several key leaders in our own military have pointed out in \ntestimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee over the past several \nmonths--from Gen. James Mattis to ADM James Stavridis--we have the \ncapacity--we have the capacity--to significantly weaken both the Asad \nregime's air power and its increasing use of ballistic missiles, which \npose significant risks as delivery vehicles for chemical weapons.\n  To address this threat, we could use our precision strike \ncapabilities to target Asad's aircraft and Scud missile launchers on \nthe ground without our pilots having to fly into the teeth of Syria's \nair defenses. Similar weapons could be used to selectively destroy \nartillery pieces and make Asad's forces think twice about remaining at \ntheir posts. We could use the Patriot missile batteries outside of \nSyria to help protect safe zones inside Syria from Asad's aerial \nbombing and missile attacks.\n  Would any of these options immediately end the conflict? Probably \nnot. But they could save innocent lives in Syria. They could give the \nmoderate opposition a better chance to succeed in marginalizing radical \nactors and eventually provide security and responsible governance in \nSyria after Asad falls. However, the longer we wait, the worse the \nsituation gets and the tougher it will be to confront, as we will \ninevitably be forced to do sooner or later.\n  I am encouraged that a consensus is emerging and many of our \ncolleagues--Democrats and Republicans alike--share this view. I note \nthe leadership of Senator Levin, the chairman of our Armed Services \nCommittee, whom I joined in writing a letter to President Obama urging \nhim to take more active steps in Syria. I also note the important voice \nSenator Bob Casey has lent to this debate and ask unanimous consent \nthat his op-ed printed last week in the Huffington Post, ``Time to Act \nin Syria''--which calls for consideration of more options, including \ncruise missile strikes to neutralize the Syrian Air Force--be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Huffington Post, May 9, 2013]\n\n                          Time to Act in Syria\n\n                             (By Bob Casey)\n\n       Last week, I joined a bipartisan group of senators to ask \n     the President whether the Assad regime has used chemical \n     weapons. The administration's response suggests mounting \n     evidence of chemical weapons underscores the imperative that \n     the United States stand with the people of Syria during this \n     critical period.\n       The fall of Assad is not only good for Syria, but will deal \n     a significant blow to Iran and Hezbollah. Degrading the \n     destructive power of Iran and Hezbollah is in the national \n     security interests of the United States--Bashar al-Assad is a \n     key link between them.\n       In March, Senator Rubio and I offered legislation that \n     could offer a path forward. Since that time, several senators \n     have cosponsored the measure including Senators Kirk, Coons, \n     Klobuchar, Levin, Cardin, Boxer and Shaheen. This legislation \n     would provide support to the armed and political opposition, \n     increase humanitarian aid to Syrians inside the country and \n     to refugees in neighboring states. This bill also lays the \n     groundwork to address the immense humanitarian and political \n     challenges in the post-Assad era.\n       A political transition to a government that reflects the \n     will of the Syrian people is in the core interests of the \n     United States in the region. I have made the case \n     consistently that the U.S. should lead efforts to support the \n     moderate Syrian armed and political opposition. I have also \n     said that the U.S. should consider measures that would hamper \n     the ability of the Syrian Air Force to conduct aerial attacks \n     on civilians, including cruise missile strikes on Syrian Air \n     Force planes as they sit on the tarmac [Foreign Policy 2/27/\n     13]. In addition, the U.S., working with Turkey and NATO, \n     should use Patriot missile batteries to provide cover for \n     Syrians living in the northern part of the country who are \n     subjected to SCUD missile attacks.\n       Any U.S. action should not result in U.S. boots on the \n     ground.\n       It is time to act in the interests of our security in the \n     region. Decisive action by the U.S. and our allies could help \n     to tip the balance so that Syria can begin a transition \n     process. Absent constructive engagement by the U.S., I am \n     very concerned that the killing in Syria will continue and \n     extremists will play an increasingly influential role in \n     determining that country's future, resulting in very negative \n     implications for the region.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Let me conclude with one final thought. For America, our \ninterests are our values and our values are our interests. The moral \ndimension cannot be lost from our foreign policy. If ever a case should \nremind us of this, it is Syria.\n  Leon Wieseltier captured this point powerfully in the New Republic \nthis week:\n\n       Seventy thousand people have died in the Syrian war, most \n     of them at the hands of their ruler. Since this number has \n     appeared in the papers for many months, the actual number \n     must be much higher. The slaughter is unceasing. But the \n     debate about American intervention is increasingly conducted \n     in ``realist'' terms: the threat to American interests posed \n     by jihadism in Syria, the intrigues of Iran and Hezbollah, \n     the rattling of Israel, the ruination of Jordan and Lebanon \n     and Iraq. They are all good reasons for the president of the \n     United States to act like the president of the United States. \n     But wouldn't the prevention of ethnic cleansing and genocidal \n     war be reason enough? Is the death of scores and even \n     hundreds of thousands, and the displacement of millions, less \n     significant for American policy, and less quickening? The \n     moral dimension must be restored to our deliberations, the \n     moral sting, or else Obama, for all his talk about \n     conscience, will have presided over a terrible mutilation of \n     American discourse: the severance of conscience from action.\n\n  Nearly two decades ago, I worked with Democratic and Republican \ncolleagues in Congress to support President Clinton as he led America \nto do the right thing in stopping mass atrocities in Bosnia. The \nquestion for another President today, and for all Americans, is whether \nwe will again answer the desperate pleas for rescue that are made \nuniquely to us, as the United States of America.\n  I, first, would ask both of my colleagues one question, if it would \nbe all right. There is news today that the Secretary of State wants to \nconvene a conference, including the Russians, in order to try to bring \nabout a resolution at the same time we read reports that the Russians \nare selling Syria the most advanced weapons. I guess I would ask my \ncolleague from South Carolina and then Senator Levin because I know he \nhas a statement.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. That would be a big contradiction.\n  I will just yield to Senator Levin to answer the question and make \nhis opening statement.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank, first of all, the Senator from \nArizona for the leadership he has taken on the question of Syria. In \nanswer to the question, to the best of my ability, at least, it would \nnot be the first time Russia has taken an inconsistent position. What I \nam hoping is that the additional military pressure on Asad, which we \nare all calling for this morning, would help put pressure on Russia to \nunderstand, if that military pressure is forthcoming, that they should \nparticipate in the political solution. I do not know that we can stop \nthem, as much as we would all wish to, from taking the inconsistent \nposition that they have, but I believe--and I think the Senator from \nArizona would probably agree, but he can speak for himself, obviously--\nthat if President Obama does as we are urging him to do, which is find \na way to put additional military pressure on Asad, that would be an \nimportant sign to Russia that: OK, join in a solution. You participated \nenough in the problem already. Join in the solution.\n\n[[Page S3290]]\n\n  They are inconsistent. But I think our goal of trying to get more \nmilitary pressure on Asad is very consistent with the idea that maybe \nthere will be a political solution, but if there is, it will be \npromoted by military pressure on Asad and his understanding of that \nfact.\n  The worsening situation in Syria and the snowballing plight of \nmillions in the region requires a response.\n  Since nonviolent demonstrations demanding democratic change began in \nSyria in March of 2011, Bashar Asad and his clique of supporters have \nunleashed a massacre that has claimed the lives of at least 70,000 \nSyrians, displaced more than 4 million people across a region that \nalready suffers from a massive refugee population, sparked a civil war \nwith a multitude of divergent ethnic groups and religious sects, and \nplaced the security of Syria's chemical weapons stockpile--which is one \nof the world's largest--at risk of falling into the hands of terrorist \ngroups.\n  Despite the impact of this horrific campaign, Asad's commitment to \ncontinuing the fight appears unwavering. One must look no further than \nthe increasingly indiscriminate tactics with which he conducts his \ncampaign. In recent months, in addition to Asad's possible use of \nchemical weapons, he has increased his reliance on airstrikes, Scud \nmissiles, rockets, mortar shells, and artillery to terrorize and to \nkill civilians.\n\n  Asad's ability to conduct this campaign is enabled by two actors--\nIran and Russia. Iran's financial, personnel, and materiel support have \nbeen critical to ensuring Asad's military remains operable and that the \nimpact of defections is mitigated with reinforcements. Russia's support \nto Syria's more advanced military weaponry, most notably air defense \nsystems, is critical to Asad's continued ability to project power into \nareas of the country he no longer controls.\n  To add further complexity to the situation, al-Nusra Front, an al-\nQaida offshoot, continues to spread its influence in some areas of \nSyria. Its presence is of concern and countering its spread needs to be \na priority. It is also critical that we ensure that countries in the \nregion that are seeking to force an end to the Asad regime are not \nenabling and enhancing the capabilities of violent extremists who will \nultimately turn their weapons on moderate Syrians and on religious \nminorities in Syria, such as the Syrian Christians.\n  The combination of these circumstances in Syria demonstrates that the \nstatus quo is unacceptable and that time is not on our side. Many \nofficials in Washington share this sentiment but in the same breath \nremind us that the situation in Syria is complex, volatile, and \nasymmetric; Syria's Government institutions are crumbling, which could \ncreate a dangerous vacuum; any action by the United States or the West, \neven if it is with our Arab partners, risks significant escalation; and \nthat any security vacuum could be filled by Islamist extremists.\n  I have supported, and I will continue to support, the President's \ncontributions to provide humanitarian relief to the Syrian people \nthroughout the region, as well as the additional assistance he has \npledged to Jordan to help with the devastating impact of this conflict \non that country.\n  But it is essential that the United States, working with our allies \nin the region, step up the military pressure on the Asad regime--of \ncourse, doing so in a carefully thought out and regionally supported \nway.\n  Certainly, there are significant challenges to any plan of action in \nSyria. But we not only have to figure out the consequences of any \naction, we also have to figure out the consequences of not taking \nadditional actions. In my view, the facts on the ground make the \nconsequences of inaction too great, and it is time for the United \nStates and our allies to use ways to alter the course of events in \nSyria by increasing the military pressure on Asad until he can see that \nhis current course is not sustainable.\n  Taking steps to add military pressure on Asad will also provide \nbacking to Secretary Kerry's efforts to bring the Russians into the \ndialog politically, which is aimed at leading to Asad's departure. I \ncommend Secretary Kerry for his efforts to bring Russia into that \ndialog.\n  At the same time, of course, we condemn Russia's support for the Asad \nregime. I happen to feel very strongly that even though we are \ncondemning, and should condemn, Russia's support for the Asad regime, \nit is still in our interest that Russia participate in putting pressure \non Asad politically to depart, if Secretary Kerry can possibly do so.\n  I have joined Senator McCain recently in writing to President Obama, \nurging the President to consider supporting a number of efforts, \nincluding the creation by Turkey of a safe zone inside Syria along its \nborder, the deployment of our Patriot batteries closer to that border \nin order to protect populations in that safe zone and to neutralize any \nSyrian planes that threaten it and also to provide weapons to vetted \nelements of the opposition in Syria. These actions--raising the \nmilitary pressure on Asad--will send the critical message to Asad that \nhe is going to go one way or the other.\n  The Armed Services Committee, which I chair, recently held an open \nhearing on the situation in Syria and the Defense Department's efforts \nto plan for a full range of possible options to respond to the \ncontingencies in Syria. Our committee is set to receive a classified \nbriefing on Syria next week. I intend to raise these issues with our \nwitnesses at that briefing. I know Senator McCain and Senator Graham \nand others are also going to forcefully raise these issues with those \nwitnesses at that briefing and to urge them to carry the message back \nto the administration that it is time to up the military pressure on \nAsad.\n  I thank Senator McCain and others who are participating in this \ndiscussion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I wish to join with my distinguished \ncolleagues in our collective call for a greater engagement. I start \noff, as I always do in many years in Congress between the House and the \nSenate, with two questions: What is in the national interests of the \nUnited States? What is in the national security interests of the United \nStates? The answer to those two questions is, in essence, how I \ndetermine my views, my advocacy, my votes, and the policies I want to \npursue.\n  There are vital U.S. interests engaged in Syria. First, of course, \nthere is a humanitarian crisis, probably the most significant \nhumanitarian crisis at this moment--70,000 dead and climbing, 4 million \ndisplaced. That is, of course, an urgent call. Beyond that we have \nlarge chemical weapon stockpiles that potentially can fall into the \nwrong hands. Some have, by a whole host of public reports, already been \nused against the Syrian people. Unless you believe that somehow the \nrebels have in their possession chemical weapons, then this largely has \nto be from Asad. He has used them. I think once you use them, you are \nwilling to use them even in greater quantities. That is a real concern.\n\n  The Syrian State could collapse. That would leave a safe heaven for \nterrorists, constituting a new threat to the region. You already have \nal-Qaida affiliated al-Nusra, you have Hezbollah, you have the Iranian \nGuard. You have the opportunity for a safe heaven for terrorists \nconstituting a new threat to the region with broader implications for \nour own security.\n  The refugee crisis and sectarian violence spread instability \nthroughout the region. The King of Jordan was here 2 weeks ago and sat \nwith our committee. He made it very clear, his population has already \nincreased by 20 percent. At the rate it is going, the population of \nJordan could double. That is not sustainable for the kingdom. This is \none of the countries that has been one of our most significant and \nfaithful allies, and a constructive ally in the region. We cannot \nafford for that ally to ultimately find itself in a position in which \nit could very well collapse. We look at all of that.\n  Finally, there could be no more strategic setback to Iran--which this \nbody has spoken collectively and in a bipartisan united fashion to stop \nits march toward nuclear weapons--than to have the Asad regime \ncollapse. That would be a tremendous setback to Iran and would cause a \ndisruption in the terror pipeline between Iran and Hezbollah in \nLebanon.\n\n[[Page S3291]]\n\n  These are just some of the vital national security interests of the \nUnited States in changing the tide. Under the present set of \ncircumstances, Asad believes he is winning. For so long, as he believes \nhe is winning, he will continue the course he is on. There has to be a \nchange in the tipping point.\n  After 2 years I believe there are those in the opposition--rebels we \ncan and have thoroughly vetted--we can assist in trying to change that \ntipping point. If you have a monopoly on air power and on artillery, \nthen the reality is you will not see a change on the ground.\n  So the legislation I have introduced and am working with colleagues \non begins to move us in a different direction. It is to seek to arm \nthoroughly vetted elements of the Syrian opposition so we can change \nthe tipping point. It is to, of course, continue to provide \nhumanitarian assistance and at the same time work for the assistance of \na transition fund to help those rebels that are already controlling \nparts of the civilian population to help them administrate there and \nprepare for the future.\n  The key point is unless we change the dynamics on the ground, we will \nnot have a change in the regime. So long as the regime can continue to \nbomb its citizens indiscriminately--and if the reports, as we have seen \nfrom various countries, including our own, suggest that Asad has used \nchemical weapons against his own citizens--that is only an invitation \nto allow him to continue to do it unless we act.\n  I am willing to consider other options. I know my colleague, Senator \nMcCain, very distinguished in this field, has suggested others. I am \nwilling to consider those as well. But I think, finally, we strengthen \nthe hand of the administration and Secretary Kerry. We all want to see \na politically, diplomatically achieved solution. But in the absence of \nchanging the calculus not only of Asad but of his supporters who have \npropped him up, unless they believe he will fall, I am not sure we have \nchanged the calculus for the political opportunity to take place and \nthe diplomacy to be effective.\n  I think these efforts strengthen the hand of the administration, \ncreate a parallel track that if diplomacy fails, we will have an \nopportunity to pursue our vital national interests and security \ninterests, end the humanitarian tragedy, and create the type of \nstability we want to see in the region. I appreciate my colleague \nbringing us together on the floor of the Senate. I look forward to \ncontinuing to work with him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the distinguished chairman. May I say, it has \nbeen a great pleasure for me to have the opportunity to serve on the \nForeign Relations Committee, of which Senator Menendez is the chairman. \nI think his stewardship of that committee has been outstanding. I \nappreciate the very articulate argument the chairman just presented, \nincluding the strategic dimension of this whole issue which sometimes \nin our--particularly, when you focus so much on the humanitarian side, \nthe strategic interest of the fall of Bashar Al-Asad is something which \nI think adds another dimension. I thank the Senator and chairman of the \nForeign Relations Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would just like to echo what Senator \nMcCain said about Senator Menendez. I would like to, for the record, \nnote that the tide of war in Syria changed today because of what is \nhappening on the floor of the Senate. That may be hard for people to \nunderstand, but I really do not think so.\n  How do you change the tide of battle? You make it certain to the \nworld that Asad will go, and you provide hope to those who are fighting \nhim that they will prevail. I would suggest that a bipartisan consensus \nis forming in the Senate that now is the time to do more, not less, \nwhen it comes to Syria, including arming the rebels--the right rebels, \nthe right opposition, with the right weapons, which will eventually \nchange the tide of battle.\n  So to those who have been following this debate about Syria, to those \nwho have been in the fight trying to topple this regime, I cannot \nstress to you how important today is in your cause. When you get \nSenator Levin and Senator Menendez, two institutional, important \nfigures because of their chairmanships, but beyond that, important \nbecause of who they are and what they bring to every debate around \nnational security, combined with Senator McCain and others, you have \nturned the tide in Washington.\n  As to Senator McCain, he has been talking in the most eloquent terms \nfor at least a couple of years about stopping this war in Syria, ending \nthe Asad regime and replacing it with something better. He has been \nright, as he usually is. But now is not the time to look backward, it \nis to look forward.\n  I think an effort by the Senate and the House to acknowledge that the \ntide of war needs to change and we should be bolder in our support for \nthe opposition is going to increase the likelihood of a peaceful \nsolution through diplomacy.\n  The Russians have to know, after today, if they know anything about \nAmerican politics, the game has changed when it comes to Asad, and this \nis a monumental sea change in terms of the war in Syria by having four \nSenators who care about such matters of foreign policy to speak out and \nsay we will support arming the rebels and being more involved \nmilitarily.\n\n  To the opposition, this is a great day for you. To Asad, this seals \nyour fate.\n  Now, what do we do and how do we do it? It will not all end tomorrow \nbecause of this colloquy today, but we are well on the way to ending \nthis war. Here is the choice: The current regime, which is evil to the \ncore, and the imperfect opposition, which has been infected by radical \nIslam--you can fix the second one; you cannot fix the first. It is that \nsimple to me.\n  The sooner the war ends the better, not only for saving people in \nSyria from further slaughter, but preventing what I think would be an \nerosion of our national security interests in four areas. If this war \ngoes 6 more months, a failed state will emerge in Syria. It will be so \nfractured you cannot put it back together.\n  The 6,000 al-Qaida associated fighters will grow in number, and there \nwill be a safe haven in Syria like there was in Afghanistan. That is \nnot good for us. Unlike Afghanistan, there is enough chemical weapons \nin Syria to kill thousands if not millions of Americans and people who \nare our allies. I worry greatly not only that chemical weapons have \nbeen used in Syria on the opposition by the regime, but those same \nchemical weapons will be used in the future by radical Islamists \nagainst us.\n  The next bomb that goes off in America may have more than nails and \nglass in it. The only reason millions of Americans or thousands of \nAmericans, hundreds of thousands have not been killed by radical \nIslamists is they cannot get the weapons to kill that many of us. They \nwould if they could.\n  I have never seen a better opportunity for radical Islamists to get \nahold of weapons of mass destruction than I see in Syria today. Every \nday that goes by their opportunity to acquire some of these weapons \ngrows dramatically. If you ask me what I worry the most about with \nSyria and why we should get involved, it is for that very reason. If \nthese weapons get compromised, they are going to fall into the hands of \nthe people who will use them against us, and to believe otherwise would \nbe incredibly naive.\n  Jordan. Probably the most stabilizing figure in the Mideast in these \ndangerous times is the King of Jordan. His country is being overrun by \nrefugees. If this war goes on 6 more months, that is probably the end \nof his kingdom because it will create economic chaos and political \ninstability. He will be a victim of the civil war in Syria, and it will \nhave monumental consequences for our national security.\n  As we talk about Syria and chemical weapons falling into radical \nIslamists' hands, we are dealing with a radical regime in Iran that is \nmarching toward building a nuclear weapon. If you think the ayatollahs \nin Iran are trying to build a nuclear powerplant at the bottom of a \nmountain, you are wrong. They are trying to build a nuclear weapon to \nensure their survivability. God only knows what they would do with \nnuclear technology. But if you believe what they say, they would wipe \nIsrael off the map, and we would be next. I tend to believe what they \nsay.\n  If you allow Syria to continue to deteriorate and have a hands-off \npolicy\n\n[[Page S3292]]\n\ntoward Asad, then I think you are sending the worst possible signal to \nIran. As Senator Levin said, really the only ally Iran has today is \nAsad in Syria. How can we convince the Iranians we are serious about \ntheir nuclear problem when we do not seem to be very serious about Asad \nusing chemical weapons against his own people? What a terrible signal \nto send at one of the most important times.\n  I would end with this thought: This bipartisan consensus that is \nemerging today is going to pay great dividends. It is going to be \nhelpful to the President. We can end this war sooner rather than later. \nBut no matter what happens, there is going to be a second war in Syria, \nunfortunately.\n  That second war is going to be between radical Islamists who want to \nturn Syria into some kind of al-Qaida-inspired state, and the \noverwhelming majority of Syrians who want to live a better life and be \nour friends, not our enemies.\n  This war will occur after the fall of Asad. But it will end the right \nway. The sooner we get the first war over, the shorter the second war \nwill be. I think we can bring this war to a close without boots on the \nground. The sooner we act the better.\n  One last thought. To the opposition, you would be helping your cause \nif you would let the world know that you do not want Asad's chemical \nweapons; that the new Syria will not be a state that wants weapons of \nmass destruction; that you would agree these weapons should be \ncontrolled by the international community and destroyed; that you would \nagree to an international force coming on the ground with your blessing \nthe day after Asad falls to secure these weapons and destroy them for \nall time. I think you would be helping your cause.\n  So I say to Senator McCain, I really appreciate his leadership for a \ncouple of years. But persistence does matter in politics and all things \nthat are important. I think the Senator's persistence is paying off.\n  I say to Senator Menendez and Senator Levin, what they have done \ntoday joining up in a bipartisan fashion is going to pay great \ndividends for our own national security interests. The way forward is \npretty clear.\n  I say to President Obama, we want to be your ally. We want to be your \nsupporter. We want you to get more involved, not less. We realize it is \nhard. We realize there are risks no matter what we do. But as Senator \nMcCain said before, the risk of doing nothing by continuing on the \ncurrent track is far greater than getting involved in ending the war \nsooner.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Can I just ask one question of my colleague? I understand \nrecently he made a trip to the Middle East. There is nothing like \nseeing the terrible consequences of war. I understand the Senator \nvisited a refugee camp.\n  Maybe for the benefit of our colleagues the Senator could take a \nminute to describe the horrible conditions people who have now been \nmade refugees have been subjected to and their failure to understand \nwhy we won't be able to be of more assistance to them.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Senator for his question. It was one of the \nmost compelling trips I have ever made to the Middle East. We went to \nTurkey, Jordan, and we went to a refugee camp in Jordan. Some 40,000 \nSyrian children are now in Jordanian schools. The burden on Jordan is \nimmense, but when you talk to the people in the camps, what they have \ngone through and what their loved ones have gone through is \nheartbreaking.\n  From a national point of view, once you visit the camps, you \nunderstand what is at stake. They tell you about radical Islamists \nmoving in. They want no part of them but at the end of the day they are \nhaving more influence because we are not in the fight. You can do this \nwithout boots on the ground.\n  The most chilling thing they tell us, which Senator McCain, has been \nechoing for a long time, is their children are watching the United \nStates. Like it or not, we have the reputation in the world that we can \ndo almost anything.\n  Well, we can't do almost anything, but we are seen as a force for \ngood. The people in Syria are beside themselves wondering where is \nAmerica. America, to them, is an idea. They want to be like us because \nit means freedom, and it means economic opportunity. It means having a \nsay about your children's future. They are dumbfounded that we are not \nmore involved, given the stakes that exist in Syria. They tell us \nwithout any hesitation that the young people of Syria will remember \nthis moment. They will hold this against us. I think I know what the \nSenator is telling us.\n  Here is the good news: There is still time to act. It doesn't have to \nend that way. The conditions in Syria are horrible. The refugee camps \nwere beyond imagination. The U.N. is doing a great job, but they are \nrunning out of money. Jordan is about to fall if we don't stop this \nwar.\n  From a human point of view, we have got to get this war over and \nAmerica needs to be seen as part of the solution, not part of the \nproblem. From a national security point of view, Syria is going to \nbecome a nightmare for the whole world, including the United States.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record a Washington Post editorial entitled ``Repercussions Of \nInaction,'' a Wall Street Journal article, ``U.S. Is Warned Russia \nPlans Syria Arms Sale,'' and, finally, a piece by Leon Wieseltier that \nis in the Washington Diarist.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 9, 2013]\n\n                     The Repercussions of Inaction\n\n                              (Editorial)\n\n       There are grave risks in continuing the current U.S. policy \n     toward Syria.\n       Opponents of U.S. intervention in Syria are adept at citing \n     the risks of a more aggressive U.S. effort to bring down the \n     regime of Bashar al-Assad. Weapons given to rebel fighters \n     might end up in the hands of extremists, the skeptics say. \n     U.S. air attacks or the creation of a no-fly zone would be \n     challenged by formidable air defenses. U.S. intervention \n     might increase the risk that the regime would resort to \n     chemical weapons.\n       Above all, say the anti-interventionists, direct or even \n     indirect U.S. engagement in the fighting would make Syria an \n     American problem, saddling a war-weary country with another \n     difficult, expensive and possibly unworkable nation-building \n     mission.\n       These are serious objections, though we believe that some \n     of the risks, such as the spread of weapons to jihadists, can \n     be mitigated, while others, such as the strength of Syrian \n     air defenses, have been exaggerated. Our greater concern is \n     about the side of the discussion critics of intervention \n     usually leave out--which is the risks that are incurred by \n     failing to intervene.\n       What will unfold in Syria if the Obama administration \n     persists with its policy of providing humanitarian and other \n     non-lethal aid while standing back from the fighting? The \n     most likely scenario is that Syria fractures along sectarian \n     lines. An al-Qaeda affiliate, Jabhat al-Nusra, is already \n     consolidating control over a swath of northeastern Syria; \n     remnants of the regime, backed by Shiite fighters from \n     Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, could take over a strip of the \n     western coastline.\n       Such a splintering would almost certainly spread the \n     sectarian warfare to Iraq and Lebanon, as it has to some \n     extent already. That could cause the collapse of the Iraqi \n     political system that was the legacy of the U.S. mission \n     there. Chemical weapons stocks now controlled by the Assad \n     regime would be up for grabs, probably forcing further \n     interventions by Israel in order to prevent their acquisition \n     by Hezbollah or al-Qaeda. Jordan, the most fragile U.S. ally \n     in the Middle East, could collapse under the weight of Syrian \n     refugees. Turkey and Saudi Arabia, which have been imploring \n     the Obama administration to take steps to end the war, could \n     conclude that the United States is no longer a reliable ally.\n       Of course, some of these consequences may come about \n     whatever the United States does. But the best way of \n     preventing them is to quickly tip the military balance \n     against the Assad regime--something that would probably \n     require an air campaign as well as arms for the moderate \n     opposition. If the regime's fighting strength is decisively \n     broken it might still be possible to force out the Assads and \n     negotiate a political transition, as Secretary of State John \n     F. Kerry aspires to do. For now, with the regime convinced it \n     is winning, there is no such chance--and with each passing \n     month Syria's breakup comes closer to reality.\n       In short, there are substantial risks for the United States \n     if it intervenes in Syria but also grave dangers in its \n     present policy. On Tuesday President Obama said his job was \n     to ``constantly measure'' what actions were in the best U.S. \n     interest. It's not an easy calculus, to be sure. But for two \n     years, as Mr. Obama has heeded the warnings about U.S. \n     engagement, the situation in Syria has grown more dangerous \n     to U.S. interests. There are no good options, as everyone \n     likes to say. But it's becoming increasingly clear\n\n[[Page S3293]]\n\n     that the greatest risk to the United States lies in failing \n     to take decisive action to end the Assad regime.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, May 9, 2013]\n\n              U.S. Is Warned Russia Plans Syria Arms Sale\n\n           (By Jay Solomon, Adam Entous and Julian E. Barnes)\n\n       Washington.--Israel has warned the U.S. that a Russian deal \n     is imminent to sell advanced ground-to-air missile systems to \n     Syria, weapons that would significantly boost the regime's \n     ability to stave off intervention in its civil war.\n       U.S. officials said on Wednesday that they are analyzing \n     the information Israel provided about the suspected sale of \n     S-300 missile batteries to Syria, but wouldn't comment on \n     whether they believed such a transfer was near.\n       Russian officials didn't immediately return requests to \n     comment. The Russian Embassy in Washington has said its \n     policy is not to comment on arms sales or transfers between \n     Russia and other countries.\n       The government of President Bashar al-Assad has been \n     seeking to purchase S-300 missile batteries--which can \n     intercept both manned aircraft and guided missiles--from \n     Moscow going back to the George W. Bush administration, U.S. \n     officials said. Western nations have lobbied President \n     Vladimir Putin's government not to go ahead with the sale. If \n     Syria were to acquire and deploy the systems, it would make \n     any international intervention in Syria far more complicated, \n     according to U.S. and Middle East-based officials.\n       According to the information the Israelis provided in \n     recent days, Syria has been making payments on a 2010 \n     agreement with Moscow to buy four batteries for $900 million. \n     They cite financial transactions from the Syrian government, \n     including one made this year through Russia's foreign-\n     development bank, known as the VEB.\n       The package includes six launchers and 144 operational \n     missiles, each with a range of 125 miles, according to the \n     information the Israelis provided. The first shipment could \n     come over the next three months, according to the Israelis' \n     information, and be concluded by the end of the year. Russia \n     is also expected to send two instruction teams to train \n     Syria's military in operating the missile system, the \n     Israelis say.\n       Russia has been Mr. Assad's most important international \n     backer, outside of Iran, since the conflict in Syria started \n     in March 2011, and supplies Syria with arms, funding and \n     fuel. Russia maintains a naval port in Syria, its only outlet \n     to the Mediterranean. Moscow also has publicly voiced worries \n     that a collapsed Syria could fuel Islamist activities in its \n     restive Caucasus regions.\n       Secretary of State John Kerry met with Mr. Putin on Tuesday \n     in Moscow. The leaders said they would stage an international \n     conference this month aimed at ending the civil war. U.S. \n     officials couldn't say whether Messrs. Kerry and Putin or \n     their teams discussed the arms sale.\n       British Prime Minister David Cameron is scheduled to visit \n     Mr. Putin in Russia on Friday. The White House on Wednesday \n     said Mr. Cameron would visit Washington on Monday to discuss \n     issues including Syria's civil war and counterterrorism, plus \n     trade and economic issues, with President Barack Obama.\n       The Obama administration has argued that Mr. Assad has to \n     leave office as part of a political transition in Damascus. \n     The Kremlin has maintained that he retains a large base of \n     support and should be included in negotiations over a future \n     Syrian government.\n       Should Mr. Putin's government go ahead with the sale, it \n     would mark a significant escalation in the battle between \n     Moscow and Washington over Syria. U.S. officials said they \n     believe Russian technicians are already helping maintain the \n     existing Syrian air-defense units.\n       The first air-defense deals between Russia and Syria date \n     back decades. Russia in recent years has stepped up shipments \n     to modernize Syria's targeting systems and make the air \n     defenses mobile, and therefore much more difficult for \n     Israel--and the U.S.--to overcome.\n       According to a U.S. intelligence assessment, Russia began \n     shipping SA-22 Pantsir-S1 units to Syria in 2008. The system, \n     a combination of surface-to-air missiles and 30mm \n     antiaircraft guns, has a digital targeting system and is \n     mounted on a combat vehicle, making it easy to move. Syria \n     has 36 of the vehicles, according to the assessment.\n       In 2009, the Russians started upgrading Syria's outdated \n     analog SA-3 surface-to-air missile systems, turning them into \n     the SA-26 Pechora-2M system, which is mobile and digital, \n     equipped with missiles with an operational range of 17 miles, \n     according to the assessment.\n       The U.S. is particularly worried about another modernized \n     system Moscow provides--the SA-5. With an operational range \n     of 175 miles, SA-5 missiles could take out U.S. planes flying \n     from Cyprus, a key North Atlantic Treaty Organization base \n     that was used during Libya operations and would likely be \n     vital in any Syrian operation.\n       The U.S. has stealth aircraft and ship-based, precision-\n     guided missiles that could take out key air-defense sites. \n     Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \n     has privately told the White House that shutting down the \n     system could require weeks of bombing, putting U.S. fighter \n     pilots in peril and diverting military resources from other \n     priorities.\n       According to an analysis by the U.S. military's Joint \n     Staff, Syrian air defenses are nearly five times more \n     sophisticated than what existed in Libya before the NATO \n     launched its air campaign there in 2011. Syrian air defenses \n     are about 10 times more sophisticated than the system the \n     U.S. and its allies faced in Serbia.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Diarist, May 7, 2013]\n\n                                 Stung!\n\n                          (By Leon Wieseltier)\n\n       A reporter who visited the White House last week brought \n     back the news that the criticism of President Obama's \n     immobility about the Syrian disaster has ``begun to sting.'' \n     Good.Something got through. The president's sophistries about \n     his ``red line'' helped, of course: he spoke his way into a \n     predicament that he cannot speak his way out of, thereby \n     damaging the article of faith about the magical powers of his \n     speech. The press is full of reports that our policy may be \n     changing, that we may finally supply weapons to rebels we can \n     ideologically support, that we have identified such rebels \n     under the leadership of General Salim Idris, and so on. ``We \n     are on an upward trajectory,'' a White House official told \n     another reporter about these second thoughts, which only a \n     short while ago it would have considered a downward \n     trajectory. Obama, somewhat embarrassed by the implication \n     that for two years he may have been in error about one of the \n     most consequential crises of his presidency, is having the \n     White House rehearse its old admonition about caution (its \n     chin-stroking Kissingerian term for a doctrinaire timidity), \n     but still something may be stirring. The Syrian use of sarin \n     and the Israeli airstrikes (which were miraculously unimpeded \n     by the mythical power of Assad's air defenses) seem to have \n     concentrated the West Wing mind. Is Obama being stung into \n     action? I do not really believe it--his interventionism runs \n     deep, philosophically and temperamentally; but in any event \n     it is not too early to record a few lessons that can be \n     extracted from this fiasco.\n       The bitterness of belatedness. There is nothing we know \n     about Assad now that we did not know a year ago and longer. \n     Not even his use of chemical weapons changes our \n     understanding of him. His strategy in this crisis has always \n     been to transform a democratic rebellion into a sectarian \n     war, and his method for doing so has been to commit crimes \n     against humanity. In the two years of American quiescence the \n     Syrian situation has become only more dire, so that those who \n     now plead that there are no perfect options are right. But \n     there are imperfect options, which is often all that the \n     Hobbesian life of nations anyway allows: we can still create \n     pro-Western elements in the struggle for Syria after Assad, \n     and deny Al Qaeda a government in Damascus, and stem the tide \n     of the refugees that is shaking the entire region. But the \n     road to a democratic Syria is now much longerand more twisted \n     than it had to be. I say this not only in recrimination, but \n     also because Obama's failure to act swiftly in the Syrian \n     crisis reiterates one of the regular mistakes of American \n     presidents after the cold war, which is to refuse to treat an \n     emergency like an emergency. In many problems of statecraft, \n     patience is a virtue and judiciousness the beginning of \n     wisdom; but not in all. There are gross outrages against \n     justice, such as the butchery of civilians, that must be \n     acted against without delay or they have not been properly \n     understood. Confronted by this degree of urgency, the \n     difference between success and failure is time. Why do we \n     have to keep rediscovering this? Must the learning curve of \n     presidents always cost many thousands of lives? Has anyone at \n     the White House read Samantha Power's book?\n       The cult of the exit strategy. A ``senior American official \n     who is involved in Syria policy'' plaintively said this to \n     Dexter Filkins of The New Yorker: ``People on the Hill ask \n     me, `Why can't we do a no-fly zone? Why can't we do military \n     strikes?' Of course we can do these things. The issue is, \n     where will it stop?'' The answer is, we don't know. But is \n     the gift of prophecy really a requirement for historical \n     action? Must we know the ending at the beginning? If so, then \n     nobody would start a business, or a book, or a medical \n     treatment, or a love affair, let alone an invasion of \n     Normandy Beach. We can have certainty about our objectives \n     but not about our circumstances. The most serious actionis \n     often improvisatory, though its purposes should always be \n     clear. The prestige of ``the exit strategy'' in our culture \n     is another American attempt to deny the contingency of \n     experience and assert mastery over what cannot be mastered--\n     in this instance, it is American control-freakishness applied \n     to the use of American force. But we often engage with what \n     we cannot master. No outcomes are assured, except perhaps \n     when we do nothing. We do not need to control the realm in \n     which we need to take action; we need only to have strong and \n     defensible reasons and strong and defensible means, and to \n     keep our wits, our analytical abilities, about us. After all, \n     there are many ways, good and bad, to end a military \n     commitment, as Obama himself has shown. All this talk of \n     exiting is designed only to inhibit us from entering. Like \n     its cousin ``the slippery slope,'' ``the exit strategy'' is \n     demagoguery masquerading as prudence.\n       The eclipse of humanitarianism. Seventy thousand people \n     have died in the Syrian war,\n\n[[Page S3294]]\n\n     most of them at the hands of their ruler. Since this number \n     has appeared in the papers for many months, the actual number \n     must be much higher. The slaughter is unceasing. But the \n     debate about American intervention is increasingly conducted \n     in ``realist'' terms: the threat to American interests posed \n     by jihadism in Syria, the intrigues of Iran and Hezbollah, \n     the rattling of Israel, the ruination of Jordan and Lebanon \n     and Iraq. Those are all good reasons for the president of the \n     United States to act like the president of the United States. \n     But wouldn't the prevention of ethnic cleansing and genocidal \n     war be reason enough? Is the death of scores and even \n     hundreds of thousands, and the displacement of millions, less \n     significant for American policy, and less quickening? The \n     moral dimension must be restored to our deliberations, the \n     moral sting, or else Obama, for all his talk about \n     conscience, will have presided over a terrible mutilation of \n     American discourse: the severance of conscience from action.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 601, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 601) to provide for the conservation and \n     development of water and related resources, to authorize the \n     Secretary of the Army to construct various projects for \n     improvements to rivers and harbors of the United States, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, for the interest of all Senators, I wanted \nto thank everyone for cooperating with us. We have handled a number of \namendments, one quite controversial and nongermane, but we dealt with \nit. It is not on this bill, I am happy to say. We are trying to keep \nthis bill a water infrastructure bill. There may be a few exceptions, \nbut, for the most part, that is what we want because it will increase \nthe chances of passage all the way through to get it to the President's \ndesk.\n  The bill we are dealing with, the Water Resources Development Act, \nwas last authorized in 2007. It is high time we did a follow-on bill. \nWhat we are talking about here is flood protection, projects we need \nall over the country to protect our people from the ravages of floods.\n  We need to make sure our ports are operational. I know my friend in \nthe chair certainly deals with all these matters in his great and \nbeautiful State of Hawaii. We need to make sure our ports are deep \nenough, they have enough funding to stay modernized, and can move that \ncargo in and out with ease. We have environmental restoration. We have \nto take care of all of our water infrastructure.\n  I know Senator Merkley is here to say something about the bill, which \nI am very pleased about, so I am going to be very brief. I will talk \nfor about 2 more minutes and say we have a great committee, the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, when it comes to \ninfrastructure. We see eye to eye. We work together. Yes, we have our \ndifferences, but we can breach those differences.\n  This bill is a product of working together. It is a product of \ncollaboration--not only in the committee where we work together, but \neven here when it got to the Senate. We have worked, Senator Vitter and \nI, with individual Members to meet all of their needs. There are no \nearmarks in this bill. Whatever we do is setting policy.\n  It is an exciting bill. It includes reforms I think are important. \nMost of all, I think the people at home are going to like it because it \nputs them in the driver's seat and protects them from delays and other \nproblems as they move forward with projects their people need.\n  We have some terrific supporters of this legislation--I will close \nthese early remarks--with organizations such as AFL-CIO, the Chamber of \nCommerce, the American Society of Civil Engineers, we have the \nAssociation of Equipment Manufacturers. We have many. I will show you \nthe next chart and name a couple: The Transportation Construction \nCoalition, the United Brotherhood of Carpenters, storm management \nagency, surveyors, engineers. I think what you see here is mainstream \nAmerica is behind this bill.\n  The bad news is our infrastructure has been rated at a D-plus. You \ncan't be the greatest Nation in the world and have an infrastructure \nthat is rated D-plus.\n  While we have major problems on other fronts in our committee--and I \nhave to admit today was not a good day for me, the committee, or the \nAmerican people, when the Republicans boycotted the markup of Gina \nMcCarthy to be the head of the Environmental Protection Agency after \nshe answered more than 1,000 questions. She is the most qualified ever \nto be nominated, having served, how about this, four Republican \nGovernors.\n  What more do they want? The fact is 70 percent of the American people \nwant clean air, want clean water, want safety reform. Gina McCarthy \ndeserves a vote, not a boycott. They say they don't like her answers. \nWell, I am not surprised. She is not Mitt Romney's nominee for the EPA, \nshe is not Rick Perry's nominee for the EPA, she is Barack Obama's \nnominee for the EPA. It is her position, as it is the President's, that \nwe should enforce the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and \nso on.\n  When your Republican Presidents put up nominees for the EPA I didn't \nagree with, I didn't filibuster them. I said, okay, I will vote no; let \nthem go. It is a sad day for me on the environment side of our \ncommittee.\n  On the public works side of my committee, it is a good day, because \nwe are making progress. We have now about a half dozen amendments that \nhave been cleared on both sides. We are trying to make them pending. We \ncleared them. We are asking all Senators, please get your amendments in \nbecause this can't go on forever. We need to pass this bill, as 550,000 \njobs are supported by this legislation. Hundreds and hundreds of \nbusinesses are looking forward to our doing this. That is why we have \nthis amazing array of support.\n  With that, I would say to Senator Merkley, the floor is his.\n  I yield the floor at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about one particular \naspect of this bill, which is WIFIA. Before I explain what WIFIA is, I \nwant to thank the Chair for managing this bill in a very bipartisan \ndiscussion of the committee. It has come to the floor with full \ncommittee examination, thorough debate, and amendment process. Here we \nare having a very thorough, visible, accountable process for \nconsidering this bill on the floor of the Senate. That is a very good \nexample of the Senate working well. Thank you, Madam Chair.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. The heart of the WIFIA program is about jobs. It is \nabout infrastructure. Five years after the greatest economic crisis in \n80 years, we still face a serious jobs crisis. Too many are out of work \nand too many are unemployed. A good, living-wage job is the most \nimportant pillar of the American dream. There is no public program that \ncan compare to the importance of a living-wage job for the stability \nand success of a family. We have to do more to create those jobs, a lot \nmore. Wouldn't it be great if we could both create jobs and fill a \ndesperate national need at the same time?\n  Well, that is exactly what WIFIA--which is short for Water \nInfrastructure Finance and Innovation Act--does. Low-cost loans for \nwater infrastructure projects create good jobs now while protecting our \ncommunities from devastating costs or public health crises in the \nfuture. WIFIA does all of this while making taxpayers money over time.\n  The need for water infrastructure is great. Across Oregon and across \nAmerica, our infrastructure is aging. That aging infrastructure needs \nto be replaced. Our communities are growing. The demand for water \ninfrastructure increases, whether it is water treatment on the front \nend or water treatment on the back end--sending water out to our homes \nand businesses and then treating it after it comes back. Much of our \ninfrastructure is approaching the end of its lifespan and needs to be \nreplaced.\n\n[[Page S3295]]\n\n  We should recognize that America is behind much of the world in terms \nof investing in infrastructure. That is not only not good for our \nfuture economy, it is certainly not good for creating jobs. China is \ninvesting 10 percent of its gross domestic product in infrastructure. \nEurope is investing 5 percent. Here in America, which had a phenomenal \ninfrastructure buildup after World War II, we are investing only 2 \npercent. That is barely enough to repair the aging infrastructure that \nprevious generations so thoughtfully funded, let alone prepare the \ninfrastructure to meet the expanding needs of the Nation.\n  Infrastructure can be thought of as the bread and butter of success \nof our Nation. Building and maintaining infrastructure is one of the \nmost effective ways also to create jobs in the short term. Having \ninfrastructure in place is absolutely critical to strong, private \nsector economic growth over the long term.\n  It is time to take water infrastructure seriously as a public policy \nchallenge. For too long, we have been putting water infrastructure on \nthe back burner. We are not investing enough in water infrastructure to \nkeep clean, affordable water accessible to all Americans. In fact, we \nare not even coming close. There is a gap, a significant gap, a growing \ngap in the area of water infrastructure needs versus actual funding. If \nwe do nothing and stay on the same course, that gap will be $90 billion \nper year by 2040. That is a disaster for our communities. That gap \nwould leave municipalities with a terrible decision--allow the \ninfrastructure to continue to degrade, which is obviously not a good \nidea, or have to raise utility rates astronomically to pay for long-\nneglected improvements.\n  Already, we are seeing this kind of lose-lose proposition play out in \nmy State in Oregon. Some communities have to set aside their plans \nbecause they can't afford them: to expand their infrastructure, to \nimprove their infrastructure, to replace their infrastructure that is \naging. Other communities are proceeding to upgrade their infrastructure \nbut at costs that are doubling or even quadrupling the cost of water to \nthe citizens.\n  We need a new way to finance critical water projects. That is why the \nWater Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act, or WIFIA, that is \ncontained in this bill, fills a key missing link in our system. \nCurrently Federal funding for water infrastructure and sewage through \nthe Environmental Protection Agency Clean Water and Safe Drinking Water \nState Revolving Funds Program is helpful, but many projects do not \nqualify, and we need to expand the amount of funding available.\n  Into that gap comes WIFIA, modeled after the very successful \nTransportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act, or TIFIA, so \nwe have a proven finance model for infrastructure in transportation. \nLet's take that proven model and apply it to the challenge of our \ncommunities on water.\n  I hold a meeting with our local officials--our city officials and our \ncounty officials--before each of my townhalls, and I hold a townhall in \nevery county every year. There is hardly a meeting with multiple \nofficials that goes by that there aren't two or three or four critical \nwater project needs discussed. And that was the motivation for having \nthis WIFIA Program before us today.\n  I applaud my colleague from Oklahoma Senator Inhofe, who has come \nforward and said: Let's not only make this work, but let's lower the \nminimum threshold for projects so we make sure we can get smaller \ncommunities, more rural communities involved. That was previously \naddressed in the bill by saying that smaller communities could \naggregate their projects and submit their application, but this was a \nvery helpful addition to the conversation, and I appreciate that type \nof bipartisan problem-solving which is evidenced in this bill as it is \nand as in the amendment proposed by my colleague from Oklahoma and \npassed yesterday.\n  The reason that funding in this pilot project--and we are talking \nabout $50 million a year for 5 years--is effective is because it has a \nhuge leverage it can fund because it is guaranteeing loans that rarely \ngo bad. The historical default on water and sewer bonds is less than 1 \npercent. In fact, it is less than one-tenth of 1 percent. So that $50 \nmillion to cover defaults can be extraordinarily leveraging. The \ncommunities get the funds they need to complete their projects at the \nlowest interest rates possible, and the American public can sleep \nsoundly at night knowing that the treasury funds being invested are \nbeing invested in a manner that is both prudent and productive.\n  This source of financing will allow communities to take on three \ntypes of projects necessary for safe and reliable water systems: \nrepairing the aging infrastructure, upgrading the old systems to modern \nstandards, and expanding the projects to meet growth needs.\n  Another advantage of this structure of financing is that under WIFIA, \nprojects would be selected by a competitive process rather than by \nState-by-State allocations, so we get funds to the greatest need across \nthis Nation. We have communities all across Oregon, in every corner of \nour State, that are facing these infrastructure challenges. I know from \ntalking with my colleagues that the same is true in States across our \nNation. And communities that are in good shape now in 5 or 10 years may \nsee the challenge of meeting new standards or meeting the growth in \ntheir communities.\n  I would like to talk about another key aspect of our recovery; that \nis, manufacturing. If we don't make things in America, we will not have \na middle class in America. Our manufacturing sector lost 5 million jobs \nover the last 14 to 15 years. It is starting to make a comeback, but we \nshould do more to help create good manufacturing jobs.\n  One very simple thing we can do is support ``Buy American'' \nprovisions in legislation such as this. We recognize the principle. We \nare using taxpayer dollars to complete a public infrastructure project \nin America, so it only makes sense for American businesses and workers \nto do as much of the work as possible. For that reason I will be filing \nan amendment to this bill to expand the ``Buy American'' provisions for \nour water infrastructure. These two are very much connected. Yes, we \nneed to be building infrastructure, but we need to make sure those tax \ndollars build our American economy when the work is being done.\n  In closing, let's pass this bill, which has a tremendous amount of \ngood in it, and one of those very good points is this water \ninfrastructure act--WIFIA--which does support good jobs and good \ninfrastructure across America.\n  I also wish to mention the great work my science associate Mirvat \nAbdelhaq has done on this bill. We are fortunate as Senators to have \nfolks come to work for us for a year or so, bringing their tremendous \nexpertise in trying to develop a very important piece of legislation. \nShe has been very involved, and I thank her, and I thank the program \nfor making this kind of expertise available to our offices.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up as \npending amendment No. 802.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. If there is objection, I can talk about the amendment \nnow. I will talk about the amendment now and then attempt to call up \nthe amendment later in the day. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, the amendment I am trying to get pending for the WRDA \nbill would delay the increase in flood insurance rates for people in \nthis country who are going to be suffering in unbelievable ways. And I \nam not just speaking of homeowners or business owners but communities \nacross America. This isn't a Louisiana issue. It is not a Louisiana-\nTexas issue. It is a national issue, as this chart will show.\n  These are all the States in the country that have flood insurance \npolicies. Starting with Florida, which has the most, there are over 2 \nmillion flood insurance policies in the State of Florida. Texas is \nsecond with 645,000. Louisiana has 486,000 policies. California, the \nfourth State, has 256,000. New Jersey has 240,000. South Carolina has\n\n[[Page S3296]]\n\n205,000. New York has 178,000. North Carolina has 138,000. Virginia has \nover 100,000. Georgia has close to 100,000. Mississippi has 75,000.\n  Time and time again, I have been on this floor, warning about \naffordability problems in the National Flood Insurance Program and \noffering proposals to address this. Despite my advice and objections, \nlast summer Congress made a mistake and passed the Biggert-Waters bill \nwhich contained huge rate flood insurance rate increases for many \nhomeowners and businesses.\n  Our families and entrepreneurs across the Nation are beginning to see \nthe disastrous consequences of that vote now. Some already see their \npremiums rising by 25 percent a year and many more will see these \nchanges over the next 2 years. These rates must be stopped until an \naffordability study can be conducted and Congress can react to those \nresults.\n  FEMA has never done an affordability study--it cannot even quantify \nhow strong an impact these exorbitant rates will have on our citizens. \nIn the bill last summer, Congress required FEMA to conduct an \naffordability study. Don't you think we should wait for that and know \nif these rate increases are affordable before we start such rapid \nincreases? Congress can't possibly have asked FEMA to conduct this \nstudy and not want to use those results to make an informed decision on \nhow best to structure rate changes.\n  I can tell you that the 480,000 policy holders in Louisiana are \nalready telling me the rates are not affordable. Families and \nbusinesses in Louisiana are already paying exorbitant rates for flood \ninsurance and some could see those rates go up dramatically under these \nproposals. Eliminating grandfathered rates, as the--Biggert-Waters bill \ndid, means their property values will plummet.\n  If people cannot afford flood insurance policies, they will drop out \nof the program. When future disasters hit, they will be entirely \ndependent on federal aid to help them rebuild.\n  I agree that the National Flood Insurance Program needs to be self-\nsustaining, but not on the backs of Louisiana families and businesses \nand not on the backs of all 5.5 million policies holders in the \nNational Flood Insurance Program. This is not the right way.\n  Flood insurance is not just about business and commerce; it is about \nculture; it is about a way of life; it is about preserving coastal \ncommunities; it is about being resilient in storms. We must make the \nflood insurance program resilient without endangering the financial \nfuture of our coastal residents.\n  This is a very serious issue, and I thank the chair, Senator Boxer, \nwho has worked so hard on the underlying WRDA bill, which is so \nimportant. I also thank those Members who came to the floor last night. \nI understand Senator Menendez gave a very fiery and passionate speech \nabout the problem he faces in New Jersey. I thank Senators Schumer, \nGillibrand, and Lautenberg for cosponsoring this important amendment.\n  We want to work with the chairman and the ranking member to pass a \nWRDA bill. There is no State that benefits more from the WRDA bill than \nLouisiana, and I am extremely grateful for her leadership not just on \nthis bill but on the RESTORE Act, which she helped shepherd through, \nwhich has helped the gulf coast in immeasurable ways, and her support \nof the FAIR Act on revenue-sharing, which will help the gulf coast get \nthe revenues we need--just as interior States have--to build our own \nlevees and not have to be such a drain on the Federal Treasury.\n  We can and are willing to do our own work. But the flood insurance \nbill, known as Biggert-Waters, never passed the Senate, and I wish to \ncall that fact to Senators' attention. The bill was never brought to \nthe Senate floor. The flood insurance bill that is called Biggert-\nWaters came out of the Banking Committee with a bipartisan vote--a \nsimilar bill. That was a House bill, and so a similar bill came out of \nthe Senate, but it never came to the Senate floor for a vote. None of \nus ever got to debate it on the floor.\n  If you are not on the Banking Committee, wake up because this bill is \ngoing to affect your State, and if you are not on the Banking \nCommittee, please listen to what I am about to say.\n  The bill never came to the Senate floor although some of us protested \nthat at the time. There are statements in the Record that show the \nprotests any number of us made at the time. The bill then sort of went \ndark. The next time it appeared, it was tucked into the Transportation \nbill, which had the RESTORE Act in it and the Biggert-Waters flood \ninsurance, which might have passed the House of Representatives--I am \nnot sure. Maybe it just came out of the House committee. I am trying to \nget clarification on whether this bill ever was passed by either body, \nand I will get that clarification in a few minutes. But it most \ncertainly never came to the Senate floor, so no one here, except \nmembers of the Banking Committee--which Senator Vitter is a member of, \nand so he knows this issue very well--voted on this.\n  So while it is not a surprise to me, it may be a surprise to others \nto find out that flood insurance rates based on the reform bill that \nwas tucked into the Transportation bill and into the RESTORE Act bill \nare now going to raise rates by 25, 50, or 100 percent on home owners. \nAnd when the grandfather clause expires--which was put in the bill to \ngrandfather many property owners--my constituents tell me their \nproperties will become worthless.\n  One can understand that a property worth even $1 million or $\\1/2\\ \nmillion or $250,000 has a flood insurance premium attached to it of a \nreasonable amount of money--$500, $600, $700. And that is still a lot \nof money, but people who live along the coast understand that we have \nto pay a little higher flood insurance rates and we have to build \nsmarter and better, which we are doing as fast as we possibly can with \nthe monies we have. There is not a coastal community in America that is \nnot fully awake after Katrina, Rita, Gustav, Ike, and Sandy. Trust me, \nfrom the east coast, to North Carolina, to the entire gulf coast \nregion, we are awake. We are understanding what is happening, and we \nare trying as hard as we can to make our communities as resilient as \npossible.\n  We are not completely to blame for the increased frequency of the \nstorms or the rising sea levels. We all have a share of that, and it is \nhappening, and we are on the frontline. Our communities have been \ndevastated. Our people are literally drowning. We lost 1,800 people in \nKatrina--2,400 between Louisiana and Mississippi--from drowning and \nliterally dying through these storms. We lost several hundred people in \nSandy. So we understand what is happening, and we are doing everything \nwe can.\n  This flood insurance bill that never passed this Senate--and I am not \nsure it passed the House, but it did come out of both committees, \ndifferent versions of it--is now known as Biggert-Waters. I understand \nMrs. Biggert is no longer a Member of Congress, but Congresswoman \nWaters is here. So the bill was pushed as a way of getting the Flood \nInsurance Program on a financially sound footing. I understand that.\n  We most certainly don't expect all the people of America to subsidize \ncoastal communities, some of which may be second homes, et cetera. But \nin my communities, we are not talking about second homes; we are not \ntalking about vacation properties, in large measure. We are talking \nabout primary homes of fishermen, of dock workers, of people who work \non the river, of boat captains, of industries such as the oil and gas \nindustry, the roughnecks, the engineers who have to work, by the nature \nof their work, near the coast, which is where the trade and commerce of \nthis Nation comes from.\n  If we could operate our trade and commerce only on railroads and \nhighways, maybe we could all go live in Oklahoma or in Nevada. But, Mr. \nPresident, you are from Hawaii. You understand we have coastal \ncommunities all the way from Oregon to California to Texas to Louisiana \nto Mississippi; and, yes, there are some lovely vacation spots along \nthe coasts. But there are also communities like those I represent, such \nas in Terrebonne Parish and Lafourche Parish and Jefferson Parish, \nwhere people wake up before the Sun and do not come home until it is \ndark. They are working at coastal businesses that are very important to \nthe entire economic strength of this Nation.\n\n[[Page S3297]]\n\n  This bill, Biggert-Waters, puts the entire burden of supporting \ncoastal communities on the people who live on the coast, while some \npeople who have a lot of money and can afford a mountaintop view go on \nthe top of the mountains in other States. I am not picking on Colorado \nand Utah, but those come to mind--multimillion-dollar homes with \nbeautiful views that look out across lots of land. Maybe they are not \nmindful of the work that is done on our coasts.\n  This is an issue that is important for the whole Nation. To have this \nbill pass--and I knew it when it happened. Mark Pryor, I understand, \nput something in the Record at the time, but now we are on the water \nresources bill, a very important bill for coastal communities. It is an \nopportunity for us to fix this bill or to get a reprieve for a short \nperiod of time until we can find a better approach for thousands of \nproperties along the coast--whether it is in Texas or California or \nFlorida or New York or New Jersey that was battered badly by Sandy--\nrather than to put additional stress on these communities.\n  While I do not have the specific answer as to how to fix it in the \nlong term, my amendment would simply hold off these rate increases for \na year. It does not repeal the bill. It will just hold off these rate \nincreases for a year, giving these Members in Congress time and an \nopportunity to fix what is terribly broken and to try to find a better, \nmore affordable way to do so.\n  There are 480,000 policy holders in Louisiana who are already \ncomplaining about the flood insurance rates as they are today. When I \ngo home now--and I go home often, very frequently--this is all people \nare talking about. There are other important issues that are going on, \nbut I do not blame them, and I certainly understand it as a homeowner \nin Louisiana. Our delegation understands this. People are saying they \nare getting notices from their company that their insurance is going to \ngo up hundreds if not thousands of dollars. What happens with respect \nto the grandfather clause, which is about to happen in October of 2014?\n  This flood insurance issue is a very important issue for the people \nin Louisiana, as I said, in Texas, in Mississippi, and in Florida, and \nthat is what my amendment will address. My amendment is not pending, \nbut I filed an amendment. We are waiting for a CBO score. We most \ncertainly want to offset this if we can find the revenue it will take \nto offset this temporary reprieve.\n  I ask both the Republican and Democratic leaders to work with me and \nwork with the other Senators who are interested in finding a solution \nto send a signal to these coastal areas that Congress understands the \npressures of flood insurance in our low-lying areas--that would be in \nMaryland or Virginia or New York or New Jersey--that we hear them. We \nunderstand what is about to happen, and we would like a chance to try \nto adjust it, to fix it, et cetera, et cetera.\n  I am going to be working with the leadership. I know there are other \nMembers who have amendments important to the WRDA bill. It is not my \nintention to stop this WRDA bill. It is a bill I certainly support. \nLouisiana can be greatly benefited. I thank Senator Vitter for his \nstrong work as the ranking member of the EPW Committee on WRDA. We have \nsome very important authorizations.\n  Let me also say something about this WRDA bill in relation to actual \ndollars. I sit on the Appropriations Committee for energy and water. I \nappreciate serving on that committee. Our job is to actually find money \nand direct funding to build some of these water resource projects.\n  Just yesterday, Senator Feinstein held a hearing--she chairs our \ncommittee; Senator Lamar Alexander is our ranking member--on the budget \nfor the Corps of Engineers. I see my good friend Ben Cardin here and \nothers who are very interested in projects on the WRDA bill, but they \nwill be shocked to know when we asked--I asked--Jo-Ellen Darcy, the \nleader of the Corps of Engineers, the civilian leader of the corps, \nwhat was the number of backlogged projects, new construction projects \nthat were backlogged and how much money was in the bill to build them \nthis year, the first number was $1.6 billion. That is how much is in \nthe appropriations bill roughly to build new water projects in the \ncountry, $1.6 billion. It sounds like a lot of money until you hear the \nsecond answer.\n  Then I asked her how many projects are in the queue for funding, \nready to go, meritorious projects, urgently needed new construction. \nShe said $60 billion worth. We have $1.6 billion in the budget to \nspend, and we have $60 billion worth of projects. We follow these \nnumbers pretty closely because many of those projects are in Louisiana. \nSo while it is important to get the WRDA bill passed, which is \nauthorizing not only new projects, but it is also putting in some very \nimportant corps reforms to expedite the way some of these projects are \nbuilt, the real problem and the real dilemma is closing the gap between \nwhat we have authorized and what we can actually afford to build.\n  Again, there is only $1.6 billion in the corps budget for new \nconstruction, and pending, even without this WRDA bill, is $60 billion \nworth in backlogged, authorized, important programs in all of our \ndistricts. With this WRDA bill there are an additional $23 billion in \nauthorizations. So, yes, I support new authorizations. Yes, I support \nthe WRDA bill. Yes, I most certainly support the reforms to the Corps \nof Engineers that are embedded in the language of this WRDA bill, but I \ncannot allow this to move forward, at least without raising a red flag \nand asking for some reprieve on the flood insurance issue.\n  I want to be flexible. I want to be open. I want to be a team player. \nThis is not the time for my way or the highway. I have tried as much as \nI can to avoid that kind of politics because it is very difficult for \nall of us to move forward together. I have so much respect for Senator \nBoxer and a good bit of respect for Senator Vitter who is the ranking \nmember. But this is the only way I know right now to raise this issue \nand to say we cannot, in Louisiana, with 480,000 flood insurance \npolicies, manage to build our communities, to recover. We are doing \nbeautifully. We would like to go faster, but you have not heard a lot \nof complaints coming from us. Our people are working hard, rolling up \nour sleeves. Our communities are coming back. We are using the \ninsurance money. We are using the community development block grant \nmoney to build as smart and quickly as we can.\n\n  We have created the Water Institute. Every single one of our parishes \nhas gone through what we call charrettes and community meetings to see \nhow we can elevate our homes and build them more resiliently.\n  This is a huge and very tough burden to lay on the shoulders of the \npeople in our coastal communities, not just in Louisiana but in \nTerrebonne and Lafourche, in Cameron, Calcasieu, Saint Mary Parish, and \nthe river parishes, Saint John, Saint James, Saint Charles and \nJefferson Parish. It is hurting north Louisiana as well.\n  We have flood insurance policies all the way up in our State. We \nwould have flood insurance. Why would we have flooding? Because we have \nthe Mississippi River. We are happy to have the Mississippi River, but \nthe Mississippi River does not belong only to us. May I remind everyone \nthat the Mississippi River, the Missouri River, the Ohio River are the \nspine, the backbone of our commerce for the whole Nation? Why should \nthe people of Louisiana, who drain the entire continent--the mouth of \nthe river runs right through New Orleans--why is it the people who live \nin south Louisiana have to pick up 100 percent of that risk? That is \nthe way this bill is structured, to put on us the burden, 100 percent, \ninstead of spreading it to everyone, to the whole country, in a \nreasonable and responsible way.\n  The way this bill is structured is to say we have to be self-\nsustaining in our flood insurance policies. We are sorry, but the \npeople who live at the mouth of the Mississippi River, which provides \ncommerce and wealth and creates huge amounts of wealth and jobs for all \nof us, have to take the water and pay for it ourselves. That is not \ngoing to work for us. It is not working for us. That is why I am \nstanding on this floor. I want to work this out.\n  I am open to a number of suggestions. I hope the Senators who have \nlots of flood insurance issues, such as the Senators in Missouri and \nIllinois and the Senators in other States, will\n\n[[Page S3298]]\n\ngive us some suggestions about how to move forward.\n  If this bill had passed the Senate and it was the will of the Senate \nand I had been on the losing side of that, I would not be standing here \ntoday. This bill never came before the Senate. It never came before the \nSenate. It was tucked into a bill that we had no chance to amend--none. \nYou cannot amend a bill coming out of conference. There was no chance \nto amend this, no chance to fix it, which is why I hope my colleagues \nwill understand and be patient with me. This is not about losing an \nissue last year and coming back and crying about it. This is about we \nnever got a chance to even talk about this on the Senate floor.\n  This is a water bill. It has everything to do with the subject \nmatter. It is not ``not germane'' to the subject matter of this bill. I \nwould like to have a vote on my amendment or a vote in some way to \ndeclare that we are acknowledging this problem; that we might not have \na solution today, but we most certainly are willing to work on it \nbecause this is devastating for coastal communities all over the \ncountry.\n  It is not fair for our working coast--whether it is fisheries or oil \nand gas or wind or manufacturing--for our coastal communities, our \ncommerce and trade, to pick up the entire burden of this Flood \nInsurance Program. Let's try to be reasonable. I am going to be as \npatient as I can. I understand how important this bill is to everyone. \nI am most mindful of how important it is to my State. We have been \ntrying to get a WRDA bill out here on the floor for several years, and \nwe finally have one.\n  I am going to leave my amendment as it is. It is not pending. It has \nbeen filed. I am going to ask for this vote to be worked out, and until \nthen I will object to any other amendments coming up for a vote until \nwe get some way forward.\n  Again, I want to be flexible, I want to be open, and I would like \neventually to see the WRDA bill passed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object for just a moment, and I, \nof course, will not object, I just want to make it clear that at noon \nthe two leaders are coming to do a back-and-forth. So up until the time \nthey arrive--I just wanted to let my friend know. Then after the \nleaders, Senator Vitter should be recognized to speak about the issue \nSenator Landrieu just raised, to be followed by me, if that is OK, if I \ncan do that in the UC? It would be Senator Cardin, the two leaders, \nSenator Vitter, and myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Cardin pertaining to the introduction of S.J. \nRes. 15 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to continue to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Cardin are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, it has been 47 days since the Senate \npassed its sensible progrowth budget. As my friend the minority leader \nhas said many times, after the Senate passed a budget, the next logical \nstep would be to go to conference and try to find common ground. This \nis what Senator McConnell said earlier this year:\n\n       We ought not to ignore the law any longer. And I think it's \n     a good step in the direction of getting back to regular \n     order, which we ought to follow.\n\n  After years of calling for regular order, Republicans ought to be \neager to go to conference. Senator McConnell and the Republican caucus \npulled a 180--a flip-flop. They were for regular order before they were \nagainst regular order.\n  For weeks Republicans have refused to go to conference, and they have \nrefused to explain why. The only excuse Republicans offered came not \nfrom the minority leader but from the junior Senator from Texas. \nSenator Cruz objected to the budget conference on the grounds that \nDemocrats must concede basically everything before Republicans will \nnegotiate anything.\n  As one news reporter put it, the Republicans' offer is: ``First \nsurrender, then we will fight.'' Republicans know as well as Democrats \nthat is not any way to negotiate. Unilateral disarmament in the \nlegislative process is not the same thing as compromise.\n  Democrats--along with the media and the American people--are left to \nwonder and guess the real reason the Republicans are so determined to \navoid a budget conference. Are Republicans afraid to defend or debate \ntheir extreme budget in full public view? Probably. It cannot be easy \nto defend a budget that will end Medicare as we know it. It cannot be \neasy to stand strong for a plan that asks the middle class to foot the \nbill for more tax breaks for the rich--a politically unsustainable \nposition already rejected by the voters. It cannot be easy to stick up \nfor the arbitrary meat-ax cuts of the sequester, which guts the safety \nnet protecting the elderly, the poor, the middle class, veterans, and \nsometimes the helpless.\n  Is it possible that Republicans are simply hoping to delay compromise \nlong enough to create another manufactured crisis as the Nation once \nagain approaches a default on its bills? Americans are tired of the \ntype of knockdown, drag-out debt ceiling battles that caused our credit \ndowngrade and cost our economy billions of dollars last year. Middle-\nclass families have been through enough economic turmoil. It is \nunbelievable that Republicans would once again hold the full faith and \ncredit of our government hostage.\n  I hope my Republican colleagues will come to their senses. The way to \nput our Nation on sound fiscal footing is to set aside this obstruction \nand set sensible policy through regular order in the legislative \nprocess, not to extort concessions through dangerous hostage taking.\n  Passing the budget in each Chamber was a first good step toward \nrestoring regular order. The next move is to go to conference and set \nour minds on reaching a reasonable compromise that reverses the painful \ncuts of sequestration.\n  Right now the Republicans are the only thing standing between the \nCongress and compromise. I am optimistic that they will not continue to \nput American families through more financial pain for their own short-\nterm political gain.\n  I yield to my friend from Washington for a unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n               Unanimous Consent Request--H. Con. Res. 25\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 33, H. Con. Res. 25; that \nthe amendment, which is at the desk, the text of S. Con. Res. 8, the \nbudget resolution passed by the Senate, be inserted in lieu thereof; \nthat H. Con. Res. 25, as amended, be agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; that the Senate \ninsist on its amendment, request a conference with the House on the \ndisagreeing votes of the two Houses, and the Chair be authorized to \nappoint conferees of the Senate, all with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object, I ask consent that the \nSenator modify her request so it not be in order for the Senate to \nconsider a conference report that includes tax increases or \nreconciliation instructions to increase taxes or raise the debt limit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modified request?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, reserving the right to object, what the \nSenator is asking is that we go back to what we had votes on throughout \nthe entire budget debate way into the morning hours on the issues of \nreconciliation, on the issues of revenue that were all debated and \nvoted on--some passed, some were defeated. We are not going to take \nthose up again. We are going to go to conference with\n\n[[Page S3299]]\n\nthe budget that was passed by the majority in the Senate and by the \nmajority in the House, and those views will be represented in \nconference. We cannot get to that debate and that discussion without \nmoving to conference, so I object to his unanimous consent and ask for \nconsent on my request again.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard to the modified request.\n  Is there objection to the original request?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, this is so challenging. It has now been \n47 days since we passed our budget. Senate Democrats have now requested \nunanimous consent to move to conference--the next step--five times. We \nwant to take the next step in this process. We want to move forward \nunder regular order and continue this debate in an open and public way, \nbut every time we try to take it to the next step, Senate Republicans \nstand and they say: No. I think this comes as a surprise to the \nAmerican people. I think they are disappointed. I know I am. I think a \nlot of people, myself included, expected that after calling for regular \norder so consistently for so long, Republicans would be eager now to \ntake the next step in the process. Some Republicans say they want to \nnegotiate a framework behind closed doors before they agree on going to \nconference, but that is what a budget is. It is a framework that lays \nout our values and our priorities and helps us plan for our country's \nfuture. Why can't we discuss that framework in a formal, public \nconference, which is what we call regular order?\n  I am sure Republicans are not excited about the prospect of defending \ntheir extreme budget all over again in a public conference committee. \nWe all know Americans are not interested in more tax breaks for the \nwealthiest, they are not interested in Medicare vouchers, but \nRepublicans wrote that budget, they voted for it, they passed it, and \nthey ought to be happy to defend it. I know Senate Democrats are happy \nto stand and talk about ours.\n  The American people now deserve to see those two visions. They need \nto see our visions side by side, contrasted with each other, and they \nneed to see who is willing to compromise and who is not.\n  We have heard the House Republican leadership doesn't want the Senate \nto appoint conferees because they don't want to go to conference \nbecause they might have to take a lot of difficult votes in the \nHouse. I am sure my colleagues remember the vote-arama we had before we \npassed our budget. We considered over 100 amendments. We were here \nuntil 5 in the morning, the entire time voting on amendments, until \nevery Senator who wanted to be heard to offer an amendment did and we \nhad a very thorough and open debate and we voted a lot. So I don't \nthink the American people are going to be very sympathetic to the \nargument that the Republicans don't want to go to conference because \nthey are afraid the House has to take a few votes.\n\n  This is deeply disappointing to me. The Republicans are now running \naway from regular order. In fact, they are running right toward another \ncrisis, and they are willing to take our American families and our \neconomy along for the ride.\n  It should be noted the House Republicans have announced a new \nconference, but it is not a conference on a budget deal; it is a \nconference of their Republican Members to decide what they are going to \ndemand in exchange for taking our economy over the debt ceiling. It is \nabsurd, and it is not going to happen. We know because we went through \nthis same thing the last time we approached the debt limit. Just a few \nmonths ago, Republicans realized how dangerous it would be to play \ngames with the debt limit and how politically damaging it would be to \nplay politics with potential economic calamity for our country, and \nthey finally dropped their demands. The so-called Boehner rule died, \nand no amount of wishing by the tea party is going to bring that back.\n  The Republican strategy now of holding our economy hostage and trying \nto push us to another crisis is absolutely the wrong approach, and \nholding our budget conference hostage so they can get to that point is \nnot going to be considered well by the American people.\n  Getting a deal is not going to be easy. Any one of us knows that. It \nis going to take compromise. But this constant lurching from crisis to \ncrisis that the House is demanding and is strategizing around is not \nwhat the American public wants or deserves.\n  I am here to say Democrats are ready to take the next step. We need a \nnegotiating party on the other side. They can bring all of their bills \nto conference and we can talk about it. We can come to a compromise. \nCompromise is not a dirty word. Oftentimes we don't hear it a lot \naround here. But I believe many of our colleagues on both sides of the \naisle, frankly, want to return to regular order. They want to move away \nfrom these constant crises. I know that is what the American public \nwants. They want to see we can govern.\n  I urge those who are coming here time and time again, blocking us \nfrom getting to a point to debate our two different budgets and from \ngetting to a compromise, to allow us to get the work of the American \npeople done and allow us to go to conference.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, before my friend leaves the floor, I want \nthe record spread with this. The admiration the Democratic caucus has \nfor the Senator from Washington is significant. She is an elected \nleader. She was the person chosen to be the chair of the supercommittee \nto come up with a plan to solve the Nation's crisis we have \neconomically, and she did yeoman's work. It was all done until a letter \nwas received from virtually every Republican Senator saying, fine, \ngreat deal that Chairman Murray has done, but we are not going to agree \nto any revenue. To work through the contentious problems we have had on \nthe floor and come up with a budget is remarkable, and it is a budget \nwe are very proud of.\n  I would say to my friend, I think we are making some progress because \njust within the past hour the Speaker has said this: ``We can't cut our \nway to prosperity.'' That is a significant step forward. The Speaker of \nthe House of Representatives, for the first time in some time, has \nspoken reality, the truth, the facts. I quote directly: ``We can't cut \nour way to prosperity.'' That is right.\n  That is why we have to get to regular order. We have to do what this \nbody has been doing for 200 years or more: go to conference when there \nis a difference between what the House wants and what the Senate wants. \nThat is all the chairman of the Budget Committee Senator Murray is \nasking--that we get together with our Republican colleagues and work \nout our differences.\n  I think our budget--and we were led by Chairman Murray--is a very \ngood budget. Is it perfect? Of course not. We would be willing to sit \ndown and talk to our Republican colleagues in conference the way we \nhave done for centuries and try to work out our differences. For them \njust to stonewall us and say, as the junior Senator from Texas said, \nfine, we will go to conference, but you have to agree to what we want \nbefore we go, what in the world is that all about?\n  I admire Senator Murray, as does the entire Democratic caucus, and I \nam confident the people of Washington are very proud of this stalwart \nSenator who has done so much for this country. I want to make sure the \nRepublicans understand she will be the chair. She is going to represent \nus. I am not going to be negotiating this. Senator McConnell is not \ngoing to be negotiating this. It is going to be done by the senior \nSenator from the State of Washington, and she is willing to deal with \nwhomever the Republicans decide she should deal with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I wonder if the Senator from Washington would enter into \na colloquy with me at this time, through the Chair.\n  I wish to join with Senator Reid in thanking Senator Murray for her \namazing leadership. I was on the Budget Committee for several years, \nand I know that as a result of the Senator from Washington becoming \nchairman and, of course, being the most senior member next to Kent \nConrad for so long, she knows this budget inside and out. It is filled \nwith complexities--the mandatories, the discretionaries, the\n\n[[Page S3300]]\n\ndefense and nondefense--all the things she knows in her head. She knows \nhow to get us to balance not only in terms of the numbers she will move \ntoward balance in her budget but also in terms of our priorities.\n  I wish to make sure my people at home understand this. What the \nSenator from Washington is telling us is that for several years now--2 \nor 3--the Republicans have been chastising the Democrats for not \npassing a budget in the Senate; am I right on that?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. That is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The reason we didn't do it is we had another law that \nactually set our caps; am I right on that? So we didn't go through the \nbudget.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. All right. So the Senator from Washington decided, with \nSenator Reid and the leadership team, to bring a budget to the floor. \nThen--I will never forget it--we stayed here until 5 o'clock in the \nmorning handling over 100 amendments; is that right?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. We passed a budget; the Senate passed its version of a \nbudget. The regular order, as I understand it, having asked the \nHistorian to go back and look, is that we then take the House budget \nand the Senate budget and we go to conference and the conferees resolve \nthe differences. All my friend is asking--and she has asked it or \nsomeone has asked it in her stead five times--we are asking our \nRepublican colleagues to allow our leader to name the conferees--of \ncourse Senator McConnell will name his--and walk into that conference \ncommittee to finish the budget. The budget is unfinished; am I right? \nWe have two versions. We need one version. What the Senator from \nWashington is telling us, in no uncertain terms, is that the \nRepublicans are stopping this country from having a budget; am I \nstating it correctly?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator is stating it correctly.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Let me say to my friend, I hope she plans to be here as \noften as she can, and those of us who can help her will be here to \ncontinue to ask for conferees so we can get to the next stage.\n  When Senator McConnell said he would amend the request of the Senator \nfrom Washington, was he not prejudging what would happen in the \nconference? He said no reconciliation, and he said something else. I \ndon't remember the other condition.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. And no revenue.\n  Mrs. BOXER. And no revenue. That is akin to the Senator from \nWashington saying, I will go to conference except I don't want to see \nany more cuts in afterschool programs or senior citizen programs or \nveterans programs. In other words, we don't take our priorities as \nindividual Senators into the conference. It is a team approach where we \nwill have to compromise.\n  So isn't Senator McConnell, by laying out his conditions, completely \nsidestepping regular order?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator would be correct, and I would add one other \nthought. What he is now asking us to do is to go back and vote on votes \nwe already took when we went through the budget process and amendments \ndid not pass. So he is saying, my amendments didn't pass, but I am not \ngoing to let a conference happen unless I get my way.\n  We have a majority. We have a minority. We went through hundreds of \namendments. Some of them passed and some of them did not. It is the \nprocess we go through.\n  Then we take what we passed--the House, by the way, passed a very \ndifferent budget--we go to conference and resolve the differences. That \nis what a conference is. But if every Senator came out here and said on \nevery bill we ever did we are not going to go to conference unless I \nget the amendment I lost on the floor, we would never do anything in \nthis country. That is not how a democracy works.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend. I got into this a little bit with \nSenator Cruz the other day. He doesn't want to go to conference because \nhe is afraid we could pass the Buffett rule. We could come out of there \nwith the Buffett rule, which says the billionaire executive should have \nto pay the same effective tax rate as a secretary. God forbid. He is \nafraid of that. So I just say, they are afraid of the process. What are \nthey afraid of? They control the House. We control the Senate. \nObviously, in conference we are going to have to meet somewhere in the \nmiddle.\n  It seems to me they have a fear of democracy, and it seems to me--and \nI don't like to use this word but I will; it rhymes with democracy and \nit is called hypocrisy. They said they want to do a budget and now they \nare stopping the budget.\n  I thank my friend. I want to make sure America understands this. They \nran around the country running against our candidates saying our \ncandidates wouldn't do a budget and now they will not allow us to do a \nbudget. It seems to me ridiculous. I am so happy our leader and the \nSenator from Washington are here to bring this issue the attention it \ndeserves.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n            Unanimous Consent Agreement--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 1:30 \ntoday, the Senate proceed to executive session to consider Calendar \nNos. 39 and 41 under the previous order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. With this consent, there will be up to two rollcall votes \nat about 2 p.m. today--there may be only one but up to two--on the \nnominations of Shelly Deckert Dick to be a district judge for the \nMiddle District of Louisiana and Nelson Stephen Roman to be a district \njudge for the Southern District of New York.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I rise today to speak about the bill we \nare considering, but also to speak, in particular, about one aspect of \nthe bill. We know the legislation as the so-called WRDA bill, the Water \nResources Development Act, and I want to express strong support for the \nlegislation.\n  This bill is, in fact, bipartisan, which is something we need more of \naround here. It provides for, among other things, flood protection, \nsafe drinking water, wastewater infrastructure, and protects the flow \nof commerce along our Nation's rivers and waterways.\n  I am grateful for Chairman Boxer's efforts, Ranking Member Vitter, \nand all the Members and staff of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee for their dedication to writing a bill that addresses the \nchallenges facing our country's water systems.\n  I want to speak in particular about inland waterways.\n  Our Nation has--for many years now, many generations--a system of \nlocks and dams that play a vital role in creating and sustaining jobs \nand supporting economic growth throughout the country.\n  I know in my home State of Pennsylvania, even though I had been a \nState official for a number of years, I did not have a full \nappreciation of what this meant until about July of--I guess it was the \nfirst week of July 2007, when I was able to tour and actually see these \nmajor barges up close out in southwestern Pennsylvania and to be able \nto see the movement of coal or other commodities or energy resources \nacross our waterways and what that meant to the economy of southwestern \nPennsylvania but, indeed, the economy of our Commonwealth and our \ncountry.\n  So when we hear the phrase ``locks and dams'' in Pennsylvania, \nespecially in southwestern Pennsylvania, we do not think of some far \noff concept; we think of commerce and the movement of commerce and the \njobs and the economic growth that comes from that.\n  Unfortunately, this system, this inland waterways system, is facing \nmajor challenges--challenges that threaten in ways that some of us \ncould not imagine even a few years ago.\n  The inland waterways system offers the most cost-competitive way to \ntransport our commodities. It moves some 20 percent of the coal that is \nused to power our Nation's electricity, much of it from Pennsylvania; \nalso 22 percent of our petroleum products; and more\n\n[[Page S3301]]\n\nthan 60 percent of export grain, which is moved because of this system.\n  The shippers who produce or manufacture these commodities are in \ndanger of losing their competitive edge unless we focus on proper \nfunding for the lock-and-dam infrastructure.\n  Unfortunately, the locks and dams of our Nation have far outlived \ntheir design life. There has not been sufficient investment to make \nheadway in replacing these locks and dams. But I am hopeful provisions \nI and others have worked on in the Water Resources Development Act, \nwhich we are considering now, will address the challenges facing this \nsystem.\n  Provisions from my bill--which, by the way, goes by the acronym \nRIVER; the RIVER Act--that are included in the bill we are considering \nwill institute a number of project management reforms that will make \nsure future lock-and-dam projects are built in the most cost-effective \nway possible.\n  We cannot ask for a greater commitment to the system or a greater \ninvestment without making sure we are also providing reforms.\n  These reforms include risk-based cost estimates and an external peer \nreview process for Army Corps projects across the Nation. This will \nhelp ensure that locks and dams in the projects that are undertaken are \nconstructed in the way that is most efficient. We also want to make \nsure we have cost estimates that are realistic and, of course, avoid \ncost overruns.\n  One of the provisions of the bill will also adjust the current cost-\nsharing system by increasing the threshold for the industry to \ncontribute to major rehabilitation projects to $20 million. This will \nallow for more funding for lock-and-dam projects, which is badly needed \nright now.\n  These provisions in the overall water resources bill are common \nsense. They also happen to be fiscally responsible proposals that will \nsignificantly improve our Nation's inland waterways system and help to \nensure our Nation's waterways can continue to be an effective method to \nship commodities.\n  Well, how do we pay for that? Well, a rather interesting development \nfor Washington, which I am about to describe for you: I am grateful so \nmany of the provisions in my bill have been included, but we also need \nto have an important conversation about how to finance this system and \nto keep the inland trust fund sustainable in the long term.\n  I filed an amendment, amendment No. 854, that will raise the barge \nuser fee from 20 cents per gallon to 29 cents per gallon. This fee has \nnot been raised since 1986 and, as a result, is not keeping up with \ninflation and project costs.\n  We have great bipartisan support for this amendment. Senator \nAlexander is leading this effort with me, and the amendment is \ncosponsored by the following Senators: Mr. Blunt, Mrs. McCaskill, Mr. \nDurbin, Ms. Stabenow, Ms. Klobuchar, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Franken, and Mr. \nHarkin--indicating the wide reach of the inland waterways system and \nits impact on so many industries in so many States across the country.\n  The current rate--the barge user fee of 20 cents per gallon--right \nnow is not raising sufficient funding to keep up with operations and \nmaintenance needs along the reach of the system. If we do not make this \ninvestment now, it could have dire consequences to multibillion-dollar \nindustries that rely on the use of locks and dams to move their goods. \nJust consider coal being one of those examples.\n  All 300 users of the inland waterways system support this increase. \nLet me say that again because this does not happen very much in \nWashington: All 300 users of the inland waterways system support this \nbarge user fee increase from 20 cents per gallon to 29 cents per \ngallon.\n  Here we have an example of an industry that is forward looking in \nasking Congress to allow them to pay more in order to make critical \ninvestments in their own infrastructure.\n  In addition to the support of industry, the user fee increase is \nbacked by a diverse array of organizations across the country, \nincluding the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Farmers Union, the \nNational Association of Manufacturers, the American Farm Bureau, the \nAFL-CIO, and over 250 national and local organizations, including barge \noperators, agriculture, energy and civics and conservation groups.\n  In southwestern Pennsylvania alone over 200,000 jobs rely on the \nproper functioning of locks and dams on the lower Monongahela River. \nFor those who do not know, it is a river on the western end of our \nState that flows into the city of Pittsburgh--one of the three rivers \nwe describe as part of our landscape in Pittsburgh.\n  If one of these locks were to fail, it would endanger all 200,000 \njobs and have a negative impact of over $1 billion just in that region, \nnot to mention the adverse impact beyond the region. Raising the user \nfee now will help prevent a catastrophe in the near future.\n  I understand there are objections to addressing important concerns \nabout including a funding fix for locks and dams in this bill due to \nthe so-called blue-slip concerns that involve the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  I will work to look for other vehicles so we do not continue to kick \nthis can down the road, and I will talk to Members of the House to \ninclude this fix in their version.\n  If we cannot raise revenue on an industry that is asking to pay more \nso they can invest in their infrastructure, I am afraid the future of \nour waterways system is in great jeopardy.\n  Many of my colleagues in the Senate on both sides of the aisle \nrecognize the importance of providing a way to pay for investments we \nneed in our locks-and-dams system, and I urge the House to follow suit. \nI have no doubt they want to do the same.\n  We cannot squander critical foundations that have made America what \nit is. Reinvesting in our Nation's waterways will allow us to seize \neconomic opportunities to remain competitive in the world and protect \nand create jobs for generations to come.\n  I will note one citation of history, from a major volume in \nPennsylvania history. This goes back to the 1800s when we developed a \ncanal system to move commodities and commerce across our waterways. I \nwill read one sentence from page 180 of a book entitled ``Pennsylvania: \nA History of the Commonwealth.'' Here is what they said all those years \nago in the 1800s, talking about coal:\n\n       Through those routes, anthracite coal left Pennsylvania for \n     England, Russia, Central Europe and Asia.\n\n  But the reason that coal was able to get to those places is because \nwe had a system in place to move it.\n  What we do not want to have today in our time is a system that breaks \ndown because we are not willing to make the investment. As I said \nbefore, this investment is supported by all of those organizations but \nespecially the 300 users who are willing to invest more so that \ntomorrow will be bright and we can move commerce across the \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania and across our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, before the Senator from Pennsylvania \nleaves the floor, I would like to thank him for his forthright and \ncourageous statement on the situation in Syria. I thank him for his \ninvolvement and his commitment to the freedom of the people of Syria.\n  (The remarks of Mr. McCain pertaining to the introduction of S. 912 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I rise today to speak in favor of \namendment No. 802 to the WRDA bill offered by my friend, great \nlegislator, chairman of the Subcommittee on Homeland Security, Senator \nMary Landrieu. I am proud to cosponsor this amendment.\n  The amendment would delay flood insurance premium increases until \nFEMA has completed a study on the impacts on the affordability of \nplanned premium increases. Nobody in this body knows better than \nSenator Landrieu the challenges faced by communities in the wake of \nnatural disasters, and she has been beyond generous in sharing her time \nand expertise and lending her vocal support to the States, such as \nmine, so greatly impacted by Superstorm Sandy.\n  Last year Congress passed a flood insurance reauthorization and \nreform\n\n[[Page S3302]]\n\nbill, the Biggert-Waters Act. We passed the Biggert-Waters Act because \nif the program expired, flood insurance would become unavailable or \nunaffordable for people who needed it.\n  Congress also needed to reform the program going forward because it \nis billions of dollars in debt and needs to be put on a better \nfinancial footing.\n  In my home State, one of the counties received a very poor and unfair \nmap, which was undone in the bill.\n  In the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy, many middle-class families in \nNew York are struggling to get back on their feet. Many lost \neverything. They have had to drain their savings to rebuild. They have \nbeen out of their homes for months. The kids get on a schoolbus and \nhave to go 20, 30 miles to school.\n  Imagine losing everything in your home as so many have. It is an \nawful feeling, not just the chair you were comfortable sitting in, all \nof your appliances and all of that, but that picture of great-grandma \nand great-grandpa which was priceless is gone. It is a horrible thing.\n  Adding another layer of difficulty to this situation, the flood \ninsurance reforms enacted by Congress last summer result, in many \ncases, in huge insurance premiums. Our families in New York are caught \nin limbo.\n  Families in Breezy Point, the Rockaways, Broad Channel, Staten \nIsland, Brooklyn, on the south shore of Long Island, from Long Beach \nall the way out to Mastic and Shirley, are still trying to make \ndecisions, are repairing their homes and investing tens of thousands of \ndollars to do so. Many of these homes are very middle-class homes. \nThese are not rich people. They have worked hard. Some of them are \nteachers, policemen, firemen, construction workers or small business \nowners. Many of them are being told their insurance rates could be \n$10,000 a year or more. What kind of insurance is flood insurance if it \nis $10,000 a year? It puts homeowners in the worst possible position. \nThey either have to come up with an additional $10,000--worse in Sandy \nbecause they have already paid money to redo their homes, but even for \na normal homeowner $10,000 a year and you don't get a mortgage. Ten \nthousand dollars a year, this is absurd.\n  I don't know what is wrong with the flood insurance program, but any \nprogram that has to charge an average homeowner on Long Island, \nBrooklyn, Queens or Staten Island $10,000 ought to be reexamined by \nthis Congress. It is confounding. People are upset and they should be.\n  Recognizing the burden these changes could put on families, FEMA was \nrequired to conduct a study on the affordability of flood insurance, \nthe effects of increased premiums on low-income homeowners and middle-\nincome homeowners, and ways to increase affordability. The study was \noriginally supposed to be completed within 270 days. That was 9 months \nafter the bill was passed.\n  That deadline has come and gone. FEMA hasn't even begun to collect \nthe necessary data. We know FEMA has been busy responding to Sandy and \nother natural disasters.\n  At the same time it is unfair to hit homeowners with massive new \nflood insurance premiums without any plan of how to address the needs \nfor those who can't afford these skyrocketing, out-of-control, and out-\nof-reach premiums. The amendment is a recognition of that fundamental \nfairness.\n  Large parts of New York City are having their flood maps revised. As \na result, New Yorkers, many, could face the prospect of crushing \nincreases in premiums. Right now, far too many Sandy victims are still \nin the process of rebuilding their homes. They simply cannot afford a \nwhopping increase in flood insurance premiums.\n  Common sense and a sense of fairness dictate that we should delay any \nunnecessary increases until we know exactly how hard they hit our \ncommunities and until we can come up with a solution that makes flood \ninsurance reasonable and affordable--particularly if it is mandated, as \nit often is--in effect or by law.\n  That is what the amendment does. I urge my colleagues to vote in \nfavor of the amendment.\n  I also wish to mention an amendment offered by my good friend from \nacross the Hudson River, Senator Menendez of New Jersey, a State also \nsuffering from Superstorm Sandy, that seems to address many of the same \nconcerns.\n  His amendment would delay flood insurance premium increases until \nFEMA's Hazard Mitigation Grant Program funds have been expended. This \ncommonsense amendment would give homeowners a chance to use the Hazard \nMitigation Grant Program for its intended purpose, to rebuild stronger \nand safer, resulting in lower flood risks.\n  This amendment simply says: Let's wait until people have taken this \nopportunity to reduce their future flood risks before we increase their \nflood premiums. It makes abundant sense. I hope my colleagues would \npass both Senator Landrieu's and Senator Menendez's fine amendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to speak as \nin morning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, all over America concern has been growing \nthat the implementation of ObamaCare will cause serious damage to our \neconomy and to our health care system. Lost wages, soaring insurance \nrates, more bureaucracy, and less access to care are just some of the \nadverse consequences we are beginning to see. There are as many reasons \nfor concern as there are flaws in this ill-advised law.\n  Today, I wish to focus on just one of these flaws; that is, the \nAffordable Care Act's definition of a full-time employee. I also will \ncomment on legislation I have introduced to fix this one flaw.\n  My preference, of course, would be for us to repeal ObamaCare and \nstart all over, taking some good features of the law, such as the \nfeature that allows young people to stay on their parents' health care \npolicy until age 26, some of the provisions having to do with \npreventive care, and some of the provisions having to do with \npreexisting conditions.\n  We should have crafted a bill that focused on lowering health care \ncosts because it is the high cost of health care that is the reason we \nhave millions of Americans who are uninsured. Here we are with a deeply \nflawed law that is having very serious adverse consequences for the \npeople of our country.\n  Let me talk further about the issue of the definition of a full-time \nemployee. Under ObamaCare, an employee working just 30 hours a week is \ndefined as full time. That is a definition that is completely out of \nstep with standard employment practices in the United States today.\n  According to a survey published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, \nthe average American works 8.8 hours per day, which equates to 44 hours \nper week. The ObamaCare definition is nearly one-third lower than \nactual practice; likewise, the ObamaCare definition of full-time \nemployee is one-quarter lower than the 40 hours per week used by the \nGAO in its study of the budget and staffing required by the IRS to \nimplement this new law.\n  In that report the GAO described a full-time equivalent employee as \nthe measure of staff hours equal to those of an employee who works the \nequivalent of 40 hours per week for 52 weeks.\n  We also know, generally speaking, that employers are required to pay \novertime to workers after 40 hours a week. That is another indication \nthat 40 hours a week is the standard definition of a full-time \nemployee. Yet, inconceivably, ObamaCare defines a full-time worker as \none who works only 30 hours a week.\n  The effect of using such a low hourly threshold is to artificially \ndrive up the number of full-time workers for purposes of calculating \nthe Draconian penalties to which employers can be exposed by ObamaCare. \nThese penalties begin at $40,000 for businesses with 50 employees, plus \n$2,000 for each additional full-time equivalent employee.\n  Needless to say, these penalties will discourage businesses from \ngrowing or adding jobs, particularly for employers who are close to \nthat 50-job trigger. In addition, these penalties create a powerful \nincentive for employers to cut the hours their employees are allowed to \nwork so they are no longer considered full-time for the purposes of \nthis law.\n  This is not some hypothetical concern. I have heard from employers in\n\n[[Page S3303]]\n\nMaine who feel they are going to be forced to stay under the 50-\nemployee threshold, and they are even considering, very reluctantly, \ncutting the number of hours per week their employees are working. \nSimilar accounts have appeared in the media. For example, last week the \nLos Angeles Times reported that the city of Long Beach, CA, is limiting \nmost of its 1,600 part-time workers to just 27 hours a week to make \nsure they do not work over the 30-hour threshold. This is a \nmunicipality that is cutting the hours and thus the wages of its \nworkers simply because of the requirements of ObamaCare.\n  According to this news story, the parent company for the Red Lobster \nand Olive Garden restaurant chains is limiting the hours of some of \ntheir employees for the same reason.\n  I would ask unanimous consent that the Los Angeles Times article \nentitled ``Part-timers to lose pay amid health act's new math'' be \nprinted in the Record immediately following my remarks.\n  Bringing it closer to home, one Maine business I know has 47 \nemployees. It is doing pretty well and would like to create more jobs \nand hire more employees, but it simply will not because of the onerous \npenalties it would incur once it gets to 50 employees. If more \nbusinesses follow suit, millions of American workers could find their \nhours and their earnings cut back, with jobs lost to them at a time \nwhen our country is still struggling with an unacceptably high rate of \nunemployment.\n  A study just published by the Labor Center at the University of \nCalifornia, Berkeley, underscores the danger. That study, which \nexamined the hours worked in businesses with 100 or more employees, \nfound that 6.4 million workers in these firms worked between 30 and 36 \nhours per week and another 3.6 million workers have variable work \nschedules that make them vulnerable to having their hours cut as a \ndirect result of ObamaCare.\n  The study identified 2.3 million workers as being at the greatest \nrisk. Not surprisingly, these are workers who are employed in the \nretail trade, nursing homes, restaurants, and hotels. These are some of \nthe most vulnerable workers.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe study I just referred to immediately following my remarks.\n  Let me cite an actual example from my State of Maine.\n  Peter Daigle, who runs Lafayette Hotels, the largest hotel chain in \nthe State of Maine, has told me that many of his 800 employees work \nbetween 30 and 40 hours a week, and that, from a financial standpoint, \nit would make sense for his company to limit their hours to ensure they \ndo not go over the 30-hour threshold. This is an artificial limit that \nis driven solely by ObamaCare. As Peter puts it:\n\n       It concerns us that employers are being put in a position \n     that they would have to cut associates' hours just to meet a \n     Federal regulation.\n\n  Believe me, the owners of the Lafayette chain of hotels are civic-\nminded, good employers, who care deeply about the well-being of their \nemployees.\n  During the consideration of the budget resolution, the Senate adopted \nmy amendment calling for legislation setting a more sensible definition \nof ``full-time'' employee for purposes of ObamaCare penalties. Last \nmonth, I introduced a bill to protect Americans who may otherwise find \ntheir hours are curtailed and their earnings cut as a result of the \nunrealistic definition of a full-time employee that is included in \nObamaCare. Under my bill, a full-time employee would be an individual \nwho works a 40-hour workweek. That only makes sense. This is a \nsensible, commonsense definition in keeping with actual practice.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my legislation, S. 701. It will not \nsolve all of the problems--the many problems--of ObamaCare, but it will \nhelp to ensure millions of American workers do not have their hours \nreduced because of an artificially low, unrealistic definition in the \nlaw that is completely inconsistent with actual practice in this \ncountry.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the UC Berkeley Labor Center]\n\n    Which workers are most at risk of reduced work hours under the \n                          Affordable Care Act?\n\n       The Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires employers to provide \n     coverage or pay a penalty based on the number of employees \n     working 30 or more hours per week. This data brief looks at \n     which industries have a high percentage of employees working \n     fewer than or slightly above 30 hours, placing them at risk \n     for reduced hours by an employer wishing to avoid penalties. \n     We also look at the distribution of hours worked by type of \n     health coverage. While the penalty only applies to firms with \n     more than 50 full-time equivalent employees, due to data \n     limitations we show all results for workers in firms with \n     more than 100 total employees. Thus, the tables may slightly \n     understate the number of potentially affected workers.\n       Table 1 below shows the distribution of hours worked by \n     industry in the United States. From this we see that 6.4 \n     million U.S. workers, 8.9 percent of the workers in firms of \n     100 or more, work 30 to 36 hours a week. An additional 3.6 \n     million workers report that their ``work hours vary'' and may \n     also be vulnerable to a reduction in work hours. The \n     industries with the highest percentage of employees working \n     slightly over 30 hours are Restaurants, Nursing Homes, \n     Accommodation, Healthcare, Retail Trade, Education and \n     Building Services. The right most columns show the number of \n     workers who are most vulnerable to work reduction, namely, \n     those working 30 to 36 hours, with incomes below 400% of the \n     Federal Poverty Level and not covered by their own employer. \n     The industries with the highest concentration of such workers \n     are Restaurants, Accommodation, Building Services, Nursing \n     Homes and Retail Trade. Retail and Restaurants account for 47 \n     percent of the most vulnerable group. While Healthcare has a \n     higher than average share of employees working between 30 and \n     36 hours, most in that hours category are in higher income \n     families and/or receive health coverage through their \n     employer.\n\n                                   TABLE 1--HOURS WORKED BY INDUSTRY, WORKERS IN FIRMS OF 100 OR MORE EMPLOYEES, U.S.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                 Number of workers (thousands)                                  Percent of workers\n                                     -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                                                               Most\n                                                                               Most                    Below 30    30 to 36                vulnerable to\n                                       Hours    Below    30 to     37 +    vulnerable to  Hours vary      hrs         hrs      37 + hrs        work\n                                        vary    30 hrs   36 hrs    hrs         work        (percent)   (percent)   (percent)   (percent)    reduction*\n                                                                            reduction*                                                       (percent)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAgriculture, Forestry, Mining.......       53       15       19      661              10         6.0         5.0         3.4        85.5             1.5\nConstruction........................      103       41       63    1,801              20         6.8         2.3         4.8        86.0             1.0\nManufacturing.......................      361      157      276    8,227              88         2.9         2.4         4.2        90.5             1.0\nUtilities, Transp, Communication....      353      298      242    4,478              77         8.3         5.0         4.9        81.8             1.4\nWholesale...........................       81       51       46    1,652              19         3.4         3.7         7.7        85.2             1.0\nRetail Trade........................      572    1,589    1,217    5,319             570         3.8        13.0        10.6        72.5             6.5\nFinancial...........................      170      215      213    4,850              59         3.5         5.1         4.4        86.9             1.1\nEducation...........................      438    1,495    1,040    7,331             237         4.3        14.5        10.1        71.1             2.3\nAccommodation.......................       55       72      119      574              68         6.7         8.8        14.5        70.0             8.3\nOther Services......................      723    1,092      966   13,912             324         4.3         6.5         5.8        83.3             1.9\nRestaurants.........................      314      815      719    1,328             515        11.3        23.8        20.7        44.2            16.2\nBldg.

Slightly \n     more than 50 percent of those working between 30 and 36 hours \n     do not have coverage through their own employer, though only \n     slightly more than one quarter are uninsured or purchase \n     coverage in the individual market.

This is consistent with the research on the \n     impact of Hawaii's health care law on work hours. Hawaii \n     requires firms to provide health insurance to employees \n     working 20 hours a week or more, so the cost to employers for \n     full-time workers are much greater in Hawaii than under the \n     ACA, while the hour threshold is lower. Buchmueller, DiNardo \n     and Valetta (2011) found a 1.4 percentage point increase in \n     the share of employees working less than 20 hours a week as a \n     result of the law. In Massachusetts, where the employer \n     penalty is smaller than in the ACA ($295 per year), there was \n     no evidence of a disproportionate shift towards part-time \n     work compared to the rest of the nation.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Los Angeles Times, May 2, 2013]\n\n           Part-timers to Lose Pay Amid Health Act's New Math\n\n                           (By Chad Terhune)\n\n       Some workers are having their hours cut so employers won't \n     have to cover them under Obamacare. But many will benefit \n     from the healthcare law's premium subsidies and Medicaid \n     expansion.\n       Many part-timers are facing a double whammy from President \n     Obama's Affordable Care Act. The law requires large employers \n     offering health insurance to include part-time employees \n     working 30 hours a week or more. But rather than provide \n     healthcare to more workers, a growing number of employers are \n     cutting back employee hours instead.\n       The result: Not only will these workers earn less money, \n     but they'll also miss out on health insurance at work.\n       Consider the city of Long Beach. It is limiting most of its \n     1,600 part-time employees to fewer than 27 hours a week, on \n     average. City officials say that without cutting payroll \n     hours, new health benefits would cost up to $2 million more \n     next year, and that extra expense would trigger layoffs and \n     cutbacks in city services.\n       Part-timer Tara Sievers, 43, understands why, but she still \n     thinks it's wrong.\n       ``I understand there are costs to healthcare reform, but it \n     is surely not the intent of the law for employees to lose \n     hours,'' said the outreach coordinator at the El Dorado \n     Nature Center in Long Beach. ``It's ridiculous the city is \n     skirting the law.''\n       Across the nation, hundreds of thousands of other hourly \n     workers may also see smaller paychecks in the coming year \n     because of this response to the federal healthcare law. The \n     law exempts businesses with fewer than 50 full-time workers \n     from this requirement to provide benefits.\n       But big restaurant chains, retailers and movie theaters are \n     starting to trim employee hours. Even colleges are reducing \n     courses for part-time professors to keep their hours down and \n     avoid paying for their health premiums.\n       Overall, an estimated 2.3 million workers nationwide, \n     including 240,000 in California, are at risk of losing hours \n     as employers adjust to the new math of workplace benefits, \n     according to research by UC Berkeley. All this comes at a \n     time when part-timers are being hired in greater numbers as \n     U.S. employers look to keep payrolls lean.\n       One consolation for part-timers is that many of them stand \n     to benefit the most from the healthcare law's federal premium \n     subsidies or an expansion of Medicaid, both starting in \n     January.\n       The law will require most Americans to buy health insurance \n     or pay a penalty. Yet many lower-income people will qualify \n     for government insurance or be eligible for discounted \n     premiums on private policies.\n\n\n                  Quiz: Test your healthcare knowledge\n\n       ``For people losing a few hours each week, that's lost \n     income and it has a real impact,'' said Ken Jacobs, chairman \n     of the UC Berkeley Center for Labor Research and Education. \n     ``But many low-wage, part-time workers will also have some \n     affordable options under the federal law.''\n       Employers say these cutbacks are necessary given the high \n     cost of providing benefits. The average annual premium for \n     employee-only coverage was $6,540 in California last year. \n     Family coverage topped $16,000 a year. Those premiums have \n     shot up 170% in the past decade, more than five times the \n     rate of inflation in the state.\n       Bill Dombrowski, chief executive of the California \n     Retailers Assn., said employers are reducing hours because \n     ``it's the only way to survive economically.''\n       The full effect of these changes in the workplace isn't \n     known yet because many employers are still considering what \n     to do. Many companies waited to see whether the landmark \n     legislation would survive a Supreme Court challenge and the \n     outcome of last fall's presidential election.\n       Now many employers are scrambling to understand the latest \n     federal rules on implementation and are analyzing what makes \n     the most sense for their workforce and for running their \n     business.\n       There has been widespread speculation that many businesses \n     would drop health coverage entirely in favor of paying a \n     federal penalty of $2,000 per worker. Benefit consultants and \n     insurance brokers say many companies examined that scenario. \n     But they say most rejected it because of the disruption it \n     would cause for employees and the potential for putting an \n     employer at a competitive disadvantage in luring talented \n     workers.\n       Instead, pruning the hours of part-timers has attracted far \n     more interest.\n       ``That will be a widespread strategy,'' said Dede Kennedy-\n     Simington, vice president at Polenzani Benefits in Pasadena. \n     ``Employers will be making sure their payroll system can flag \n     when part-time workers are getting close to the cap they \n     set.''\n       Long Beach officials said they studied the various budget \n     options and opted for a plan that should affect only a small \n     portion of its workforce. The city estimates about 200 part-\n     time workers will be among the most affected by a reduction \n     in hours, representing about 13% of its overall part-time \n     staff. The city calculated that the federal penalty for \n     dropping coverage completely for its 4,100 full-time \n     employees would have been about $8 million.\n       ``We're in the same boat as many employers,'' said Tom \n     Modica, the city's director of government affairs. ``We need \n     to maintain the programs and service levels we have now.''\n       Sievers, the outreach coordinator, has worked on and off \n     for the city since 1994. She agreed that the city has \n     experienced tough fiscal times as many municipalities have \n     since the recession. But the city expects a budget surplus of \n     $3.6 million for the coming year.\n       ``Many part-timers are already struggling to get by in \n     these jobs,'' Sievers said.\n       Virginia's Republican governor, Bob McDonnell, announced \n     this year that all part-time state employees should work 29 \n     hours or less to avert the 30-hour threshold. Darden \n     Restaurants Inc., which owns the Olive Garden and Red Lobster \n     chains, began shifting to more part-time workers last fall in \n     a much-publicized test to keep a lid on healthcare costs. \n     Then Darden dropped the plan after being roundly criticized.\n       Some California lawmakers worry that the federal penalties \n     for not providing health coverage aren't enough of a \n     deterrent. They have proposed additional state fines to \n     prevent major retailers, restaurant chains and other \n     employers from restricting hours and dumping more of their \n     workers onto public programs such as Medi-Cal. Opponents say \n     the proposal is unnecessary and could deter companies from \n     adding workers.\n       Some supporters of the Affordable Care Act say they welcome \n     a gradual shift away from employer-sponsored coverage if new \n     government-run exchanges give consumers a choice of \n     competitively priced health plans. Some low- and middle-\n     income workers who qualify for federal subsidies may end up \n     paying less by buying their own policy next year compared \n     with their contribution toward employer coverage.\n       ``If the exchanges work,'' said Nelson Lichtenstein, a \n     professor of history at UC Santa Barbara and a labor expert, \n     ``then I'd be in favor of more people getting covered that \n     way rather than through employers.''\n\n  Ms. COLLINS.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nominations, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nominations of Shelly \nDeckert Dick, of Louisiana, to be United States District Judge for the \nMiddle District of Louisiana, and Nelson Stephen Roman, of New York, to \nbe United States District Judge for the Southern District of New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 30 \nminutes of debate equally divided in the usual form.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, over the last month, Senate Republicans \nhave failed to refute the facts of what they have done to President \nObama's judicial nominations. The Senate's work on judicial nominations \nshould not be about partisan point-scoring; it should be about ensuring \nthe American people have access to justice. I rejected that partisan \ntit-for-tat approach while moving to confirm 100 of President Bush's \njudicial nominees in just 17 months in 2001 and 2002.\n  The question for the Senate is, Are we doing enough to ensure that \nhard working Americans have access to justice so that they can have \ntheir rights protected? At a time when 10 percent of the Federal bench \nremains vacant, I do not think that we are. The standard we set during \nthe Bush administration for quickly moving to confirm noncontroversial \nnominees is not being met.\n  Senate Republicans who take such pride in the number of nominees \nbeing confirmed this year ignore how many were needlessly delayed from \nconfirmation last year and what they have done during the last 4 years. \nThat is why after the 14 confirmations this year, we remain more than \n20 confirmations behind the pace we set for President Bush's circuit \nand district nominees, and vacancies remain nearly twice as high as \nthey were at this point during President Bush's second term. For all \ntheir self-congratulatory statements, they cannot refute the following: \nWe are not even keeping up with attrition. Vacancies have increased, \nnot decreased, since the start of this year. President Obama's judicial \nnominees have faced unprecedented delays and obstruction by Senate \nRepublicans. We have yet to finish the work that could and should have \nbeen completed last year. There are still a dozen judicial nominees \nwith bipartisan support being denied confirmation.\n  A recent report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service \ncompares the whole of President Obama's first term to the whole of \nPresident Bush's first term, and the contrast could not be more clear. \nThe median Senate floor wait time for President Obama's district \nnominees was five times longer than for President Bush's. President \nObama's circuit nominees faced even longer delays, and their median \nwait time was 7.3 times longer than for President Bush's circuit \nnominees. The comparison is even worse if we look just at nominees who \nwere reported and confirmed unanimously. President Bush's unanimously \nconfirmed circuit nominees had a median wait time of just 14 days. \nCompare that to the 130.5 days for President Obama's unanimous \nnominees. That is more than nine times longer. Even the nonpartisan CRS \ncalls this a ``notable change.'' There is no good reason for such \nunprecedented delays, but those are the facts.\n  The confirmations in the last few months does not change the reality \nof what has happened over the last 4 years. If a baseball player goes \n0-for-9, and then gets a hit, we do not say he is an all-star because \nhe is batting 1.000 in his last at bat. We recognize that he is just 1-\nfor-10 and not a very good hitter.\n  So while I welcome the confirmations this year, I note both that 10 \nof the 14 could and should have been confirmed last year and that there \nare another dozen nominees pending before the Senate, including four \nwho also could have been confirmed last year. We can and must do more \nfor Americans who look to our courts for justice. They deserve better \nthan long delays and empty courtrooms. With 10 percent of our Federal \nbench vacant and a backlog of nominees on the Senate Executive \nCalendar, it is clear that the Senate is not working up to its full \ncapacity on nominations.\n  It is true that some vacancies do not have nominees. I wish \nRepublican home State Senators would work with President Obama to fill \nthese vacancies. Nor do those vacancies excuse their unwillingness to \ncomplete action on the consensus judicial nominees who are ready to be \nconfirmed but whose confirmations are being delayed. Mark Barnett, \nClaire Kelly, Shelly Dick, William Orrick, Nelson Roman, Sheri \nChappell, Michael McShane, Nitza Quinones Alejandro, Luis Restrepo, \nJeffrey Schmehl, Kenneth Gonzales, and Gregory Phillips are awaiting \nconfirmation and Sri Srinivasan, Ray Chen, and Jennifer Dorsey can be \nreported to the Senate today, without further delay. So long as there \nis a backlog of nominees before the Senate, the fault for failing to \nconfirm these nominees lies solely with Senate Republicans.\n  The Judicial Conference recently released their judgeship \nrecommendations. Based upon the caseloads of our Federal courts, the \nconference recommended the creation of 91 new judgeships. That is in \naddition to the 86 judgeships that are currently vacant. This means \nthat the effective vacancy rate on the Federal bench is over 18 \npercent. A vacancy rate this high is harmful to the individuals and \nbusinesses that depend on our courts for speedy justice. The damage is \neven more acute in the busiest district courts, such as those in border \nStates that have heavy immigration-related caseloads. In a Washington \nPost article about the CRS report, Jonathan Bernstein wrote: ``Ordinary \npeople who just want to get their legal matters taken care of promptly \nhave suffered because of all the vacancies on federal courts.'' I ask \nunanimous consent to have the article entitled ``New report confirms \nGOP obstructionism is unprecedented'' printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my statement.\n  Unneccessarily prolonged vacancies are not the only way that \npartisanship in Washington is hurting our courts. Sequestration \ncontinues to affect our justice system. The chief judge of the Fourth \nCircuit, William B. Traxler, Jr., has written: ``The impact of \nsequestration on the Judiciary is particularly harsh because the courts \nhave no control over their workload. They must respond to all cases \nthat are filed . . . .'' He went on to say:\n\n       [A] significant problem arises when budget cuts impact our \n     responsibilities under the Constitution. This happens when we \n     cannot afford to fulfill the Sixth Amendment right to \n     representation for indigents charged with crimes. The \n     predictable result is that criminal prosecutions will slow \n     and our legal system will not operate as efficiently. This \n     will cost us all in many different ways.\n\n  I share Chief Judge Traxler's concern, and I ask unanimous consent to \nhave his statement printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  Our Federal judiciary provides justice to 310 million Americans and \ngives full effect to the laws that we pass here in the Senate. We have \na constitutional responsibility to those 310 million Americans to make \nsure that they can count on our Federal courts to provide justice. \nFederal courts should not be held hostage to partisan obstruction, and \nwe need to keep our courts fully funded so that they can continue to \nmeet the promise of timely justice that is embedded in our \nConstitution.\n  Shelly Dick is nominated to fill a vacancy on the U.S. District Court \nfor the Middle District of Louisiana. Since 1994, she has been in \nprivate practice at the Law Offices of Shelly D. Dick, LLC, in Baton \nRouge and was previously an associate with the law firm of Gary Field \nLandry and Dornier.

He previously served as a justice \nof the New York State Supreme Court, Civil Term, Bronx County, as a \njudge for the New York City Civil Court, Bronx County, and as a judge \nof the housing part of the New York City Civil Court, Bronx County. \nPrior to becoming a judge, he was an assistant district attorney in \nKings County, NY, as well as a special narcotics assistant district \nattorney in New York City. From 1995 to 1998, Justice Roman served as a \nlaw clerk to the Honorable Jose A. Padilla, Jr. of the New York County \nCivil Court. He has the support of his home State Senators, Mr. Schumer \nand Mrs. Gillibrand, and was reported unanimously by the Judiciary \nCommittee over 2 months ago.\n  Senate Republicans have a long way to go to match the record of \ncooperation on consensus nominees that Senate Democrats established \nduring the Bush administration, but I hope that the confirmations so \nfar this year indicate that they are finally reconsidering their \nwholesale obstruction of President Obama's nominees. After today's \nvotes, 10 more judicial nominees remain pending, and all were reported \nwith bipartisan support. All Senate Democrats are ready to vote on each \nof them to allow them to get to work for the American people. We can \nmake real progress if Senate Republicans are willing to join us.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article and statement to which I \nreferred be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 3, 2013]\n\n        New Report Confirms GOP Obstructionism is Unprecedented\n\n                        (By Jonathan Bernstein)\n\n       The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service has released \n     an important new report that details Barack Obama's record on \n     nominating judges during his first term. It's no surprise: \n     Republican obstruction against his selections was \n     unprecedented. For example:\n       ``President Obama is the only one of the five most recent \n     Presidents for whom, during his first term, both the average \n     and median waiting time from nomination to confirmation for \n     circuit and district court nominees was greater than half a \n     calendar year (i.e., more than 182 days).''\n       A quick look at the report's summary confirms that Obama's \n     nominees have been treated more roughly than those of \n     Presidents Reagan, Bush, Clinton, and the other Bush.\n       That's only half the story. George H.W. Bush had to deal \n     with an opposition party Senate for his entire first term, \n     and Bill Clinton and George W. Bush had that during about \n     half of their first terms. It's at least plausibly legitimate \n     for opposite party Senators, when they have the majority, to \n     argue that they should have a larger role in filling judicial \n     vacancies, and to act accordingly. At the very least, if they \n     simply oppose some of those nominees, they will defeat them \n     in ``up or down'' votes.\n       But Obama, like Ronald Reagan, had a same-party Senate \n     majority during his first term. He should have had among the \n     best results over any recent president, all things being \n     equal.\n       What changed when Obama took office, however, was the \n     extension of the filibuster to cover every single nominee. \n     Republicans didn't always vote against cloture (or even \n     demand cloture votes), but they did demand 60 votes for every \n     nominee. That's brand new. It's true that Democrats \n     filibustered selected judicial nominations during the George \n     W. Bush presidency, but only at the circuit court level, and \n     not every single one.\n       That meant that despite solid Democratic majorities and \n     solid support from those Democrats, Obama's judicial approval \n     statistics are basically the worse of any of the recent \n     presidents. He doesn't show up last on every measure--for \n     example, George H.W. Bush had a lower percentage of district \n     court nominees confirmed--but he's fourth or fifth out of \n     five of these presidents on almost every way that CRS slices \n     the numbers, and it adds up to by far the most obstruction \n     faced by any recent president.\n       And remember: the losers here aren't just the president and \n     liberals who want to see his judges on the bench. Ordinary \n     people who just want to get their legal matters taken care of \n     promptly have suffered because of all the vacancies on \n     federal courts.\n       It's really a disgrace. Especially those picks that were \n     delayed for months, only to wind up getting confirmed by \n     unanimous votes. Especially the foot-dragging on district \n     court nominees. Just a disgrace.\n                                  ____\n\n\n   Statement of Chief Judge William B.

The Executive Committee of the Judicial Conference is \n     responsible for developing a spending plan for the federal \n     Judiciary's annual Congressional appropriation. This process \n     involves significant input from Conference committees, and \n     under the best of circumstances, is a difficult and complex \n     task.\n       The current fiscal year presents unparalleled challenges. \n     Budget sequestration has reduced the Judiciary's overall \n     funding by nearly $350 million from the level provided in \n     Fiscal Year 2012. The impact of sequestration on the \n     Judiciary is particularly harsh because the courts have no \n     control over their workload. They must respond to all cases \n     that are filed, whether they are by individuals, businesses, \n     or the government.\n       In February 2013, the Executive Committee implemented a \n     series of emergency measures that were intended to mitigate \n     the impact of sequestration to the best extent possible. \n     Nevertheless, significant shortfalls remain.\n       Funds have been reduced for probation and pretrial \n     staffing, which means less deterrence, detection, and \n     supervision of released felons from prison. Related funding \n     for drug testing, drug treatment and mental health treatment \n     were cut by 20 percent. Money for security systems and \n     equipment has been cut 25 percent and court security officer \n     hours have been reduced. Cuts in court staffing and hours \n     threaten to impact public access and slow case processing. \n     National information technology upgrades to improve \n     infrastructure and financial management have been delayed. \n     Sequestration is impacting federal court operations and \n     programs throughout the country, including a $51 million \n     shortfall in the FY 2013 funds in the Defender Services \n     account.\n       The Judiciary is committed to doing its part to reduce the \n     fiscal deficit our country faces. However, a significant \n     problem arises when budget cuts impact our responsibilities \n     under the Constitution. This happens when we cannot afford to \n     fulfill the Sixth Amendment right to representation for \n     indigents charged with crimes. The predictable result is that \n     criminal prosecutions will slow and our legal system will not \n     operate as efficiently. This will cost us all in many \n     different ways.\n       With regard to the Defender account shortfall, at its April \n     16, 2013, meeting the Executive Committee examined all \n     aspects of this account, scrubbed expenses where possible, \n     and approved a final spending plan. After lengthy discussion, \n     the Committee determined to allocate the available funds in a \n     manner that, without further impacting payments to private \n     attorneys, will at least limit the number of days that any \n     defender organization staff must be furloughed. The result is \n     that some federal defender offices will still be forced to \n     furlough their employees up to 15 days. The Committee also \n     approved deferral of payments to private panel attorneys for \n     the last 15 business days of the fiscal year.\n       The defender program has no flexibility to absorb cuts of \n     this magnitude without impacting payments to private counsel \n     appointed under the Criminal Justice Act and Federal Defender \n     Organizations, which pay for government lawyers to provide \n     counsel to eligible defendants. Federal defender offices \n     already have fired and furloughed staff, as well as \n     drastically cut essential services. Criminal prosecutions \n     have been delayed because defender organizations do not have \n     the staff necessary to continue their representation of the \n     defendant or the funds to pay for experts or other cases \n     costs.\n       The Executive Committee's allocation of funds is not a \n     solution to the $51 million shortfall. It represents a \n     conscientious effort to mitigate the adverse impact on both \n     personnel and services. It also means that millions of \n     dollars in expenses in this account will be shifted to FY \n     2014, even though they were not part of the Judicial Branch \n     budget submission to Congress. This level of funding is \n     unsustainable without relief from Congress.\n       The Judiciary will soon ask the Office of Management and \n     Budget to transmit an FY 2013 emergency supplemental funding \n     request to Congress to help ameliorate the impact of the \n     sequestration cuts to defender services, probation and \n     pretrial services, court staffing, and court security.\n       In his 2012 Year-End Report on the Federal Judiciary, the \n     Chief Justice said:\n       ``A significant and prolonged shortfall in judicial funding \n     would inevitably result in the delay or denial of justice for \n     the people the courts serve.''\n       I share this grave concern.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to present to this Chamber \nthe nomination of Shelly Deckert Dick as a nominee for article III \njudge on the U.S. Middle District Court of Louisiana. I was pleased to \nrecommend Ms. Dick to President Obama, and I am happy that he sent her \nname to the Senate and that the committee has\n\n[[Page S3307]]\n\nunanimously recommended her for confirmation.\n  She is equipped with decades of Federal court litigation experience. \nShe brings with her a thorough understanding of the Federal court \nsystem, having practiced for years before the court. From all \nindications from her peers and colleagues, she is fair and evenhanded. \nI think her temperament is appropriate for the bench.\n  She is a current resident of Baton Rouge but was born in El Paso, TX. \nShe earned her bachelor's degree in business administration from the \nUniversity of Texas at Austin and graduated on the dean's list with \nhonors.\n  She brings with her years of experience, not just in the private \nsector. She has worked as a lawyer before the Federal bench. She has \nalso been extremely active in community affairs.\n  She graduated from Louisiana State University law school, where she \nwas a member of the Law Review. Demonstrating her commitment to public \nservice early in her legal career, she served as a law clerk to a woman \nwho went on--and was actually mentored by the first woman of our \nSupreme Court--Kitty Kimble, who went on, of course, to become chief \njustice of the Louisiana Supreme Court.\n  Following law school, at an early age, she became an associate \nattorney at the firm of Gary, Field, Landry & Bradford before going on \nto become a full partner in one of our strongest and best law firms in \nBaton Rouge, LA.\n  She has extensive experience, as I said, in Federal court \nrepresenting both plaintiffs and defendants as well as government and \nnongovernment clients. She has a well-rounded legal career and is very \nactive in the community, in her church, and has done missionary work \nfor many years throughout the world. She is also very active in the \nAmerican Bar Association, the Louisiana State Bar Association, the \nLouisiana Association of Defense Counsel, and the Baton Rouge bar. She \nwas admitted to practice in the district courts of the Western, Middle, \nand Eastern Districts, the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and the \nU.S. Supreme Court. She has written numerous articles for legal \npublications and presented at legal seminars on a wide range of topics.\n  I have known Ms. Dick for a few years. She is a friend now. She was \nnot a close friend when my search committee went out and looked for the \nmost qualified individuals to step up and serve on our bench. She and \nher credentials were brought to my attention by many members of the \ncommunity, and I am very happy to nominate Ms. Dick.\n  Ms. Dick will be the first woman to serve in the Middle District of \nLouisiana. I think it is high time, after a couple of hundred years, \nthat we have women now qualified and stepping up to assume these \nleadership positions. I have been very proud to help bring diversity \nand excellence to our bench both at the prosecutor level and as judges \nin the courts in Louisiana.\n  As I said, Shelly has also volunteered for international missions \noverseas, particularly in Cambodia, South Africa, and Kenya. She has \nworked with her church and other nonprofit organizations.\n  I think she is perfectly suited to be a judge with all the \nprerequisite experience and legal degrees and academic degrees \nrequired. Most importantly, she is enthusiastic and excited about \nserving.\n  I am sorry it has taken us so long to get her to this point where the \nSenate will hopefully confirm her--if not acclamation--by a strong and \noverwhelming vote. I know of no opposition to her nomination.\n  These days it seems that these nominations seem to be going a lot \nslower than they should. I thank her and her family for their patience \nas they have waited and waited for this day to come. Hopefully she will \nbe able to put on that robe and get to that bench in the Middle \nDistrict and do a fine job for us both in Louisiana and around the \ncountry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The junior Senator from Louisiana may want to add a word.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from you Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise for two reasons. First of all, I \nlook forward to supporting the confirmation of Shelly Dick to become a \njudge in the Middle District of Louisiana, and I look forward to that \nvote in 5 minutes. As I have said before, I believe she will serve \nwell.\n  Secondly, I also wanted to come to the floor to add my support to the \nLandrieu flood insurance amendment. I am a cosponsor, and we are \nworking very hard on clearing a path for an important, substantive \nversion of that amendment.\n  Senator Landrieu and I have talked, and we have talked to others, \nincluding Senator Boxer and many other supporters. We are working very \nhard not to get into the weeds but to take care of some technical \nissues, some budget points of order, and some other issues so we can \nclear the path for a strong, substantive version of this amendment.\n  This is a big deal. It is a big deal for the country. It is a big \ndeal for any coastal area and certainly a big deal for South Louisiana. \nWe need to ensure that as the new Flood Insurance Program is \nadministered, it is done in a fair and reasonable way and that we don't \nprice anybody who has been following the rules out of their home \nbecause their flood insurance rates increased so astronomically. That \nis the fear, but that has not played out. The new rates are not out, \nbut that is the legitimate fear. Senator Landrieu and I are working \nwith our entire delegation to make sure we avoid that.\n  Right after this vote, I am going to travel to northern Virginia to \nmeet with a Louisiana group at the FEMA offices to talk about this very \nissue. I am convinced FEMA has some authority under law already to \nmitigate these issues in many ways but including by making sure they \nget their LAMP process right and take into account all flood barriers \nand protections in a given area as new areas are mapped. I am going \ndirectly from this judge vote to that important meeting, and we will \nall be following up in important ways to make sure we get it right, \nmake sure FEMA gets it right, hopefully including a good, workable \namendment that can be passed on this bill. We are all working toward \nthat goal.\n  I thank my colleague from Louisiana for that joint effort.\n  I yield back to the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I wish to follow up on the comments \nmade by my colleague from Louisiana, Senator Vitter. I am pleased he \nwill accompany many of our elected officials to the FEMA office this \nafternoon. I had a chance to meet with the FEMA officials yesterday. At \nmy request, they came to the Capitol to meet with me.\n  We are both very hopeful that there are some things within the new \nmandates and new authorizations that FEMA can do to mitigate against \nthe projected 25-percent increases annually for some of our \npolicyholders--not the majority but for some of them. I am anticipating \nthat some of these issues are not going to be addressed \nadministratively and that it is going to take a change of law.\n  Again, the reason I am pushing this issue and pushing this bill is \nbecause this new law that we are talking about, expressing frustration \nabout, and questioning never came to this floor for a vote. I am still \nnot clear at this point whether this bill was ever voted on by the full \nHouse.\n  This bill, the flood insurance reform bill of last year, was tucked \ninto a larger bill, the national transportation bill, at the last \nminute. The national transportation bill was widely supported. It funds \nbillions of dollars' worth of projects for everyone's district. It is a \nvery popular bill.\n  This relatively small but significant flood insurance bill was tucked \ninto a conference report, which is really not that usual, particularly \nif the bill itself had not passed one body. There are lots of times \nwhen things are put into a conference committee that have not passed \nthe Senate, but it passed the House, or it passed the House but not the \nSenate, and there is an indication of broad support. We have to move \nlegislation, and sometimes we have to use an expedited means.\n  I am still waiting to get clear from the staff whether this bill ever \ngot a vote in the House of Representatives. I know it didn't get a vote \nhere, and it would probably, in its current form, not pass because the \ndelegations from\n\n[[Page S3308]]\n\nLouisiana, Texas, Mississippi, California, and any numbers, would have \ninsisted on some amendments and some procedures to help our people who \nare going to be affected by these very significant increases in flood \ninsurance, to give them more time to meet their obligations.\n  I know we are on a judgeship so I am going to yield the floor, but I \nam hoping we can continue to work on this issue.\n  I thank Senator Vitter for his support, as well as Senator Boxer, as \nwe are continuing to work on the language of this amendment.\n  I yield back all time on the nominations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Shelly Deckert Dick, of Louisiana, to be \nUnited States District Judge for the Middle District of Louisiana?\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Nelson Stephen Roman, of New York, to be \nUnited States District Judge for the Southern District of New York?\n  Mr. COATS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. \nLautenberg) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. CORNYN.

The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam President, I rise to urge my colleagues to \nsupport a bipartisan amendment I worked on with Senator Wicker to make \nour communities more resilient in an era of extreme weather that we \nlive in. No corner of America is being spared: blazing wildfires in the \nWest, massive tornadoes in the South, crippling droughts in the \nMidwest, routine hurricanes battering the gulf coast and the northeast \ncoast.\n  We cannot accept the status quo. I think we must do more, because as \nwe have seen in New York, the storm of the century has literally become \nthe storm of the year. In 2011, we saw widespread and devastating \ndamage from Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee. One year later, \nSuperstorm Sandy hit us harder than we could have ever imagined.\n  The Federal Government must step in. It must step up to do the hard \nwork, to lead the way in preparing for and protecting against these \nextreme weather events. This does not mean just building a higher flood \nwall or moving public infrastructure out of the flood zone; it means \ntaking a smarter, longer term regional approach to disaster planning.\n  Along with saving lives, this makes smart economic sense. For every \n$1 we spend to reduce disaster risk, we save $4 in recovery costs. Our \nbipartisan amendment can help achieve this goal. It is called \nStrengthening the Resiliency of Our Nation on the Ground--the STRONG \nAct--to give the Federal Government a real plan to strengthen our \nresiliency.\n  First, the bill would investigate effective resiliency policies, \nidentify the gaps, and identify the conflicting policies. Knowing what \nresources we have, what works, what does not, we can write and \nimplement a national resiliency strategy to support the local efforts.\n  This would include a one-stop shop to gather and share data to \ndevelop smarter resiliency policies, incorporating existing databases \nand ongoing efforts across a range of sectors, from weather and climate \nto transportation and energy. It also eliminates redundancies, ensuring \nall levels of government are coordinating effectively and efficiently, \nsharing their expertise, their data, and information.\n  This national resource will work hand in glove with local efforts, \nproviding the most recent scientific information and best practices to \nhelp our communities plan for and survive the worst. As we learn the \nlessons of Superstorm Sandy and other natural disasters, we need to \nensure that our communities are thinking broadly about resiliency \nacross all sectors of society. The STRONG Act is the foundation to \nbuild smarter and stronger cities, States and a nation. Only with \ncommunities built for the 21st century can we withstand the extreme \nweather of our time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               ObamaCare\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I wish to talk a bit about the health \ncare bill. Every time I am home, I hear more and more concerns from \nmore and more families and more and more individuals and more and more \nemployers. In 2009, the President repeatedly said that if you like your \nhealth care plan, you can keep it. Notice nobody is saying that \nanymore.\n  Maybe that is not what the measure should be because that is \ncertainly not going to happen. I think the question is, are you going \nto have health care and can you afford it. During the Presidential \ncampaign, the President said he liked the term ``ObamaCare.'' So I feel \na little more free to use that than I did previously. I do not mean it \nto be disparaging in any way. I just happen to think it is a plan that \nwill not work.\n  In the 3 years since the Affordable Care Act became law, it has \nbecome increasingly clear that this plan will only deliver more broken \npromises and bad news. Opponents have long warned this overhaul is bad \nfor the economy. There are now over 20,000 pages of new regulations. In \ntalking to the people I work for, they say they were concerned when \npeople did not read the 2,000-page bill. Since the election, there have \nbeen 20,000 pages of regulations. There will be at least 159 new \nbureaucracies, boards, and programs.\n  A number of recent reports have reinforced everybody's concerns, \nnoting that the health care bill will burden Americans with $1 trillion \nof new taxes over 10 years and penalties. It will stifle job creation.\n  Investors Business Daily noted that retailers are cutting worker \nhours at a rate not seen in more than three decades, a sudden shift, \naccording to them,\n\n[[Page S3309]]\n\nthat can only be explained by the onset of ObamaCare's employer \nmandates--only explained by the onset of ObamaCare's employer mandates. \nIn the April job figures, 288,000 people moved from full-time work to \npart-time work.\n  Almost all of us in the Senate, as we talk to people in the States we \nrepresent, have talked to somebody who is figuring out how they can \nreplace full-time employees--when they leave or maybe earlier than they \nwanted to leave--with part-time employees. The Congressional Budget \nOffice warned that the President's health care plan will slash \napproximately 800,000 jobs, increase government spending by $1.2 \ntrillion, and force 7 million Americans to lose their employer-\nsponsored coverage.\n  On that last one, I think that is optimistic. I think it will be more \nthan 7 million people who 2 years from now do not have health \ninsurance, who had some kind of health insurance 2 years ago or even up \nuntil today. I think setting the standard that they have to meet that, \nand if they cannot meet that standard, just pay the penalty and do not \nprovide anything is going to put people in a position they are going to \nfind themselves very troubled to be in.\n  A leading health care advocacy group recently noted that millions of \npeople will be priced out of the health insurance market under \nObamaCare thanks to a glitch in the law that hurts people with modest \nincomes who cannot afford family coverage offered by their employers. \nOf course, the only thing the employer gets any credit for offering in \nthe new world we are about to move into is individual coverage.\n  In fact, if someone has a family member who is covered in their \nfamily policy, the person they work for appears to get no credit for \nthat coverage. An independent study by the Society of Actuaries--these \nare people who try to calculate benefits and life expectancy and all of \nthat--estimates that insurance companies will have to pay out an \naverage of 32 percent more for medical claims on individual health \npolicies by 2017.\n  Why would that be? Remember, these are health policies that there is \na small penalty for not having but the insurance company has to issue \nto you whenever you decide you want it.\n  I have talked to more than one hospital group that said we will just \nput the insurance forms in the ambulance.\n  Under the law, as I have read the law, you can fill out the insurance \nform on the way to the hospital in the ambulance, and the insurance \ncompany still has to give the so-called guaranteed issue no matter what \nyour health is.\n  For Missourians, this study shows that medical claims costs could \nincrease by almost 60 percent--the exact amount is 58.8 percent--per \nperson. This actuarial study in my State says insurance claims costs \ncould increase by 58.8 percent, making my State's projected cost \nincrease the eighth highest in the country.\n  At a time when millions of Americans are still searching for jobs, \nthe last thing we should be doing is discouraging job growth, but every \nsingle person here has heard somebody that they work for in the State \nthey represent say: We are not going to grow above 50 people or we are \nnot going to hire full-time employees.\n  Next year job creators will be forced to start complying with the law \nor pay a penalty. This will lead employers to reduce hours for full-\ntime employees to avoid paying those penalties or providing health \ncare--either one.\n  State governments, such as the State of Virginia right across the \nriver from where we are working in the Nation's Capital, said that \nafter July 1 none of their part-time employees will be allowed to \nwork--that is the beginning of their spending year--that after July 1 \nnone of their part-time employees will be able to work more than 29 \nhours. Why would the entire State of Virginia be saying that? Because \nthe Federal Government says 30 hours is the time when you have to \nprovide a benefit.\n  Once we start saying something as a government that you have to do \nsomething, suddenly it seems to be OK to meet the exceptions. Companies \nthat for five decades after World War II have done everything they \ncould to provide benefits for health care at whatever level they \nthought they could because they thought it was either the competitive \nthing to do or the right thing to do or both, those same companies are \nnow saying: Well, the exception in the law says I don't really have an \nobligation to provide you health care, and so I am not going to.\n  As we see people move toward the part-time workforce, I believe we \nare going to see people having more than one job, but none of those \njobs will have benefits. The person who served your breakfast or sells \nyou your coffee in the morning may be the same person you see at a meal \nlater that same day at another place because they are working two jobs, \nnot one, and neither of those has benefits.\n  For those employers who decide it is cost-effective to pay the \npenalty rather than comply with the law, those people who worked for \nthem obviously will see their plans change or lose their plans \naltogether. Maybe that is why my friends across the aisle are beginning \nto say the things they have said about this.\n  Everybody has heard the Senator Baucus comment that warned that \nimplementing this bill will be a ``huge train wreck coming down.''\n  Senator Wyden said:\n\n       There is reason to be very concerned about what's going to \n     happen with young people. If their premiums shoot up, I can \n     tell you, that is going to wash up on the Senate in a hurry.\n       The New York Times reported that Senator Ben Cardin told \n     White House officials that he was concerned about big rate \n     increases being sought by insurers in his State, one of the \n     first States to report what the new rates would be.\n\n  Senator Jeanne Shaheen noted that she is ``hearing from a lot of \nsmall businesses in New Hampshire that do not know how to comply with \nthe law.''\n  Senator Jay Rockefeller said that he is of the belief that the health \ncare act ``is probably the most complex piece of legislation ever \npassed by the United States Congress.'' He noted, ``It worries me, \nbecause it is so complicated. And if it isn't done right the first \ntime, it'll just simply get worse.''\n  The Secretary of HHS said, ``There may be a higher cost associated \nwith getting into that market.''\n  As I said, even the top health care official in the country, the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services, Kathleen Sebelius, said that \nthere might be a higher cost associated with getting into this market \nwhere folks will be moving into a really fully insured product for the \nfirst time--or not. What she did say was that this insurance may cost \nmore than what your employer used to think they could afford to provide \nto you, and now maybe they are not providing anything at all. Maybe \nthey are providing something that meets new standards--not what the \nperson paying the bill thought they could afford but what was the only \noption available.\n  This isn't like, if you can do some of this, fine, you will just pay \npart of the penalty. It is not like that at all. In fact, what this \nreally is, if you don't meet the standards that the Federal Government \nhas decided should be the standards for employees of yours whom they \nhave never seen, whom you pay $100 a day if you try to offer insurance \nthat doesn't meet the insurance, per employee--that is, $36,500 a year \nis the penalty if you don't offer the insurance exactly as the \ngovernment says it has to be offered at a minimum. If you decide not to \noffer any insurance at all, it is $2,000 a year.\n  So now we have gotten to the point where the government is so right \nthat it is a $36,500 penalty if you don't offer exactly the insurance \nthey say you have to offer and it is a $2,000 penalty if you don't \noffer any insurance at all. What kind of parallel universe is this that \nthis has taken us into that we have that kind of ridiculous situation \ndevelop?\n  Last week President Obama said there may be ``glitches and bumps'' in \nthe rollout of his massive government overhaul. The Chicago Tribune, \none of his hometown newspapers, after he said that, said in an \neditorial: Give us the choice of ``train wreck'' or ``glitches and \nbumps,'' we are betting on train wreck.\n  This is his hometown paper that is saying that. This is certainly not \nwhat the President and congressional leaders promised us when this \nbecame the law.\n  We can all agree that we must fix our health care system. I think the \npath we are on is the wrong path to take. There are a number of things \nwe could do: medical liability reform, more vigorous competition, \nbuying across State lines, more individual ownership of policies set \nup, high-risk pools that work. The\n\n[[Page S3310]]\n\nchoice should never have been ``you can do this or we can do nothing at \nall.'' There were things in the great health care system we had that \ncould have been improved and still had the benefits of that great \nsystem. It appears that none of these are being allowed to happen until \nwe see for sure that the new system either will work or won't work.\n  I recently voted for the amendment to defund the program. Let's go \nback to the drawing board and see what we can do to get started again. \nI think this is a flawed concept. I think we have to replace this \nconcept with commonsense reforms that put patients and doctors in \ncontrol of health care, not new bureaucracies in Washington.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I would like to lay out what we are \ngoing to do, and it will take me about 6 minutes maximum.\n  The good news for the Senate--I am glad you don't object to good news \nbecause it is not always good news. What we have seen on this WRDA bill \nis that we have handled a number of amendments both through the \nmanagers' package that we substituted for the original text and in \nindividual amendments. What we have seen is that the Boxer-Vitter \nsubstitute strengthened participation of environmental agencies in \nproject delivery. We have addressed challenges in every part of the \ncountry. We reached agreement with appropriators on future harbor \nmaintenance trust fund expenditures. We authorized additional regional \nprograms. We accelerate investment in the Inland Waterways Trust Fund.\n  Here on the floor, we adapted amendments to set up an oceans trust \nfund and a new program to address Asian carp. We have made sure that \nagencies are treated fairly in the WIFIA Program. We require \nperformance measures for levee safety grants. These are good amendments \noffered by both sides of the aisle.\n  We are about to, as soon as we do this little technical change to an \namendment number--and it looks as though it has been done--we are about \nto adopt Senator Blunt's very important amendment that has so much \nsupport on both sides of the aisle for resilient construction, meaning \nwe are going to make sure that as we enter a phase of extreme weather \nsituations, we use the best materials on these projects. That is the \nBlunt amendment.\n  Then we go to the Sessions amendment, which is land transfer to help \nhis local communities--uncontroversial.\n  There is a Coburn amendment to deauthorize projects that have been \ninactive for a very long time. This saves us money.\n  Also, there is a Warner amendment that makes technical corrections \nfor Four Mile Run.\n  We will set aside the Inhofe amendment and that number, amendment No. \n797, that would be pending.\n  I ask unanimous consent that in addition to the Blunt amendment No. \n800 in the previous order, the following amendments be the next \namendments in order to the bill: Sessions No. 811, as modified with the \nchanges that are at the desk, Coburn No. 823, Warner No. 873, and \nInhofe No. 797; further, that no second-degree amendments be in order \nto any of these amendments or the Blunt amendment prior to the votes in \nrelation to the amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n      Amendments Nos. 800, 811, as modified, 823, and 873, en bloc\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent that the following amendments, \nwhich have been cleared by both sides, be considered and agreed to en \nbloc: Blunt amendment No. 800; Sessions amendment No. 811, as modified; \nCoburn amendment No. 823; and Warner amendment No. 873.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments were agreed to, as follows:\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 800\n\n (Purpose: To provide for the consideration of resilient construction \n   techniques in certain studies relating to extreme weather events)\n\n       Redesignate sections 11001, 11002, and 11003 as sections \n     11002, 11003, and 11004, respectively.\n       At the beginning of title XI, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 11001. DEFINITION OF RESILIENT CONSTRUCTION TECHNIQUE.\n\n       In this title, the term ``resilient construction \n     technique'' means a construction method that--\n       (1) allows a property--\n       (A) to resist hazards brought on by a major disaster; and\n       (B) to continue to provide the primary functions of the \n     property after a major disaster;\n       (2) reduces the magnitude or duration of a disruptive event \n     to a property; and\n       (3) has the absorptive capacity, adaptive capacity, and \n     recoverability to withstand a potentially disruptive event.\n       In section 11002(b) (as redesignated), strike paragraph (2) \n     and insert the following:\n       (2) an analysis of--\n       (A) historical extreme weather events;\n       (B) the ability of existing infrastructure to mitigate \n     risks associated with extreme weather events; and\n       (C) the reduction in long-term costs and vulnerability to \n     infrastructure through the use of resilient construction \n     techniques.\n       In section 11003(b)(5) (as redesignated), strike the \n     ``and'' at the end.\n       In section 11003(b) (as redesignated) redesignate paragraph \n     (6) as paragraph (7).\n       In section 1003(b) (as redesignated), insert after \n     paragraph (5) the following:\n       (6) any recommendations on the use of resilient \n     construction techniques to reduce future vulnerability from \n     flood, storm, and drought conditions; and\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 811, as modified\n\n (Purpose: To require the Tennessee Valley Authority to grant certain \n                           use restrictions)\n\n       At the end of title V, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 5011. RELEASE OF USE RESTRICTIONS.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Tennessee \n     Valley Authority shall, without monetary consideration, grant \n     releases from real estate restrictions established pursuant \n     to section 4(k)(b) of the Tennessee Valley Authority Act of \n     1933 (16 U.S.C. 831c(k)(b)) with respect to tracts of land \n     identified in section 4(k)(b) of that Act, provided that such \n     releases shall be granted in a manner consistent with \n     applicable TVA policies.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 823\n\n  (Purpose: To ensure environmental infrastructure activities are not \n  exempt from review by the Infrastructure Deauthorization Commission)\n\n       Section 2049(b) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       (6) Application.--For purposes of this subsection, water \n     resources projects shall include environmental infrastructure \n     assistance projects and programs of the Corps of Engineers.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 873\n\n  (Purpose: To include a provision relating to Four Mile Run, city of \n               Alexandria and Arlington County, Virginia)\n\n       On page 216, between lines 3 and 4, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 3019. FOUR MILE RUN, CITY OF ALEXANDRIA AND ARLINGTON \n                   COUNTY, VIRGINIA.\n\n       Section 84(a)(1) of the Water Resources Development Act of \n     1974 (Public Law 93-251; 88 Stat. 35) is amended by striking \n     ``twenty-seven thousand cubic feet per second'' and inserting \n     ``18,000 cubic feet per second''.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I move to reconsider and lay those motions on the table.\n  The motions to lay on the table were agreed to.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I wish to thank everybody. We have made great progress on \nthis bill. We will still be working very hard tomorrow, Saturday, \nSunday, and Monday. We urge you, if you have amendments, we are just \nsaying let them be relevant and not controversial. We can't solve every \nproblem in America on this water bill, but we are trying our best to \nget a really good bill through the Senate.\n  I understand from the House that they intend to look at our bill, \nwork off our bill, and make their changes. Then we will go to \nconference and hopefully have a very good result.\n  It is 3 o'clock on a Thursday, and we have disposed of numerous \namendments. We are still looking at more. We are trying to resolve all \nof those. One way or the other, it is our plan to finish this bill next \nweek. It is very rare to have a bill that is so bipartisan, that will, \nin fact, support over 500,000 jobs, and that has the support of \nbusiness, labor, and all kinds of community groups. With that, I thank \nmy colleagues for working with us.\n  I have talked to the majority leader. There will be no further votes \ntoday. Next week we will finish this bill. I thank you very much.\n  I thank my friend from Missouri. It has been a pleasure working with \nhim and staff on his excellent amendment with Senator Nelson. We are \nvery pleased we were able to clear this.\n  I also thank Senator Landrieu and Senator Durbin. They had some \nissues, but they stepped back and let us move forward with these \namendments.\n  People are working together, and they are working very hard, and I am \nvery pleased about where we are. I thank my colleague from Missouri.\n\n[[Page S3311]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BLUNT. I thank the chairwoman for her work.\n  As this bill progresses, I will remind my friends on the floor that \none of the major bills we passed last year was the highway bill in the \nlast Congress that she and Senator Inhofe worked on. Now she and \nSenator Vitter are bringing another important bill to the floor that is \nsignificant.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. I ask unanimous consent to address the Senate as in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I recently had a great conversation with \nan individual, August Busch, III, the longtime president and CEO of \nAnheuser-Busch. We talked about the state of the economy. We talked \nabout the desire to get jobs created and the country back on solid \nfiscal footing.\n  That conversation reminded me of the opportunities we have here in \nthe Senate and the Congress to work together to see that we enact \npolicies here in the Nation's Capital that would make a real difference \nin the everyday lives of Americans by creating jobs, by making certain \nour business climate is beneficial to large and small businesses. In \nthat climate, they then would have the opportunity to add additional \nemployment opportunities for all Americans.\n  In this overly partisan climate of Washington, DC, it is easy to lose \nsight of the fact that we should all be working toward that same goal \nof getting our economy back on track.\n  I think the No. 1 issue standing in the way of robust economic growth \nis the uncertainty that continues to be there--as described, in part, \nby my colleague from Missouri in regard to the Affordable Care Act--\nwith Americans in general and people making family as well as business \nand investment decisions about where we are headed with our national \ndebt and our deficit spending.\n  As elected officials, Americans expect us to confront our Nation's \nfiscal challenges and not push them off into the future. But last \nyear's budget shortfall--just to remind us of the facts--reached $1.1 \ntrillion, the fourth straight year of trillion-dollar deficits. This \nout-of-control too much spending we have in our government has \nincreased our national debt to a record $16 trillion, which is more \nthan the entire U.S. economy produced in goods and services in 2012.\n  The fact is our current fiscal state is the responsibility of many \nCongresses and several Presidents from both political parties. It is \nnot always the opportunity we sometimes take to point fingers, but it \nis that over a long period of time we have allowed ourselves to live \nway beyond our means, and it has gone on far too long.\n  When I was elected to the Senate, just about 3 years ago, I was \ninvited to the White House to have a conversation with my colleagues \nand President Obama. The conversation was all about deficit spending, \nthe national debt, and the upcoming vote to raise the debt ceiling. \nUnfortunately, since that time, it has been pretty much business as \nusual in Washington, DC, and almost no progress has been made. It is \ntime for us to get beyond the conversations and the rhetoric that too \noften is pretty empty around here and get down to the business of \nmaking real changes in the way we conduct our business.\n  First and foremost, we must reduce the government drag on the private \nsector. Startups in small businesses--the real job creators in this \ncountry--are being held down under the weight of a 74,000-page \nconvoluted Tax Code and $1.75 trillion worth of redtape.\n  Every single job creator I meet, whether it is at a townhall meeting \nback home in Kansas or here in Washington, DC, tells me their story and \nasks for our help. What they tell me is we have to reduce the massive \nregulatory burden. The overwhelming cost of compliance prevents many \nsmall business owners and entrepreneurs from hiring new employees, \nexpanding their facilities, and growing the economy.\n  Second, in addition to the regulatory environment, we have to say no \nto spending and yes to projob measures. This will help reduce the \nuncertainty in the marketplace, encourage business investment, help us \nbecome more competitive in the global economy and, most important, \ncreate jobs.\n  The President's solution is to raise revenues to balance the budget. \nBut the President's tax increase proposals would only cover the deficit \nfor just a few weeks. I would be pleased to be convinced that if we \nincrease taxes, the money would be used to pay down the debt. I don't \nthink I am overly cynical, but my view of history, my review of the \nfacts suggests that every time there is more revenue--more money sent \nto Washington, DC--more money is spent. History shows money raised in \nWashington, DC, only results in more spending in Washington, DC.\n  The revenues we need to balance our books are not from increasing \ntaxes but revenues that come from a strong and growing economy. We are \nnot immune from the laws of economics that face every nation. The \nCongressional Budget Office estimates that government spending on \nhealth care entitlements, Social Security, and interest on the national \ndebt will consume 100 percent of the total revenues by 2025. What that \nmeans is that money the government spends on national defense, \ntransportation, veterans, health care, and other government programs \nwill have to be borrowed money. That drives us further and further into \ndebt.\n  So regulations, getting the deficit under control and on the right \npath toward a more balanced budget, and then, third, we must take \nserious action to address the $48 trillion in unfunded obligations \nfound in Social Security and Medicare.\n  These programs represent promises that were made to Americans and, in \nmy view, are promises that must be kept. Because of my family's \ncircumstance--my parents--I pretty much know what life is like for \npeople who utilize Social Security and Medicare and the benefits they \nprovide for their lives at that stage in life we all aspire to reach. \nWhen Social Security was signed into law by President Franklin \nRoosevelt, the average life expectancy was 64 years of age and the \nearliest retirement age to collect the benefits was 65. Today, \nAmericans live 14 years longer, retire 3 years earlier, and spend two \ndecades in retirement.\n  So we have gone from a time in which Social Security was envisioned \nto be used for a short period of one's remaining life expectancy to a \nSocial Security System that now is a source of income and support for \npeople through a couple decades of retirement. That means we have to \nchange the way we support Social Security in order to fit today's \ndemographics: more people retiring, more people living longer with \ninsufficient revenues to meet those programmed needs.\n  When this year's kindergarten class enters college, spending on \nSocial Security and Medicare, plus Medicaid and interest on the debt \nwill devour all tax revenues. Congress can and should begin today--and \nshould have started a long time ago--to address these questions \nconcerning the sustainability of these very important programs.\n  Lastly, to get our country's fiscal house back in order, Congress \nshould consider adopting many of the bipartisan recommendations put \nforth by the President's own deficit reduction commission. The cochairs \nof the Commission have warned--this is the Simpson-Bowles Commission--\nif we fail to take swift action and serious action, the United States \nfaces ``the most predictable economic crisis in history.''\n\n  In other words, we know it is coming. One would expect that people \nwho know something bad is on its way--an economic crisis is coming--\nwould take evasive action to avoid the consequences. Yet the President \nand Senate leadership have ignored the recommendations contained in the \nSimpson-Bowles report and generally continue to spend borrowed money \nwithout regard for those consequences--without regard for what we know \nis coming.\n  I don't want Americans to experience the day when our creditors \ndecide we are no longer creditworthy and we have to suffer the same \nconsequences as those countries that ignored their financial crisis. \nOne needs to look no further than places in Europe--Greece, Italy, \nSpain--to see what high levels of national debt will do to a country's \neconomy. Out-of-control spending is slowing America's economic growth\n\n[[Page S3312]]\n\nand threatening the prosperity of future generations that will have to \npay for our irresponsibility.\n  Thousands and thousands of young Americans will be graduating this \nmonth. Typically, I would guess many of my colleagues will be giving \ngraduation addresses and encouraging our graduates to go forth and \npursue a great life. We ought to also be telling ourselves that for our \ncollege graduates to go forth and pursue that wonderful life, we need \nto make changes in the way we do business and get our country's \neconomic condition and fiscal state to a place where the American dream \ncan be expected to be pursued and, in many cases, achieved.\n  I am fearful that while my parents' generation handed off a country \nwhere the expectations were high--we all felt we could live the \nAmerican dream--my generation is failing to do the same for the \ngeneration that follows ours. We must not fail to take action now and \nleave it for another Congress, another year, another session, another \nelection. If we fail to take the action we need to take today because \nwe believe it is too difficult; that we can't afford the political \nconsequences of making what some people describe as very difficult \ndecisions, we clearly will reduce the opportunity of the next \ngeneration to experience the country we know and love, and we will \ndiminish the chances they can pursue and achieve the American dream.\n  I had someone in my office recently who travels the globe, and he \nindicated to me that every place he goes, people around the world know \nwhat the phrase ``the American dream'' means, and they all want to \npursue the American dream. But the reminder was that more and more the \nAmerican dream is pursued outside of America because of the inability \nof this Congress, the failure of past Congresses and Presidents to come \ntogether and do the things that are responsible for today but, more \nimportant, responsible for the well-being of Americans in the future.\n  Not one of us was elected to ignore problems. People tell us, each \none of us, all the time of some circumstance or condition that is a \nchallenge to them. I have no doubt that each one of us in the Senate \ntries to figure out how we can help. The American people are \nexperiencing a problem. Our country faces a challenge, and we ought to \nrespond in the same way we respond individually to our own constituents \nwhen we say: How can we help? What can we do? We know the answer to \nthose questions. We just need to have the will, the courage, and the \ndesire to work together to address the issues and make certain America \nis a place we are proud to pass on to the next generation and that no \nAmerican, because of our inability to act, is unable to pursue that \nbeautiful American dream.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, may I be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I rise to speak in support of the Water \nResources Development Act. I congratulate Senator Boxer and Senator \nVitter for showing how two Senators of opposite parties can work \ntogether, which is something that is sorely needed around here. I thank \nthem for clearing the amendment Senator Blunt and I offered on \nresilient construction, to study the need to improve our infrastructure \nin order to withstand extreme weather conditions and events such as \nhurricanes.\n  The last time we passed a water bill was back in 2007. The gridlock \nthe American people are seeing so much of now is part of what has \ndelayed us passing a new water bill--and the controversy over earmarks. \nBut all of this inaction since 2007 puts our ports, beaches, and \nenvironmental restoration projects such as the Everglades restoration \nin jeopardy.\n  This water bill is going to authorize new flood protection, \nnavigation, and specific restoration projects which are so important to \nour State of Florida, such as Everglades restoration. Also this bill is \ngoing to authorize important updates to our Nation's ports. Our ports \nobviously are a main part of the economic engine of this country. All \nof these projects are now in this bill and will be able to proceed.\n  This Senate water bill means good news for Florida's beaches, \nwaterways, ports, and the Everglades. Rather than talk about the \nspecific projects, I want to say Congress made a promise 13 years ago \nto restore the Everglades and this bill puts us on the path to finally \nfulfilling that promise and restoring as much of that extraordinary \necosystem known as the Everglades as it could be in the way Mother \nNature designed it.\n  I also want to talk about another part of this bill that is extremely \nimportant to the State of Florida. People think California has the \nbiggest coastline. Not so; Florida's coastline is much larger. \nActually, Alaska's coastline is the longest, but when it comes to a \ncoastline with beaches, almost all of Florida's coastline is beaches. \nSo beach renourishment is exceptionally important to us. It is \nimportant to our economy, with all of our tourism that comes to \nFlorida. It is important to our environment. Beach restoration saves \nlives, mitigates property damage, and it keeps the recovery costs down.\n  Beach renourishment is one of the reasons I support the bill. I come \nfrom a State that has more beaches than any other State, so naturally \nour beaches are of critical importance to us. It is important not only \nfrom an environmental standpoint but also from an economic and tourism \nstandpoint.\n  There is something known as the lateral drift, which is from north to \nsouth. It takes sand off the beach and pushes it south. When we have a \ncut in the beach--such as an inlet--that goes into a port, it all the \nmore aggravates beach erosion. When the storm comes, watch out, because \nthe beach can completely disappear.\n  So I strongly oppose any efforts to cut the funding of beach \nrenourishment. This is about protecting our communities from natural \ndisasters. These investments save lives, mitigate property damage, and \nkeep recovery costs down.\n  For every $1 that is spent on shoreline protection, we see a return \nof $4. In Florida, we have several coastal communities anxiously \nwaiting for the reauthorization of beach renourishment programs because \nthey are so vulnerable to erosion caused by hurricanes and the rise of \nthe sea level. This is pretty simple for us. We have to protect coastal \ncommunities from flooding and storms by adding sand to the beach.\n  I will continue to try to prevent any kind of cut that we seek. As a \nmatter of fact, we are going to see a Coburn amendment that is going to \ntry to take money out of the beach renourishment. I will urge my \ncolleagues to vote no on that Coburn amendment.\n\n\n                           Suspicious Arrests\n\n  Before I conclude, I wish to talk about a very disturbing \ncircumstance which occurred about a week ago in the Turks and Caicos.\n  There was an arrest and jailing of two older American tourists on \nammunition charges at the Turks and Caicos Islands Airport. These two \nAmericans were arrested on back-to-back days.\n  The first person arrested was a 60-year-old businesswoman from Texas, \nand that was on April 25. The second person arrested was an 80-year-old \nretired neurosurgeon from Florida, and that was the next day. Both were \non vacation in the Turks and Caicos and arrested at the airport. The \nreason they spent days in jail is because after their luggage was \nchecked--and supposedly examined by the authorities--they found a \nsingle bullet in the luggage.\n  Does that sound suspicious? I found it to be even more suspicious \nwhen I heard that both of the American tourists--who were on vacation--\nhave said adamantly that they had no ammunition and, therefore, had no \nway of putting a bullet in their luggage.\n  It sounded even more suspicious when I was told that after they were \narrested and hauled off to jail, they had to pay $4,000 cash for bail \nin order to get out of jail and to return home.\n  The Senator from Texas, Mr. Cruz, and I sent a letter to the Charge \nd'Affaires of the U.S. Embassy in the Bahamas--which includes the Turks \nand Caicos--to ask them to investigate this\n\n[[Page S3313]]\n\nmatter. We want to know if there have been similar cases this year to \nmake American tourists a target under a similar kind of scheme. We are \nasking him to examine this so he knows we are very concerned on behalf \nof our constituents.\n  In essence, we want to know whether this was a shakedown operation or \nlegitimate. The fact that this happened on two successive days with a \nsingle bullet found in the luggage of American tourists gets to be \nawfully suspicious.\n  I ask unanimous consent that our letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                      May 9, 2013.\n     John Dinkelman, Charge d'Affaires,\n     American Embassy\n     Nassau, The Bahamas.\n       Dear Mr. Dinkelman: We are very concerned over the recent \n     arrests of two older U.S. tourists at Providenciales \n     International Airport in the Turks and Caicos Islands, both \n     on charges of carrying ammunition a single bullet.\n       These two Americans are our constituents. One of them is \n     80-year-old Horace Norrell of Sarasota, Florida, a retired \n     neurosurgeon who was forced to spend three nights in jail, \n     and then pay $4,000 cash bail to return home.\n       The other is a Texas businesswoman, Cathy Sulledge Davis, \n     who also had to post $4,000 cash bail.\n       We understand appropriate local officials have begun an \n     investigation stemming from these arrests.\n       While we do not seek to interfere in the judicial matter, \n     we ask that you convey to the proper authorities that the \n     investigation needs to be expeditious, thorough, transparent \n     and independent.\n       We also want to know whether any other Americans have been \n     arrested there on similar charges since January.\n       Your immediate attention to this matter is greatly \n     appreciated, as is keeping our offices fully apprised of any \n     developments as they occur.\n\n\n              Unanimous Consent Request--Executive Session\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, this is important. I have a unanimous \nconsent request that we have been working on for a long time.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be determined by me, in \nconsultation with Senator McConnell, the Senate proceed to executive \nsession to consider Calendar No. 92; that there be 1 hour of debate \nequally divided in the usual form; that upon the use or yielding back \nof that time, the Senate proceed to vote without intervening action or \ndebate on the nomination; that the motion to reconsider be considered \nmade and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate; that \nno further motions be in order to the nomination; that any statements \nrelated to the nomination be printed in the Record; that President \nObama be immediately notified of the Senate's action and the Senate \nthen resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, I am reserving my right to \nobject.\n  I say to the leader, through the Chair, I am on the floor, as is \nSenator Nelson, to speak to the WRDA bill and to offer two amendments. \nI ask that I be allowed to do that before we move to executive session \nso the amendments can be offered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, through the Chair to my friend from New \nMexico, I am not managing the bill. However, it is my understanding \nthat there have been objections raised to offering more amendments.\n  We could get the chair back here or somebody to manage this bill, but \nthat is where we are.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, I totally respect the \nleader and the discussion he has had with the chairman. I have tried \ntoday to contact the chairman. I have called her. I wanted to talk to \nher about this issue, and I want to get these amendments in.\n  I know Leader Reid has been encouraging us throughout this debate to \nwrap this up and try to get amendments in. So I am here to offer my \namendments, and I would like to do that.\n  Mr. REID. I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the UC? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, as you may have noticed a \nminute or so ago, I had a discussion with the leader, and he was moving \nto executive session. I have been down here--along with Senator Nelson \nand other Senators--to try to move the WRDA bill forward. Leader Reid \nsaid that was the business of the day. We are trying to move this \nforward, and we are trying to get our amendments in. I hope we can do \nthat and do it in an efficient order.\n  I am going to speak to both of my amendments. Senator Bennet is here, \nand I know he has a statement he wants to make on immigration. I ask \nthat the Presiding Officer give me notice when I am in the 5-minute \nrange so I can wrap up and get everything in at that point.\n  My message is simple on the NEPA and WRDA process. Despite what we \nhear, environmental reviews protect people, taxpayers, and the \nenvironment.\n  On average, it takes the corps just 2 to 3 years to complete a \nfeasibility study once funding is available. Studies of complex and \nhighly controversial projects may take longer, but these are exactly \nthe projects that require more indepth review.\n  The administration has warned that the streamlining provisions in S. \n601 ``may actually slow project development and do not adequately \nprotect communities, taxpayers, or the environment.''\n  The real causes of project delays are, No. 1, limited funding; No. 2, \npoor project planning that does not focus on national priorities or \nidentifying the least possible damaging solution to a water resource \nproblem.\n  Project studies take the longest when the project developers insist \non pushing outdated, damaging, and extremely costly projects instead of \nadopting low-impact modern solutions that could quickly gain broad-\nbased support.\n  I have two amendments that go to the heart of making sure we have a \ngood WRDA bill. The first is Udall amendment No. 581. Streamlining is \nan empty promise if the backlog is not addressed. The corps currently \nhas an estimated backlog of more than 1,000 authorized activities, \ncosting an estimated $60 billion to construct. WRDA 2013 will add to \nthis backlog. It authorizes more than 20 new projects and increases \ncosts by $3.4 billion over the next 5 years.\n  The plate is full. Cutting corners on environmental reviews will not \nchange that. It will just hurt communities. The plate has been full for \nover 25 years. Project authorizations far exceed the money to pay for \nthem.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, between 1986 and \n2010 Congress authorized new corps projects at a rate that \nsignificantly exceeded appropriations. In 2010 dollars, the annual rate \nof authorizations was roughly $3.0 billion and the rate of \nappropriations for new construction was roughly $1.8 billion.\n  Completing project studies is not the problem. A newly authorized \nproject will still have to wait. It has to compete for funding with \n1,000 other projects already on the books.\n  This amendment would go directly to that process and solve it.\n  Udall amendment No. 853 talks about the value of a pilot project. The \ncurrent environmental review process has been used successfully for \ndecades resulting in better and less damaging projects. It saves \ntaxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.\n  There is no evidence that the process proposed in S. 601 would \nactually speed up project planning, there is no evidence that the \nprocess will speed up project construction, and there is absolutely no \nevidence that the process would produce better projects. It is quite \nthe opposite.\n  The evidence shows that the streamlining provision will lead to more \ndamaging and more costly projects and will hurt communities, taxpayers, \nand the environment. The corps does not want Congress to enact these \nchanges. The resource agencies don't want these changes, the \nenvironmental community does not want these changes, the legal \ncommunity does not want these changes, and the public does not want \nthese changes.\n\n[[Page S3314]]\n\n  Once again, I wish the floor managers were here on this bill. I am \nhere, as Leader Reid has requested us to be, to put in amendments. As \nsoon as we get back, I want to bring up these amendments, make them \npending, and continue with this procession. I am very discouraged that \nwe can't move forward as our leader has said. This is a bill that is on \nthe floor. The managers need to be here to manage this process. I am \nhere to meet with the leaders and try to move this along.\n  Thank you.\n  I will yield to the Senator from Colorado, Mr. Bennet, but I want to \nsay one thing. He has done such great work on immigration. He has been \na marvelous Senator ever since he has been here. This Gang of 8 has \ncontributed something that is very important to this country. So I hope \neverybody listens very carefully to his words because he is giving us \nvery wise advise as to how to proceed.\n  I yield for the Senator from Colorado, Mr. Bennet.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNET. I wish to thank, through the Chair, the Senator from New \nMexico for his kind remarks and for keeping it brief today. I know it \nis an issue of great importance to him and to his State.\n  This morning the Senate Judiciary Committee began working on the \nBorder Security Economic Opportunity and Modernization Act, otherwise \nknown as a bill to fix our broken immigration system. As we are here \ntoday, they are continuing to work on that bill and I think will work \ninto the night.\n  Working with this group of 8--I call it a group of 8, not a gang, \nbecause Senator McCain doesn't like the term ``Gang of 8,'' so in \ndeference to him I call it the group of 8--has been one of the most \nrewarding experiences during my time in the Senate. My Senate \ncolleagues in this group include Senators Schumer, McCain, Durbin, \nGraham, Menendez, Rubio, and Flake. I come to the floor today first to \nthank them for their leadership and courage to move past the talking \npoints on this issue and to produce this bipartisan product the \ncommittee is now considering today.\n  This is a bill that has been applauded by editorial boards from the \nWall Street Journal to the New York Times--two editorial pages that \nseldom agree on anything. In Colorado, editorial boards from across the \nState, including the Denver Post, the Colorado Springs Gazette, and \nDurango Herald, have all praised this bill. It has the support of a \nwide-ranging and extremely diverse coalition from the left and the \nright, from business and from labor, rural and urban all across the \nUnited States.\n  All of this is to say the pieces are in place today to actually get \nsomething done in this town, in Washington, DC, and in Congress. That \nis not a small feat for a place where stalemate has become standard \noperating procedure. I would say we have a golden opportunity to rise \nabove politics as usual, to do something big and something real--\nsomething that lasts and endures. We have the chance to pass \ncommonsense, bipartisan legislation that will strengthen our economy \nand our families, better protect our borders and our communities, and \noffer a tough but fair path to citizenship for those currently here \nwithout any legal status at all. In this way we have the chance to act \ntogether to do something great for our Nation and for its future.\n  It is a cliche--uttered many times in this Chamber, including by me--\nthat America is a Nation of immigrants, and, of course, that is true. \nBut we are so used to saying and hearing that phrase we rarely take the \ntime to act or to think: What does that even mean? There is literally \nno other country in the world, on this planet, for which immigration is \nso central to its history and to its identity as the United States of \nAmerica. All of us in this Chamber--and, more importantly, every family \nback home we are privileged to represent--can tell us when and how \ntheir family came to this country. Did they come in a boat in the 17th \ncentury? Did they come by plane in the 20th century? Did they come by \nfoot or by bus, with papers or without? Every one of us has a story.\n  My family has one of its own that won't surprise my colleagues to \nknow I find pretty interesting. It is also utterly ordinary for this \ncountry. When I was in the second grade, my class was given an \nassignment. We were asked to research whose family had been in America \nthe shortest time and the longest time. So we interviewed our parents \nand grandparents, we traced our genealogies, and we came up with our \nanswer as a class. The answer was me. My family was the answer to both \nof these questions--the longest time and the shortest time.\n  My father's family came over on one of those 17th century boats. For \nnearly 400 years, the Bennets, in nearly one form or another, have \nlived in this country. Then there is my mother. She was born in Poland \nin 1928, while Nazi tanks were massing on the border. She and her \nparents endured that war in and around Warsaw. They and an aunt were \nthe only members of their family to survive. Everybody else in their \nfamily perished at the hands of the Nazis.\n  They lived in Poland for a couple of years after that, but then by \nway of Stockholm and Mexico City, my mother and her grandparents \narrived in New York City in 1950. She was 12 years old in 1950. As is \nthe case with so many children of immigrants, she was the only one in \nthe family who could speak any English at all. But the three of them \nwere alive, they were free, and they had made it to America.\n  My mother and grandparents were able to rebuild their lives and \nsucceed here because America welcomed them. It greeted them not with \nprejudice but with opportunity. They worked hard--extremely hard--to be \nworthy of that great gift. It was a gift my grandmother, Halina \nKlejman, who loved this country as deeply as anyone I have ever known, \ntaught me and my brother and my sister never to take for granted.\n  So my family's history happens to run through both Plymouth and \nPoland, but it is not so different from the ones millions of Americans \ntell. Stories such as the town of San Luis, CO. San Luis is Colorado's \noldest town, founded in 1851. The town was established by Latino \nsettlers from New Mexico who migrated under a land grant issued by the \nMexican Governor in Santa Fe. These immigrants were the pioneers of the \nColorado settlement 25 years--25 years--before Colorado officially \nbecame a State.\n  The narratives of how we come here matter because they tell us who we \nare and where we have been. But they matter just as much for where we \nare going as a Nation. The future of this country will be determined \nnot just by those of us who are in this Chamber or in this city, or \neven in this country today. It is going to be written by people who \nhave yet to step foot in the United States of America. Because over our \nhistory, it is the refugees fleeing persecution--the parents seeking \nopportunity for their children--who make America the America we love. \nThey are the ones who keep us fresh and free-thinking and free. \nThey are all of us. They are every single one of us--a nation of \nimmigrants.\n\n  Unfortunately, today's immigration policies do not reflect the \nhistory or the values that shaped it. Neither do they reflect our 21st \ncentury economic needs. Instead, our system is a hodgepodge of \noutdated, impractical, and convoluted laws. It is a mess of unintended \nconsequences that hurts our businesses and families and keeps America \nat a competitive disadvantage in an ever-shrinking world.\n  There is an old Visa slogan--I mean capital V, Visa slogan--that says \nsomething like ``Life Takes Visa.'' Well, in the United States, work \ntakes a visa--and our visa system is working against us today. It is \nstifling growth and making us less competitive. Travel around my home \nState of Colorado, as I do, and people will see what that looks like. \nPeople will meet vegetable growers in Brighton and peach farmers such \nas Bruce Talbott from Palisade who fear they will not have enough labor \nto harvest their crops season after season. They are part of Colorado's \n$40 billion agricultural industry--the lifeblood of our State and so \nvital to our Nation--yet they have no confidence--and for good reason--\nthat a legal, reliable, and competent workforce will be available for \ntheir farms and ranches.\n\n[[Page S3315]]\n\n  Fifty-seven million tourists visited Colorado in 2011. I don't know \nwhether the Presiding Officer was among them, but we would love to have \nher back. If people were to talk to our ski resort operators and \nrestaurant owners, they will hear loudly and clearly that we need a \nprogram for low-skill workers to come into this country and fill jobs \nAmericans don't want. In cities such as Denver and Boulder a person \nwill find high-skilled immigrants with graduate degrees in science and \nengineering--the kind who are 3 times more likely to file patents and \n30 percent more likely to create new businesses.\n  In fact, more than 40 percent of the 2010 Fortune 500 companies were \nfounded by immigrants and their children. Forty percent of the largest \ncompanies in the United States of America, which once were small \ncompanies and grew to become large companies, were created by \nimmigrants. These companies employ more than 3.6 million people in this \ncountry and generate more than $4.2 trillion in revenue every single \nyear.\n  You will also see thousands of foreign students with these highly \ntechnical advanced degrees who are being turned away. You will hear \nthem say they have no choice but to go back to India, go back to China, \nand use whatever they have learned at American universities to compete \ndown the line with American workers.\n  Students such as Wolfgang Pauli, a German psychology and neurocience \nPh.D. student who had attended the University of Colorado-Boulder--\nWolfgang was studying under a temporary visa sponsored by his adviser \nat the University of Colorado, but because of the inflexible nature of \nour visa system, his adviser wasn't able to keep him for an advanced \nresearch project despite his advanced skills and unique experience. The \nposition went unfilled. It is a loss for the project, for innovation, \nand for Wolfgang.\n  I have been to India. I have been to Hyderabad. I have seen people \nsitting in front of computer screens in a room with a clock on the wall \nthat said underneath it ``East Hartford, CT.'' I said to the guy who \nran the show there: Why does that clock say East Hartford, CT, on it? \nHe said: Because they are redesigning the engines for Pratt & Whitney \nin East Hartford. Two shifts a day, by the way, 24 hours a day. They \nare up when people in East Hartford, CT, are up. I asked: Where were \nthe people sitting at those computers educated? He said: Half were \neducated in my country, in India, and half were educated in your \ncountry. What we know is if they were given the opportunity to stay \nhere and contribute, to build their business, to apply their intellect \nhere, many of them would, but today we are sending them away. This is \ncrazy.\n  It doesn't end there. Go into our schools all across America, as I \ndid when I was superintendent of the Denver public schools, and you \nwill see kids, meet kids--great kids, hard-working students--enter \ntheir junior and senior years, their peers making college visits and \nconsidering careers, and you will see what it looks like when those \nstudents fully realize, in the starkest and most heart-breaking terms \nimaginable, what it means to live in a country without legal status; \nwhat it means to live in a place they got to through no fault of their \nown, without legal status.\n  Many of these young people--inspiring young people such as Octavio \nMorgan, who graduated third in his class from Bruce Randolph High \nSchool in 2011--managed to carve out a future against all odds. But I \ndon't know how we as a Nation can continue to look them in the eye and \npreach opportunity and social mobility without dealing with their legal \nstatus.\n  You will hear about dangerous border crossings. You will hear about \nseparated families and disrupted dreams. Yes, if we are being honest, \nyou will also hear about jobs that went to new neighbors, and gang \nviolence, and overcrowded schools. You will see, as we study this, and \nhear and feel a system that hardly qualifies as one. But that is the \nsystem we are living in unless we do something about it.\n  For years, even though Congress has done nothing, immigration has \nbecome a poster child for the kind of dysfunctional politics the \nAmerican people have rejected, but we keep on practicing it. We keep on \npracticing this dysfunctional set of policies. That is the way it has \nbeen in Congress. I hope it is now changing. But thankfully, for a lot \nof us who are here, that is not what we see back home--not even close.\n\n  (Mr. COONS assumed the chair.)\n  A few years ago, a small group of us in Colorado began working on a \nset of principles to begin a more pragmatic and productive immigration \ndiscussion. Utah launched a similar effort in 2010, so I would like to \nrecognize the leadership of our friends to the west for paving the way.\n  I was very pleased to take part in my State's effort, along with \nformer Senator Hank Brown--no stranger to some of the people in this \nChamber. Senator Brown, a Republican, is one of Colorado's greatest \nstatesmen, with a long record of working across the aisle to get things \ndone.\n  Over the course of 18 months, we traveled over 6,300 miles in \nColorado--which is, by the way, not a hardship; a lot of people fly \nover oceans to get there to have their vacations, but still, 6,300 \nmiles--and held about 230 meetings in the State. We talked to farmers \nand business owners, law enforcement officials and educators, faith \nleaders and Latino leaders, and all are struggling with different \nbroken pieces of our immigration system. But we found far more \nagreement on what immigration reform should mean and what it ought to \nlook like than you would ever think was possible if you listened to the \npoliticians here in Washington or the pundits on TV.\n  Together, we developed a commonsense blueprint called the Colorado \nCompact. It puts its emphasis on a strong economy and strong national \nsecurity; it cares for families while keeping our citizens safe. I am \nglad we developed these principles, and I am glad it was done in such a \nbipartisan way, in rural parts of the State as well as urban and \nsuburban parts of the State, and that we had such a broad coalition of \npeople, including my former opponent for this very seat, whom we \nassembled in support of it.\n  One of the things we all agreed on was that, as promising as efforts \nlike this are--the effort in Colorado, the effort in Utah--this issue \nneeds more than piecemeal reforms. No State's effort can be a \nsubstitute for a smart, sensible, national strategy to overhaul our \nimmigration system, and with this new Senate proposal, that is exactly \nwhat we have.\n  The bipartisan Senate bill we have introduced addresses each of the \nissues we mentioned in the compact, and it does so in a way that is \nreasonable, that is compassionate and respects the rule of law. It \nrecognizes that we must take concrete steps to further secure our \nborders.\n  We are building on steps already taken. Since 2004, the United States \nhas doubled the border patrol. We have tripled the number of \nintelligence analysts working at the border. We are seizing a higher \nvolume of contraband weapons, currency, and drugs, and net migration \nfrom Mexico is at its lowest level in decades.\n  Our bill would make substantial further investments at the border, \nincluding new fencing and technologies--motion sensors, virtual \nmonitoring systems, inexpensive surveillance, and other innovative \napproaches--that enable us to secure the border more cheaply, more \neffectively, and with a smaller footprint.\n  However, there is still more we can do. With 40 percent of illegal \nimmigration due to visa overstays, we need to ensure a better system \nfor tracking people who come to our shores, who enter and exit our \nborders, which is why our bill provides for a stronger and more \ncomprehensive entry/exit system.\n  This is a very interesting point that a lot of people do not know. \nForty percent of the 11 million people who are here who are \nundocumented entered the country lawfully on a visa. We have a system \nto check them on the way in, but we do not have a system today to check \nwhether they ever left. This is one of the ways, by the way, that the \nbill will prevent our finding ourselves back where we are today to \nbegin with.\n  We need to secure opportunity, also, for those who are already in \nthis country. Our bill provides a fair but tough pathway for many of \nthe Nation's 11 million undocumented immigrants, especially young \npeople whose parents brought them here as children, just like my mother \nwas, in search of a better life. Those here without status\n\n[[Page S3316]]\n\ntoday would be required to undergo a background check, pay a $2,000 \nfine, pay all of their back taxes. They would have to go to the back of \nthe line, which is what both parties have said for years, behind those \nwho have gone through the proper process to immigrate. That is only \nfair and it is only right.\n  This is not just a humane thing to do, but it is sound economic \npolicy. Conservative economist Doug Holtz-Eakin estimates that \nimmigration reform will generate $2.7 trillion in deficit reduction and \nhelp grow the economy. Some estimates have said this bill would grow \nthe economy by more than a percentage point of GDP. It is $1 trillion \nor so over a 10-year period. A path to citizenship would lead to higher \nwages in this country, more consumption of goods, and increased \nrevenue.\n  Our bill proposes a more coordinated effort across Federal, State, \nand local governments, in partnership with private organizations, to \nhelp new immigrants and refugees integrate into their communities. Our \nimmigration title, which was influenced by cities such as Littleton and \nGreeley, CO, would help provide immigrants with greater access to \nEnglish language classes and civics education and help us cultivate \nstronger citizens with a greater appreciation for our Nation and her \nhistory.\n  With a broken immigration system hurting our businesses and workers \nas well, we propose an efficient, sensible, and flexible visa system \nthat would be more aligned with our changing 21st-century economy.\n  As I mentioned earlier, roughly 40 percent of Fortune 500 companies \nwere founded by immigrants. We want an immigration system that \nharnesses the world's innovation and talent here in the United States \nof America.\n  There is no place where this is truer than the State of Colorado, \nwhere 1 in 10 entrepreneurs is an immigrant. Colorado has a high-tech \nsector that includes more than 10,000 companies and 150,000 workers who \nproduce almost $3 billion worth of exports each year--$3 billion worth \nof exports each year--as well as a new patent office opening soon.\n  We want the next Facebook or iPhone or clean energy technology and \nbreakthrough medical device to be built in our State or at least in \nAmerica. That is why we create a new INVEST visa for foreign \nentrepreneurs who want to start new businesses here in the United \nStates. A new category of visas proposed in our bill provides this \ninvestment opportunity. Immigrant entrepreneurs who have launched \nsuccessful startups could stay or come and continue to create jobs and \nfuel our economy if they can show they have been backed financially.\n\n  We make it easier for foreign students who graduate with advanced \ndegrees in STEM fields to get a green card--I know this has been of \ngreat interest to the Presiding Officer--and increase the number of H-\n1B visas. This will help us attract and retain highly skilled and \neducated talent to fill labor shortages in some of our fastest growing \nindustries, including bioscience and computer engineering.\n  Our bill also creates a new--this is a lot to take in, I know, Mr. \nPresident, and I hope people will have the chance to study this. This \nis why I am so glad we took the time we did to negotiate this bill with \nthe eight of us, but now it is going through the committee on which the \nPresiding Officer serves, the Judiciary Committee, to have hearings, to \nhave a markup, to have everybody have their chance to offer--I think \nwhen I last heard, there were more than 300 amendments to the bill--to \noffer those amendments and then to get it to the floor where we can \ndebate it. There is going to be time to do all this work, and this \nrequires time to understand it.\n  Our bill creates a new W visa, a program for lesser skilled workers \nto come into the country. This, in addition to several other reforms \nthat are made throughout our bill, will ensure that we can continue to \nfill our labor needs in sectors such as hospitality and our vibrant ski \nindustry, which hosts 56.5 million visitors every year.\n  There was complete agreement among Democrats and Republicans who were \nmeeting in this group that our visa system must protect American \nworkers and prevent exploitation, such as requiring efforts, first, to \nrecruit American workers. It also must be paired with a reliable, cost-\neffective employment verification system that prevents identity fraud, \nprotects our civil liberties, and is critical to stopping future \nillegal immigration.\n  That is one of the key objectives of this legislation. We do not want \nto end up right where we are today, with 11 million undocumented \npeople, and we have put the systems in place--including, very \nimportantly, this employment verification system--to deal with that. We \nhave had broad bipartisan support on this part for many years in this \nCongress, and it is now part of our legislation.\n  This all has to come with a determination to crack down on employers \nwho knowingly hire illegal workers. Simply put, if we want to reduce \nillegal immigration, we need to make legal immigration a much more \nstraightforward process in this country. That is one of the reasons I \nwas glad to take part in the agriculture negotiations around this bill \nunder the leadership of Senator Feinstein and with Senator Rubio and \nSenator Hatch. This bill alone is going to stabilize our agricultural \nworkforce for years to come and is critical to protecting and growing \nour agricultural economy, which has a $40 billion economic impact in \nColorado.\n  This bill provides a faster path to citizenship for agricultural \nworkers to be able to do the important work of producing our Nation's \nfood and fiber and, increasingly, our energy. It also creates a new \nstreamlined program for agricultural guest workers that is more usable \nfor employers while maintaining critical worker protections.\n  It is the first time we have had an ag jobs title of this bill that \nis endorsed by both the farm workers and the Farm Bureau. I thank them \nfor taking part in these negotiations and for the willingness of both \nsides to give a little up for the greater good. Their example is one we \nshould embrace as we go forward on this bill.\n  As I said earlier, I feel the same way about the bipartisan \ncolleagues who worked on this bill. In crafting this bill, we all had \nto give a little--just a little--to get a lot. Each of us had to come \nto the table with our diverse perspective, representing different \nconstituencies. We each would have written certain pieces differently \nwere we left to our own devices, but this type of compromise needs to \nhappen if you are crafting a bipartisan and complex bill to fix the \nimmigration system in a country of 300 million people.\n  Every single member of the group was committed to working together to \naccomplish that goal. In particular, I wish to again thank Senators \nSchumer and McCain especially for driving this process forward. As the \ncommittee begins its important work, I would like to acknowledge the \nwork and leadership of Chairman Leahy to see it through.\n  In the spirit of our partnership, I think it is important to remind \nourselves, on an issue where emotions can run so high and so hot, that \nall of us are trying to do right by the American people, as each one of \nus sees it.\n  Every proposed path to citizenship is not amnesty, and this proposed \npath to citizenship is not amnesty. And every opponent of these reforms \nis not anti-immigrant. We need to do more to secure our borders, but we \ndo not need to treat people trapped in a failed system as criminals.\n  These changes will be difficult. It is understandable that people \nworry about what this is going to mean for their jobs, their schools, \ntheir businesses. But if we just apply a very basic test--is it smart \nand it is right--then I am confident we can find common ground and move \nforward.\n  I would like to close with one last reflection on my own \ngrandparents' experience. On my first birthday, which was November 28, \n1965, my grandparents gave me a birthday card and sent me a gift. In \nthat card, they wrote:\n\n       The ancient Greeks gave the world the high ideals of \n     democracy in search of which your dear Mother and we came--\n\n  They wrote this in English, by the way. Remember, when they came to \nthis country, they spoke none.\n\n       The ancient Greeks gave the world the high ideals of \n     democracy in search of which your dear Mother and we came to \n     the hospitable shores of beautiful America in 1950. We have \n     been happy here ever since, beyond\n\n[[Page S3317]]\n\n     our greatest dreams and expectations, with Democracy, Freedom \n     and Love and humanity's greatest treasures.\n\n  They continued:\n\n       We hope that when you grow up, you will [have a chance to \n     help] to develop in other parts of the world a greater \n     understanding of these American values.\n\n  Democracy and freedom and love, in my grandparents' view: humanity's \ngreatest treasures, and they called them American values.\n  This is a lesson my wife Susan and I are now trying to teach our \nthree little girls. Opportunity is indeed a precious gift this country \nwill give each generation, asking only that they in turn not squander \nthat inheritance but increase it and pass it along to the next. That is \nour responsibility as we consider this piece of legislation, and for \nthat matter any other.\n  If history is any guide, someone waiting in line for a visa at this \nmoment or someone waiting to enter what my grandparents called \n``beautiful America'' will go on to become a brilliant artist or a \ntalented surgeon or a path-breaking businessperson. Someone whose \nfather picked grapes will grow up to found the next Apple. Someone \noperating a ski lift at Vail is going to be the parent or grandparent \nof a President or, God help us, of a Senator. That person will stand in \nour shoes a generation from now, and they will know whether we had the \ncourage to do what was smart and what was right and what was hard.\n  Now is not the time to pat each other on the back. We have a long way \nto go, as the Presiding Officer knows. But what we do have is some \nmomentum--I think a lot of momentum--and a balanced reasonable piece of \nlegislation. There are going to be some difficult discussions and \nchallenges ahead. There is no doubt about that. But what I know is if \nwe use the efforts and insights of the Colorado Compact as a guide, we \nwill arrive at that shared, sensible middle ground. We will pass \nlegislation that is worthy of the great hope of my grandparents and the \nfuture generations in this country.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. King.) The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Postal Reform\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I rise today to say a few words about an \nissue I think does not get enough discussion in the Senate but is of \ngreat concern to the American people in general; that is, the need for \nCongress to pass comprehensive Postal Service reform as soon as \npossible.\n  The Postal Service is of enormous importance to tens of millions of \npeople, people in rural States like Maine or Vermont, to businesses all \nover this country, not to mention the hundreds of thousands of \nemployees who serve us so well in the Postal Service.\n  About 2 years ago, the Postmaster General of the United States came \nup with a plan for the Postal Service that would have--let me just tell \nyou and the American people what it would have done. It would have \neliminated about 220,000 Postal Service jobs, including the jobs of \nmany American veterans. It would have closed about 15,000 post offices \nthroughout the country, many of them in rural areas like the State of \nVermont. It would have eliminated half of the mail processing plants in \nthis country. It would have substantially slowed down the delivery of \nmail by eliminating overnight delivery for first class mail. It would \nhave ended Saturday mail delivery.\n  Many of us in the Senate and in the House thought that plan was a \ndisaster for our country, for our economy, and for American workers. We \nall organized and fought back against that plan. The goal was to \nconvince the Postmaster General to substantially revise the ideas that \nhe had brought forth.\n  Instead of closing down 15,000 post offices, the Postal Service, in \nfact, came up with a plan to reduce the hours of service at about \n13,000 post offices throughout the country, and many in the State of \nVermont. Was I happy with that? No, to be frank with you. Was it better \nto see a reduction of 2 hours or 4 hours than seeing the entire rural \npost office shut down? It was.\n  Instead of closing down half of the mail processing plants in this \ncountry, the Postal Service decided they would keep about 100 of the \nmail sorting centers that were originally on the chopping block open. \nIn other words, they did shut down some but not nearly as many as they \nhad intended to shut down.\n  Instead of ending overnight delivery standards, the Postal Service \nhas adopted a plan to keep overnight delivery going, although not as \nstrong as it previously was. Although it took an act of Congress \nthrough the appropriations process, the Postal Service, for the time \nbeing at least, has decided to obey the law of the land and not \neliminate Saturday mail delivery.\n  Last year, the Senate passed a comprehensive postal reform bill. That \ndid not go as far as I would have liked, but it was certainly a \nsubstantial improvement over what the Postmaster General had proposed. \nWe won that vote with 62 or 63 votes. There was bipartisan support for \nit.\n  Unfortunately, the House of Representatives failed to even schedule a \nvote on the floor of the House for any postal reform bill. As a result \nnothing was signed into law last Congress, forcing us to start this \nprocess all over again.\n  What I fear the most is that all of the work the Senate did last \nCongress--and the committee of jurisdiction worked hard on it. Some of \nus put together an ad hoc committee of 15, 16 Members of the Senate who \nworked hard on that issue. But I fear very much that all of that work \nto save the Postal Service will go for naught if Congress does not get \nits act together and pass a comprehensive postal reform bill as soon as \npossible.\n  In my view the time has come to send a very loud and clear message to \nthe leadership of the House, the leadership of the Senate, the \nPostmaster General of the United States, and the President of the \nUnited States; that is, in the midst of this terrible recession which \nhas significantly impacted the middle class and working families of our \ncountry, it is imperative that we do not destroy thousands and \nthousands of decent-paying, middle-class jobs, including the jobs of \nmany veterans. That is what happens when you make the kinds of cuts the \nPostmaster General has been talking about. In the midst of this \nterrible recession, it is important that we do not harm small \nbusinesses that depend upon the Postal Service to sell their products.\n  Just yesterday I met with some businesses in the State of Vermont for \nwhom it is enormously important that they know there is a strong Postal \nService that can provide rapid delivery of the packages they produce. \nIt is terribly important that as we talk about postal reform, we \nunderstand many senior citizens depend upon the post office for their \nprescription drugs.\n  It is also important, again, for the economy, that we not slow down \nthe delivery of mail, that we do not close half of the mail processing \nplants in this country.\n  Here is the important point: There is no question that the Postal \nService has financial problems. Nobody disagrees with that. I think \nmany people do not understand the basic causes of the Postal Service's \nfinancial problems; that is, the Postal Service today is in terrible \nfinancial shape because of a congressional mandate signed into law by \nPresident Bush in December 2006, forcing the Postal Service to prefund \n75 years of future retiree health benefits over a 10-year period.\n  Let me repeat that. The Postal Service, as a result of a decision in \n2006, is forced to prefund 75 years--75 years--of future retiree health \nbenefits over a 10-year period. Clearly, no other government agency at \nthe Federal level, State level, or local level comes anywhere close to \nthat kind of onerous burden. In fact, to the best of my knowledge, no \nprivate sector corporation in this country is burdened with a mandate \nanywhere near that extreme.\n  This prefunding mandate is responsible for about 80 percent of the \nPostal Service's financial losses since 2007. Let me repeat that. You \nare going to read often, and we read often, the Postal Service is \nfacing severe financial problems. Let me repeat: This prefunding \nmandate is responsible for about 80 percent of the Postal Service's \nfinancial losses since 2007.\n\n[[Page S3318]]\n\n  Before this prefunding mandate was signed into law, the Postal \nService was making a profit. In fact, from 2003 to 2006, the Postal \nService made a combined profit of more than $9 billion. That is a \nsignificant profit.\n  I should also note that despite what we read in the media, the Postal \nService actually made a profit of $100 million during the last quarter \nsorting, processing, and delivering the mail. If we are serious about \ndealing with the financial problems facing the Postal Service, the \nfirst thing we have to do is end this prefunding mandate once and for \nall and allow the Postal Service to use the $48 billion sitting in that \nfuture retiree health fund to keep the Postal Service healthy and \nthriving for years to come.\n  When we talk about the financial problems facing the Postal Service, \nwe have to understand that to a very significant degree some 80 percent \nof the problem was caused by the Congress as a result of a decision \nmade in 2006. It is clear to me, and I think to all Americans, that we \nlive in the year 2013. The world is changing. We are becoming more and \nmore a digital economy, but it is also clear to me that the Postal \nService does not survive by cutting back on its services to the \nAmerican people and to the business community.\n  In order to save and strengthen the Postal Service, I have introduced \nthe Postal Service Protection Act, S. 316. I am very proud to say that \nbill now has 23 cosponsors.\n  Let me thank all of the Senators who are cosponsoring this bill: \nSenators Baucus, Blumenthal, Brown, Casey, Cowan, Franken, Gillibrand, \nHarkin, Heinrich, Lautenberg, Leahy, Levin, Manchin, Menendez, Merkley, \nSchatz, Stabenow, Tester, Tom Udall, Warren, and Wyden.\n  Mr. President, I would ask that Senator Cardin be added as a \ncosponsor to S. 316.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I am delighted that we are making progress on real \npostal reform not only in the Senate but in the House as well. I thank \nCongressman Peter DeFazio from Oregon for his leadership efforts in \ncosponsoring the exact same bill in the House as we have in the Senate, \nand that now has 139 cosponsors.\n  We have 24 cosponsors now in the Senate, and in the House that bill \nhas 139 cosponsors, which tells me the American people and their \nrepresentatives in Washington understand how terribly important it is \nthat we pass serious postal reform.\n  Let me very briefly talk about what is in that legislation, what the \nlegislation, if passed, would accomplish. That bill would reestablish \nstrong overnight delivery standards to ensure the timely delivery of \nmail. When people put a letter or a package in a mailbox or go to the \npost office, they want to know that letter or package is going to be \ndelivered in a timely manner, and we do that.\n  In order to make sure we do have timely mail delivery, this \nlegislation would prevent the closure of hundreds of mail processing \nplants throughout this country and save the jobs of tens of thousands \nof workers. This legislation would end, once and for all, as I just \nmentioned, the disastrous prefunding mandate that is the major problem \nfacing the Postal Service.\n  This legislation would allow the Postal Service to recoup over $50 \nbillion it has overpaid into the Civil Service Retirement System. This \nlegislation would prevent the Postal Service from ending Saturday mail \ndelivery. Further, and significantly, our bill would give the Postal \nService the tools it needs to compete in the 21st century.\n  I understand, we all understand, the world has changed. It is not \nsimply a question of finances, it is a question of giving the Postal \nService the ability to compete in today's market and to allow it to \nsell innovative new products, new services, and, as a result, raise \nmore revenue. We need a new vision for the Postal Service. This \nlegislation would provide that vision.\n  Many Americans don't notice, but right now Federal law is tying the \nhands of the Postal Service in terms of the products and services it \ncan provide. We say to the Postal Service that we are upset they are \nnot making enough revenue, and yet we tie their hands and prevent them \nfrom going forth in producing new products and services to raise the \nrevenue that would help their bottom line.\n  This legislation unties the hands of the Postal Service and would \ndevelop a process to allow the Postal Service to explore offering the \nbest products and services that would raise the most revenue.\n  Let me just give an example of some of the absurdities under which \nthe Postal Service is now operating.\n  If you were to go into a post office in Maine with a document and say \nto the clerk who is waiting on you: Listen, I need you to notarize this \nletter, the clerk would tell you: Sorry, it is against the law for me \nto notarize that letter. Now, that is pretty absurd.\n  If you were to walk into a post office, as I am sure everyday people \ndo, and say: Listen, I need you to give me 10 copies of this document \nbecause I have to send it out to 10 different people, they would say: \nSorry, it is against the law of the United States of America for me to \nmake 10 copies, 3 copies, or 1 copy of your document.\n\n  Furthermore, it is against the law for post offices to sell fishing \nor hunting licenses. Well, in my State, we are a rural State. People \nmight, in certain parts of the State or other parts of America, like to \nbe able to walk into a post office and say: Hey, how do I get a fishing \nlicense? How do I pick up a hunting license?\n  It is against the law right now. If somebody has a check that needs \nto be cashed, it is very difficult to cash that check in a post office.\n  What you see, by the way, all over America are payday lenders who are \ncharging outrageous rates to low-income people to cash a check, a \nservice I suspect the Postal Service could do to make some money and \nalso save people a whole lot of money by not having to pay these \noutrageous rates.\n  If you were to pick up a case of beer or a case of wine and you \nwanted to send it to a relative in California, it is against the law \nfor the Postal Service to deliver wine or beer. Currently, it is \nagainst the law for the United States Postal Service to engage in e-\ncommerce activities.\n  We say to the Postal Service: We want you to go out and we want you \nto be competitive. By the way, you can't do this and you can't do that. \nOn top of that, we are going to cause a massive financial problem for \nyou demanding that you prefund 75 years of retiree health care in a 10-\nyear period. Good luck. Well, that has a lot to do with why the Postal \nService is facing the serious financial problems it is today.\n  We have to give the Postal Service a lot more flexibility, and we \nhave to give them the opportunity and the ability to develop a very \ndifferent business model than it currently has. In my view, we need to \ngive the Postal Service the authority to do what other countries \nthroughout the world are doing to respond to the shift toward \nelectronic mail and away from hard copy mail. Fewer and fewer people \nare using first class mail. We understand that. They are using e-mail. \nThat is the reality and we have to respond to that.\n  Let me give a few of them, really just a few, of what other postal \nservices around the world are doing.\n  In Sweden, the post office will physically deliver e-mail \ncorrespondence to people who are not online or don't have access to a \ncomputer. Could that work here? I don't know. It is an interesting \nidea.\n  In Switzerland, people can have their physical mail received, \nscanned, and delivered into their e-mail boxes by the postal service.\n  In Germany, the post office will allow customers to communicate \nthrough secure service.\n  I think people are increasingly and legitimately concerned about who \nis going to get into their e-mail. In Germany they provide secure \nservices. Could that work here in the United States? I don't know. Is \nit worth exploring, worth looking into? I think it is.\n  The point is that the Postal Service must be given the opportunity to \ninnovate and implement an expanded business strategy for a changing \nworld. We can't keep doing the same old-same old in a world that is \nchanging.\n  For over 230 years, and enshrined in our Constitution, the Postal \nService has played an enormously important role for the people of our \ncountry and, in fact, for our entire economy. A strong Postal Service, \na Postal Service\n\n[[Page S3319]]\n\nthat delivers mail and packages in a timely manner, is extremely \nimportant for our economy.\n  That mission remains as important as it has ever been. Let's stand \ntogether and fight to save the Postal Service, not destroy it. Let's \nstand together in the midst of this recession to fight and save \nhundreds of thousands of jobs.\n  I again want to thank the 23 cosponsors on my legislation. I look \nforward to having more, but let's go forward together to save the \nPostal Service.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceed to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this afternoon we have been trying to move \nforward on the WRDA bill--the Water Resources Development Act--and \nsignificant progress has been made. One of the issues we are trying to \nwork out is an issue dealing with Senator Landrieu. She has been, more \nthan anyone else in the Senate, concerned about what happens when \nplaces flood, and she has every reason to feel this way because of what \nhappens in Louisiana with flooding. She is concerned about flood \ninsurance.\n  I have worked with Senator Boxer, Senator Boxer's staff, I have \nworked with the Republicans, and it appears to me this is something \nthat has made great progress today. The staff is going to work on this \nover the weekend. We will be here on Monday. I will file cloture in a \nfew minutes, but if, in fact, cloture doesn't need to be voted on, we \ncan always move forward without doing that. We can vitiate the cloture \nvote.\n  So I hope the good work done by Senator Landrieu, her staff, and \nother staff members here--and Senator Landrieu has been here, as she is \nnow. I don't mean this in a negative sense, but she is like a bulldog. \nWhenever she gets hold of something, it is hard to get her to loosen \nthat jaw. She has been here all afternoon working on this, so I hope \nsomething can be worked out during the next 48 hours on this matter.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  I have a cloture motion at the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The cloture motion having been \npresented under rule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the \nmotion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on S. 601, a bill to \n     provide for the conservation and development of water and \n     related resources, to authorize the Secretary of the Army to \n     construct various projects for improvements to rivers and \n     harbors of the United States, and for other purposes.\n         Harry Reid, Barbara Boxer, Tom Udall, Richard Blumenthal, \n           Max Baucus, Bill Nelson, Jeanne Shaheen, Tom Harkin, Al \n           Franken, Kirsten E.

I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum required \nunder rule XXII be waived and that the vote on the motion to invoke \ncloture on S. 601 occur at 12 noon on Tuesday, May 14.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

KIRCHNER\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today with sadness in my heart to \npay tribute to a very special individual, Gene M. Kirchner, a Baltimore \nCounty volunteer firefighter who died in the line of duty. Gene was \njust 25 and a volunteer firefighter for the Reisterstown Volunteer Fire \nDepartment. He rushed to the second floor of a house fire on April 24 \nin a vain attempt to save the resident. Gene was found unconscious and \nwas rushed to Maryland's Shock Trauma Center, but succumbed to his \ninjuries on May 2.\n  Gene joined the company's ranks when he was just 14 and served as a \njunior firefighter for 2 years before becoming a volunteer firefighter. \nHe came from a family of firefighters. His twin brother Will is also a \nfirefighter and so is his sister Shelly Brezicki. Craig Hewitt, \nassistant chief of the fire company, said that Gene ``was selfless, \nwell-liked, funny; got along with everybody. He liked helping people.''\n  Gene was laid to rest this past Sunday and the entire Baltimore \ncommunity is mourning the death of this kind, gentle young man who laid \ndown his life in an attempt to save another's life. His brother and \nsister firefighters came from as far away as New York and North \nCarolina to pay special tribute to this young man who understood the \nrisks he faced, but dedicated himself to helping ensure the safety of \nothers. Gene was posthumously awarded the Fire Department's Medal of \nHonor because he embodied what we, as a Nation, come to look for in our \nfirst responders--courage, selflessness, and dedication to duty.\n  I know my U.S. Senate colleagues will want to join me in thanking \nGene's family for giving our community such a special young man and in \nsending condolences to his family, friends, and fellow firefighters on \nthe tragic loss of such a hero.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/09/senate-section/article/S3319-3", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3319-S3320]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO MAYOR JOHN A. SPRING\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I want to take a moment today to thank a \nfriend and a remarkable public servant. John Spring ended his second \nterm as mayor of Quincy, IL, earlier this week.\n  Mayor Spring led Quincy through some of its most difficult times in \nrecent memory. Under his leadership, Quincy weathered record floods and \nthe Great Recession. Not only did Quincy survive these crises, the city \nactually came out stronger than before.\n  Any elected official would be proud of that record. It is even more \nimpressive in Mayor Spring's case because he was a political rookie. He \nhad never won public office before the people of Quincy elected him \nmayor in 2005. His only previous public service experience was a stint \nas the appointed chairman of Quincy's Police and Fire Commission.\n  For many of us, it takes a few tries before we actually win a race. \nBut John is a natural. He won his first election.\n  Quincy, IL, is a river town. It sits right on the banks of the \nMississippi River. At one point this past winter the river was so low \nthat barge traffic was in danger of being halted.\n  During Mayor Spring's final weeks in office, however, heavy rains \nswelled the river to flood stage. When flooding threatened the city's \nwater and wastewater treatment facilities, Mayor Spring and his team \nimmediately put into place emergency procedures they had honed during \nprevious floods. With leadership, hard work and a lot of sandbags, \nQuincy weathered the storm.\n  In 2008, during an earlier flood, then-Senator Barack Obama and I \nvisited Quincy to lend support. We were inspired to see how the entire \ncity came together to protect their homes and their neighbors' homes \nand businesses.\n  In 2010, Mayor Spring was able to welcome President Obama back to \nQuincy and show him how Quincy had weathered not only rainstorms, but \nthe economic storm caused by the Great Recession.\n  Mr. President, the unemployment rate today in Quincy and Adams County \nis 6.6 percent. That rate is among the lowest in the State of Illinois, \nand that is no accident. Under Mayor John Spring's leadership, Quincy \nhas continued to be the economic engine of the Tri-State area.\n  John Spring led the effort to lay a solid foundation for economic \ngrowth. He balanced the city's budget every year and didn't raise \ntaxes--not even once. In fact, Quincy reduced its property tax rate in \n7 out of Mayor Spring's 8 years in office.\n  He made tough, smart decisions that enabled Quincy to maintain \nadequate\n\n[[Page S3320]]\n\nfunding for basic services such as police, fire, and streets. He \ndownsized city government, reducing the workforce by more than 12 \npercent, implemented an early retirement program that is estimated will \nsave the City more than $5 million, and built up the City's reserve \nfunds.\n  He worked aggressively to retain and attract businesses and good \njobs, and he made transportation a top priority. Amtrak expanded \nservice between Quincy and Chicago after Mayor Spring and others \nadvocated for more downstate Illinois passenger rail. Cape Air, a \npartner of American Airlines/American Eagle, expanded its Quincy-St. \nLouis service, recently crossing the 10,000-passenger mark. Mayor \nSpring also worked with Cape Air CEO Dan Wolf and regional economic \ndevelopment leaders to open a maintenance facility at the airport, \ncreating a number of good-paying local jobs.\n  John Spring had big shoes to fill in 2005. His predecessor, Mayor \nChuck Scholz, served as Quincy's mayor for 12 years and left a record \nof success. John Spring built on that record. Chuck Scholz helped bring \nQuincy into the 21st century, and John Spring positioned Quincy even \nmore firmly to compete and win in this century's global economy.\n  I mentioned that Mayor Spring was a political rookie. He spent most \nof his career--nearly 30 years--as a teacher, counselor and coach at \nQuincy Notre Dame High School. In his final post at the school, as \ndirector of the Quincy Notre Dame Foundation, he was instrumental in \nthe survival of this Catholic high school which is so important to \nQuincy.\n  Mayor Spring has been active in many other community organizations \nand efforts, from the Salvation Army to the Abraham Lincoln \nBicentennial and exchanges with Quincy's Sister City, Herford, Germany.\n  In January 2010, John Spring called a press conference at which he \nannounced with his typical honesty and humility that he had prostate \ncancer. He recalled that when he ran for mayor he had pledged that \nserving the city of Quincy was his highest priority and he said that \nnothing, not even cancer, would keep him from serving the city he \nloved. He began a 9-week course of radiation treatments--about 15 \nminutes every weekday morning--and reported to City Hall for work after \nevery session\n  I am happy to report that John's health is good and that he more than \nlived up to his pledge of putting the people of Quincy first.\n  Quincy's nickname is Gem City. In John Spring, they have had a gem of \na mayor. I will miss working with Mayor Spring, but I know that he has \nearned a break from public service.

I thank Republic of Korea, ROK, President Park Geun-hye \nfor her thought-provoking and heartfelt address on May 8 to a joint \nmeeting of Congress. President Park is a testament to her nation's \nresilience. Like her country, she has courageously weathered \ndifficulties and emerged as a strong leader on the global stage--her \nnation's first woman President.\n  Her momentous visit to the United States came at an opportune time to \nunderscore the solidarity and cooperation between our two countries. \nOur deep ties with the Korean people stretch back to Korea's Chosun \nDynasty, when we established diplomatic relations in 1882. One hundred \nand thirty-one years later, we are expanding our relationship in new \nways.\n  This year we celebrate 60 years of the U.S.-ROK alliance, established \nin 1953 by our Mutual Defense Treaty. In Korean culture, which greatly \nrespects its elders, the 60th birthday of a person's life, called a \n``hwan-gap,'' holds great significance. It acknowledges the wisdom and \nmaturity that a person attains by the peak of a productive life.\n  And so, too, has the U.S.-Korea relationship proven fruitful and \nproductive. Our relationship is more than a military alliance; it is a \ncomprehensive partnership. Our people-to-people ties are strong; per \ncapita, South Korea sends more students to the United States to study \nthan any other industrialized country. We cooperate on counterterrorism \nefforts and on development assistance. One year ago, we demonstrated \nour commitment to strengthen our economies with the signing of our free \ntrade agreement.\n  South Koreans have created an economic ``Miracle on the Han River'' \nout of a country once leveled by war. The country has risen from being \nan aid recipient to becoming a world economic power, which now lends a \nhand to help other nations flourish.\n  The Republic of Korea had a GDP per capita of $79 in 1960; today its \nGDP per capita is over $30,000. It is one of the fastest growing \ndeveloped countries in the world. And we are proud to have played a \nrole in helping our friend climb from poverty to prosperity, in \ncontrast to its northern neighbor, whose people continue to suffer \ngreatly from poverty.\n  So there is much to celebrate during this 60th year of our alliance. \nAnd President Park has attested to the strength of the enduring global \nalliance between the Republic of Korea and the United States. This is \nan historic anniversary, not only of our friendship, but of the end of \nthe Korean war.\n  Since the end of the war, the Republic of Korea has practiced \nrestraint and mature diplomacy in the face of tremendous threats, \ncontinued bellicose rhetoric, and provocative actions from North Korea. \nThis is in no small part due to the strength of the U.S.-ROK alliance \nand our close cooperation.\n  As President Park has demonstrated in her determined but flexible \napproach, we need to preserve stability on the Korean peninsula and in \nthe region by acting decisively together to address both North Korea's \nprovocations and the dire humanitarian situation there.\n  North Korea continues to threaten U.S. interests and the security of \nour friends and allies. As chairman of the Foreign Relations \nSubcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs, I have been closely \nwatching the alarming developments following North Korea's February 12 \nnuclear test, including its declaration that it nullified the 1953 \narmistice, and its decision to shut down the Kaesong industrial \ncomplex, and its repeated threats to strike the United States and our \nallies. And I am deeply concerned about American citizen Kenneth Bae, \nwho last week was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor in a North Korea \ngulag for ``hostile acts'' against the country and Kim Jong-Un's \nregime.\n  We must do more to reach an international solution on bringing North \nKorea back into the denuclearization process. It is essential to ensure \nthe continued safety of Americans and our allies in the Asia-Pacific \nregion and to prevent a nuclear arms race in the strategically critical \nKorean peninsula.\n  And we must not forget the humanitarian crisis that is besieging the \nNorth Korean people, as they are often imprisoned, starved, and \ndeprived of civil liberties and freedoms at the hands of a ruthless \nauthoritarian state.\n  So what more can we do? This March, the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee held a hearing on North Korea which underscored the \nimportance of working with the United Nations Security Council to \nstrengthen sanctions on North Korea. The United States has intensified \ncoordination on addressing the North Korean threat with Japan and \ndeveloped a new counter-provocation plan with the Republic of Korea. In \nApril, I chaired a Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs \nhearing during which we discussed ways to work with China to help \nchange North Korea's dangerous path.\n  I was pleased to see Secretary Kerry, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, \nGeneral Dempsey, and Deputy Secretary Burns travel to China to seek \nChina's help to rein in North Korea. And I welcomed the recent visit of \nthe Chinese chairman of the six-party talks, Wu Dawei, to Washington.\n  It was encouraging to see China strongly support UN Security Council \nResolution 2094. This resolution imposes tough new financial sanctions \nwhich will block North Korea from\n\n[[Page S3321]]\n\nmoving money to pay for its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and \nmakes arms smuggling and proliferation more difficult. The sanctions \nwill only be successful if all countries rigorously implement and \nenforce them.\n  The international community, including the U.S., must sustain \nsanctions and continue systematic pressure. We hope that China will be \nsincere in implementing these sanctions and reduce its economic support \nof North Korea.\n  New sanctions alone, however, cannot halt the pattern of North Korean \nprovocations and broken promises. The United States will not reward bad \nbehavior. We must use all of the diplomatic, military, financial, and \nmultilateral tools at our disposal in a newly coordinated effort to \nmove beyond the current stalemate.\n  Along with Senators Menendez, Corker, and others, I have cosponsored \nthe North Korea Nonproliferation and Accountability Act of 2013, which \nwould direct the Department of State to undertake a comprehensive \nreview of our North Korea policy to look for creative ways to re-\nengage. If North Korea shows a serious intent to denuclearize, halt its \nproliferation activities and improve human rights, we should be open to \nbilateral talks, as Secretary Kerry stated on his April trip to the \nregion. We must continue to prepare for the worst while hoping for the \nbest. We stand by Japan, South Korea, and other allies in providing \nextended nuclear deterrence under our ``nuclear umbrella.'' And the \ninternational community stands with us in condemning North Korean \naggression and belligerent actions.\n  At the same time, we should separate humanitarian concerns from \npolitics. New ROK President Park Geun-hye has launched a policy of de-\nlinking humanitarian aid to North Korea from diplomatic developments. \nPreviously, the U.S. has done the same, funding food aid to North Korea \nfrom 2008 to 2009. We should consider reinstating such food aid to \nNorth Korea based on demonstrated need and our ability to verify that \nthe food will reach the intended recipients. Congress and the \nadministration must track the delivery of aid to make sure it reaches \nthe people who so desperately need it.\n  American development workers now provide humanitarian assistance in \nNorth Korea without U.S. Government assistance, giving North Koreans an \nopportunity to encounter the goodwill of the American people. In June \n2012, a United Nations evaluation team confirmed that over 60 percent \nof the population continues to suffer from chronic food insecurity. \nHungry people can focus only on survival and have no additional energy \nto direct toward bettering their lives or changing the environment or \nregime around them. So we must extend our hand to the North Korean \npeople by supporting the NGO community's basic humanitarian efforts to \nprovide lifesaving services such as supplemental school feeding, \nincreased agricultural production, clean water, and medical assistance \nprograms.\n  The humanitarian crisis is further compounded by gross human rights \nviolations. People are trying to cross the border in search of food and \nthen being imprisoned in forced labor camps when they are caught \nleaving the country. Reports indicate that approximately 138,000 people \nwere being held in detention centers in 2011, where they are beaten, \ntortured, and starved. These human rights violations merit \ninternational condemnation and accountability. I urge UN High \nCommissioner for Human Rights Pillay and Special Rapporteur Darusman to \nestablish a mechanism of inquiry through the UN Human Rights Council to \ndocument these egregious human rights violations expeditiously.\n  I have great concerns about North Korea's political trajectory, but I \nbelieve that a broader humanitarian engagement holds a long-term \npromise of enhancing regional peace and security. President Park Geun-\nhye has taken a similar approach. I applaud her tremendous courage and \nwelcome her visit on this historic occasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/09/senate-section/article/S3321-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3321-S3322]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     MENTAL HEALTH AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, May is Mental Health Awareness Month. The \nMental Health America organization began this campaign in 1949 in an \neffort to raise awareness of mental health conditions and mental \nwellness. Even after more than 60 years, however, we are still fighting \nagainst the stigma of mental illness and for greater access to mental \nhealth services for all Americans.\n  I would like to call particular attention to mental health issues \naffecting our Active-Duty service men and women, our veterans, and the \nimpact of these issues on thousands of military families.\n  The protracted military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq have made \nmental health disorders some of the ``signature'' wounds our military \nmembers experience upon returning from these conflicts. A comprehensive \nstudy by RAND found that approximately 18.5 percent of those returning \nfrom deployment reported symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of post-\ntraumatic stress disorder, PTSD, or depression. And up to 30 percent of \ntroops returning home from combat develop serious mental health \nproblems within 3 to 4 months. Unfortunately, due to the stigma \nassociated with seeking help and the fear of risking their careers, our \nservice men and women often do not seek the care they desperately need \nand are entitled to receive.\n  In fact, according to a recent Department of Defense, DoD, report, \nmental health disorders are the leading cause of disability among U.S. \nmilitary members. Recent studies illustrate that out of the 1.4 million \nActive-Duty servicemembers, mental health disorders are the leading \ncause of hospitalization among men and the second leading cause for \nwomen, only after pregnancy-related conditions.\n  The five most common mental disorders our military members face are \npost-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD, major depression, bipolar \ndisorder, alcohol dependence, and substance dependence. These disorders \nare likely to be chronic in nature or long-lasting in duration.\n  Since mental health issues often aren't immediately addressed on \nActive Duty, we see even higher numbers of mental illness diagnoses \namong our veterans. According to the Department of Veteran Affairs, VA, \nthe number of veterans receiving specialized mental health treatment \nfrom the VA has risen each year, from 927,052 in fiscal year 2006 to \nmore than 1.3 million in fiscal year 2012.\n  One major reason for this increase is the VA's proactive screening of \nall veterans to identify those who may have symptoms of depression, \nPTSD, or problem use of alcohol or drugs. As we anticipate a growing \nnumber of incoming veterans with this need for care, increasing \navailability of qualified mental health professionals is absolutely \nimperative.\n  I commend VA Secretary Shinseki's recent decision to hire an \nadditional 1,600 mental health staff at the VA. We know our veterans \nneed these services and we must do everything we can to provide them \nwith the care they need.\n  The invisible wounds of war are not new--they were called ``shell \nshock'' or ``combat fatigue'' after World War I and World War II, or \n``post-Vietnam syndrome'' after Vietnam. But there are unique features \nstemming from our prolonged engagement in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  First, our troops have experienced more frequent deployments of \nlonger duration while having shorter ``dwell time,'' creating a more \nstressful environment.\n  Second, we have the highest rate of survivability in history for \nserious injuries such as amputations, severe burns, and spinal cord \ndamage, leading to greater need for mental health care.\n  Third, the prevalence of traumatic brain injury, TBI, from improvised \nexplosive devices, IEDs, and other blasts have increased the number of \ncombat veterans with mild to severe diagnoses, which are linked to \nother psychological comorbidities.\n  It took the DoD and the VA too long, unfortunately, to realize that \ntheir medical care system must provide the same level of expertise, \nresources, and dedication to address the psychological wounds of war as \nthey do for physical ones.\n  Although the DoD and the VA have made progress in the past 5 years, \nthere is still a great gap between the mental health needs of our \nmilitary members and their access to quality care.\n\n[[Page S3322]]\n\n  This is an epidemic that needs to be resolved. Recent reports \nindicate that nearly 22 veterans commit suicide every day. In 2012, \nmore than 349 Active-Duty service men and women across the four \nbranches took their own lives. That is an average of 1 every 25 hours, \nthe highest suicide rate ever in the DoD.\n  It is not just about resources. In fact, having an adequate number of \nmental health professionals is just one component of ensuring access to \ncare.\n  Former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta testified in a hearing the \nSenate Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense held last year that he \nwas unsatisfied with the Pentagon's current approach to combating \nmilitary suicides and admitted that the DoD needs to review its \nprocedures for handling mental health cases. Secretary Panetta said \nthat there are still huge gaps in the way a mental health diagnosis is \ndetermined. Furthermore, Secretary Panetta acknowledged that the \ngreatest obstacle to service men and women receiving necessary mental \nhealth treatment is the stigma that continues to be associated with \nseeking help for psychological injuries.\n  Throughout Maryland, I hear from service men and women who believe \nthat seeking mental health services will hurt their military careers. \nWe must overcome these real and perceived barriers to care by changing \nthe policies that govern how we provide mental health care to our \nmilitary members. Those who are hurting in silence will seek treatment \nonly when they can truly speak freely and off the record. As more and \nmore of these individuals go untreated, we will continue to see a rise \nin suicides and other tragic incidents among our military members and \nveterans.\n  Even as we wind down our combat operations in Afghanistan over the \nnext year, I fear that we will continue to see an increasing number of \nour military members and veterans needing mental health care in the \nnear future.\n  Yet the DoD now is facing looming furloughs and unnecessary funding \ncuts, which could force the DoD to lose many of the highly valued \nmental health and behavioral professionals who were hired to help treat \nsoaring rates of PTSD. Recently, Dr. Jonathan Woodson, the Assistant \nSecretary of Defense for Health Affairs, stated his concerns over the \nDoD's long-term capability to provide mental health care to the force, \nto counter the effects of PTSD. More than one-half of the mental health \nspecialists serving the military are civilians, and they have options \nto seek employment elsewhere. I worry about sustaining this valuable \nworkforce under constant threat from sequesters.\n  Mr. President, we need to ensure that we have the personnel, \nresources, and policies in place to guarantee access to quality mental \nhealth care for our men and women in uniform, our veterans, and their \nfamilies. Active-Duty service men and women especially need access to \nsuch care without fear of being stigmatized of suffering career-\ndamaging consequences. Providing such care isn't just a good idea to \nmaintain the well-being and readiness of our troops; it is our solemn \nmoral obligation to those who have sacrificed so much for our great \nNation. It is important for us to remember that--especially during \nMental Health Awareness Month and as we approach Memorial Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/09/senate-section/article/S3322-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3322]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           REMEMBERING CHIEF MASTER SERGEANT ARDEN HASSENGER\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY.

His wife and children lived in \nuncertainty for decades, not knowing whether Arden had been killed that \nday or whether he was alive in Laos.\n  Finally, the crash site was located, and in 2010 and 2011, remains of \nthe missing men were at last recovered. Last year, they were buried \nwith full honors in Arlington National Cemetery. This Sunday, Arden's \nultimate sacrifice for our Nation will be honored once again at the \nVietnam Memorial. The cross next to his name, which signified his \nstatus as missing in action, will be changed to a diamond, representing \nthat he has returned home to rest after these many years. I hope that \nthis final act of remembrance will help to bring closure to his family \nand all who loved him.\n  We honor Chief Master Sergeant Hassenger, and we thank him and his \nfamily for the tremendous sacrifice and service they have given to our \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/09/senate-section/article/S3322-2", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3322]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             REMEMBERING LIEUTENANT COLONEL ROBERT M. BROWN\n\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a fallen airman who \ndied in military service to this country. U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. \nRobert M. Brown, of Portsmouth, VA, was lost on Nov. 7, 1972 in his F-\n111 near Quang Binh Province, North Vietnam. The remains of Lieutenant \nColonel Brown were located in North Vietnam and returned June 7, 1995. \nHe was finally identified on December 14, 2011 and accounted for on \nFebruary 25, 2012.\n  Robert Brown graduated from the US Naval Academy in the top 30 \npercent of his class and was given his choice of branch of service. He \nchose the US Air Force and trained as a pilot while adding to his \nbachelor of military science degree with an electrical engineering \ndegree from the University of Michigan. Before his first deployment he \nwas assigned to NASA and worked on the Mercury and Gemini Space \nprograms. During his first tour of duty in Southeast Asia in 1966, \nMajor Brown compiled an impressive record of 299 combat missions while \nflying the F100 Super Sabre. Upon returning to the United States, he \nwent to work in Research and Development for America's Anti-Ballistic \nMissile Systems program as a project scientist. In 1972 he returned to \nVietnam for his second tour as a highly decorated fighter pilot to fly \nthe most advanced combat aircraft of its time--the F111A Aardvark.\n  On November 7, 1972, the F111A crew, call sign ``Whaler 57'' departed \nTakhli Airbase, Thailand on a single aircraft strike mission. Its \ntarget was the Luat Son Highway ferry and ford nestled in a populated \nand forested area where the highway crossed over the river \napproximately 24 miles south of the major port city of Dong Hoi. After \nreporting that its mission was proceeding normally, radio contact was \nlost after 0400 and by 0500 a 2 week long search and rescue effort was \ncommenced.\n  Efforts to recover ``Whaler 57'' were unsuccessful, but the remains \nof Lieutenant Colonel Brown have finally been found and identified. \nLieutenant Colonel Brown is survived by his sister Gail and his \nchildren Beverly, Margie, and Bruce. Today, I ask all Members of the \nSenate to join me as we honor the life and legacy Lt. Col. Robert M. \nBrown, and the other Americans in our Armed Forces who have made the \nultimate sacrifice for their country. There are no words fitting enough \nto fully express our thanks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/09/senate-section/article/S3322-3", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3322-S3323]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     WINSTON-SALEM, NORTH CAROLINA\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to Winston-\nSalem, NC, which I proudly call home. This year marks the 100th \nanniversary of the consolidation of the towns Winston and Salem. Before \ntheir consolidation, each town had a long and prosperous history. Salem \nwas established in 1766 by members the Moravian Church. Today, Old \nSalem Museum and Garden still shows life as it was 200 years ago. It \nfeatures the iconic 12-foot tall coffee pot first erected by Julius E. \nMickey to attract customers to his tin shop in 1858 and the Moravian \nEaster Sunrise Service in God's Acres cemetery has been a yearly \ntradition since its inception in 1773. The town steadily increased in \ninfluence and commerce activity and was incorporated by the North \nCarolina General Assembly in 1857.\n  In 1849, Salem sold the land to its north to Forsyth County to serve \nas the county seat. The land was named Winston, in honor of local \nRevolutionary War hero, Joseph Winston. Ten years later the town was \nincorporated. In the 1870s the town was connected to the North Carolina \nRailroad. This gave way to many factories; Reynolds and Hanes being the \nlargest. Their healthy competition helped Winston grow remarkably over \nthe next three decades.\n\n[[Page S3323]]\n\n  The two towns worked closely together on many issues, and began to \nhave a unified identity. Winston and Salem's citizens then voted to \nconsolidate the two towns into the city of Winston-Salem. This \nofficially took effect May 9, 1913, and Oscar B. Eaton was elected the \nfirst mayor of the newly formed city. After consolidation, Winston-\nSalem was one of North Carolina's foremost cities throughout the 1920s \ndue to vastly successful R J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., Wachovia Bank and \nTrust Co., Hanes Knitting, Hanes Dye and Finishing, and Piedmont \nAirlines.\n  The Winston-Salem Arts Council was founded in 1949, and was the first \nof its kind in the Nation. It has led to the rich arts culture that \nWinston-Salem enjoys today. The University of North Carolina School of \nthe Arts was established as the first of its kind State-supported arts \ncollege in the United States. Through the years the university has \nequipped thousands of men and women developing the arts in the program \nto incorporate dance, design and production, drama, film making, and \nmusic. Today, Winston-Salem is known as ``The City of the Arts and \nInnovation.''\n  As the economy changed in the 1900s, the leaders of the city \nsuccessfully worked to make Winston-Salem prosperous in the new age by \nestablishing the Piedmont Triad Research Park, which recently became \nthe Wake Forest Innovation Quarter. This equipped the city with \ntechnological and medical jobs that has grown to be the leading of \nindustry in Winston-Salem today.\n  Winston-Salem has received many accolades for its friendly business \nenvironment, low cost of living, lively downtown district, and many \nother aspects. In Winston-Salem, May 9-12 has been set aside to \ncelebrate the 100th anniversary of their consolidation. So I join my \nfellow Winston-Salem citizens and leaders in celebration of this \nhistoric anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/09/senate-section/article/S3323-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3323]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     RECOGNIZING STEPTOE & JOHNSON\n\n Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, today I wish to highlight a West \nVirginia business on its 100th year in the Mountain State--Steptoe & \nJohnson, a renowned and nationally respected energy law firm.\n  From yesterday's humble beginnings, Steptoe & Johnson now has more \nthan 270 attorneys and a staff of 570 people, including more than 220 \nreal estate professionals, working in 14 offices in 6 states--my home \nState of West Virginia, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Texas, Ohio and \nColorado.\n  Over the past century of American history--through war and peace, \nthrough recessions and abundance, through tragedy and triumph--Steptoe \n& Johnson has persevered and prospered.\n  I wonder if Philip P. Steptoe and Colonel Louis A. Johnson looked 100 \nyears into the future when they hung out their shingle and established \ntheir law firm in Clarksburg, WV, in 1913. I wonder if they ever \ndreamed Steptoe & Johnson would grow so large or be so influential.\n  They probably did, because they began their practice in Clarksburg, a \nperfectly centralized location with a diverse economy. That decision \nalone helped introduce their company to various service-related \nindustries and public utilities.\n  Over the next century, Steptoe & Johnson would grow and expand \nnumerous times, opening six offices across West Virginia, including \nBridgeport, Charleston, Huntington, Martinsburg, Morgantown, and \nWheeling. That solid foundation helped propel them into five other \nStates.\n  Steptoe & Johnson's success story is similar to that of many of our \nNation's great entrepreneurs: two men with one vision began this \nAmerican-made story of service and perseverance. Today, more than 800 \nindividuals join together on a daily basis to carry out the company's \nvision and mission, by offering strong representation and quality \nservice to its clientele.\n  But for Steptoe & Johnson, there is no end in mind--only the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/09/senate-section/article/S3323-2", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3323]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REMEMBERING EVAN DUBE\n\n Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, Senator Ayotte and I wish to \ncommemorate the life of Evan Dube, a young man from Plaistow, NH, whose \nlife was tragically cut short on May 19, 2012. Evan's spirit touched \nthe lives of many in his community, and his legacy as a kind and loving \nfriend will not be forgotten.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, Evan, a graduate of Timberlane Regional \nHigh School in Plaistow, NH, was a beloved member of both the school's \ncommunity and the greater Plaistow community. Evan was involved in the \nschool's theatre program, competed on the Model United Nations team, \nand was a member of the National Honor Society. Upon graduating from \nTimberlane, Evan began his freshman year at Bates College in Lewiston, \nME, where he was studying classical and medieval studies. At the time \nof his passing, Evan was participating in an archaeological research \nproject in Scotland.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. While Evan earned great success in his academic \npursuits, his most profound impact was on the lives of those with whom \nhe interacted. Evan's thoughtful compassion touched the lives of \nhundreds of acquaintances, friends, and family members. This was \nevidenced in part by a ceremony held to honor Evan's life at the \nTimberlane Regional High School Performing Arts Center where nearly 900 \nindividuals honored his memory and celebrated the life that he lived \nwith extraordinary attention to the thoughts and feelings of those \naround him.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. In the wake of Evan's passing, students and faculty of \nTimberlane Regional High School gave great thought to the true meaning \nof compassion. To honor Evan's life and the many lessons he shared, \nmembers of the community have worked to incorporate Evan's values of \ncompassion and kindness into their daily lives. We would all be well \nserved by emulating such behavior.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. We express our true sorrow at the loss of such an \nadmirable, accomplished, and compassionate young man. We would also \nlike to recognize and offer our sympathies to Evan's family, including \nhis mother Eileen, his father John, and his twin brother Conor. We are \nconfident that Evan's friends and family have great pride when they \nremember the impact that his short life had on so many individuals.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. We recognize Evan Dube for his well-lived life that was \nfull of compassion, kindness and care. Those who knew Evan are \nfortunate to have had the opportunity to grow with and learn from him, \nand are certainly better off by having had their lives touched by such \nan inspirational person.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/09/senate-section/article/S3323-3", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3323-S3324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO FATHER JONATHAN\n\n Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, today I wish to honor a \nremarkable leader, Father Jonathan DeFelice, who will retire as the \nPresident of Saint Anselm College in Manchester, NH, this June.\n  Father Jonathan, as he is known to his beloved students and college \ncommunity, has devoted his adult personal and professional life to \nSaint Anselm College. He lives and works at Saint Anselm in community \nwith his fellow monks of the Order of Saint Benedict, who founded the \ncollege in 1889. Under his leadership, Saint Anselm College has become \na nationally ranked liberal arts college and model for other \ninstitutions of higher education on ways to expand civic engagement and \ncommunity service among all members of the campus community.\n  Originally a native of Bristol, RI, Father Jonathan attended \nPortsmouth Abbey School for high school and completed his undergraduate \ncareer at Saint Anselm in 1969. He joined the Order of Saint Benedict \nin 1973, and 1 later was ordained a Roman Catholic priest. Shortly \nthereafter, Father Jonathan returned to Saint Anselm, where he served \nin the administration, holding a variety of positions, including dean \nof freshman students, assistant to the academic dean and dean of \nstudents. The capstone of his years of work for his alma mater was his \nappointment as its president 24 years ago.\n  Father Jonathan believes that student development requires pursuing \nboth academics and extracurricular activities. Building on that \nphilosophy, he helped oversee the creation of the New Hampshire \nInstitute of Politics, established at Saint Anselm College to\n\n[[Page S3324]]\n\neducate citizens and encourage political and civic participation in the \nUnited States and abroad. Since its creation, the Institute has hosted \nhundreds of State and local leaders and international visitors and \nhelped many new American citizens celebrate at five naturalization \nceremonies. Every 4 years, Saint Anselm College becomes a main setting \nfor national politics when it hosts numerous activities surrounding the \npresidential primaries.\n  Father Jonathan has also made service a priority for his students. \nToday, the college's student-led Meelia Center for Student Engagement \nmanages more than 40 partnerships with New Hampshire non-profits, such \nas the Big Brother/Big Sister program. Father Jonathan built on that \nwork by founding the State version of Campus Compact, a national \ninitiative that works in cooperation with private sector partners to \nincorporate community service into college curriculum. Campus Compact \nNew Hampshire is made up of 23 college and university member \ninstitutions in the state.\n  Father Jonathan has given back to the State by serving as chair of \nboth the New Hampshire Colleges and University Council and the New \nHampshire Higher Education Commission. He was a founding member of New \nHampshire's Forum on Higher Education and, most recently, was appointed \nby Governor John Lynch to serve as director of the New England Board of \nHigher Education.\n  Throughout his tenure, Father Jonathan's commitment to higher \nlearning has been a valuable asset to New Hampshire. With community \nservice and civic engagement as cornerstones of his presidency, Father \nJonathan has created a lasting and significant connection between the \nState of New Hampshire and the Saint Anselm College community.\n  I thank Father Jonathan for his service and his commitment to \nimproving higher education in New Hampshire.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/09/senate-section/article/S3324-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO CAMERON LYLE\n\n Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the \ntremendous selflessness and compassion demonstrated by Cameron Lyle of \nPlaistow, NH. Cameron is completing his senior year at the University \nof New Hampshire, UNH, and is a 4-year member of the school's track and \nfield team. He elected to forgo his final two meets in order to donate \nbone marrow to a complete stranger who is battling acute lymphoblastic \nleukemia.\n  Cameron Lyle is a graduate of Timberlane Regional High School and a \nstandout thrower on UNH's track and field squad. He is a member of the \nNational Marrow Donor Program's Be The Match Registry, which he joined \nas a sophomore along with many of his fellow UNH athletes by completing \nthe mouth swabbing process that is the initial step in registering to \nserve as a potential bone marrow donor. Nearly 2 years later, Cameron \nreceived a call informing him that he was identified as a potential \nmatch for a 28-year-old man diagnosed with blood cancer. After \nadditional testing, it was confirmed that despite incredibly small \nodds, Cameron's marrow was a match. Without hesitation, Cameron decided \nthat he would give up participating in the final track and field meets \nof his senior year to potentially save another man's life.\n  The story of Cameron and the anonymous recipient of his bone marrow \ndemonstrate the importance of bone marrow registries such as the \nNational Marrow Donor Program's Be The Match Registry. These \norganizations can provide a critical lifeline for those individuals \nsuffering from immune system, genetic or blood disorders. In addition, \nbone marrow donor registries serve as a place where patients afflicted \nwith these terrible diseases can turn in hopes of receiving a \ntransplant. While these disorders can be fatal, bone marrow registries \ngive patients the hope of finding a lifesaving donor.\n  Cameron's decision truly demonstrates the strength of his character, \nbut perhaps most importantly, his selfless act will undoubtedly never \nbe forgotten by the man who received another chance at life. I know \nthat residents of New Hampshire are extremely proud of Cameron and \nadmire him for making such an important choice.\n  Once again, I would like to recognize and thank Cameron Lyle for \nmaking such a powerful and life changing decision for both himself and \nthe recipient of his bone marrow. I commend Cameron's family, friends \nand the UNH and Plaistow communities for the support they have shown \nhim in the weeks before and since his surgery. His story is truly \nmemorable.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/09/senate-section/article/S3324-2", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  20TH ANNIVERSARY TRIBUTE TO THE COLORADO STATE VETERANS NURSING HOME\n\n Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, today I wish to \ncelebrate the 20th anniversary of the Colorado State Veterans Home in \nWalsenburg. For 20 years, this home has provided exceptional care to \nveterans and their spouses from all over the United States.\n  Built in 1993, the Colorado State Veterans Home is southern \nColorado's newest nursing home for veterans and the only nursing home \nphysically connected to a community hospital. Residents in Walsenburg \nhave access to a Special Care Unit, which provides services for \nresidents with dementia, Alzheimer's, Huntington's and/or Parkinson's \ndiseases, and a family outpatient clinic, all on the health center's \ngrounds. Furthermore, following a major renovation funded by the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs in 2011, the veterans home now boasts \nexpanded kitchen areas, outdoor gardens and recreational space, as well \nas views of nearby mountains and lakes in every resident's room. These \nimprovements have created modern and bright living accommodations that \ntake full advantage of Colorado's natural beauty and ensure the comfort \nof our veterans.\n  With 115 residents, everyday life at the Colorado State Veterans Home \nis filled with the stories from our Nation's heroes. Rich, a veteran \nwho, with his wife, has resided at Walsenburg for 3 years, was a B-17 \ncommander flying 34 successful sorties over Germany and France during \nWWII. On his 35th sortie he and his crew went down as the result of \nenemy fire. His story makes Rich a favorite among visiting airmen, and \nit is only one among many.\n  While we will never be able to repay our heroic servicemembers for \nthe sacrifices they have made in the line of duty, it should be our top \npriority to make their lives back home as pleasant and comfortable as \npossible. The services, staff, and stunning location of the Colorado \nState Veterans Home in Walsenburg uphold our commitment to keep that \npromise to these individuals and their loved ones.\n  On behalf of a grateful nation, I thank the staff at Spanish Peaks \nRegional Health Center, the Colorado State Veterans Home, and the \nFederal employees at the VA for their commitment to serving our \nNation's heroes, and I offer them congratulations on the occasion of \nthe Colorado State Veterans Home's 20th anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/09/senate-section/article/S3324-3", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/09/senate-section/article/S3324-4", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/09/senate-section/article/S3324-5", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:29 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1406.

A bill to allow multichannel video programming distributors \nto provide video programming to subscribers on an a la carte basis, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Today I am introducing the Television Consumer Freedom \nAct of 2013. The legislation has three principal objectives:\n  One, encourage the wholesale and retail unbundling of programming by \ndistributors and programmers. Allow the consumer, the television viewer \nwho subscribes to cable, to have a la carte capability--in other words, \nnot be required to buy a whole bunch of channels that consumer may not \nwish to subscribe to--in order words, a la carte. If you want to watch \none television program, you can watch it. If you do not, you do not \nhave to. The situation today obviously is far different from that.\n  It would also establish consequences if broadcasters choose to \ndowngrade their over-the-air service.\n  Three, it eliminates the sports blackout rule for events that are \nheld in publicly financed stadiums.\n  For over 15 years, I have supported giving consumers the ability to \nbuy cable channels individually, which is known as a la carte, to \nprovide consumers more control over viewing options in their homes and, \nas a result, their monthly cable bills. The video industry--principally \ncable companies and satellite companies and the programmers that sell \nchannels, such as NBC and Disney-ABC--continues to give consumers two \noptions when buying TV programming: first, to purchase a package of \nchannels whether they watch them all or not or, second, not purchase \nany cable programming at all.\n  There are two choices: You can either buy one of their packages or \nnot watch it at all. That is unfair and wrong, especially when you \nconsider how the regulatory deck is stacked in favor of industry \nagainst the American consumer. It is clear when one looks at how cable \nprices have gone up over the last 15 years, which was brought to the \nlight by the most recent Federal Communications Commission pricing \nsurvey. In the FCC survey, the average monthly price of expanded basic \nservice--basic service--for all communities surveyed increased 5.4 \npercent over the 12 months ending January 1, 2011, or to $54.46, \ncompared to an increase of 1.6 percent in the Consumer Price Index. In \nother words, the cost of cable went up nearly four times the consumer \nprices people pay for everything else. You can only do that when you \nhave a monopoly.\n  Over the last 15 years, this rise in cost has become even more \nevident. According to the FCC, the price of expanded basic cable has \ngone up at a compound average annual growth rate of 6.1 percent during \nthe period from 1995 to 2011. This means that the average annual cable \nprice has gone up about $25 a month from 1995, to over $54 today. That \nis a 100-percent price increase. People are on fixed incomes. People \nare hurting. Why in the world should they have a 100-percent cost \nincrease? The only way it can be done is through monopolies.\n  Those that provide video directly to consumers, such as cable and \nsatellite companies, are not solely to blame for the high prices \nconsumers face today. Many articles have been written about the \npackages of channels--commonly called bundles--that are sold to cable \nand satellite companies by video programmers such as Comcast, NBC, Time \nWarner, Viacom, and the Walt Disney Company, which owns 80 percent of \nESPN.\n  The worldwide leader in sports, as ESPN calls itself, thrives because \nof the advertising revenue it is able to generate and large subscriber \nfees. According to a January 2012 Newsweek article, ESPN charges $4.69 \nper household per month, citing a research company. By comparison, the \nnext costliest national network, TNT, costs $1.16. Again, $4.69 for \nESPN and the next most expensive one is $1.16 for TNT. Whether or not \nyou watch ESPN--and I do all the time--all cable subscribers are forced \nto absorb this cost. Not every American watches ESPN. Not every \nAmerican should be forced to watch ESPN and pay $4.69 per household per \nmonth in order to have it carried into their homes when they do not \nview it. Because these channels are bundled into packages, all cable \nconsumers, whether they watch sports or not, are paying for them \nanyway.\n  Cable and satellite carriers that consider dropping ESPN must also \ncontemplate losing other channels in the bundle, such as the Disney \nChannel. Some have described this as ``a tax on every American \nhousehold.''\n  Others, like the CEO of the American Cable Association, have said:\n\n       My next-door neighbor is 74, a widow. She says to me, ``Why \n     do I have to get all that sports programming?'' She has no \n     idea that in the course of a year, for just ESPN and ESPN2, \n     she is sending a check to Disney for about $70. She would be \n     apoplectic if she knew . . . Ultimately there is going to be \n     a revolt over the cost. Or policymakers will get involved \n     because the cost of these things are so out of line with the \n     cost of living that someone's going to put up a stop sign.\n\n  Today we are putting up a stop sign. We are going to find out how \npowerful these companies are, as opposed to clearly correcting an \ninjustice that is being inflicted on the American people. This \nlegislation would eliminate regulatory barriers to a la carte by \nfreeing up multichannel video programming distributors, such as cable, \nsatellite, and others offering video services, to offer any video \nprogramming service on an a la carte basis. But if they want to keep \nbundling, they can do that too. They can make both offers to the \nAmerican subscriber.\n\n  In order to give these companies an incentive to offer programming on \nan a la carte basis, the legislation links the availability of the \ncompulsory copyright license to the voluntary offering of a la carte \nservice by the MVPD. In other words, if these companies do not offer a \nbroadcast station and any other channels owned by the broadcaster on an \na la carte basis, then that company cannot rely on the compulsory \nlicense to carry those broadcast stations. The compulsory license is a \nbenefit conferred on these corporations, so it is reasonable to ask the \nrecipients of that benefit to provide consumers with an a la carte \noption. I emphasize ``an option.''\n  To address the notion that a la carte options are being denied \ndistributors,\n\n[[Page S3330]]\n\nthe legislation conditions important regulatory benefits such as \nnetwork nonduplication, syndicated exclusivity, blackout rights, and \nretransmission consent option on the programmers, allowing MVPDs to \nsell their channels on an a la carte basis.\n  It is time that the consumers got something in return, other than a \nhigher bill at the end of the month.\n  Furthermore, because not all programmers also own broadcast stations, \nthe bill contains a provision that would create a wholesale a la carte \nmarket by allowing programmers to bundle their services in a package \nonly if they also offer these services for the MVPDs to purchase on an \nindividual channel basis. If a cable operator does not want to carry \nchannels like MTV, it would have the option of not doing so and only \nbuying and carrying the channels it thinks its consumers want to watch.\n  Finally, the bill provides that if the parties cannot agree to the \nterms of a carriage agreement, the final offer made by each side must \nbe disclosed to the FCC.\n  The second section of the bill responds to statements by broadcast \nexecutives that they may downgrade the content of their over-the-air \nsignals or pull them altogether so that the program received by MVPD \ncustomers is preferable to that available over the air. Our country is \nfacing a spectrum crunch. If broadcasters that are using the public \nairwaves in return for meeting certain public interest obligations are \ngoing to deviate from those obligations, it is my view that we should \nconsider whether that is the most efficient use of our country's \nspectrum. It would be a distortion of this basic social compact if \nover-the-air viewers were treated as second-class citizens.\n  This bill provides a legislative response if broadcasters either \ndowngrade their signal or pull it altogether. The bill provides that a \nbroadcaster will lose its spectrum allocation and that spectrum will be \nauctioned by the FCC if the broadcaster does not provide the same \ncontent over the air as it provides through MVPDs.\n  Finally, my bill touches on sports blackout rules that can limit the \nability of subscribers to see sporting events when they take place in \ntheir local community but are not broadcast on a local station. When \nthe venues in which these sporting events take place have been the \nbeneficiary of taxpayer funding, it is unconscionable to deny those \ntaxpayers who paid for it the ability to watch the games on television \nwhen they would otherwise be available. Therefore, the bill proposes to \nrepeal the sports blackout rules so far as they apply to events taking \nplace in publicly financed venues and/or involve a publicly financed \nlocal sports team.\n  In the end, this Television Consumer Freedom Act is about giving the \nconsumer more choices when watching television. It is time for us to \nhelp shift the landscape to benefit television consumers. I know the \nbroadcasters and cable companies are likely to suggest that the \ngovernment should not micromanage how they offer their product to \ncustomers and that bundling can promote diverse offerings. What those \ninterests fail to mention is that the government has already entered \nthe marketplace and conferred certain rights and privileges, such as a \ncompulsory license, network nonduplication, syndicated exclusivity, and \nretransmission consent, which stack the deck in favor of everyone but \nthe American consumer.\n  I hope the introduction of this act furthers the debate on issues \nsuch as a la carte channel selection. I look forward to the Chamber's \nconsideration of the bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COCHRAN (for himself and Mr. Wicker):\n  S. 914. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \npermit direct payment to pharmacies for certain compounded drugs that \nare prepared by the pharmacies for a specific beneficiary for use \nthrough an implanted infusion pump; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, on January 1, 2013, the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services began implementing a final rule to \nprohibit compounding pharmacies that prepare medications used in \nimplanted infusion pumps from billing Medicare directly for these \nservices. This reverses a policy that has been permissible in several \nStates for over 20 years. Since the proposed change in May 2011, I have \nworked with Senator Wicker and other Members of Congress to delay this \nchange until its effects have been fully considered.\n  During the public comment period for this rule, pharmacies, \nphysicians, and patients overwhelmingly opposed this policy change. In \nMississippi, the State board of pharmacy prohibits pharmacies from \nselling compounded pain medications to physicians, resulting in \ndecreased access to effective treatments for chronic pain disorders. \nStates across the nation are coming to realize the negative \nimplications of this policy change.\n  With this final rule, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \nhas not fully taken into account patient impact or State regulations. \nIn addition, pharmacies that bill Medicare must comply with Federal \naccreditation rules, further enhancing patient safety. We should \nprotect patient access to effective treatments rather than hinder it. \nThis bill would allow compounding pharmacies to continue to bill \nMedicare directly for their services in the interest of helping \npatients receive the quality care they deserve.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. Rubio, and Mr. Warner):\n  S. 915. A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to update \nreporting requirements for institutions of higher education and provide \nfor more accurate and complete data on student retention, graduation, \nand earnings outcomes at all levels of postsecondary enrollment; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, when my colleagues and I went to college, \nthings were a lot different. We took out loans, but those loans were \nmanageable, and there were jobs waiting after graduation. Today, too \noften, that's simply not the case. In fact, the majority of students \ntoday will leave school weighed down with more than $26,000 in debt and \nwill attempt to enter a labor market in an environment where there are \nmore unemployed Americans than there are jobs available.\n  For the first time in our Nation's history, student loan debt exceeds \ncredit card debt and now totals over $1 trillion.\n  James Garfield once said, ``Next in importance to freedom and justice \nis popular education, without which neither freedom nor justice can be \npermanently maintained.'' He was right. Investment in higher education \nis an economic imperative. Education is the great equalizer. It enables \nupward economic mobility and breaks down class structures. A highly \nskilled and educated workforce is the basis for any healthy economy. It \nis the foundation of our country's future.\n  In nearly every financial decision Americans make, individuals and \nfamilies try to evaluate the economic value of that decision. Like \nprospective homebuyers who inspect and assess the potential value of \ntheir future home, students should be able to compare colleges and \nprograms based on what the likely return on their investment will be.\n  Our capital markets work best when there is transparency so we can \naccurately measure the value of what we choose to invest in. We saw \nwhat happens when this is not the case with the burst of the housing \nbubble. Our economy is still struggling to recover from the mortgage \ncrisis. Misinformed consumers bought a product based on misleading \ninformation and, often times, fell victim to bad loans offered by \npredatory lenders.\n  Consumers must know what they can expect from their investments. \nSimilarly, students are entitled to know the value of their education \nbefore they borrow tens of thousands of dollars from banks and the \ngovernment to finance their future.\n  Right now, consumers don't have this information. It is unavailable \nto students and families who are making critical decisions that will \nimpact not only their future, both their financial future and career \npath, but also the collective future of our country. That is why today, \nSenator Rubio, Senator Warner and I are introducing an updated version \nof the Student Right to Know Before You Go Act which will help inform \nconsumers and prevent market failures.\n\n[[Page S3331]]\n\n  This proposal would ensure future students and their families can \nmake well-informed decisions by creating a market in which specific \nschools and specific programs can be evaluated based on the average \nannual earnings and employment outcomes of graduates; rates of remedial \nenrollment and success of students that participate in remedial \neducation; the percent of students that receive Federal, State, and \ninstitutional grant aid or loans; the average amount of total Federal \nloan debt of students upon graduation; the average amount of total \nFederal loan debt for students that do not complete a program; transfer \nsuccess rates; and rates at which students continue on to higher levels \nof education.\n  The Department of Education has created a College Scorecard which is \na step in the right direction. The Scorecard, however, does not fully \ncapture any of the metrics outlined above and includes no information \nto prospective students to evaluate the economic returns of their \nprogram of study. The Wyden-Rubio-Warner bill generates this critical \ninformation.\n  Markets fail when there is too little information and until now, it \nhas been impossible to ``Collect this data in a cost-effective way \nwhile ensuring student privacy.\n  This proposal makes it possible to secure a return on investment for \nstudents, parents, policy makers, and taxpayers while creating a \nworkforce that meets the demands of today's businesses and ensures that \nAmerican workers can successfully compete in the global economy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KAINE (for himself, Mr. Cochran, and Mr. Heinrich):\n  S. 916. A bill to authorize the acquisition and protection of \nnationally significant battlefields and associated sites of the \nRevolutionary War and the War of 1812 under the American Battlefield \nProtection Program; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, the battlefields on American soil contain \nour national history and commemorate the events that made our nation \nwhat it is today. Too many of these sites are open to urban development \nthat could 1eave no trace of the sacrifices made there.\n  That is why I am pleased to introduce the American Battlefield \nProtection Program Amendments Act, which reauthorizes Federal \ncompetitive matching grants to protect these historic lands. I was \nproud to have supported this program at the State level when I was \nGovernor of Virginia, and I am proud to be joined on this bipartisan \nlegislation by my colleague, Senator Thad Cochran from Mississippi. Our \nStates hosted key battles of the Civil War, and we have led the Nation \nin preserving the land on which these defining battles were fought.\n  This bill extends the authorization for the American Battlefield \nProtection Program for 5 years at the current funding level and adds \nsites of the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812 to the program's \neligibility. These grants have a 1/1 federal/non-federal match, which \nis often exceeded on the non-federal side by private contributions from \npeople interested in American history.\n  This program is strictly voluntary. The bill specifies that land will \nbe acquired only from willing sellers and only at fair market value. It \nalso authorizes funding solely for land acquisition and does not incur \ndevelopment or maintenance costs for the National Park Service.\n  It would be worth protecting these battlefields for the historic \nvalue alone, but these activities also have economic value. Battlefield \ntourists do not simply pass through a region. They pay for guided \ntours. They stay in hotels and bed and breakfasts. They dine at local \nrestaurants. They browse the shops on town streets. According to a \nstudy by the Virginia Tourism Corporation, Civil War tourists in \nVirginia stay twice as long and spend double the money of the average \ntourist. Of out-of-town visitors interviewed at 20 battlefields, two-\nthirds were visiting the area specifically to see the battlefield, and \nthree-quarters said they would visit other Civil War sites while in the \narea.\n  Virginia is a state where history is all around us, and to understand \nthis history is to understand ourselves as Americans. This effort \nbrings together federal, state, and private sector supporters to ensure \nthat future generations will be able to visit these sites and \nappreciate the historic deeds that transpired on this hallowed ground.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the junior Senator \nfrom Virginia in introducing the American Battlefield Protection \nProgram Amendments Act. I doubt there has been a more defining period \nin this country's history than the Civil War. The scars left by that \nconflict were deep and slow to heal. This year marks the 150th \nanniversary of the first major Civil War battle in the western theater \nand with Memorial Day approaching, the preservation of historic \nbattlefields reminds Americans of those who have fought and died for \nfreedom. Stressing preservation, commemoration, and education, the \nCivil War Battlefield Preservation Program, for almost 15 years, has \npartnered with neighboring communities to promote resource protection \nand heritage tourism. By bringing together local, State, and national \nstakeholders to preserve America's most historically significant Civil \nWar battlefields, the program has built a consensus to protect 19,000 \nacres of hallowed ground in 16 states. In my state, more than 3,300 \nacres of related Civil War battles have been protected. Among the many \nother battlefields that have benefited from this program are: Antietam, \nMaryland; Averasboro, North Carolina; Chancellorsville, Virginia; \nChattanooga, Tennessee; Gettysburg, Pennsylvania; Harpers Ferry, West \nVirginia; Mill Springs, Kentucky; and Prairie Grove, Arkansas. I am \npleased that this legislation will extend program eligibility to \nRevolutionary War and War of 1812 battlefields. This is an appropriate \ntime for the Congress to embrace this legislation and to preserve and \ndiscover our history, our culture and our individual stories. By \nhighlighting the history and cultural significance of these battle \nsites, we can help maintain our sense of place as Americans. With it, \nwe can be more aware of our history and reflect upon how we have become \nwho we are as individuals and who we are collectively as Americans.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na reduced rate of excise tax on beer produced domestically by certain \nqualifying producers; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, next week is American Craft Beer Week so I \nam pleased to rise today with my friend and colleague, the senior \nSenator from Maine, Senator Collins, to introduce the Small Brewer \nReinvestment & Expanding Workforce Act of 2013, otherwise known as the \nSmall BREW Act. Our esteemed former colleague, Senator Kerry, now \nSecretary of State, introduced this bill in the 112th Congress. I am \nhonored to take up the mantel.\n  The Small BREW Act of 2013 would reduce the excise tax on America's \ncraft brewers. Under current federal law, brewers producing fewer than \n2 million barrels annually pay $7 per barrel on the first 60,000 \nbarrels they brew, and $18 per barrel on every barrel thereafter, one \nbarrel = 31 gallons. The Small BREW Act would create a new excise tax \nrate structure that helps start-up and small breweries and reflects the \nevolution of the craft brewing industry. The rate for the smallest \npackaging breweries and brewpubs would be $3.50 per barrel on the first \n60,000 barrels. For production between 60,001 and 2 million barrels, \nthe rate would be $16.00 per barrel. Thereafter, the rate would be \n$18.00 per barrel. Breweries with an annual production of 6 million \nbarrels or less would qualify for these recalibrated tax rates.\n  The small brewer threshold and tax rate were established in 1976 and \nhave never been updated. Since then, the annual production of the \nlargest U.S. brewery has increased from 45 million barrels to 105 \nmillion barrels. Raising\n\n[[Page S3332]]\n\nthe ceiling that defines small breweries from 2 million barrels to 6 \nmillion barrels more accurately reflects the intent of the original \ndifferentiation between large and small brewers in the U.S. Because of \ndifferences in economies of scale, small brewers have higher costs for \nraw materials, production, packaging, and market entry compared to \nlarger, well-established multi-national competitors. Adjusting the \nexcise tax rate would provide small brewers with an additional $67 \nmillion each year they could use to start or expand their businesses on \na regional or national scale.\n  Three years ago, the Joint Committee on Taxation, JCT, scored the \nbill at roughly $33 million annually and $324 million over 10 years. A \nmore recent, March 2013, study on the costs and benefits of the House \ncompanion bill that Harvard University economist John Friedman prepared \non behalf of the Brewers Association indicates that the bill would \ndirectly reduce the excise tax revenue collected by the Federal \nGovernment by $67.0 million in 2013. But Professor Friedman notes that \nsuch a loss would be offset in large part by $49.1 million in new \npayroll and income taxes collected on the increased economic activity. \nAs craft beer prices decline, demand would rise and the Federal \nGovernment would collect an additional $1.1 million in excise taxes \nfrom the increased sales. The net yearly revenue loss, therefore, would \nbe $16.9 million in 2013. The total net revenue loss over 5 years would \nbe $95.9 million. The bill would lead to the creation of 5,230 new jobs \nin the first 12-18 months after passage and the cost of each new job in \nforegone revenue would be just $3,300.\n  While some people may think this is a bill about beer, it is really \nabout jobs. Small brewers are small business owners in communities in \neach and every State across the country. Nationally, small and \nindependent brewers employ over 108,000 full and part-time employees, \ngenerate more than $3 billion in wages and benefits, and pay more than \n$2.3 billion in business, personal and consumption taxes, according to \nthe Brewers Association. As the craft beer industry grows so, too, does \nthe demand for American-grown barley and hops and American-made \nbrewing, bottling, canning, and other equipment.\n  Maryland is home to 29 craft brewers, with at least 24 more in the \nplanning stages. According to the Brewers Association of Maryland, \nthere were 342 people employed full-time who were directly involved in \nproducing craft beer in the State last year, and another 1,420 people \nemployed full or part-time who were indirectly involved, including \nbrew-pub restaurant staff and associated employees. The brewing \nindustry accounted for $8.9 million in State excise taxes and $56.7 \nmillion in Federal excise taxes, paid some $13 million in wages, and \ngenerated nearly $95 million in economic activity.\n  Small brewers have been anchors of local communities and America's \neconomy since the start of our history. Indeed, there is a Mayflower \ndocument published in 1622 that explains why the Pilgrims landed at \nPlymouth Rock which states, ``For we could not now take time for \nfurther search or consideration: our victuals being much spent, \nespecially our beer.'' Presidents from George Washington to Barack \nObama have been homebrewers. Going back much further, the oldest extant \nrecipe is for beer. And many people would argue that our thirst for \nbeer is what drove man from being a hunter-gatherer to a crop \ncultivator since the earliest domesticated cereal grains were various \ntypes of barley better suited for beer production than making bread. \nSaint Arnulf of Metz, also known as St. Arnold, who lived from roughly \n582 to 640 AD, is known as the ``Patron Saint of Brewers'' because he \nrecognized that beer, which is boiled first, contains alcohol and is \nslightly acidic, was much safer to consume than water. French chemist \nand microbiologist Louis Pasteur, who discovered yeast and propounded \nthe germ theory that is the basis of so much of modern medicine, worked \nfor breweries for much of his career. The pH scale, the standard \nmeasurement of acidity, was developed by the head of Carlsberg \nLaboratory's Chemical Department in 1909.

Res. 138\n\n       Whereas charter schools are public schools that do not \n     charge tuition and that enroll any student who wants to \n     attend, often through a random lottery when too many students \n     want to attend a single charter school;\n       Whereas charter schools deliver high-quality public \n     education and challenge all students to reach their \n     potential;\n       Whereas charter schools promote innovation and excellence \n     in public education;\n       Whereas charter schools provide thousands of families with \n     diverse and innovative educational options for their \n     children;\n       Whereas charter schools are authorized by a designated \n     public entity and--\n       (1) respond to the needs of communities, families, and \n     students in the United States; and\n       (2) promote the principles of quality, accountability, \n     choice, and innovation;\n       Whereas, in exchange for flexibility and autonomy, charter \n     schools are held accountable by their sponsors for improving \n     student achievement and for the financial and other \n     operations of the charter schools;\n       Whereas charter schools are required to meet the student \n     achievement accountability requirements under the Elementary \n     and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.) \n     in the same manner as traditional public schools;\n       Whereas charter schools often set higher expectations for \n     students in addition to the requirements under the Elementary \n     and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.) \n     to ensure that charter schools are of high quality and are \n     truly accountable to the public;\n       Whereas 42 States and the District of Columbia have enacted \n     laws authorizing charter schools;\n       Whereas more than 6,000 charter schools are serving more \n     than 2,300,000 children;\n       Whereas, in the United States--\n       (1) in 110 school districts, more than 10 percent of public \n     school students are enrolled in charter schools;\n       (2) in 25 school districts, more than 20 percent of public \n     school students are enrolled in charter schools; and\n       (3) in 7 districts, at least 30 percent of public school \n     students are enrolled in charter schools;\n       Whereas charter schools improve the achievement of students \n     they enroll and stimulate improvement in traditional public \n     schools;\n       Whereas charter schools--\n       (1) give parents the freedom to choose public schools;\n       (2) routinely measure parental satisfaction levels; and\n       (3) must prove their ongoing success to parents, \n     policymakers, and the communities they serve;\n       Whereas an estimated 610,000 students were on waiting lists \n     to attend charter schools before the beginning of the 2011-\n     2012 academic year; and\n       Whereas the 14th annual National Charter Schools Week is \n     scheduled to be celebrated the week of May 5 through May 11, \n     2013: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) congratulates the students, parents, teachers, and \n     administrators of charter schools across the United States \n     for--\n       (A) their ongoing contributions to education;\n       (B) impressive strides made in closing the academic \n     achievement gap in schools in the United States; and\n       (C) improving and strengthening the public school system in \n     the United States;\n       (2) supports the ideals and goals of the 14th annual \n     National Charter Schools Week, a weeklong celebration to be \n     held the week of May 5 through May 11, 2013, in communities \n     throughout the United States; and\n       (3) encourages the people of the United States to hold \n     appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities during \n     National Charter Schools Week to demonstrate support for \n     charter schools.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/09/senate-section/article/S3344-2", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3344-S3345]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 858.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE IMPORTANCE OF \n                   THE DELAWARE RIVER BASIN COMMISSION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the Delaware River Basin is the longest undammed river \n     in the eastern United States, draining into portions of \n     Delaware, New York, and Pennsylvania (in this section \n     referred to as the ``4 basin States'') and providing drinking \n     water to 15 million people, including the populations of New \n     York City and Philadelphia;\n       (2) over 8,500,000,000 gallons of water are withdrawn from \n     the Delaware River Basin each day;\n       (3) in 1961, the Delaware River Basin Commission (in this \n     section referred to as the ``DRBC'') was formed to address \n     problems of drought, floods, and pollution by bringing the \n     Governors of the 4 basin States and the Federal Government \n     together to manage the water resources of the Delaware River \n     Basin by using the watershed boundary, not political \n     boundaries;\n       (4) the formation of the DRBC was approved by Congress and \n     signed into law by President John F. Kennedy and the 4 basin \n     States, marking the first time that the Federal Government \n     and a group of States joined together as equal partners in a \n     river basin planning, development, and regulatory agency;\n       (5) the DRBC serves Federal, State, and local interests by \n     providing comprehensive and proactive water resources \n     management for the 13,539 square mile Delaware River Basin \n     through programs that address water quality protection, water \n     supply allocation, flood loss reduction, drought management, \n     water conservation, permitting, watershed planning, and \n     recreation;\n       (6) the DRBC has proven to be invaluable in preventing \n     water conflict and finding effective solutions to complicated \n     and critical water resource challenges;\n       (7) after the multi year drought in the 1960s, the DRBC \n     facilitated a series of negotiations that resulted in an \n     agreement in the early 1980s to reduce water diversions to \n     upstream and downstream users, create a water conservation \n     program, and establish minimum flows to prevent saltwater \n     from reaching further up the Delaware river and degrading \n     freshwater supplies and ecosystem function;\n       (8) this agreement assisted the 4 basin States through \n     numerous droughts without major water use changes or \n     restrictions, and has conserved billions of gallons of water;\n       (9) the DRBC model of watershed management has proven to be \n     so successful that other countries are interested learning \n     from and replicating the DRBC model, and DRBC representatives \n     have been invited to share knowledge with and offer technical \n     assistance to Australia, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Sri Lanka, the \n     People's Republic of China, Indonesia, the United Kingdom, \n     South Korea, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Jordan, Portugal, \n     Sweden, Turkey, Uganda, Uruguay, India, and Japan;\n       (10) the DRBC is funded by the 5 signatory parties to the \n     Delaware River Basin Compact (Public Law 87-328; 75 Stat. \n     688), project review fees, water use charges, and fines, as \n     well as Federal, State, and private grants;\n       (11) the 100-year Delaware River Basin Compact stipulates \n     that the 5 signatory parties agree to support the annual \n     expense budget of the DRBC;\n       (12) in 1988, the 5 members of the DRBC reached a tacit \n     agreement to apportion signatory party contributions to the \n     annual expense budget of the DRBC as follows: 12.5 percent \n     for Delaware, 17.5 percent for New York, 25 percent for New \n     Jersey, 25 percent for Pennsylvania, and 20 percent for the \n     Federal Government;\n       (13) the Federal Government has provided funding to support \n     the 20 percent contribution to the annual expense budget of \n     the DRBC only 1 Federal fiscal year since 1996;\n       (14) the Federal Government is responsible for contributing \n     $715,000 to the annual expense budget of the DRBC; and\n       (15) the cumulative shortfall of the Federal Government \n     contribution to the annual expense budget of the DRBC from \n     October 1996 through the DRBC fiscal year ending on June 30, \n     2013, is $10,709,250.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the Sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) it is the responsibility of the Federal Government to \n     pay a 20 percent contribution to the annual expense budget of \n     the DRBC;\n       (2) the mission of the DRBC, as established in the Delaware \n     River Basin Compact, is critical for local communities, \n     business, and industry, States, and the region surrounding \n     the Delaware River Basin, and for Federal interests such as \n     emergency response, interstate commerce, and ecosystem \n     management; and\n       (3) the President and Congress should provide Federal \n     funding to the DRBC.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 887.

Mr. President, I wish to continue and again thank the \nmajority leader for his kind comments and assure him I am working with \nthe Republican leadership as well to try to find a way forward to \nminimize the impact on many businesses and homeowners who will be \nnegatively affected by the new requirements of the Federal flood \ninsurance program.\n  I have an amendment which has been filed. It is amendment No. 888. I \nwill be offering it for myself and Senator Vitter. Senator Schumer and \nSenator Lautenberg are also cosponsors of this amendment. Hopefully we \ncan get a vote. I do not mind trying to meet the 60-vote threshold. I \nunderstand that would be a requirement should we be able to move to a \nvote next week on this amendment.\n  We will be working very hard over the weekend to get additional \ncosponsors on the first amendment I filed, which had a multimillion-\ndollar cost to it. We had 62 people who had committed to vote. So we \nhave a strong network of Senators, Republicans and Democrats, who are \nvery supportive of the effort Senator Vitter and I are leading to try \nto mitigate some of the harshest provisions of this bill that passed \nlast year. The bill never was voted on in this Chamber. It came out of \nthe Banking Committee. A separate bill came out of the House with a \nstrong bipartisan vote. Then what happened was both bills never went to \na formal conference. It got pushed inside of a larger bill. A few \nthings did not get pushed in the correct way, at least from the \nperspective of those of us who believe that, yes, our flood insurance \nprogram should be cost-effective, should be affordable, and should not \nrun at deficit levels any longer. But there are certain ways to do that \nthat are more equitable and fair than others. So my amendment now--we \nhave worked all throughout the day. I thank Senator Crapo. Senator \nJohnson's staff has been helpful as well. We are not quite there yet, \nbut we are working on a fix to delay the implementation of some of \nthese rate increases to give our communities--this is not just for \nLouisiana. Texas is affected, Florida is affected, the east coast is \naffected. California is No. 3 in terms of policies that are related to \nflood insurance.\n  It will give us some time to give our people a little bit more \nbreathing room until we can get our levees constructed, until this new \nmapping can be put into place, as not to shock homeowners and owners of \ncommercial real estate with these very high premiums we hope to be able \nto avoid.\n  Again, it is amendment No. 888. There is no score attached to it. We \nwill accept a 60-vote threshold. I hope my colleagues will look at \nthis. I thank Senator Vitter for his leadership. It is a Landrieu-\nVitter amendment, again with Senator Schumer and Senator Lautenberg and \ntheir staffs giving us plenty of help and assistance throughout the \nday.\n  We will work on it over the weekend. Hopefully, we can come to a \nfinal resolution early next week, and then get to\n\n[[Page S3353]]\n\nthe passage of the WRDA bill which is so extremely important to people \nin Louisiana. I am very grateful for Senator Boxer's leadership. \nSenator Vitter is the ranking member. This bill came out of the EPW \nCommittee with a fairly strong bipartisan and overwhelming vote.\n  We have millions of dollars of projects that are authorized in this \nbill. We have corps reform. It is important for us to be able to build \nour levees more quickly, more efficiently, to avoid some of the \nterrible devastation that has happened.\n  It is very important to get the WRDA bill passed. I am going to ask \nany colleagues, if you can join in helping on this flood insurance \nbill, please do. I look forward to working with people over the weekend \non it.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/09/senate-section/article/S3353-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3353]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, MAY 13, 2013, AT 2 P.M.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.
