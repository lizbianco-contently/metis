Mr. President, America has and had for so many years the \nmost brilliant, innovative, and imaginative scientists in the world. \nMany of them have worked hard to develop new environmentally friendly \nenergy sources. That is one area in which we have been so good.\n  Every year over the last many years during the month of August I host \nan energy summit in Las Vegas. We have had Governors and Presidents and \nall kinds of Cabinet officers there. It is a bipartisan event. One of \nthe activities we do there is recognize some of the smartest and most \ncreative inventors and investors in the world to show their latest \ndiscoveries, and there are lots of them. This past August I learned \nabout an American company that is developing high-tech batteries. It \nhas great potential. They want to store solar power for use long after \nthe Sun goes down. I met the inventor of a flying wind turbine that \nlooks like a cross between a giant kite and a small plane.\n  On the Nevada and California border just a few miles from Las Vegas \nthere is an amazing project going on out there. They have hundreds and \nhundreds of thousands of solar panels--mirrors. They have three very \ntall towers that look like skyscrapers, and they harness the Sun. The \nreason this invention is so terrific is that one of the problems we \nfound with solar energy is that when the Sun goes down, it is not \nproducing energy anymore. This will no longer be the case because these \nlarge skyscrapers have molten salt stored in them. During the day it \nheats up, and when the Sun goes down it still produces energy. It is \namazing. That is now 98 percent completed.\n  I am constantly amazed by the ingenuity of the clean energy that \nbrings a bright spot during the darkest of economic times. But \nAmericans cannot just rely on scientists and inventors to solve our \nenergy dilemma and break our reliance on polluting fossil fuels. We \nneed to be part of the solution instead of part of the problem, and \nthat will mean reducing our energy consumption at home and at work. \nThat is what the Shaheen-Portman legislation is all about.\n  Being more efficient at home--we can start with small choices, such \nas replacing a burned out lightbulb with an energy-efficient one, \nbuying more efficient appliances, which are out there, so we can do \nthat. We can install thermostats that turn the heat or the air down \nwhen no one is home. It can be regulated remotely. The effect of these \nchoices and many more is real.\n  We also need to make the buildings we live in and work in, as well as \nthe technology inside those buildings, more efficient. What has \nhappened for generations here in America is that\n\n[[Page S6404]]\n\nyou design a building and give the specifications, but then people come \nin and build it as cheaply as they can. At the time it is constructed, \nthe construction company wants to get it done as quickly and cheaply as \npossible. As a result, the insulation is not good and the air-\nconditioning equipment and appliances are not as good as they could be. \nSo we need to make the buildings we work in, as well as the technology \ninside those buildings, more efficient.\n  Much of the electricity created in America is wasted. When I was a \nboy growing up in rural Nevada, less than a mile from our home were \nthese massive power lines coming from the Hoover Dam, extending to \nCalifornia--lots of them. We used to be amazed. We would stand under \nthem and hear the electricity popping and snapping. It went from \nBoulder City to L.A. Think of all of the electricity lost while \ntransmitting that electricity down there. So much of the electricity we \nuse in America today is wasted. Just heating and cooling our homes and \noffices with outdated technology is one way we waste so much \nelectricity. The legislation before the Senate will spur the use of \nenergy-efficient technologies. Here is what Senators Shaheen and \nPortman named the legislation: the Energy Savings and Industrial \nCompetitiveness Act. It will spur the use of energy-efficient \ntechnologies in private homes, commercial buildings, as well as in the \nindustrial sector--all at no cost to taxpayers. I commend Senators \nShaheen and Portman for their persistence and dedication in bringing \nthis bill to the floor. I thank Senator Wyden, chairman of the full \ncommittee, and Ranking Member Murkowski for their able management of \nthis measure.\n  Investing in energy efficiency is one of the fastest and most \neffective ways to grow our economy. This legislation will make our \ncountry more energy independent, protect our environment, and will also \nsave consumers and taxpayers money by lowering their energy bills.\n  It is estimated that this measure would save American families today \n$14 billion per year and will create more than 150,000 new jobs, \naccording to some of the studies surrounding this legislation. This \nbipartisan bill makes it easier for the private sector to adopt \nefficient technology.\n  By 2030--even as a young man presiding, the Senator understands how \nquickly 2030 will get here--this legislation will reduce Americans' \nCO2 emission as much as taking nearly 17 million cars off \nthe road. The bill creates incentives for companies to use technology \nthat is already available right off the shelf. It is technology that \ncan be used in every State in the Nation, and it will pay for itself \nright away through savings and energy.\n  The Federal Government also has an important role to play in saving \nenergy, and we have not done very well in the past. The Federal \nGovernment is the Nation's single largest energy consumer of \nelectricity. No one is a bigger customer for electricity in America \ntoday than the Federal Government. Reducing the government's energy use \nwill not only be good for the environment, it will save taxpayers lots \nof money.\n  I am aware that Senators wish to offer amendments. I have been told \nby Senator Shaheen that there are 18 bipartisan amendments to be \noffered. I look forward to working with them and the bill's managers to \nhelp American businesses and consumers play an active role in reducing \nour Nation's energy consumption. While some of the answers to America's \nenergy dilemma will come from inventors and researchers, others must \nbegin in the places we live and work.\n  There has been a lot of happy talk about what a great piece of \nlegislation this is--and it is. I have worked with Senator Shaheen and \nSenator Portman. They said there will be amendments and that all the \namendments are bipartisan. Of course, we have been totally diverted \nfrom what this bill is all about. Why? Because the anarchists have \ntaken over. They have taken over the House, and now they have done the \nsame in the Senate.\n  The Speaker could not pass a simple CR today. When asked at a press \nevent yesterday--as I heard reported on the news today--they said: What \nis next?\n  He said: If you have a couple of ideas, give them to me, and they \nwill be shot down also.\n  We are in a position here where people who don't believe in \ngovernment--and that is what the tea party is all about--are winning. \nThat is a shame. There has not been a single amendment allowed to be \noffered in this legislation that has anything to do with energy. There \nare all kinds of different issues, such as defunding ObamaCare.\n  As the fiscal year comes to an end, I guess that is what it is all \nabout: You do what we want and get rid of ObamaCare or we won't fund \nthe government. The President of the United States has said he is not \ngoing to negotiate dealing with the debt ceiling.\n  If the Republicans in the House can't pass a simple funding \nresolution for a short time, then it will shut down because of that. \nThe government can't fund unless we have activity here.\n  Even though I gave all the reasons why we need to do this Energy \nbill--and Senators Shaheen and Portman have been talking to me for \nmonths and months: Let's do this bill. They said there won't be \namendments on it unless they relate to energy. So here we are. Where \nare we? Where we have been this whole year. What have we accomplished? \nNot much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/12/senate-section/article/S6404-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6404]\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I did a lot of listening over the past \nseveral weeks in meetings and events all across Kentucky. Last week I \nparticipated in my 51st hospital townhall since 2011, and one thing \nkept emerging over and over: Kentuckians are really, really worried \nabout ObamaCare. They read the same stories we have about businesses \nbeing forced to cut hours and eliminate health care and about people \nbeing laid off. They read about how the rollout of this massive law is \nbecoming a massive mess and how their personal information could be \ncompromised by scam artists. I know there are some who supported the \nlaw who are thinking: Well, they will learn to like it. But it is \nprecisely the kind of ``we know what is good for you'' attitude that is \nso upsetting to my constituents. That is what got us into this mess in \nthe first place.\n  So let's at least get this much straight: The doctors, the nurses, \nthe health care professionals, the patients, and everyday Kentuckians I \nhave been speaking with on this issue are not ignorant of the facts. \nThey know what they are talking about. A lot of them know more about \nhealth care than those who voted for this law ever will.\n  The fact is that the more my constituents seem to know about \nObamaCare, the more worried they tend to be. That is true for the \nbusiness owners too. One small business owner in Murray wrote to me \nabout how she is looking at premium increases of nearly 90 percent. I \nthink she summed up the situation pretty well. She wrote:\n\n       Government is crippling the businesses that are keeping \n     this country going.\n\n  Another constituent wrote to me to say that as a matter of \nconscience, he doesn't want to let his employees go uninsured but that \nrealistically he may no longer have a choice. One of Kentucky's biggest \nemployers recently announced plans to stop providing health care to \nspouses of 15,000 of its employees--also due in part to ObamaCare.\n  This is part of a growing trend across America. These are just some \nof the human costs of this law, and it hasn't even fully come online \nyet. So it is small consolation for business owners in my State that \nthey will have a little more time to work through this mess after the \nPresident's decision to delay the so-called employer mandate for a \nyear. They get a reprieve for a year, and then the mess comes along a \nyear later.\n  Interestingly enough, just yesterday the country's largest union \nfederation, the AFL-CIO, outlined serious flaws in ObamaCare that could \nhurt its members too. Apparently, they came very close--very close--to \ncalling for outright repeal. This is the AFL-CIO that came very close \nto calling for outright repeal. News reports suggested a lot of harsh \nwords were said. I don't think I can even quote all of it on the floor.\n\n[[Page S6405]]\n\nBut one union leader implied that ObamaCare could lead to the \nfederation losing three-quarters of its membership in just the next few \nyears. This is the AFL-CIO--the biggest supporter the President had--\ncoming this close to calling for outright repeal.\n\n  So we know Big Labor is leaning on the President. We know they want \nhim to let them rewrite the same law they helped ram through, and \napparently he is listening to them.\n  But what about everybody else who is not in Big Labor? What about the \nsingle mom in Bowling Green who will not be able to cover rent if her \nhours are, in fact, cut as she anticipates they will be? What about the \nrecent college graduate in Louisville who is barely scraping by as it \nis and who will not be able to afford a premium increase? What about \nthe families from Covington to Paducah who are worried sick about this \nlaw? Doesn't the administration think those folks deserve some relief \ntoo? The same kind of delay at least businesses will get? Republicans \ndo. That is why the Republican-led House of Representatives passed a \nbill on a bipartisan basis--that means Democrats voted for it too--\nbefore the August recess to do just that. Last month I tried to pass \nthat same bill in the Senate, but the Washington Democratic leadership \nblocked it. I am not sure why.\n  This legislation is just common sense. It is the fair thing, the \nright thing to do. So today I am going to try again. Yesterday, along \nwith a number of my colleagues, I filed an amendment to the Portman-\nShaheen bill that would provide the same reprieve for individuals the \nadministration has already offered to businesses. This time I hope my \ncolleagues on the other side will join me in supporting it, as a number \nof Democrats did over in the House.\n  I know they all got an earful when they were home last month. So \nmaybe they have reconsidered the wisdom and fairness of their earlier \nposition. Maybe now they think individuals and families should be \ntreated no differently than businesses when it comes to protecting them \nfrom ObamaCare. This same legislation, as I indicated, attracted votes \nfrom both Republicans and Democrats in the House, and there is no \nreason for blocking it in the Senate.\n  We need to pass a 1-year delay--a 1-year delay--of ObamaCare for \neveryone. That is what the amendment I filed would do. Then we need to \nenact what Kentuckians and Americans truly need, a full repeal of this \njob-killing mess of a law--job-killing mess of a law; that is what it \nis--and what I intend to keep fighting for. As I said earlier, union \nmembers who pushed for this bill now are turning against it in droves, \nso are businesses and so are our constituents. I don't care what party \npeople are in, we will hear from them. So let's take this first step \ntogether. Let's delay ObamaCare mandates for families right now, just \nas the White House did for businesses, while there is still time to do \nit. Then let's work together, Democrats and Republicans, to repeal the \nlaw for good and replace it with the kind of commonsense, step-by-step \nreforms that will actually lower costs.\n  That is what Kentuckians want, that is what Americans want, and \nanybody who actually listened to their constituents last month already \nknows what I just said.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/12/senate-section/article/S6405-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6405]\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about \na new CNN poll that came out yesterday. It says support for the \nPresident's health care law appears to be ``waning.'' CNN polling \ndirector Keating Holland talks about this. He says that support has \ndropped in virtually all demographic categories, but it has fallen the \nfarthest among two core Democratic groups: women and Americans who make \nless than $50,000 a year.\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       Those are also the two groups that are most likely to pay \n     attention to health insurance issues and possibly the ones \n     most likely to be affected by any changes. That may be \n     particularly true for lower-income Americans who are most \n     likely to have part-time jobs, be on Medicaid, or not \n     currently have health insurance and thus be the first to have \n     to navigate the new system.\n\n  So there is the story from CNN polling yesterday: Support for the \nPresident's health care law appears to be waning.\n  I have spent a lot of time, as the Presiding Officer has, over the \nlast month traveling around my State, listening to constituents, \nhearing what is on people's minds. That is what I did back in Wyoming \nover the last month. I do it every weekend, meet with lots of people. \nWe have had lots of county fairs and rodeos, townhall gatherings.\n  One thing that came up just about everywhere I went was the concern \nthat so many folks still have about the President's health care law. \nSome are confused, many are upset, and many more are angry, angry that \nthe law is doing serious damage to middle-class jobs and to people's \npaychecks. Even the insurance coverage many people already had and \nliked, there are things they are going to lose.\n  Republicans have warned from the beginning that the President's law \ncreated too much redtape, too many new taxes, new fees, and expensive \nmandates. As a result, people are going to end up paying a lot for \nhealth insurance.\n  Well, for months now, Americans have been seeing exactly that. One of \nthe latest numbers that really stuck out was from Delta Air Lines. They \nsay they are going to be paying about $100 million more to cover their \nemployees next year. All of the mandates in the health care law, the \nPresident has said so many of these are free. They are not free. \nSomebody has got to pay for them. Just covering workers' children up \nuntil age 26--it is about 8,000 young people covered by Delta Air \nLines, added to their policy--is going to cost them an extra $14 \nmillion next year.\n  Remember, the President said health care costs were supposed to go \ndown, not up. He also said that for 85 to 90 percent of Americans who \nalready have health insurance, the only impact, he said, of the law was \nthat their insurance was better than it has ever been before.\n  Well, that does not seem to be the case. All you need to do is pull \nout today's New York Times business section, first page, B-1, above the \nfold, ``Unions' Misgivings on Health Law Burst Into View.'' Labor \ndelegates level criticism at Congress and the President. It seems the \nPresident's promises to people who believed him that they could keep \nwhat they had if they like it--they are now saying: Mr. President, \nsomething has to change here. You know, you have not leveled with us. \nWhat we are seeing now coming out of this administration is not what \nyou promised us.\n  It is not just the New York Times. Today's Investors Business Daily, \nabove the fold, first page, ``ObamaCare Hitting Union Members--And \nThey're Upset.'' Unionized part-timers losing health insurance; full-\ntimers losing hours. That is not what the President promised.\n  What this means is people are not just losing their health care, \ntheir insurance, it is affecting their jobs and it is affecting their \npaychecks.\n  Another step some employers have had to take is to drop coverage for \nspouses who can get their insurance elsewhere. The President said that \nwas not going to happen. He said, if you like the insurance you have, \nyou will\n\n[[Page S6406]]\n\nbe able to keep it. But once again the President has failed to see how \nmuch harm his health care law will do to middle-class Americans. Those \nhard-working people are now paying the price. In a recent memo to \nemployees, the shipping company UPS said it plans to exclude 15,000 \nspouses from its insurance plan. They cited the health care law as the \ntop reason for the switch.\n  It is not just businesses. The University of Virginia recently \nannounced plans to drop spousal coverage for some of its employees too. \nThe President is berating colleges about the cost of tuition, but yet \nhis own mandates are making it more expensive for colleges to provide \ninsurance for members of their faculty. So, of course, they pass those \ncosts on to the students. The school said the President's health care \nlaw would add $7.3 million to the cost of its health plan in 2014. So \njust like UPS, if a worker's husband or wife can get insurance from \ntheir own employer, the University of Virginia will not be covering \nthem anymore, even if it is insurance that they have and they like, the \nPresident said they could keep. The school directly laid some of the \nblame on the health care law. It is not something the President \nadmitted might happen, and it is not something he is eager to talk \nabout now.\n  He is also not eager to talk about his promise to cut the price \npeople pay for insurance. President Obama promised that by the end of \nhis first term he would lower people's premiums by $2,500 per family \nper year. He did not say this once; he said it over and over, at least \n19 times. He did not misspeak. It was a practiced line, an intentional \nline, an intentional part of his stump speech.\n  He did not say premiums would go down if Congress passes a perfect \nlaw that takes effect the first day in office. He did not tell the \naudience it would be $2,500 less than the projected rate of growth \nsomeone estimated we would have otherwise. He chose to ignore all of \nthat, to leave out every caveat he could have included. He said, $2,500 \nless by the end of his first term, period.\n  Every person, every audience, knew what the President was promising. \nWell, now we know President Obama broke that promise, like so many \nothers. He and his supporters should stop trying to explain it away and \nadmit they failed.\n  According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, the average family premium \nhas soared by almost $3,000 since the President took office. That is \nnot a prediction about what will happen over the next 4 years; it is a \nsimple, indisputable fact about how much more people are already \npaying. So you have people who are losing their insurance plans that \nthe President's health care law taxes too heavily. You have other \npeople losing the insurance they have now because employers are \ndropping coverage for spouses. You have some people who will keep their \ninsurance but they are going to have a lot less money in their paycheck \nbecause costs are going up, thanks to the health care law. You have a \nlot of people the President's health care law is really hitting in the \nwallet. It is because we are continuing to see towns and counties and \nschool districts having to cut back the hours of their workers. They \nneed to keep more employees at a part-time status in order to reduce \nthe burdens and expenses of the health care law. Over the past month, \neven more places have had to take these steps.\n  Middletown Township in New Jersey said they would cut the hours of 25 \npeople. A county in Texas said it would do the same. Another county in \nFlorida figured it would cost them more than $1 million to cover all of \ntheir part-time workers under the health care law. So they are already \nreducing the hours for some of these people and they are planning to \nmake additional cuts.\n  The Obama administration is brushing off these reports. They are \nsaying it is only anecdotal evidence. Anecdotal? These are not \nanecdotes, these are people's jobs. One of the analysts out there found \n258 different employers have cut work hours, cut jobs, or taken other \nsteps to avoid ObamaCare's costs--258 employers across the country, \nmany of them school districts, counties, communities, some private \nbusinesses, and more are coming forward every day. They are limiting \nthe hours they can pay busdrivers, librarians, coaches, substitute \nteachers, and middle-class workers. The Obama administration says, \neverything is fine because some of these workers will get a subsidy to \nhelp buy their expensive insurance.\n  Well, the people I talk to are not looking for a subsidy, they are \nlooking for a job. They are looking for more hours. They are looking \nfor the ability to take home a paycheck comparable to the paycheck they \nmay have had last year but it is going down because their hours have \nbeen cut. They want the Obama administration to stop making it so tough \nfor them to find full-time work. They want to go back to the insurance \nthey had before the President's health care law went into effect. \nInstead, they are getting more bad news, more signs that the health \ncare law is a trainwreck that is going to hurt the middle class even \nmore.\n  We all knew the health care system in this country had problems and \nneeded to be fixed. Costs were rising year after year. Too many people \nwere having trouble getting the care they needed. Democrats could have \nsat down with Republicans to write a law to help those people. Instead, \nPresident Obama and Democrats in Congress, who were in charge of the \nHouse and the Senate, passed their plan, a one-sided plan, a plan that \ntoday is failing the American people. They did it without Republican \nsupport, and they did it without seriously considering our ideas.\n  Washington Democrats promised reform, but the reform they promised is \nnot what is delivered in this 2,800-page health care law. With over \n100,000 pages of regulations, it is hard for anyone to understand or \ncomply with.\n  Republicans have voted to repeal this failed law and start over with \nreforms that solve the biggest problems families face today. We are \ngoing to keep trying to get that done. If Democrats are serious about \nhelping middle-class Americans, they will join us.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, since its inception, ObamaCare has remained \nconsistent in one regard: an alarming pattern of delays, glitches, and \noverturned provisions, not to mention failure to meet certain promises \nthat were made when this bill was passed.\n  First, Congress repealed the law's 1099 mandate after realizing this \nprovision would drastically increase expenses on every business, \ncharity, and local government entity. Then Congress repealed the law's \nlong-term care program in 2012 after the administration admitted this \nwouldn't work.\n  Next came a slough of waivers. Rather than admit ObamaCare would \ndrive up costs, the administration created a program that has granted \nmore than 1,700 waivers covering more than 4.1 million people. A lot of \nother Americans are saying: Hey, how about our waiver? Why did these \n1,700 waivers covering 4.1 million people go to them and not to us?\n  Even meeting its own deadlines for implementation seems to be too \ndifficult for the White House. According to the Congressional Research \nService, as of May 31, 2013, the administration had yet to meet half, \nonly 41 of 82, of the deadlines legally required by the Congress under \nthis legislation.\n  But in June 2013, President Obama claimed: ``I think it is important \nfor us to recognize and acknowledge this is working the way it's \nsupposed to.''\n  Really? There are 1,700 waivers for people who couldn't comply with \nthis, repeals enacted by Congress, and it is working the way it is \nsupposed to? Is that what they intended when they passed the bill? It \nis not what they promised. A month later the President's team announced \nthe delay of another key ObamaCare component, the employer mandate--a \n1-year delay--while maintaining implementation of the individual \nmandate. Individuals, yes; employers, no.\n  We know they are not able to comply, that the downside of complying \nwith this under this timetable doesn't work, so we force individuals to \ncomply with the law and the mandate to buy health insurance or pay a \ntax, but we take that burden away from employers.\n\n[[Page S6407]]\n\nIs that fair? Is that fair, to give it to part of the country, give it \nto employers? How about the other half, the employees? How about the \nother individuals who don't fall under those plans? Yesterday the \nnonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released a report of 19 \ninstances in which portions of ObamaCare had been changed, rescinded, \nrepealed, or delayed--19 separate times when it has either been \nchanged, repealed, rescinded, or delayed.\n  The report specifically found the President has signed 14 laws, \nseveral of these with multiple provisions, that each amend, rescind, or \nrepeal part of ObamaCare. The administration also has delayed at least \nfive significant provisions of the law.\n  What does all of this tell us? It tells us that even the President \nand his administration recognized the health care law they wrote and \nthey passed--not one single vote of support from the opposing party. \nThey recognize this is not going as promised or planned.\n  Recognizing the impact his health care law is having on job creators, \nthe President decided to give relief to businesses. As I said before, \ndon't all Americans deserve the same break? Don't we all deserve some \nrelief?\n  While it is a necessary step, even the delay of the employer mandate \ncame too late for many Hoosiers, whose companies have been forced to \ndrop employees or cut back their hours to less than 30 hours per week, \nthe threshold at which ObamaCare kicked in for companies.\n  In recent weeks newspapers across Indiana had been filled with \nstories of companies and school systems that have reduced hours to \navoid the ObamaCare requirements. All this is coming at a time of \ncontinued, chronic, high unemployment. People are working two and three \npart-time jobs to keep their heads above water, only to barely keep the \nbills paid at a time when our economy is growing at half the rate it \nshould.\n  We are not putting people back to work and people are actually \ndropping out of the job search category. We add this burden on them.\n  Let's take a moment and consider the contrast between these reports, \nthe promises made by those who authored and those who have supported \nand voted for it. This administration continues to say it is working as \nplanned.\n  When President Obama signed his health care reform package into law \nback in March 2010, he said the reforms would ``lower costs for \nfamilies and for businesses'' and ``help lift a decades-long drag on \nour economy.''\n  A law that was supposed to help workers, employers, and families in \nour economy is, instead, doing the exact opposite. I have heard the \nsame sentiments over and over--and I continue to hear from Hoosiers as \nI travel across the State--this law is not helping, it is hurting.\n  We need to repeal this law and replace it step by step with reforms \nthat lower costs, increase access to care, and empower patients, not \nbureaucrats in Washington.\n  I have voted more than two dozen times to repeal, defund, and strip \nprovisions from ObamaCare. It is a principle I share with all of my \ncolleagues on the Republican side, and I will continue to support these \nefforts.\n  However, I believe the best way to stave off this coming train \nwreck--as described by a Democratic Senator who was instrumental in \nwriting the bill--is to delay implementation of the ObamaCare mandates \nfor 1 year.\n  The President has already determined he is going to delay the \nemployer mandate, so let's add to that the delay of the individual \nmandate which essentially delays the implementation of this law for a \nyear so we have the opportunity to do what we need to do legislatively. \nWe need to repeal this law and replace it with sensible legislation--\nrational and cost-effective legislation--that actually addresses the \nproblem we are dealing with. It also gives the American people a chance \nto basically tell the White House: This ain't working.\n  We need to make a difference here. This can be an issue American \npeople can debate throughout 2014 while it is delayed and then express \ntheir concerns at the ballot box in November of 2014.\n\n  As a consequence of this, I have introduced legislation, supported \nnow by over 30 Senators, which would delay the individual mandate until \nJanuary 2015. I am pleased the minority leader, Senator McConnell, has \nagreed to take up this bill to lead the effort, to join me in not only \nhaving this body examine this bill, debate it, and vote on it, but to \njoin the House, which has already passed.\n  My Indiana colleague in the House, Congressman Todd Young, introduced \nthis legislation in the House of Representatives, and it passed with \nbipartisan support. Even the members of the President's own party have \nrecognized this train wreck that is coming and have chosen, in \nsignificant numbers, to support the Republican effort of my colleague \nfrom Indiana, Congressman Young.\n  I am carrying this ball here in the Senate. I am pleased the minority \nleader, as I stated, Senator McConnell, is willing to take this up. We \nalready have the support of more than 30 Senators, and I expect that \nwill grow and hopefully it will be bipartisan support.\n  The bill is identical to legislation the Republicans passed in the \nHouse. I am proud that fellow Hoosier Congressman Todd Young has \nauthored that bill.\n  If Democrats, Republicans, and a majority of the Americans agree this \nlaw is not working, then let's do something now before ObamaCare's full \nimpact on our economy takes effect.\n  I urge the majority leader to allow a vote on this amendment that \nwill be offered and give all Americans the same protection this \nadministration has provided to businesses--to give that to individual \nAmericans. After all, it is simply a matter of fairness. The \nadministration, having decided to waive for a year the implementation \nof the employer mandate, needs to waive for a year the implementation \nof the individual mandate in fairness to the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. FLAKE. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FLAKE. I come to the floor today to urge my colleagues to do \neverything we can to ensure ObamaCare is delayed. Like the Senator from \nIndiana who just spoke, we know this law is not ready for prime time. \nThe President has delayed certain parts of it, a number of parts of it.\n  The individual mandate has been delayed. If we are going to delay the \nemployer mandate, it would make sense to delay the individual mandate \nas well.\n  I have introduced S. 1490. This would delay by 1 year all provisions \nof the Affordable Care Act that are supposed to take effect on January \n1, 2014, or later.\n  In addition, it would suspend all taxes, including the tax on medical \ndevices associated with the law for 1 year.\n  I am also a cosponsor of the legislation introduced by Senator Coats. \nThe minority leader has offered this legislation as an amendment to the \nenergy efficiency legislation which is on the floor now. It would also \ndelay the individual employer mandates for 1 year.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I have opposed ObamaCare from the \nbeginning. I have voted against this legislation time and time again. I \nthink the count is 37 times in the House to repeal it. Obviously I did \nnot support it in the first place. Even the law's strong advocates \nagree there are issues with implementation under the current timeline \nand that a positive immediate next step for all Americans would be to \ndelay this harmful law.\n  January 1, 2014, marks a rollout of some of the most fundamental \nparts of the law. The CBO estimates some 37 million will join the \nindividual exchanges that are scheduled to open their enrollment period \nin less than 3 weeks from now, and all of our constituents will start \nfeeling the pain if the law isn't ready from the outset. As I \nmentioned, even the President has conceded the health care law is not \nready by issuing a combination of waivers and delays for certain parts \nof the law.\n  He did it for the employer mandate a while ago. If we do it for the \nemployer mandate, it makes sense to do it for the individual mandate as \nwell. Because of the delay of this employer mandate starting in 2014, \nmany individuals will be using the honor system to\n\n[[Page S6408]]\n\nverify their income and whether they have access to employer-provided \nhealth coverage. Without an appropriate verification system in place, \nindividuals will have an incentive to report a lower income to receive \nmore subsidies than they qualify for. This will ultimately raise the \ncost for everyone else.\n\n  On the individual exchanges, just 2 weeks ago HHS delayed the signing \nof final agreements for insurance plans that are going to be sold on \nthe exchanges starting October 1. This comes on top of a report issued \nby GAO this past June cautioning that the health care law could miss \nthe October 1 open enrollment date because of missed deadlines and \ndelays in several areas. The administration has also delayed the cap on \nout-of-pocket expenses that was intended to go into effect in 2014.\n  If this wasn't enough, there are also privacy and fraud concerns. \nThere is great apprehension over the new Federal navigators who are \nhired by the Federal Government to help individuals weed their way \nthrough the new paperwork and enrollment guidelines of the Affordable \nCare Act. These navigators receive no antifraud training, and the \nadministration recently announced the training for these individuals \nwould be reduced from 30 to 20 hours. Further, these individuals will \nhave access to consumers' private and personal data without having any \nminimum eligibility criteria or background checks.\n  I could continue to list the pitfalls this law has already faced, but \nthe point is clear: The law is simply not ready for prime time. \nImplementing this law before it is ready will only force taxpayers into \na system riddled with potential fraud, certain gridlock, and increase \ncosts for all. As lawmakers, we have a responsibility to our \nconstituents. If a law is not ready, we need to delay it for everyone. \nThat is why I urge my colleagues to support the minority leader's \namendment coming up on this legislation on the floor today and any \nother legislative vehicle to grant taxpayers a 1-year delay for the \nAffordable Care Act to ensure the least harmful path forward.\n  Simply put, I believe a total delay of ObamaCare is the fairest way \nand most realistic plan to prevent the law from wreaking havoc on all \nAmericans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I strongly support the previous two \nspeakers in their attempts to delay a law that is clearly not ready for \nprime time. In that spirit, I again put forward my proposal to make \nsure there is no Washington exemption from ObamaCare. This, I believe \nmore than anything else, will ensure that Washington doesn't impose \nsomething unduly burdensome--not ready for prime time--on America if it \nis living under the same rules.\n  Unfortunately, that is not the case right now. This special OPM rule, \nwhich was made up out of thin air, in my opinion, and unveiled in draft \nform a little over 1 month ago, creates a huge Washington exemption--a \nspecial deal--particularly for Members of Congress and our staff.\n  We need to say no Washington exemption, and my amendment on the bill \nthat is on the floor now, and my separate bill of the same substance, \nthe No Exemption for Washington from ObamaCare Act, will do just that. \nIt will say all Members of Congress, all congressional staff, the \nPresident, the Vice President, and all of their political appointees \nhave to go to the exchanges for their health care--the fallback option \nfor every American--and they have to do that under the same rules, \nunder the same parameters as every other American does--no special \ndeal, no special exemption, no special subsidy.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this measure as an amendment on the \nbill that is on the floor now or as a freestanding bill.\n  With regard to the posture of the bill on the floor now, I have no \ndesire to hold up any other amendments. I am eager to move forward with \nthose amendments and with mine. I simply need assurance that my \namendment will get a fair vote, particularly before October 1. This is \nvery time sensitive because October 1 is when the OPM rule will \notherwise take effect. I am eager to come to an agreement so all of us \ncan move forward with this proposal and this vote and others in a \nconstructive way, and I look forward to that happening.\n  I would add this doesn't have to happen on this bill. This can happen \nregarding my stand-alone bill or in other ways, as long as that is \nassured before October 1.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/12/senate-section/article/S6408-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6408]\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of S. 1392, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1392) to promote energy savings in residential \n     buildings and industry, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Wyden (for Merkley) amendment No. 1858, to provide for a \n     study and report on standby usage power standards implemented \n     by States and other industrialized nations.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, when the Senate began debate on the \nbipartisan energy efficiency bill yesterday, I thought it was important \nto start by putting the discussion in the context of what I know \nSenators heard all summer long. All summer long Senators heard from \nfolks at home who said: Look, when the Senate goes back into session in \nSeptember, what you folks have to do is knock off some of this \nbickering, this pettiness, which seems like a kind of glorified food \nfight, and get serious about real issues, get serious about those kinds \nof concerns that are most important to us here at home--energy, \ncreating good-paying jobs, the infrastructure, and all of those bread-\nand-butter questions that go right to the heart of how middle-class \npeople in America improve their standard of living.\n  I was struck yesterday--and I especially appreciate the tone brought \nto this discussion by the Senator from New Hampshire and the Senator \nfrom Ohio--by how the Senate reflected and got, in those first few \nhours of the debate, the message from the summer. It seemed this body \nheard the American people saying: Knock off this pettiness and this \nbickering and get serious about real issues, and that means doing it in \na bipartisan way. In the first couple hours of this discussion, we had \nfive amendments that were bipartisan, and all of them stemmed, in \neffect, from Senators on both sides of the aisle who were responding to \nthis kind of welling up of the benefits of energy savings and how those \nenergy savings help to create good-paying jobs and a cleaner \nenvironment.\n  For the first couple hours, we had Senator after Senator coming in \nthese bipartisan kind of pairs to discuss real issues. So I am just \ngoing to spend a few minutes talking about how that unfolded.\n  The first one that came up was the Inhofe-Carper amendment. Those two \nmight not agree on every possible cause but certainly they said: Look, \nwe ought to include thermal energy in the definition of renewable \nenergy as part of the Federal energy purchases that take place. That \nprobably is too logical for some--and certainly if you want to spend \nyour time on polarizing fights you might not be that interested in the \nInhofe-Carper amendment--but I said I was going to back that because \ntwo Senators did a lot of good, constructive work and they came to us \nearly on with a good idea.\n  Then we heard from Senator Collins and Senator Udall about another \npractical idea to reduce redtape--to reduce bureaucracy and redtape--so \nwe could maximize energy efficiency programs in our schools.\n  We also heard about a useful amendment from Senators Bennet and\n\n[[Page S6409]]\n\nAyotte in terms of recognizing the efficiency achievements of \ncommercial building tenants. This space constitutes about 41 percent of \nall the energy that is used in our country, and so two Senators said \nhere is an opportunity to again promote the efficiency and the \nvisibility of the programs that work.\n  Then we had a useful amendment offered by Senators Klobuchar and \nHoeven to assist nongovernmental organizations. These are the churches \nand the senior citizens groups and the programs for kids. These are the \nnonprofits. And what that bipartisan coalition wanted to do was to \nassist nongovernmental organizations in making these energy-efficient \nimprovements.\n  Then as the fifth part of this discussion we had the Landrieu-Wicker-\nPryor amendment to improve the way in which various governmental \nagencies select the Green Building Program certification systems for \nFederal agency use--again, something designed to reduce some of the \nbureaucratic redtape that is associated with how these programs are \nimplemented.\n  So there you are. The first five amendments are bipartisan. They are \nin response to this kind of welling up, as I would characterize it, to \nthe opportunity that this bill presents.\n  We received letters from a number of organizations just today--the \nNational Association of Manufacturers, the American Council for an \nEnergy-Efficient Economy, the Business Roundtable, the Alliance to Save \nEnergy, and the Natural Resources Defense Council--all of which wrote \nto Majority Leader Reid and Minority Leader McConnell to express their \nsupport for this legislation. I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record this letter.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               September 11, 2013.\n       Majority Leader Reid and Minority Leader McConnell: We \n     write representing a broad spectrum of interests to express \n     our support of S. 1392, the Energy Savings and Industrial \n     Competitiveness Act, introduced by Senators Shaheen (D-NH) \n     and Portman (R-OH). This bill reflects a bi-partisan, \n     consensus agreement on a set of energy policies that will \n     benefit the economy, advance energy security, and improve the \n     quality of the environment. All agree that expanding energy \n     efficiency is in the national interest and this legislation \n     would increase energy efficiency opportunities for \n     businesses, consumers, and the federal government.\n       S. 1392 is built on a consensus principle and the broad \n     support it has received is the product of that principle. It \n     is our hope that the Senate will proceed with full \n     consideration of this bill in a manner that gives it the best \n     opportunity to move forward in the legislative process.\n       Thank you for your consideration and we look forward to \n     continuing to work with you and the Senate to support federal \n     energy efficiency policies that benefit all Americans.\n           Sincerely,\n     National Association of Manufacturers.\n     Natural Resources Defense Council.\n     American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.\n     Alliance to Save Energy.\n     Business Roundtable.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. The reason they wrote this kind of letter is that the \nAmerican Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy has estimated that \njust 10 of the efficiency amendments--most of which were introduced and \nheard by our energy subcommittee on June 25--would increase, by 2030, \nthe number of jobs created by 10,000. So 10,000 jobs, and we have just \n10 of those amendments that would make that kind of difference, and the \namendments would increase energy savings by over 10 percent and \nincrease the annual savings by 2030 by $1.5 billion.\n  The Business Roundtable, the National Association of Manufacturers, \nthe leading environmental groups--that is not exactly a coalition that \ncomes together for every important energy issue, every important \nenvironmental question all the time. But they are there on this one, \nand they are there to a great extent because they understand that \nmodernizing energy policy and having an ``all of the above'' energy \npolicy means you have to pass legislation like the Shaheen-Portman bill \nand the useful amendments that are associated with it.\n  Senators come to the floor here in the Senate constantly to talk \nabout how they are for an ``all of the above'' energy policy. It is \nalmost obligatory that you mention it three or four times just to show \nyou are serious about energy policy. You can't be serious unless you \nsupport a robust bipartisan effort, such as the Shaheen-Portman bill. \nThis is too important to the overall agenda for energy, productivity, \njob creation, and a cleaner environment.\n  I look forward to hearing more from colleagues on their efficiency \namendments. I very much hope we can keep the amendments that go forward \nrelevant to the question of energy policy.\n  It just seems to me that when you have a bipartisan foundation, as we \nhave with this bill--and it started bipartisan with the Senator from \nNew Hampshire and the Senator from Ohio, and it got significantly more \nbipartisan yesterday.\n  It would be one thing if Senators came to the floor yesterday and \nsaid: We are here to talk about energy legislation. I really don't care \nabout this topic. What I want to do is talk about these other issues \nthat are important to me politically.\n  That would be one thing. But Senators didn't do that. They came to \nthe floor and they said they want to talk about energy, they want to \ntalk about getting something done in a bipartisan way, they like the \nbipartisan bill, and they want to make it even stronger. It seems to me \nthat if we now spend an appreciable amount of our time undermining that \nbipartisan foundation and preventing us from working together on a \nsubject Senators say they care about, that they recognize is part of an \n``all of the above'' energy policy, that would be particularly \nunfortunate.\n  This bill is an opportunity for the Senate to put some points on the \nboard for the people who sent us here to pass legislation that is going \nto benefit the country and have a positive impact on folks at home.\n  Senator Murkowski and I and Senators Shaheen and Portman talked \nyesterday about the extraordinary breadth of the coalition that \nsupports this bill--business and energy efficiency advocates and \nenvironmental organizations. More than 200 businesses and groups from \nacross the political spectrum support this bill.\n  I have already asked that their letter be printed in the Record, but \nI would like to read one passage from the letter that I think reflects \nthe case for enacting this bill. Those organizations--again, the \nBusiness Roundtable, the National Association of Manufacturers, the \nNatural Resources Defense Council--agreed that ``this bill reflects a \nbi-partisan, consensus agreement on a set of energy policies that will \nbenefit the economy, advance energy security, and improve the quality \nof the environment. All agree that expanding energy efficiency is in \nthe national interest and this legislation would increase energy \nefficiency opportunities for businesses, consumers, and the federal \ngovernment.''\n  So why the Senate would want to say no to something like that because \nSenators want to advance other unrelated issues important to them \nreally doesn't add up. I know in the Senate there is a desire to debate \na whole host of issues, but the reality is that Senators who have \ntalked about energy policy for years and years--and there are a host of \nthem for whom energy is particularly important--now say they want to \nhave their issues that are unrelated to energy advanced today, even \nthough that has the potential to undermine this bill. I don't know how \nthat adds up if you give a lot of speeches at home about sensible \nenergy policy and then you take steps to undermine a bipartisan effort, \nwhich got more bipartisan yesterday.\n  So I am very hopeful that this legislation, which got out of the \nenergy committee on a 19-to-3 vote and got better yesterday, starting \nwith Senators Inhofe and Carper and going through all the Senators who \nhad bipartisan proposals, I hope it will not be undermined by unrelated \nmatters. If we stay focused on efficiency, I believe we will have an \neven stronger vote than we had in the committee, which was a 19-to-3 \nvote, because Senators will have made clear that they understand this \ndebate is about energy productivity, it is about job creation, it is \nabout a cleaner environment, and that they especially understand this \nbill reflects what Senators heard all this summer.\n\n[[Page S6410]]\n\n  All this summer the message was, go back to Washington, deal with \nimportant issues, particularly those related to the economy. Do it in a \nbipartisan way. That is what I believe an overwhelming majority of \nSenators wants to do, and if we keep this bill related to energy \nefficiency, that will be the result, and that will be good for the \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I respect and appreciate my distinguished \ncolleague, the majority floor manager on this bill, and I appreciate \nhis remarks. But since they were all directed at my activity, I would \nlike to briefly respond.\n  I have nothing against his efforts. I have nothing against this bill \nand the provisions of it. I applaud that work, and I want to support \nthat work. And I too listened really hard this summer, all through \nAugust. I do townhall meetings in every parish in Louisiana every \nCongress. This August alone I did 18, and I did hear a lot. Quite \nfrankly, I didn't hear about this bill or any provision of this bill, \nbut I am not denigrating it. I support the vast majority of the \nprovisions of this bill.\n  What I did hear over and over is this: Washington shouldn't be \ntreated differently and better than we are. What is good for America \nneeds to be good for Washington. And if that rule is applied across the \nboard, you all will start getting a lot of things right in Congress and \nin Washington.\n  I heard that articulated hundreds of times at 18 townhall meetings in \na lot of different ways. That is what my amendment is all about. And \nthe reason I am demanding a vote now is simply because this illegal OPM \nrule is set to happen and go into effect on October 1, so it is time-\nsensitive. I didn't ask for that. I didn't invite that. I would like \nthat rule to go away. But that is a fact, and that is why this is a \npressing time-sensitive matter.\n  The distinguished Senator also talked about bipartisanship. Well, \nthis proposal--the ``no Washington exemption from ObamaCare'' \nproposal--is thoroughly bipartisan in America. It has enormous \nbipartisan support in America. The only place it is not popular, quite \nfrankly, on a bipartisan basis is in Washington, DC.\n  Again, what I heard over and over in 18 townhall meetings was this: \nThe quicker you all apply all laws to yourselves as much as they apply \nto America, the quicker you will start figuring this stuff out and \ndoing the right thing in Washington.\n  I agree with that. So I am simply asking for a timely vote on my \nproposal--which has to be before October 1 for reasons I have explained \nthat are beyond my control--and I have no desire to hold up these other \namendments or this bill.\n  In that spirit, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nset aside and the following amendments be made pending: Bennet No. \n1847, Enzi No. 1863, Udall No. 1845, Sessions No. 1879, Inhofe No. \n1851, Klobuchar No. 1856, and Vitter No. 1866; that on Tuesday, \nSeptember 17, at a time to be determined jointly by the majority and \nminority leaders, my amendment No. 1866 and a side-by-side amendment on \nthe same subject by the majority leader be made pending and receive 60 \nminutes of debate evenly divided and controlled by the majority bill \nmanager and me; that no points of order be in order in relation to \nthese two amendments; and that upon expiration of the time for debate, \nwithout any intervening motions or debate, the Senate then proceed to \nvotes on these two amendments subject to a 60-vote threshold for \npassage, and subsequent to each amendment vote and motion to \nreconsider, each vote be made and laid upon the table.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, reclaiming my time, I am sorry for that. I \nthink that establishes a perfectly reasonable path forward in which we \ncould present and vote on these energy votes the distinguished floor \nmanager is talking about. It would mean a 60-minute debate on this \nimportant and timely topic I am bringing up next week. So I think that \nis a reasonable path forward.\n  But I have an alternative that would take it out of the context of \nthis bill, if that would be preferable.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the Vitter \namendment No. 1866; that on Wednesday, September 25, 2013, at 3 p.m, \nthe Senate discharge the relevant committees from consideration of my \nbill, the No Exemption for Washington From ObamaCare Act, and proceed \nto immediate consideration of that bill; that without any intervening \nmotions or debate, the Senate proceed to 60 minutes of debate on that \nbill, evenly divided and controlled by the majority leader and me; that \nthe bill not be subject to any amendments or motions to commit; that \nafter debate has expired, the bill be engrossed for a third reading, \nread a third time, and the Senate immediately vote on final passage; \nand that the motion to reconsider be made and laid upon the table.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, again reclaiming the floor, I think that \nis unfortunate because that would be a path forward that takes this \nissue and this vote completely out of the context of this bill--which I \nhave no problem with. I have no problem with that. I have no desire to \nobstruct or delay this bill, and I have laid out a path that makes that \ncrystal clear. I am open to any reasonable variation of these ideas, \neither an amendment vote next week on this bill or a timely vote on the \namendment--or a timely vote on my identical bill before October 1. I am \ncompletely open to any of that. I hope the majority side and the \nmajority leader will take that under consideration and agree to a \nversion of that. That would immediately solve this impasse, which is \ncreated by the majority leader, not by me.\n  This is an important issue. This is timely. This illegal OPM rule, \nwhich creates a special exemption, a special deal for Washington, is \nhappening October 1. I heard a lot from my constituents this August and \nI heard a lot about that. I heard a lot about how Washington should \nlive under the same rules as America. I heard that on a thoroughly \nbipartisan basis. I look forward to furthering that important goal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, by way of responding to the distinguished \nSenator from Louisiana, I think I am about as bipartisan as anybody \nhere. The one thing I have tried to make essentially the focus of my \ntime in public service is trying to find a way to get folks together, \nwhether it is on tax reform or health care or education with Marco \nRubio. That is what I want to be all about.\n  Particularly on the Energy Committee, Senator Murkowski has \nconsistently met our side halfway, trying to find common ground, trying \nto get folks to work together. The two of us laugh often about it. We \ndo not agree on every single issue under the sun, but there is an awful \nlot we can agree on. That is why no other committee in the Senate has \npassed as many bills to the floor in a bipartisan way as the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee.\n  When it comes to working on important issues in a bipartisan way, the \nSenator says that is what he wants to do. He got me at ``hello'' on \nthat. But I ask him to not hold this bipartisan legislation, which was \na first-rate bill when Senator Shaheen and Senator Portman brought it \nhere. It got better yesterday during the first couple hours. Senator \nMurkowski and I heard five amendments from Senators. This is already a \nblock of 10 Senators. Each of them was bipartisan, starting with \nSenator Inhofe and Senator Carper. It got better yesterday.\n  I ask the Senator from Louisiana, who I know cares a lot about energy \npolicy--in his State I imagine they talk about energy quite a bit--to \nnot hold this bipartisan Energy bill hostage for something else. Let's \nget this passed. It is the first significant Energy bill on the floor \nof the Senate since 2007.\n  Hydropower was a very good bill, largely accomplished through the \nleadership of Senator Murkowski and a\n\n[[Page S6411]]\n\nhandful of other Republican and Democratic Senators. This is a chance \nto put points on the board for an issue that dominates so much of our \ncountry and I know certainly the part of the country that the Senator \nfrom Louisiana represents.\n  I want him to understand--and I think he knows--since my days when I \nwas codirector of the Gray Panthers, health care is truly my first \nlove. I am willing to work with the Senator from Louisiana on these \nhealth care issues. But I implore, in the strongest possible way, that \nwe not hold up this bipartisan Energy bill, a bill that was bipartisan \nbefore it arrived and it got better after it did--that we not hold this \nbipartisan Energy bill hostage for something else.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, again, I respect the distinguished \nmajority floor leader. I appreciate his comments. He has been very \nbipartisan in his work in the Senate. But I am a little confused \nbecause it is as if he did not hear my unanimous consent request. I \nthink those are clearly two possible paths forward that do not have to \nhold up anything. All I am asking for is a vote on a very important \nissue before this illegal rule goes into effect October 1.\n  Again, I re-urge both unanimous consent requests and ask the \ndistinguished floor leader, why is that not a path forward and why do \nthe American people--forget about me--why do the American people not \ndeserve this vote? Because they sure as heck support this on a \nthoroughly bipartisan basis.\n  Again, I am open to either path forward, either a vote on my \namendment on this bill or let's withdraw that and have a separate vote \nbefore October 1. That is a path forward. There is no hostage-taking \nhere. There is no holding up anything. What I am reacting to is this \nillegal OPM rule and this October 1 deadline, which I certainly did not \nask for. I think that is completely contrary to the law. But now that \nit has been issued I think we need to respond and have a public vote. I \nurge that, either path forward. Let's take that in a bipartisan way. \nLet's listen to our constituents, Republicans, Democrats, and \nIndependents. If we listen to them, we will not only have this vote, we \nwill pass this amendment, we will pass this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I also wish to respond to my colleague \nfrom Louisiana because I appreciate his interest in addressing some of \nthe concerns on health care that have come up. I would certainly like \nthe opportunity to correct a lot of the misinformation that is out \nthere. But, again, I think there are other opportunities to do that. We \nshould not be doing that on an energy bill that has such bipartisan \nsupport.\n  The Senator is talking about wanting to get a vote on his \nlegislation. Senator Portman and I have been waiting for 3 years to get \na vote on this legislation. For something that has such overwhelming \nsupport, I hope my friend from Louisiana is going to be flexible and \nthink about how he can address the concerns he has and yet let the \ndebate on this bill go forward.\n  We have, as Senator Wyden said, 16 bipartisan amendments that have \nalready been vetted by both sides on the committee, that are ready to \ngo, that I think we could probably get a voice vote on, on all of \nthose, because we have so much support on both sides.\n  This is legislation on which we have had a number of other amendments \nfiled that we should debate, around energy, because we have not debated \nenergy on the floor of the Senate since 2007. We have more than 260 \ngroups and businesses that have endorsed this legislation. Everybody \nfrom Eastern Mountain Sports, which is a great New Hampshire business, \nto large companies such as General Electric and Raytheon, to small \nbusinesses such as--in New Hampshire we have a company called Warner \nPower, which makes the first innovation in transformers in over 100 \nyears; they are supporting it.\n  One of the other businesses I thought was particularly interesting is \nEileen Fisher, which makes women's clothes. They support the \nlegislation. As everybody knows, anybody who is doing manufacturing in \nthis country is using a lot of energy and they are looking for any way \npossible to reduce their energy use because they want to be \ncompetitive.\n  We have a number of manufacturing companies on this list that are \ninterested in how they can reduce their energy use. Then we have a \nwhole number of organizations, everything from the Christian Coalition \nto the Union for Reform Judaism. We have environmental groups such as \nthe League of Conservation Voters and the Sierra Club. We have trade \nassociations such as the American Chemistry Council. When is the last \nbill we have seen that has both the Sierra Club and the American \nChemistry Council supporting the same legislation?\n  We have a whole list of industry groups that understand that energy \nefficiency is something they can support because it is something that \nis going to allow them to add jobs in their businesses. We have the \nLeague of Women Voters, the National Restaurant Association, the Oil \nHeat Council of New Hampshire--a small group that is concerned about \nmaking sure people in New Hampshire can heat their homes at a \nreasonable cost.\n  The North Carolina Chamber of Commerce, the Southern Alliance for \nClean Energy--this is legislation that has support all over the \ncountry. The U.S. Council of Mayors as well as the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, they are supporting it because they understand first how \nimportant energy is for the future of this country. If we are going to \nstay competitive, we have to be able to meet the energy demands that \nbusinesses have, that people who are trying to heat their homes and pay \ntheir electric bills have, that we have as a country, as the U.S. \ngovernment, where we are the biggest user of energy in the country and \npart of our legislation deals with government's use of energy and tries \nto reduce that.\n  They understand it is in their interest to try to reduce their energy \nuse. We are having a debate about how focused we are going to be on \nfossil fuels, whether we are going to put more support in for \nalternative sources of energy. But energy efficiency benefits \neverybody, regardless of whether one supports fossil fuels or new \nsources of energy. That is why this legislation makes so much sense.\n  We have heard just in the last couple weeks from the American Council \nfor an Energy-Efficient Economy that if we can pass this legislation, \nby 2025 it will support the creation of 136,000 jobs. How many pieces \nof legislation have we seen on the floor of the Senate that for the \ncosts we are talking about in this bill--no new authorization--that we \ncan support the creation of 136,000 jobs?\n  Last year when they looked at the bill, they said it would also be \nthe equivalent of taking 5 million cars off the road, saving consumers \n$4 billion. This is a win-win-win. At a time when we know our future \nenergy opportunities are limited, to some extent, by what is happening \nin the Middle East, what is happening with foreign oil, this is \nsomething that makes sense. For us to be held up because there are \npeople in the Chamber who want to debate health care or who want to \ndebate what the EPA is doing or who want to debate any other myriad of \nissues--I understand. I am willing to have those debates. I am willing \nto take those votes. But right now we should be limiting our debate to \nenergy because that is the legislation on the floor before us.\n  I urge that we try to address the concerns that people have but we do \nit in a way that will allow us to move forward on this Energy bill. I \nthink it is in the best interests of the country. As Senator Wyden said \nso eloquently: People in this country want us to work together. They \nwant us to work together to address the issues we are facing in \nAmerica. Senator Portman and I have tried to do that. We have spent 3 \nyears trying to do that. We want to move forward. We want to work \ntogether to address this issue. I certainly want to have the debate \nwith my colleague from Louisiana about health care. But I don't want to \nhave it right now because we cannot move forward on this legislation as \nlong as that, his amendment, is holding this up.\n  I hope we can work out some way to do that in a way that we can both \nfind\n\n[[Page S6412]]\n\nagreeable and that allows us a path forward to address energy because, \nclearly, we have to come up with a comprehensive energy strategy for \nthis country. I think energy efficiency is the first step, and that is \nwhat this legislation would do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I appreciate not only the words but the \nwork of my colleague from New Hampshire, and I specifically suggest, \nre-urge, and again call attention to my second suggestion, in the form \nof a UC which was to withdraw my amendment from this bill as long as a \nfair vote were assured before October 1.\n  The reason this is so time sensitive, and the only reason I am camped \nout here on the floor in this way, is because this illegal OPM rule \nhappens October 1. This is happening right now. It was announced a \nlittle over a month ago. We were not here during the intervening time. \nWe were in the August recess. This is happening, so I don't \nparticularly want to debate this next year. We need a vote next week \nbecause of that timetable, which is not of my making.\n  I appreciate the sentiment of the Senator from New Hampshire. I look \nforward to working with the Senator in that way.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, would my colleague yield for a question?\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I will yield for a question.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I appreciate the consent agreements are \nusually worked out by the leadership of both the majority and the \nminority. I know Senator Vitter understands that too. Would the Senator \nfrom Louisiana be willing to withdraw his objection to moving forward \nto amendments on the bill if he and I went--in good faith--to the \nmajority and minority leaders to see if we can get some agreement on \nwhen we can address Senator Vitter's issue?\n  Mr. VITTER. I would not agree to that because that discussion--in \ngood faith--has been going on for a long time, and it is not yielding \nanything. I hope it does. But simply put, I cannot take the pressure \noff that discussion to yield something because that discussion has been \ngoing on for a long time. I am happy to continue that discussion, but \nmoving forward with the bill, quite frankly, lets all the pressure out \nand assures defeat and lack of progress.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Would the Senator from Louisiana not agree there are \nother bills that will be coming to the Senate in the next couple of \nweeks, and so if we cannot come to an agreement, there will be another \nopportunity before the deadline when the Senator could also have this \ndebate he is looking for?\n  Mr. VITTER. Well, again, answering the question through the Chair, I \nwould observe the time between now and October 1 is pretty darn short, \nand what may be coming to the floor is pretty limited. It may be a CR, \nand the amendment opportunities on that are very uncertain. I know \nthere are nominations that are moving forward with obviously no \namendment opportunities.\n  No. 1, I don't know what other bills there may be to even try to get \nan amendment on; but, No. 2, even if I knew of those targets, I would \nnot be assured of a vote. I would just be put off some more.\n  Again, I am open to any solution that guarantees a vote, not for me \nbut for the American people, on this important issue before October 1. \nAgain, that timeline was not of my making. It was due to the issuance \nof what I think is a clearly illegal rule to benefit Washington, \ncontrary to the statutory language of ObamaCare.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I have been watching with admiration \nthe work done by my colleagues from New Hampshire and Ohio, Senators \nShaheen and Portman, and I would suggest in all respect to colleagues \nwho may have extraneous amendments that this measure is so important \nand vital to the future of our country. It is important not only in the \npolicies it achieves but also the trust it will inspire. If we are able \nto come together and work on a bipartisan basis and get this job done, \nit can set a template for changing the mindset within this building and \nacross the country as to how Congress can function.\n  We have an opportunity here. Let's seize it. Let's avoid the kind of \nquagmire, gridlock, and paralysis that has been so damaging to the \ntrust and confidence in our public institutions.\n  Senators Shaheen and Portman deserve a tremendous amount of credit \nfor getting this bill to where it is right now. They never gave up, and \nI am proud they have come this far. Let us enable this Congress to go \nthe rest of the way.\n  This legislation is more than the sum of its parts. It is about \nsaving money--clearly saving $13.7 billion per year--and it is about \nsaving energy and creating jobs. It will create 164,000 jobs by 2030, \nso it is also a great return on investment. It is also about creating \ntrust and confidence in our ability to protect our national security \nfrom excess use of energy that makes us more dependent on nations that \nhave no particular affection for us, and indeed, wish us more harm than \ngood.\n  This legislation authorizes $10 million in grants for institutions of \nhigher learning, trade schools, and community colleges to provide \nworkforce training and skill creation to engineers and builders who \nneed to develop and install the latest, most cutting-edge technologies. \nIt provides limited but very helpful rebates of up to $20 million over \nthe next 2 years for manufacturers who upgrade their electric motors \nand transformers.\n  It directs the Department of Energy to focus its ongoing research and \ndevelopment offices on alternative energy sources for our heating and \npower. These measures, along with energy efficiency required in our \nFederal buildings and facilities, are meaningful and real. They may not \nbe the biggest steps but they are important steps that take us in the \nright direction toward saving energy, money, and ultimately saving our \nplanet. We know climate change--more properly known as climate and \nplanet disruption--are facing us if we fail to act as this measure \nwould have us do.\n  I have an amendment to the bill that will provide for very \nstraightforward, noncontroversial steps in this same direction. It is \namendment No. 1878, and it would require the U.S. Department of Energy \nto study the nonmonetary benefits to our communities of energy-saving \nproducts and complying with energy codes for buildings.\n  For example, buildings account for almost 40 percent of the world's \ngreenhouse gas emissions, according to the World Business Council for \nSustainable Development. We all see the difference energy efficiency \nmakes in our pocketbooks and wallets. This amendment will help quantify \nthese same improvements so far as a cleaner environment, and energy \nsaving contributes in nonmonetary ways to our quality of life. It makes \nus more efficient in the workplace because the quality of life in the \nworkplace is improved and better conditions make people more \nproductive.\n  There are other amendments, such as the fine work done by my \ncolleague Senator Bennet of Colorado to get a better understanding of \nthe financial--that is the monetary savings that commercial energy-\nefficient buildings generate for both owners and tenants. My amendment \nlooks to the nonmonetary benefits and seeks to quantify them and build \na case for energy efficiency there and throughout our society insofar \nas we work better and enjoy life more from savings this bill may \nachieve in money and energy.\n  As chair of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Oversight of Federal \nand Agency Actions, I have seen how Federal agencies are able, through \nthe rulemaking process, to take into account the nonmonetary factors \nduring their cost-benefit analysis. Consumers and manufacturers should \nalso have a better understanding of the nonmonetary factors that are \naddressed through energy efficiency, such as improved building codes \nthat benefit occupants and the general population as well as greater \noffice productivity.\n  There are three areas of manufacturing in Connecticut that are \nthriving because of energy efficiency. United Technologies makes \nbuilding systems, elevators, and heating and air conditioning units and \nsystems that are focused on the most innovative and sustainable \ntechnology. We all use their energy-efficient Otis elevators every day \nto come to the Senate floor, to\n\n[[Page S6413]]\n\nbring constituents to the Capitol Visitor Center.\n  At Legrand in West Hartford, CT, visitors can see firsthand the jobs \nthis legislation supports. Legrand employs about 500 people. They make \nthe electrical and digital insides of buildings across commercial, \nindustrial, and residential markets. They have a demonstration visitors \ncan walk through and see how energy-efficient products work and how \nthey save energy, money, and also improve quality of life.\n  This past May Legrand was recognized by the U.S. Department of Energy \nfor its continuing efforts in making energy efficiency a top priority \nthrough that company's involvement in the Better Buildings, Better \nPlants Challenge.\n  Connecticut is also leading the world in making energy-efficient fuel \ncells and hydrogen energy systems, which is a third area of great \nimportance in energy savings. Fuel cells are of great importance to \neverything from our neighborhood schools to military bases to many \nother areas where inexpensive energy storage and power, as well as \nincreased reliability, result from grid independence. These lessons are \ntangible, real, and dramatic. They are lessons in energy efficiency.\n  In fact, after Superstorm Sandy, we know something about the need for \nreliable backup power in Connecticut. Fuel cells are our future, and we \nshould be recognizing that energy efficiency is our future as well. It \nis an investment that helps everyone in all communities.\n  I have long supported making energy efficiency more supportable, \naffordable, and reliable by improving the existing and new \ntechnologies. Since arriving in the Senate, I have fought for continued \nadequate funding for weatherization assistance programs.\n  A comprehensive energy strategy is what the Nation needs. This \nmeasure is a step in that direction. We cannot live successfully and we \ncannot thrive as a Nation in the 21st century without an energy policy \nand without moving forward on measures such as this one that enable us \nto be more energy efficient.\n  This legislation is an important approach and part of a comprehensive \npolicy our Nation needs to address climate disruption, national \nsecurity threats, fiscal austerity, and all of the challenges of \nquality of life that are so imminent and direct to our Nation.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I appreciate the work of my colleague from \nConnecticut. I will add his amendment numbered 1878 to my proposed UC. \nI absolutely support it being fully debated and having a vote. I have \nabsolutely no problem with that.\n  Alternatively, I have no problem withdrawing my amendment from this \nbill and getting a vote subsequent to this bill before October 1, and \ncertainly the Blumenthal amendment numbered 1878 should get a vote. I \nfully support that.\n  Finally, I absolutely agree with the need to build the confidence of \nthe American people. Let me suggest that I don't think the way to build \nthe confidence of the American people is by passing some energy \nefficiency act, which I expect to support but they have never heard of, \nand sweeping under the rug and thereby protecting this special deal and \nspecial Washington exemption from ObamaCare.\n  I think step one of rebuilding the confidence of the American people \nis to say and to live by the motto that everything we pass and apply to \nAmerica has to apply in the same way to us. That is exactly what this \nillegal OPM rule goes against and disrupts.\n  There is a statutory provision in ObamaCare that specifically says \nall Members of Congress and all congressional staff have to go to the \nexchange. This OPM rule completely and effectively reverses that. It \ntakes all the sting out of that. It is contrary to the law and, \ntherefore, illegal. I think letting that stand, ignoring it, or \nsweeping it under the rug is no way to build the confidence of the \nAmerican people.\n  I want to do both things. I want to address that and I want to debate \nand vote on this bill and all of these amendments, certainly including \nthe Blumenthal amendment No. 1878 which I will certainly add to my \nproposed UC.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleague and \nfriend from Louisiana for his support of my amendment and say that I \nrespect and appreciate the passion and zeal he has brought to this \ndebate on behalf of his beliefs. We can disagree on the policies and \nthe merits of those beliefs, and I would respectfully add my voice to \nthe voices of other colleagues who have suggested there may be other \nways to raise this issue and to indeed have a vote. As my colleague \nfrom New Hampshire articulated so well, I would in no way shirk from \nvotes on the issues the Senator from Louisiana has raised. I am ready \nto debate and confront those issues and deal with the merits. I would \nsimply suggest there may be better ways to raise this issue than, in \neffect, to block consideration of a bill that is so important to the \nAmerican people, so widely supported among so many different groups, \nand has amassed and mobilized such a strong bipartisan coalition.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I will respond through the Chair that I \nappreciate those remarks and the genuine sentiment behind those \nremarks. I welcome and will accept any reasonable path forward that \nassures a vote before October 1, which is the deadline established by \nOPM's illegal rule. I will agree to any path forward that assures a \nvote before October 1, absolutely. I look forward to that.\n  Finally, I am not blocking anything. I am proposing votes. I am \nproposing making amendments and, alternatively, I am proposing \nwithdrawing my amendment from this bill as long as we can vote before \nOctober 1.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Louisiana \nfor his comments.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I rise today to talk about energy \nefficiency and my amendment to Senators Jeanne Shaheen's and Rob \nPortman's Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act. I am very \npleased we are acting on this legislation today, and I am very \nappreciative of the work the Energy and Natural Resources Committee \nChairman Ron Wyden and Ranking Member Lisa Murkowski have done to get \nus to this point.\n  This a very important piece of legislation. In the United States, our \nenergy consumption is about one-fifth of the world's total energy \nconsumption. Yet when you consider we have less than one-twentieth of \nthe world's population, that says we have a role to play here and \nespecially when a tremendous amount of that energy is simply lost \nthrough inefficient buildings, appliances, industrial processes, and \nautomobiles. Those losses have been estimated to cost U.S. businesses \nand households $130 billion a year.\n  By making investments in energy efficiency, we can help consumers \nlower energy costs, and we can reduce pollution, boost the \nmanufacturing sector, and create jobs. That is a win-win-win-win.\n  That is what this legislation is all about. I am proud that the first \nhearing I held as chairman of the Energy Subcommittee on the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee was on amendments to Senator Shaheen's and \nSenator Portman's bill. We considered a number of amendments that would \nbolster the bill's efforts to make our economy more energy efficient. \nNow we have the opportunity to consider some of those amendments we \naddressed in my subcommittee on the floor of the Senate. I would like \nto call up and briefly talk about an amendment I filed to this bill.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \namendment and call up amendment No. 1855.\n\n[[Page S6414]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I would \nlike to propose an alternative unanimous consent request that would \ncertainly allow that amendment to be made pending.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside and \nthe following amendments be made pending: Franken No. 1855, Blumenthal \nNo. 1878, Bennet No. 1847, Enzi No. 1863, Udall No. 1845, Sessions No. \n1879, Inhofe No. 1851, Klobuchar No. 1856, and Vitter No. 1866; and \nthat on Tuesday, September 17, at a time to be determined jointly by \nthe majority and minority leaders, my amendment Vitter No. 1866 and a \nside-by-side amendment on the same subject by the majority leader be \nmade pending and receive 60 minutes of debate, evenly divided and \ncontrolled by the majority bill manager and myself; that no points of \norder be in order in relation to these two amendments; that upon \nexpiration of the time for debate, without any intervening motions or \ndebate, the Senate then proceed to votes on these two amendments \nsubject to a 60-vote threshold for adoption, and that subsequent to \neach amendment vote, a motion to reconsider each vote be made and laid \nupon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request from the \nSenator from Louisiana?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Is there objection to the request from the Senator from Minnesota?\n  Mr. VITTER. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Minnesota has the floor.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I am disappointed my colleague is \nobjecting to us moving forward with this energy bill for reasons I \nbelieve are entirely unrelated to this bipartisan piece of legislation, \nfor an amendment that is not germane, and I hope we can work this out. \nBut in the meantime, I would like to explain what my amendment does on \nenergy efficiency, which is what this bipartisan bill is about.\n  My amendment is simply designed to help get information on the energy \nuse in buildings. That way building owners and private sector companies \ncan identify energy savings. Unless we know how well buildings are \nperforming, we cannot be sure what types of energy efficiency \ntechnologies will be the most effective. And that is exactly what my \namendment addresses.\n  The main thing my amendment does is to require that building spaces \nthat are leased by the Federal Government measure and report their \nenergy use. The Federal Government is the Nation's largest consumer of \nenergy. Taxpayers are paying for all of that energy. We owe it to them, \nto our taxpayers, to make sure our buildings save as much energy as \npossible.\n  The Energy Savings and Independence Act of 2007 created energy \nefficiency requirements for Federal buildings and for federally leased \nspaces. However, over half of those leased spaces are exempt from these \nenergy efficiency requirements. My amendment makes the Federal \nGovernment's energy usage accountable to taxpayers by requiring \ndisclosure of energy use in all federally leased spaces, where such \ndisclosures would be practical and appropriate.\n  This amendment will also have a small grant program so that utilities \nand their partners that want to measure and disclose energy use in \ntheir buildings are able to do so. The grant program is voluntary and \nis fully offset.\n  My amendment would be a significant step in making our commercial \nbuildings more energy efficient. I had a call with a member of the Real \nEstate Roundtable. Benchmarking is what this is called. On that call, \nhe was saying: Well, not only will this save the Federal Government \nmoney, save taxpayers money, but it will, through the whole commercial \nbuilding sector, create more energy efficiency and save dollars. Again, \nit will make the Federal Government more accountable to taxpayers.\n  By accessing information on the energy use of buildings, private \nsector investors and energy service contract companies can identify and \ndeploy more effective energy efficiency retrofit improvements. \nRetrofits are a win-win-win, and it is low-hanging fruit. When you do a \nretrofit, you are putting people to work doing the retrofit, you are \nimproving the value of the property, you are using products that are \nmade by manufacturers in the United States, so you are creating jobs \nthere, you are also reducing the amount of energy use, so saving money. \nRetrofits pay for themselves. It lowers our carbon footprint and, \nagain, it saves money. So it is a win-win-win. Let's do that.\n  I again commend Senators Shaheen and Portman on their legislation. I \nlook forward to the adoption of this commonsense amendment, and I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I strongly support the Franken amendment. \nThis concept known as benchmarking--and that is what the Senator's \namendment is all about--is something of a term of art in the energy \nfield. But I think it is important for people to know that benchmarking \nis essentially about information. It is about making markets work \nbetter. Benchmarking is a process that allows building owners to assess \nand disclose the energy use of their buildings so they can compare it \nto similar buildings.\n  The information provides an incentive for owners to improve building \nefficiency. And, obviously, better information on energy use is itself \nan incentive to improve efficiency.\n  All this amendment does is expand benchmarking. In effect, it \napproaches the issue of building efficiency and says: One of the most \npractical commonsense steps we can take is to expand access to good \ninformation.\n  So I am very appreciative that the Senator from Minnesota has offered \nthis amendment. It is very much consistent with what is known as the \nENERGY STAR Program, which also encourages building owners to share \nthis kind of information.\n  So I hope Senators will support it. I am sure that not every Senator \nhas heard the word ``benchmarking'' before because that is something of \na term of art in the energy policy field, but to put it in something \nresembling English, this is about sharing information, it is about \nmaking markets work better. There are no mandates or requirements here \nin terms of the private sector.\n  I am very hopeful that, again, as part of the effort to keep this \nbill focused on energy efficiency, we can get the Franken amendment \nbefore the entire Senate. I support it and I support it strongly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Minnesota for \ncoming down to the floor and talking about his amendment, even though \nhe cannot officially offer it, because I think it is an important \namendment. I think it improves the legislation. I appreciate the fact \nthat he took time to figure out how to offset it because some of the \noriginal drafts of the amendment had some authorization without \noffsets. So this is a deficit-neutral amendment, as I understand it. I \nhave looked at the offsets, and they look as if they are offsets that \nare consistent with the underlying bill to make sure we are not adding \nany burden to the deficit here.\n  But it does make sense. This benchmarking is important. It enables \npeople to see what others are doing, comparing performance to similar \nbuildings. It is invaluable when evaluating the need for upgrades, and \nparticularly in the Federal sector, where we do not have necessarily \nthat same profit motive to be able to be incentivized to look at those \ncomparable energy efficiency performances.\n  So I like this amendment because it has a sensible approach on \nbenchmarking. It has no mandates on the private sector. It does expand \nbenchmarking from federally owned facilities to federally leased \nfacilities, which is important because we have a number of those around \nthe country. And it also does something I think positive in terms of \nrequiring DOE to study the whole methodology behind benchmarking, which \nwill help not only the Federal sector but the private\n\n[[Page S6415]]\n\nsector. It requires that these methodologies be studied so that cities \nand States can implement better practices and best practices.\n  So I think this amendment is an example of the four other amendments \nI see here we have already had good discussion on in the last day which \ndeal with aspects of energy efficiency that improve the legislation. \nAgain, I thank my colleague from Minnesota for bringing it forward, as \nhave others--Senator Inhofe, Senator Carper, Senator Hoeven, Senator \nBennet, Senator Ayotte, Senator Collins, and others, over the last 24 \nhours.\n  I look forward to getting the amendment actually called up so we can \nmove forward. I would urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nfind a unanimous consent agreement so we can move forward. It seems to \nme we are pretty close to that. Having followed the proceedings this \nmorning, it seems as though every time we get close, there is another \nconcern that gets raised. I think we need to figure out how to resolve \nthe health care issue in a way that does permit this Chamber to have \nits voice heard but then get back to this underlying legislation and to \nthese amendments.\n  This is something we have worked on now for 2\\1/2\\ years. It is \nsomething that I think is the result of the kind of bipartisan effort \nwe ought to be doing around here, helping to find common ground to \nactually move the country forward on things that actually help create \njobs, help our economy, and make us more competitive as a country but \nalso have an environmental and energy benefit.\n  I yield the floor and again thank the Members who are willing to come \ndown to the floor and talk about some of these amendments, even though \nwe cannot officially offer them at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I also wish to thank my colleague from \nMinnesota for his work and for this amendment. I wish to underscore I \nam not blocking his amendment. In fact, I presented a unanimous consent \nthat makes his amendment pending, assures a debate, and would assure a \nvote. I am completely open to that with regard to that Senator's \namendment and all the other amendments we are talking about.\n  Alternatively, if it is preferable, earlier--I know the Senator from \nMinnesota was not on the floor, so I do not expect him to know this, \nbut I wanted to underscore, earlier I presented an alternative \nunanimous consent request to withdraw my amendment from this bill and \nbe assured of a vote outside of this bill on the Senate floor before \nOctober 1.\n  Of course, that October 1 deadline is real and is important, not \ncreated by me, created by this illegal proposed OPM rule. So that is an \nalternative path forward that would take my amendment and my proposal \ncompletely outside of this bill. I also offered that unanimous consent \nagreement. I would re-urge it. I too hope we are making progress toward \nthat sort of fair resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I would like to speak to an amendment \nthat has been filed by my colleague from North Dakota, Senator Hoeven. \nI expect he will be here momentarily to speak specifically to his \namendment, but it has to do with the Keystone Pipeline. This is an \nappropriate opportunity to talk about the energy needs our country has \nand the way in which those are being addressed.\n  We believe there is a great opportunity for our country to benefit in \nso many ways from the building of the Keystone Pipeline. Obviously, \nSenator Hoeven's state is benefiting enormously from the oil and gas \nfind they have in North Dakota. There are lots of abundant energy \nresources. As typically is the case, you have to have a way to get \nthose to the ultimate marketplace.\n  The most efficient way to do that is through a pipeline. The Keystone \nPipeline, which has been proposed now for several years, is a way in \nwhich we can move about 830,000 barrels of oil every single day \naccording to the Department of Energy. Not only would this pipeline \ntransport Canadian crude to U.S. markets, but it would also benefit oil \nproduction from the Bakken formation in the Upper Great Plains.\n  Just to put that figure into perspective, 830,000 barrels represent \nabout half the amount that the United States imports from the Middle \nEast each and every day. According to the Department of Energy, much of \nthe needed oil of the United States shipped through this pipeline will \nbe refined at the Gulf Coast refineries and would likely offset heavy \ncrude imports from Venezuela.\n  Keystone XL Pipeline is a $5.3 billion investment. According to the \nObama State Department, the pipeline would support 42,000 jobs across \nthe country; that is, over a 1- to 2-year construction period, \napproximately 3,900 would be directly employed in construction \nactivities. These jobs would translate into approximately $2 billion in \nwages and earnings.\n  Keystone XL would also generate much needed tax revenue in several \nStates, including an estimated $5 billion in additional property taxes \nthroughout the operational life of the pipeline. The Keystone XL \nPipeline has been under review now for 1,819 days. September 19 will \nmark the 5-year anniversary of the initial application for the \npipeline's Presidential permit. Four environmental reviews have already \nconcluded that the pipeline would not have a significant impact on the \nenvironment.\n  As President Obama continues to delay, Canada's oil supply is growing \nby the day and is expected to double by the year 2025. Canadian oil \nproducers are quickly building pipelines to Canada's east and west \ncoast to ship their oil to foreign markets. Meanwhile, reports indicate \nwe may not get a decision out of the administration until the year \n2014. By delaying approval of the pipeline, President Obama is \nproviding China and other nations with an opportunity to outcompete the \nUnited States and gain access to Canada's growing oil supply.\n  Senator Hoeven's resolution declares that the construction of the \nKeystone XL Pipeline is in our national interest. That is what the \nState Department will have to conclude at the end of this current \nenvironmental impact statement process, which is supposed to be wrapped \nup in the coming weeks. At that point, Secretary Kerry, the Secretary \nof State, has 90 days to determine if the pipeline is in our national \ninterest.\n  I would state again: this pipeline is going to create jobs, it is \ngoing to boost investment, it is going to reduce our dependence on \nVenezuelan oil, and it will strengthen our relationship with our \nlargest trading partner. Keystone XL Pipeline is clearly in our \nnational interest. I would hope the Senate would go on record to that \neffect. If we think about the impact it can have on our economy, on \njobs, the impact it can have on reducing that dangerous dependence we \nhave on foreign sources of energy, this makes all the sense in the \nworld.\n  I would reiterate what I said earlier; that is, this has been \nstudied, this has been scrutinized, this has been reviewed now for 5 \nyears. 1,819 days have elapsed since this permit was first applied for; \nfive years have lapsed and four environmental reviews have been done. \nThere is now currently yet another environmental impact study under \nway, which is supposed to be concluded soon, at the conclusion of which \nthere will be a 90-day period in which the Secretary of State has to \nmake a determination about whether the Keystone Pipeline is in our \nnational interest.\n  What this amendment, offered by my colleague from North Dakota, \nSenator Hoeven, would do is simply put the Senate on the record as \nsaying the Keystone Pipeline is, in fact, in our national interest. I \nbelieve that is a statement the Senate ought to make. We ought to weigh \nin on this subject. It is clear from all of the economic impact, clear \nfrom the environmental impact, clear from the need that we have to get \naway from the dependence we have on foreign sources of energy that this \nis a win-win for Americans, win-win for American consumers, win-win for \nAmerican workers who need those jobs, and a win-win for the American \neconomy in not having to get so much of our oil and our energy supply \nfrom outside the United States.\n  I would hope my colleagues and I get the chance, as we continue the \ndebate on this bill, to discuss this amendment\n\n[[Page S6416]]\n\nbut also to ultimately vote on it and to declare once and for all, \nthrough the Senate, that this is, in fact, in the national interest. I \nsee my colleague from North Dakota who is the author of this amendment \nis here. I credit him for bringing this amendment to the floor and \ngiving us an opportunity to discuss what I think is a very important \nissue, not only to his State and my State and to many others that would \nbe impacted directly by this, but to the entire economy and our \ncountry.\n  I would yield to the Senator from North Dakota who is the author of \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I wish to thank the esteemed Senator \nfrom South Dakota for being here and for his comments on this very \nimportant issue and also for being a cosponsor of this amendment, both \nnow and in previous amendments that I have submitted in support of the \nKeystone XL Pipeline project.\n  I believe some of the other sponsors of this amendment will be \njoining us. I will ask that they are able to say a few words as well as \nthey appear. I wish to thank the Senator from South Dakota for his \nleadership on this issue. The pipeline will actually go through part of \nSouth Dakota, I should mention.\n  It was not too long ago I was back home in North Dakota, and down in \nthe southwest corner of our State there are hundreds of miles of \npipeline stacked, just waiting to be used, to be put in the ground.\n  A lot of that pipeline will go through the State of South Dakota, \nthrough the western part of your State. Of course, this is all about \nbuilding vital infrastructure for our Nation. What it is truly about is \ngetting our Nation to energy independence, working with Canada to have \nNorth American energy independence, so we no longer depend on oil from \nthe Middle East. That is something all Americans very much want.\n  As the Senator from South Dakota said, this is a joint resolution, a \nconcurrent resolution of the Senate, and then of course it would go to \nthe House. So it would be putting both the Senate and the House on \nrecord together stating specifically and clearly that the Keystone XL \nPipeline is in the national interest. It is in the national interest.\n  Why is that important? Because, quite simply, that is the decision \nour President needs to make. He has been reviewing this project for 5 \nyears. TransCanada submitted an application to build this pipeline in \nSeptember of 2008. Now it is September of 2013. For 5 years this has \nbeen under review and under study.\n  So what is the decision for the President of the United States? The \ndecision for the President of the United States is he needs to \ndetermine is this pipeline in the national interest? Why is that \nimportant? Because it crosses an international boundary. The pipeline \nstarts in Hardisty, which is in Alberta, Canada, and it travels down to \nthe Canadian border and then across our country to our refineries, to a \nvariety of refineries across the country.\n  It will provide 830,000 barrels of oil a day. But that is not just \nCanadian oil, that is also oil from the great State of North Dakota and \nMontana, more than 100,000 barrels a day of the lightest, sweetest \ncrude oil produced anywhere in the country, really in the world. It \ntakes it to our refineries so our consumers can use that refined fuel \nfrom Canada and from the United States rather than what? Rather than \noil from the Middle East.\n  How fitting is it that we are here today where we are talking about \nthe Middle East and Syria and today now talking about an energy \nefficiency bill. I will submit to you, it is a lot more efficient to \nmove oil in a pipeline than it is by trains and trucks. So it is \ncertainly appropriate that this amendment be part of the energy \nefficiency bill.\n  Americans do not want to get their oil from the Middle East anymore. \nThat is a no-brainer. They do not want to get oil from the Middle East. \nThey want it produced here. They want to work with our closest friend \nand neighbor, Canada. That is what this project is all about. So we \nfigure if Congress can go on the record together, the Senate and the \nHouse together, just go on the record stating clearly, simply, and \nstraightforwardly, after more than 5 years of study, exhaustive \nenvironmental impact statements, we are stating this pipeline is in the \nnational interest.\n  It is in the national interest because we want the jobs. It is in the \nnational interest because we want the energy. It is in the national \ninterest because it will create tremendous economic activity, tax \nrevenue without raising taxes for our country, for the States. It is in \nthe national interest because of our national security.\n  We do not want to have to go to Venezuela or to the Middle East for \nour oil. We can produce it here and we can work with Canada to produce \nthat oil. So by clearly stating in a joint resolution, in a concurrent \nresolution from the Senate and the House, this is in the national \ninterest, we believe we can get the President to say, after 5 years of \nstudy, after environmental impact statement after environmental impact \nstatement that shows no significant environmental impact, that he will \nmake a decision.\n  The decision is to approve the project.\n  Mr. THUNE. Will the Senator from North Dakota yield for a question?\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I yield to my distinguished colleague from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. I would ask the Senator from North Dakota, who has been a \ngreat leader on all of these energy issues as we debate energy policy \nin the Senate, to confirm this but my understanding is that, according \nto President Obama's State Department, the pipeline will support 42,000 \njobs across the country.\n  There have been some discussions and debate but the President, not \ntoo long ago, made a comment in front of an editorial board in one of \nthe country's major newspapers that this is only going to create a \ncouple of thousand jobs and that this was a very minimalist thing.\n  We have an unemployment rate that continues to hover in the 7.5-\npercent range and we have the lowest labor participation rate in our \ncountry today that we have had literally in 35 years, going back to the \nCarter administration. The real unemployment rate in other words those \nwho are not only unemployed but those who would like to be working full \ntime or those being forced to work part time or those who have quit \nlooking, is actually much higher. About 14 percent--22 million \nAmericans--fall into that category. We should be interested in anything \nthat would create shovel-ready jobs.\n  We have heard from this administration, particularly when we were \ndebating the stimulus, that we need shovel-ready jobs. We need jobs \nthat can get people back to work immediately. This perfectly fits that \ndescription.\n  I would ask the Senator from North Dakota if it is his understanding, \nas well, that it is actually thousands of jobs that would be created as \na result of building a pipeline. Wouldn't that be something we would \nadd to the argument? There are many arguments, but this certainly is \none, when we are talking about a sluggish economy where growth \ncontinues to hover in that 1- to 2-percent range, to get the economy \ngrowing and expanding again.\n  This is not only to get the immediate construction jobs but, when we \nare producing energy in this country and lowering the cost of energy \nbecause we are actually having more of it produced here as opposed to \nimporting it from somewhere else around the world, it gives us a \ncompetitive advantage. It is good for economic growth and good for job \ncreation.\n  Would the Senator from North Dakota speak to the issue of jobs and \nwhat his understanding is in terms of jobs that would be created if, in \nfact, we did move forward with the pipeline?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Absolutely. This is a project, a $7.9 billion \nconstruction project. The administration's State Department has been \nworking with a variety of agencies and has developed a number of \nenvironmental impact statements. In their own analysis, they indicate \nmore than 40,000 jobs. We are talking of a project that costs billions \nto build and will create more than 40,000 jobs by their own admission. \nIn the construction process alone, it will generate hundreds of \nmillions in tax revenue at the local, State, and Federal level. It has \na huge economic impact at\n\n[[Page S6417]]\n\na time when we need to get people working and when we need to get our \neconomy growing.\n  At this time, I wish to acknowledge this is very much a bipartisan \napproach. Look, to get anything done, we have to be bipartisan. When we \nshow a concurrent resolution from the Senate and the House, both Houses \nof Congress together, with Republicans and Democrats coming together \nand saying this is in the national interest, that is a powerful \nstatement. It is one I certainly hope the President will acknowledge \nand make the same decision that this project truly is in the national \ninterest.\n  On that note, I see Senator Mary Landrieu, my esteemed colleague from \nLouisiana, who is also a prime sponsor of this resolution. Also, I see \nSenator Begich from the great State of Alaska and Senator Heitkamp from \nmy State of North Dakota. They are here as well. I wish to acknowledge \nthem and acknowledge their cosponsorship of this legislation.\n  I will read the sponsors we have onboard already. There will be more. \nThen I will turn to the esteemed Senator from Louisiana, who was so \ninstrumental in crafting this resolution.\n  I wish to mention all of our sponsors in addition to the Senator from \nLouisiana, Ms. Landrieu, Senator Thune of South Dakota, Senator \nMcConnell of Kentucky, Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, Senator Begich \nof Alaska, Senator Cornyn of Texas, Senator Blunt of Missouri, Senator \nRisch of Idaho, Senator Mark Pryor of Arkansas, and there will be \nothers.\n  I mention these Senators both to thank them and to make the point \nthis is very much a bipartisan effort because we are serious about \ngetting something done. This is not about making a statement. This is \nabout getting something done in a bipartisan way from the people's \nrepresentatives across this great Nation.\n  I yield to Senator Landrieu, the coauthor of this resolution, and \nthank her for all of her great work on this project.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I am proud to join a fairly large group of colleagues, \nboth Republicans and Democrats, to talk about the importance of energy \nfor our country, domestic energy and all facets of it, particularly the \nKeystone Pipeline. It will transport oil primarily--potentially gas as \nwell but oil right now--from an important part of the country to the \nrefineries that can refine it so our people can use it here and, as \nappropriate, export it as appropriate around the world.\n  Canada is a very strong ally of ours. We have reduced our imports of \noil because of the fallout of demand and the increased production \ndomestically, but we can do more.\n  Before I get into my brief remarks, I see Senator Shaheen and Senator \nPortman on the floor. I wish to commend them for bringing an energy \nbill to the floor, a conservation energy bill to the floor, that will \nnot only make America more secure, but it has the potential to create \nliterally millions of jobs in our country, the kinds of jobs we want \nthat rely on cutting-edge science, technology, and manufacturing here \nat home. It is hard to get a bill out of any committee with bipartisan \nsupport.\n\n  The chairman, Senator Wyden, has done a fabulous job, in my view, \nnavigating between many very tough currents to get this bill to the \nfloor. It is disheartening that some people would come to the floor \nthis morning to talk about health care or to talk about nonrelated \nissues to energy, when this government needs to be focused on creating \njobs, supporting the middle class, and growing the middle class.\n  I am proud to be here talking about what most Americans want us to \ntalk about, which is creating jobs at home, ending this recession, \nexpanding our economy, and investing in good old American know-how \nabout how to get things done.\n  I am pleased to spend my time talking about things that are positive; \nthat is, the Keystone Pipeline. I am proud to be the lead cosponsor on \nthe Democratic side with Senator Hoeven, and we are about to be joined \nby the Senator from Alaska and Senator Heitkamp.\n  I again urge support of our resolution, which we believe will have \nmore than 60 votes. It will urge the President and push us to a place \nwhere we can approve the Keystone Pipeline as an important \ninfrastructure component to our efforts to greatly expand production.\n  There is horizontal drilling that is going on, and there is fracking \nthat can be done very safely with a minimum environmental blueprint. \nThere are some opportunities, as the chairman knows, to export gas. We \nare a big gas producer and consumer. I understand the balance that is \nnecessary.\n  We most certainly don't want to export 100 percent of our production, \nbut we do need to export enough to send a signal to the marketplace \nthat if you risk your money to find it, you will have a market for it. \nThese are the fundamentals of any kind of market. Whether it is the \ncotton market, the gas market or the oil market, they all operate the \nsame.\n  We are excited about what is happening in America. From our view in \nLouisiana, this is one of the most exciting times we have had in \ndecades because there is so much interest in more domestic production. \nSo many more jobs are being created.\n  In Senator Heitkamp's State, I think they have run out of workers. I \nam not even sure we can build their roads fast enough to help us get \nthis production underway.\n  It is revitalizing the manufacturing base of America. All of my \nindustries are excited. I am going to finally say this because there \nare others who wish to talk.\n  Just between Lafayette, LA, and Lake Charles, two medium-sized cities \nin south Louisiana, just the southern part of our State, there is \ncurrently $60 billion of investments being made today because of this \nextraordinary new domestic production.\n  The Keystone is part of this. I know there are some environmental \nconcerns. I think they are unfounded. I think they have been disputed \nby any number of groups. What I am here to say is this is about \nAmerican jobs. This is about building our infrastructure in America for \nmore domestic production.\n  Let's get over this hump and let's get together, focus on that which \nmatters to the American people and not undermine this bill. I am going \nto end with this--not undermine this bill. This is an important \ncomponent to do what we can to get this Keystone Pipeline moving in a \ncooperative spirit, which is not often found on the floor.\n  I wish to ask the Senator from Alaska what he heard in Alaska, \nbecause I have heard nothing but green light for the Keystone when I \nwas home in Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. BEGICH. I thank the Chair.\n  We find ourselves always on the floor on oil and gas issues, but our \ngroup has grown. We have Senator Heitkamp of North Dakota. We \nappreciate that she is here on these issues. It is always interesting \non Keystone and hearing my colleagues on the other side.\n  It is one of the issues where Democrats and Republicans are focused \non what is right for America, creating jobs and opportunities, not just \nhaving partisan fights. We are focused on what is important.\n  When you think about energy at all, this is what I hear a lot back \nhome.\n  First, get us off of energy from countries that don't like us. That \nis the first priority. We do a lot of business with countries that do \nnot like us because we don't have our own production or have the \ncapacity to tap into production.\n  Second, of course, Alaska is a huge producer of oil. I know my \nfriends from North Dakota will tell me they outrank us today.\n  I will remind them when the OCS opens, the Outer Continental Shelf, \nwe will have a few 26-plus billion barrels of oil which we have already \nstarted moving into production in the sense of exploration. We hope \nnext year they get back into the OCS. We feel very confident about \nthat.\n  Alaska, similar to Louisiana, North Dakota, Montana, and others, is \nabundant with this resource which will get us off foreign oil. This is \nwhat I hear over and over. What a better deal than to work with our \nCanadian partners from whom we import enormous amounts of oil.\n  Why not work on a pipeline with a country that is unbelievably always\n\n[[Page S6418]]\n\nthere for us. We know a little bit about pipelines in Alaska. We built \na pretty large one going through some tough terrain and very \nenvironmentally sensitive areas. It has been operating successfully for \ndecades, and that was under the old rules of construction.\n  Today, with the new engineering technology, there is an unbelievable \npotential to bring that resource to our refineries. The choice isn't \nthey are not going to do it. I think this is a false argument you hear \nout there. People say: If we just stop this pipeline, they will not \nproduce it.\n  No. Canada is a sovereign country. They have a resource they intend \nto utilize. They will ship this resource to us to refine or China. I \ndon't know about you, but there is a clear difference in environmental \nstandards between China and the United States. By the way, those jobs \naren't our jobs in China. These jobs were produced by a project, the \npipeline alone. I know there are people who discount it--well, it is \nonly a temporary project, it only has so many jobs.\n  First off, they have a labor agreement. It is unbelievable when you \nthink about it, laborers, Teamsters, IBEW, plumbers, pipefitters who \nwill be trained and employed. For North Dakota and Montana, a resource \nof oil being developed there, this creates access. This is access for \ntheir product, U.S. oil, to be able to be moved through the pipeline, \nrefined down south and in incredibly strict environmental \nstandards. And yes, some might be exported, some might stay in the \nUnited States. But at the end of the day, it is about creating American \njobs.\n\n  From Alaska's perspective, people say: Well, why are you for this, if \nyou want to do your own projects in Alaska? Because it is good for all \nof us. I want to see Chukchi Sea and Beaufort Sea in Alaska built, and \nthey are on their way. The National Petroleum Reserve will see the \nfirst production. I was up there 2 weeks ago with the Secretary of the \nInterior and saw CD-5, which is a platform being developed, and over \nthe next 2 years that well alone will produce 14,000 to 15,000 barrels \na day--just one well. They have plans for two or three more. This is an \nincredible component, but Keystone is the safest way to move this.\n  And oh, by the way, we already have oil coming from that tar sand \nthrough the Chicago region--about half a million barrels already. Now \nunless I have missed something, I didn't hear a lot of complaints on \nthat. So this will up the capacity to 1.1, the southern section that is \nbeing built. It is about American jobs, an American resource, and it is \nthe right decision.\n  I am somewhat perplexed by the administration's delay after delay \nafter delay and arguments why somehow something else can't happen. In \nreality, this project is a good project, a good jobs project, and it \nhas a lot of opportunity not only for us here in the United States, in \nthe sense of the lower 48--where I am standing today in this Chamber--\nbut for Alaskans too. Because the oil industry moves around. We have \npeople working in the North Dakota region from Alaska; we have people \ndown in Louisiana and vice versa. It is a unified system of employment. \nIt is good jobs, good jobs, good jobs. Did I mention that?\n  This is the United States and Canada, which have been partners for \nyears. Why would we not purchase this oil or work through this and \nbuild this pipeline to make sure this oil from this great partner is \nrefined in the United States, rather than focusing on oil from \ncountries that do not like us? It makes no sense to me.\n  So I thank my friend from Louisiana for asking. I hear it all the \ntime. I know we have been joined by the Senator from North Dakota, and \nprobably the Senator from Louisiana is very excited to have another \nperson here on the floor with us talking about oil and gas issues \nbecause sometimes we feel a little lonely, but on this bill, this \namendment, there are a lot of us.\n  I know my friend from North Dakota has a lot to say because I heard \nit during her campaign. So I will turn to my colleague from North \nDakota, if it is okay with the Senator from Louisiana, and ask my \nfriend from North Dakota if she has some additional comments or what \nshe is also hearing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I would ask at this time to be able to \npropound a unanimous consent request with respect to Keystone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, there has been a bit of confusion with \nrespect to the handling of Keystone because I was under the impression \nwe would be completed at this time with the discussion of Keystone. So \nI ask unanimous consent that at this time we allow Senator Heitkamp to \nspeak with respect to her position on Keystone, then Senator Portman \nwould go next. Both of them have indicated they will be brief. I would \nthen ask, for purposes of this part of the discussion, that Senator \nBoxer and Senator Whitehouse be recognized for their views with respect \nto Keystone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. I thank the Senator from Oregon for clarification and \nfor this opportunity to very briefly speak on the significance of the \nKeystone Pipeline.\n  We have been waiting 5 years. We fought a world war and defeated the \nNazis in less time than we have been waiting to have a determination on \nthe Keystone Pipeline. I know there is a lot of discussion here and a \nlot of concern and, obviously, this has gotten to be a national issue \nof some magnitude. But when we look at it, overwhelmingly the building \nof the Keystone Pipeline is supported by the American people.\n  Why is that? Because it is good for our national security, and I \nthink we heard how good it is for employment and job opportunities, but \nI want to spend a moment in recognizing that in this time we are in \nright now, given the events of last week and early this week, the \nAmerican public is looking for a way to allow us to express our \nnational security interests without worrying about where our oil comes \nfrom.\n  I was fortunate enough during the August recess to go up to the oil \nsands in Alberta and spend some time with the Premier, spending some \ntime with their environmental community, spending some time with their \nlabor community, and talked about the developments there and talked \nabout the enormous opportunities. When we take a look at Alberta and \nNorth Dakota, these are two of the fastest growing economies in the \nworld because of this development. We should not walk away from this \ndelivery system, which is very remote and very much needs this pipeline \nin order to participate in this great North American energy \nindependence opportunity we have.\n  As a final note, I want to talk about the relationship we have with \nCanada and the responsibility we have to our largest trading partner, \nthe responsibility we have to one of our best and longest allies. In \nNorth Dakota, we celebrate that border with a peace garden that is on \nboth sides of the border, recognizing this is unheard of in the history \nof the world. This is not some rogue country that doesn't have \nenvironmental standards. They are adopting standards and doing \neverything they can to deal with what they believe is their \nresponsibility for global climate change, and they shake their head and \nwonder why it is we are waiting 5 years down here to provide them with \nan opportunity to work with us to create a North America that is energy \nindependent. So I can't say enough about how frustrating this issue has \nbeen, but I think how important it is that we have again a sense of the \nSenate because we represent the people. We represent the majority \nopinion in this country which says build the pipeline.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I appreciate the comments of my \ncolleague from North Dakota and my other colleague from North Dakota, \nwho has been leading this effort over the past couple of years to get \nto a point where we can have, as Senator Heitkamp said, the views of \nthe American people here on the floor.\n  Although this discussion is on the energy efficiency bill, and this \nis more of a production issue, I do think it is consistent with the \nlegislation. As we have\n\n[[Page S6419]]\n\ntalked about from the start, we need an ``all of the above'' energy \nstrategy, and it has to include, in my view, efficiency as one of those \nkey elements, but also producing more. We have talked about the \nimportance of producing more oil and gas in this country to make us \nless energy dependent on other countries, where we are currently, and \nunfortunately, dependent on volatile and dangerous parts of the world \nfor our energy, which affects the price at the pump by virtue of the \nspike in gasoline prices we have seen. It also affects our economy. So \nI think this goes hand in hand.\n  As the Senator from North Dakota knows--because I am a cosponsor of \nthe legislation he has proposed before, and I also supported his \namendment on the budget resolution--I would also make an argument here \non efficiency. One of the things that has been frustrating to me on \nthis Keystone debate is the discussion seems to be that somehow there \nwould be more emissions and less efficiency if we were to allow the \npipeline. I think the opposite is true. This is oil which would come, \nas we know, from the oil sands in Canada, but it also comes from the \nBakken in North Dakota and other places. Right now most of that is \nbeing trucked or trained, and that is certainly not an efficient way to \nmove oil and gas. In fact, it is a more dangerous way to do it.\n  It is difficult for me to see how there are efficiency gains by \ncontinuing the current policy rather than allowing this pipeline to be \nbuilt, which will create tens of thousands of jobs, which is why the \nAFL-CIO Building Trades Council supports it, but also it has efficiency \nimprovements.\n  Second, if we don't build the pipeline and cannot access the oil from \nCanada, which helps us to become North American energy independent from \nan area of the world which is not volatile and dangerous, then that oil \nwill be sold. As the Senator from Alaska said, it is a sovereign \ncountry, they will figure out where the market is, and that market, \napparently, is China. Our environmental standards in this country are, \nof course, at a higher level than in China. So in terms of an emissions \nissue and an environmental issue it would be an advantage to send it to \nour high-tech refineries on the gulf coast.\n  Second, how would that oil get there? Not by pipeline, but by rail \nand by truck and, ultimately, by tanker. Certainly that is not a more \nefficient way to deliver that product, regardless of whether there were \nenvironmental standards at the end of that process. Of course they \nwould not be at the level as they would be in the United States.\n  So I do think this is an important amendment, and I do think it ties \ninto this overall strategy of having an ``all of the above'' energy \nstrategy. I do think the way the Senator from North Dakota has phrased \nthis amendment it gives us the opportunity to have our views be \nexpressed, but also the House to have its views be expressed, and \nhopefully would result in the President making an important decision \nthat is in the interest of economic growth, in the interest of good \nenergy policy, as I said earlier, and in the interest, ultimately, of \nefficiency and fewer emissions, not more emissions.\n  With that, with the understanding we have a time agreement here, I \nappreciate the opportunity to talk a little about it. I appreciate the \nfact the Senator from North Dakota is also on the energy committee with \nme and also supports our energy efficiency bill, which is the \nunderlying bill, and also offered an amendment yesterday that we talked \nabout and that is a very important improvement in terms of the energy \nefficiency issue he offered with the Senator from Minnesota, Senator \nKlobuchar. He has another amendment, I understand, that deals directly \nwith efficiency. So we appreciate working with him on that.\n  Again, hopefully we can resolve these unrelated issues and move \nforward with this energy efficiency legislation and have votes on some \nof these energy issues.\n  With that, I yield to my colleague from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I want to express some thanks as we \nclose out our colloquy, and I want to begin with the Senator from \nOregon, who is the chairman of the energy committee, as well as our \nranking member, the Senator from Alaska--Senator Wyden from Oregon and \nSenator Murkowski from Alaska. I thank them for working to get energy \nlegislation to the floor and for the way they are working to be \ninclusive and bipartisan in this effort.\n  I also thank Senator Shaheen from the great State of New Hampshire \nand Senator Portman from the great State of Ohio for their \nbipartisanship in this energy efficiency bill, which truly creates \nefficiencies and is a natural piece of legislation for us to add this \namendment to, as Senator Portman described.\n  Again, recognizing the time constraints, I want to finish by thanking \nthe Senator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu, for her coauthorship of this \nlegislation, and for all of the Senators who have joined with us in \nthis bipartisan interest on the Keystone XL Pipeline, which we truly \nbelieve is in the national interest.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I rise to talk about why approval of the \nKeystone XL Pipeline is not in the national interest and why it places \nour Nation's families at risk.\n  There is a reason why it is taking a long time to get this approved. \nIt is because it is very controversial and there are some irrefutable \nfacts that I think need to be laid on the table about this pipeline.\n  I also want to say how discouraging it is to me to see a Senator come \nhere and offer an unrelated amendment that has to be seen, in my mind, \nas an attack on working people who happen to work for their country and \ntry and derail this bill. It is wrong. And let's be clear: If a Senator \ndoesn't want to have health care here, they should take themselves out \nof it. If they don't think their staff deserves to have a health care \nbenefit as an employer, tell them they do not have to take it. Tell \nthem to opt out. Tell them it would please you if they didn't have that \nbenefit.\n  To see a good bill such as this, shepherded by a great chairman, Ron \nWyden, and two terrific Senators here on this particular piece of \nlegislation, Senators Shaheen and Portman, get derailed because someone \nwants to attack working people is unfortunate--absolutely unfortunate.\n  Let me say that one of my colleagues said: Oh, this is all the people \nin America want the XL pipeline. I don't know. Maybe in her State that \nis true. It is not true in my State. And it is not true in many States. \nAs a matter of fact, that is why there have been 1.2 million comments \nto the State Department from various public agencies and private \nparties, from Native American tribes and others.\n  I think when the President said on June 25 that our national \ninterests will be served only if this project does not significantly \nexacerbate the problem of carbon pollution, he was speaking the truth. \nYou would have to be asleep for 10 or 15 years to not believe that \ncarbon pollution is dangerous to the planet. I know Senator Whitehouse \nwill follow with his comments on this. But when I listened to the \ndebate, I didn't hear one person say carbon pollution is a problem.\n  The Keystone XL would ship one of the dirtiest fuels on the planet \nthrough America's heartland and through critical water supplies. It \nwill significantly increase carbon pollution, and the oil will be \nexported to other countries. So to stand here and not even address the \nissue of pollution and not even admit that most of this oil will be \nexported, I do not think is a fair argument.\n  To put it into context, if the full range of products produced from \ntar sands crude oil, such as petroleum coke, is taken into account, EPA \nestimates that tar sands would create 30 percent more carbon pollution \nthan domestic oil. We would see carbon pollution of over 18 million \nmore metric tons per year, according to the State Department.\n  You would have to be asleep not to notice Superstorm Sandy and what \nit cost us not only in lives and in damage but in dollars. You would \nhave to be asleep if you haven't noticed that Yosemite National Park is \nclose to burning. Thank the Lord God we had firefighters who were \nprotecting it. The fire is still burning. You would have to be asleep \nif you didn't notice what is\n\n[[Page S6420]]\n\nhappening to our oceans and to our economy.\n  We had just the other day a meeting of folks out there, from farmers \nto recreational industry people, who were saying their world is \nchanging because of climate change. But you don't hear our colleagues \ntalking about that. They say: Oh, there is no problem. How about the \nfact that a Nebraska study found that Keystone XL is likely to have 91 \nmajor spills over its 50-year lifetime? And tar sands oil will be very \ndifficult to capture if the pipelines rupture.\n  For all the talk about jobs, when we look at the permanent jobs, we \nare looking at 50 jobs. What are the chances that there are going to be \nspills?\n  Just look at what happened in 2010, when over a million gallons of \ntar sands oil spilled into the Kalamazoo River in Michigan. Over three \nyears later, the clean-up of the river--which has cost almost $1 \nbillion--still continues, and the local communities are still \nstruggling.\n  Another reminder of the terrible price that Americans pay when tar \nsands pipelines rupture occurred in March 2013 in Mayflower, Arkansas. \nIn that case, 22 residents were evacuated when tar sands oil ran \nthrough the neighborhood streets, and contaminated a local lake.\n  The risks are real, and we cannot forget the damage that tar sands \noil spills have already caused in our communities.\n  What are the chances that we are going to hurt this planet? And what \nare the chances that if we were smart and we did what this underlying \nbill is doing--which is make sure we have incentives for alternatives \nthat are clean, that are made in America, that work for us--there will \nbe many more jobs? That is the kind of alternative I want to see.\n  They may pass their amendment if we ever get to it, if they can stop \nthis attack on our working people that is evident in an amendment that \nhas been offered, but I know there is a better way, and I would like to \nsee us make sure that when we say XL is great, we consider all of the \nreasons there is so much controversy surrounding it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am very pleased to come to the floor \ntoday after my chairman on the Environment and Public Works Committee, \nSenator Boxer, and offer an alternative view to that expressed by my \ndistinguished colleagues who are supporting the Keystone XL Pipeline. \nIn my view, that pipeline takes us in the wrong direction, from an \nenergy point of view, and it supports the wrong kind of energy.\n  If we look at the growth of green and renewable energy, there are \nactually more jobs in clean, green, and renewable energy than there are \nin the oil industry. I had that question reviewed by Politifact, and I \ngot a ``true'' on it. The energy jobs of the future are going to be in \nclean, green, renewable, sustainable energy, and this takes us in \nexactly the wrong direction.\n  Moreover, they are temporary jobs. I think the State Department put \nthe number of final jobs produced by the Keystone Pipeline at between \n35 and 50--not thousands, not tens of thousands, but between 35 and 50. \nWhat we might as well do is actually go out there and build a pyramid \nand put tens of thousands of people to work stacking up a pyramid, and \nwe would actually do better because that pyramid wouldn't pollute. \nThose are the kinds of jobs we are talking about.\n  We would be far better off investing in clean, green, renewable, \nsustainable energy technologies and developing those markets which are \ngoing to be the competitive markets in the future rather than chasing \nthe tail of fossil fuel technology.\n  I didn't hear everybody speak the whole time. I had to come over from \nmy office, and I missed that point, and I had to take a call, and I \nmissed that point. I believe I heard seven Senators speak for 45 \nminutes, and I believe the words ``climate change'' and the words \n``carbon pollution'' were never mentioned.\n  We are going to pipe out the tar sands from Canada, and we are going \nto add 18.7 million metric tons of additional carbon pollution. That is \njust from refining the tar sands. We are going to add another 3.5 \nmillion metric tons from the electricity required to heat and pump the \nstuff through the pipeline. The refining cost is the equivalent of 5 \nmillion cars out on the road that otherwise wouldn't be there. The \nelectricity cost is another 600,000 cars on the road that wouldn't be \nthere.\n  We just hit 400 parts per million carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. \nFor as long as the human species has existed on this planet, we have \nbeen in a window of 175 to 300 parts per million. It has been a long \nand successful run for homo sapiens in that comfortable window of \nenvironmental protection. We are out of it. We are out of it for the \nfirst time in probably millions of years--at a minimum, 800,000 years, \nmore likely 3 million or more. We are not out of it a little bit--not \n301, not 315--but 400 and climbing. This adds to that problem.\n  It is irresponsible to discuss energy and refuse to discuss climate \nchange, refuse to discuss carbon pollution. But for our friends on the \nother side and for our friends from the coal- and oil-producing States, \ncarbon pollution and climate change are the Lord Voldemorts of the \ndiscussion: It is he who must not be named. They are just going to \nignore it, pretend it isn't there at all. That is wildly irresponsible \nin the environment we are in right now, as we see the effects of \nclimate change occurring on our coasts, in our oceans, in \nacidification, to our fisheries, to our farms, and to our forests. You \nreally don't have to go very far in this country to find something that \nis being affected by the changes in our climate from our carbon \npollution, and all of that for 50 long-term jobs. I don't think this is \nthe good deal our colleagues suggest.\n  I will close by saying two things. First, on energy independence, \nthis pipeline connects to Port Arthur, TX, a foreign-trade tax-free \nzone. That is where it is going to go, and then it is going to be \nshipped overseas to other countries. This isn't going to protect \nAmerican energy independence; this is going to protect energy \ncorporation profits. That is what is behind all of this.\n  We have a supplemental environmental impact statement coming from the \nState Department. You can believe the people who for some reason can't \nseem to get the phrase ``climate change'' or ``carbon pollution'' to \ncome out of their mouths or you can believe me. You can believe \nwhomever you want. But from a point of view of being fair to the \nprocess, we should probably wait until the State Department has \nconcluded the supplemental environmental impact statement they are now \nworking on before we make too many rash decisions about polluting tar \nsands oil, investing in that dirty addition to our energy mix, and \ncontinuing to suck funding and support away from the energy sources of \nthe future, which are the clean ones and the sustainable ones and the \nones that aren't going to keep shoving the carbon dioxide concentration \nin our atmosphere over and beyond where it is right now, which is 400, \nwhere it hasn't been in millions of years, where it hasn't been in the \nhistory of the human species.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I ask unanimous consent that we be in a period of debate \nonly until 2 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am going to be very brief. I think \nSenator Boxer and Senator Whitehouse have made a number of very \nimportant points with respect to this climate debate and particularly \nthe scientific finding that we are now at 400 parts per million. That \nought to be a wake-up call to everyone with respect to the challenge of \nclimate and carbon.\n  I was in North Dakota last week at the request of our colleague and \nfriend Senator Hoeven. Certainly, there is a lot of common ground that \ncan be found on this natural gas issue. Of course, natural gas is 50 \npercent cleaner than the other fossil fuels. It has\n\n[[Page S6421]]\n\nbeen a real catalyst for the American manufacturing sector, with a lot \nof companies that for economic reasons felt they had to do business \noverseas coming back to do business here in the United States. Of \ncourse, it has a direct connection to the expansion of green power--\nsolar and wind and others--because it can be a key factor in making \nthose energy sources part of an embedded power system.\n  So there are a lot of opportunities for common ground. For example, \nwhen I was with Senator Hoeven last week, we talked about--the way I \nwould characterize it--a wide berth for the States with respect to \nregulating natural gas because the geology differs for various States.\n  So when we look at these kinds of approaches, there is an opportunity \nfor common ground. Clearly, this is a good set of challenges to have. \nWe have the natural gas, the world wants it, and the pricing advantage \nis ours. This is a good set of challenges to have.\n  I do think it is important to recognize that the debate about the \npipeline has changed very significantly since it was originally \nproposed. I am particularly struck by the fact that we now have the CEO \nof the largest producer in the Bakken essentially saying that the \npipeline isn't needed, and we have the CEO of the largest oil company \nin Canada saying that Keystone isn't needed. I will be very specific \nand use their words.\n  Last month Harold Hamm, the CEO of the largest oil producer in the \nBakken shale, Continental, said the Keystone Pipeline was not \n``critical.'' For anybody who is interested in the politics, Mr. Hamm \nisn't some flaming liberal. He was Mitt Romney's chief energy adviser.\n  Just a few days ago we had the CEO of Suncor--by some estimates, \nCanada's largest oil company--saying that the lack of a pipeline, in \nhis words, has ``certainly not constrained [his company's] growth'' and \nthat his best estimate would be that it has not ``significantly \nconstrained the rest of the market, either.''\n  So we recently had the CEO of the largest producer in the Bakken \nsaying the pipeline is not needed. We have the CEO of the largest oil \ncompany in Canada saying essentially the same thing. That basically \nleaves only the refiners. It turns out they have been pretty much \nsaying the same thing.\n  A few days ago the Wall Street Journal had a story with the headline \n``U.S. Refiners Don't Care if Keystone Gets Built.''\n  Valero, one of the largest refiners in the country, said Keystone \nwas, in their words, not ``critical'' to their business. This is a \nrefiner that signed up early to get oil from Keystone, spent billions \nupgrading their refiners in the gulf to process it, and they now say it \nis not critical.\n  We are going to have further discussion about this. I want it \nunderstood that I think Senator Boxer and Senator Whitehouse have made \nsome important points. I am particularly struck by how, as you get into \nthis issue, there are significant questions about how this \nfundamentally benefits the American people. My hope--and I have talked \nabout this with Senators on both sides of the aisle--is that we can \nwork out the various procedural questions with respect to how Keystone \ncomes up here on the floor of the Senate. In fact, I am going to go \nspend about 45 minutes trying to be part of an effort to see if we can \nfind some common ground so we can get the issues that Senators want \naddressed done, done promptly, done once, and then we can go to the \nenergy efficiency legislation and have a vote, up or down, on the \nmerits of that bill.\n  Senator Portman is here. He and Senator Shaheen have done an \nexcellent job. Frankly, they had done a good job of keeping this issue \nbipartisan in the interests of energy security, in the interests of \ncreating more jobs and a cleaner environment. They had done that before \nthe bill arrived on floor, and the bill has been improved since it came \nto the floor with bipartisan amendments that colleagues have offered.\n  I appreciate that we are now in a period of debate only until 2 \no'clock.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I ask to engage in a colloquy with the Senator from \nMississippi for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, Senator Wicker and I come to the floor \nto talk about a very important matter. We appreciate the opportunity to \ntalk about our amendment that will update the current EISA statute to \nreflect the evolution of green building rating systems and create a \nmore strategic approach for the Federal Government so that we have the \nhighest performing, most efficient, and most cost-effective buildings. \nI would like to ask Senator Wicker to go into a little bit more detail, \nand then I will come back to some more information about our amendment \nthat has been filed.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Louisiana and \nagree that this is a very important amendment because it addresses a \nnumber of issues that are important to American industries. In \nparticular, the amendment specifies that the Department of Energy and \nthe General Services Administration must allow the use of multiple \ngreen building rating systems for both commercial and residential \nbuildings. We should avoid the situation where the Federal Government \nendorses one green building standard over others.\n  DOE and GSA ought to support competition and allow the free market to \nproduce the best energy-efficient buildings at the lowest cost. They \nalso ought to support the use of domestically produced materials, such \nas sustainable wood and green technologies.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from \nMississippi. He and I have worked very closely together on the \namendment we are talking about today, and hopefully we will get a vote \non it sometime in the near future. But I am also concerned that many \nrating systems arbitrarily discriminate against domestically produced \nproducts based on arbitrary hazards, without consideration for risk of \nexposure and supporting scientific data.\n  Our amendment--and we have worked very carefully on this--will \naddress this issue by requiring an ongoing review of private sector \ngreen building certification systems and allowing for the exclusion of \nportions of green building certification systems that are found to be \ndiscriminatory. This will not preclude efforts to exclude or reduce \nexposure to known environmental risks, such as radon, formaldehyde, or \nvolatile organic compounds; however, it will ensure that the risk of \nexposure is not ignored.\n  This process will support competition among green building \ncertification systems and encourage existing systems to revise portions \nof their systems that are determined to be discriminatory to domestic \nproducts.\n  Let me add that since many of these products that are in question \ncome from Mississippi and Louisiana as well as other States, that is \nwhat has engaged and piqued our interest.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, the Senator from Louisiana is exactly \ncorrect. Basically, what we are saying is there is more than one way to \nget where we need to go when it comes to green buildings. This \namendment is a step forward to ensure GSA's and DOE's green building \npolicies are fair and effective.\n  I also wish to point out that this amendment requires the \nconsideration of environmental impacts across the entire life cycle of \na building material or product by incorporating a life-cycle \nassessment. This will ensure that the Federal Government is utilizing \ngreen building certification systems that are the most efficient.\n  I thank the Senator from Louisiana, and I wholeheartedly endorse our \namendment and call on our colleagues to vote on it.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, let me finally say that we believe our \namendment strengthens--not weakens but strengthens--the Energy Savings \nand Industrial Competitiveness Act as introduced by Senators Shaheen \nand Portman by encouraging improvements to green building rating \nsystems\n\n[[Page S6422]]\n\nand policies. I look forward to seeing this bipartisan legislation move \nforward. It is in that spirit that our colloquy and our amendment is \nbeing offered.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I wish to discuss amendments \nI am offering to the Shaheen-Portman bill. However, I have been \nwatching what has been happening on the floor, and I don't understand \nthis because I have some amendments I am working on which are \nbipartisan. I know there have been major endorsements of this bill from \nthe Business Roundtable, from the Chamber, and many others. What we are \nseeing here is a very targeted attack from the other side to prevent \nall of these bipartisan amendments from coming forward. All the debate \nthis week has been good on this bill, but we aren't able to offer \namendments. We are not having the ability to debate amendments. That is \nvery important. So I am one of the Members who is going to be talking \nabout amendments. I have been reaching out. I think they are very \nbipartisan amendments. But we are being blocked, and that is very \nunfortunate.\n  I rise today to discuss several amendments to the Energy Savings and \nIndustrial Competitiveness Act. First, I wish to thank Senators Shaheen \nand Portman for working on this important legislation, for working on \nit so long, and for being so diligent about it. Energy efficiency is \ncritical for our future, and this bill takes us in the right direction.\n  There are a few areas where I think we need to take additional steps. \nMy first amendment connects energy and water efficiency. Many people do \nnot realize that water efficiency is energy efficiency. Three to four \npercent of our national electricity consumption is for water and \nwastewater services each year. That is about 5 to 6 billion kilowatts \nand $4 billion a year in costs. That is a lot of energy and it is a lot \nof money.\n  When we talk to the water management professionals in our States, \nthey tell us these costs add up quickly. The energy-water nexus is one \nthat cannot be ignored.\n  The energy committee has been engaged in the water-energy nexus for \nsome time, both under Senator Bingaman and continuing under the \nleadership of Senator Wyden. I know the Presiding Officer is on the \ncommittee with Senator Wyden, and I know he is very interested. The \nSenator from Oregon has done a very good job in terms of trying to pull \nall of this together.\n  Water and wastewater utilities are typically the largest consumers of \nenergy in towns and cities, often accounting for 30 to 40 percent of \ntotal energy consumed. As ratepayers, we all pay those bills. And \ninefficient systems don't just cost money; they waste huge amounts of \nwater. As much as 6 billion gallons per year is lost. Let me repeat \nthat: Six billion gallons of water a year is wasted. That is enough \nwater to serve 10 of the largest cities in this country or the entire \nState of California.\n  To continue this practice while the Southwest and other regions are \nfacing extreme drought is ridiculous, and in some of our communities it \nis downright dangerous. We can do better, and we have to do better. \nEfficiency of U.S. water and wastewater pumping facilities is about 55 \npercent. But for a new, well-designed pumping facility, it is 80 \npercent. Consider this: If water and wastewater utilities could reduce \nenergy use by just 10 percent, it would save about $400 million \nannually.\n  My amendment calls for $15 million to support smart water system \npilot projects, supporting innovation and the kinds of investments \ntoday that will pay off tomorrow. Our amendment is fully offset. This \nis not about adding cost; it is about reducing the cost to ratepayers.\n  I believe this amendment is worthy of bipartisan support. We have \nsupport from almost every major water utility association and from the \ntechnology industry. It should be included on any amendment list, \nespecially on a bipartisan amendment list. I am talking about the \nblocking that is going on from the other side of the aisle to prevent \ngood, bipartisan amendments from coming forward.\n  Putting innovation to work in three to five cities is a first step. \nThe program will be jointly managed by the Department of Energy and the \nEPA to create incentives for public-private partnerships, lowering the \ncost of innovation, applying best practices to the public and private \nsectors, and to eventually benefit communities across the entire \ncountry.\n  I also plan to introduce a second more ambitious amendment to improve \nthe water efficiency of our homes, to save water, and to lower costs \nfor American families. The average family of 4 in our country uses 400 \ngallons of water every day. My amendment will provide funds to States, \nlocal government, and utilities to implement incentives and rebates for \ncustomers to purchase water-efficient products and landscaping.\n  In addition, the amendment will authorize the EPA WaterSense Program, \nsimilar to the ENERGY STAR Program, to enable WaterSense to improve and \nexpand its labeling system for water-efficient appliances, plumbing \nfixtures, landscaping, and new homes.\n  My amendment also establishes a grant program called Blue Bank, \nproviding water and sewer utilities with grants for important \ninvestments in climate change adaptation, including advanced water \nsupply management, modification of infrastructure, improved planning, \nand water efficiency and reuse.\n  Finally, I will offer an amendment for a renewable electricity \nstandard, to get to 25 percent renewable electricity by 2025. The first \nlegislation I introduced as a Senator was to create a national RES. The \ntime is right to put this idea back on the table. Renewables are a \ncrucial part of our energy mix. A national RES will create thousands of \njobs that cannot be outsourced and will help revitalize rural America. \nIt has worked in over half of the States in the country by guaranteeing \na market for wind and sun and other clean energy sources.\n  Renewable energy is a key partner of energy efficiency in a modern \nenergy system. They are often installed side by side, increasing the \npayback in energy savings and reducing emissions and fighting climate \nchange.\n  Our Nation needs a ``do it all, do it right'' energy policy to \naddress global climate change and to reduce our dependence on foreign \noil--those are the big threats--but also a big opportunity. We can \ncreate a clean energy economy that leads the world in producing the \njobs of the future.\n  Again, I wish to thank my colleagues Senator Shaheen and Senator \nPortman for their work and I look forward to continued bipartisan \nefforts as we address the energy needs of our country.\n  I would say to Senator Shaheen and to Senator Wyden, I find it very \nunfortunate that we are in a position now where so many Members have \ncome to the floor to offer bipartisan amendments and my colleagues have \nbeen stopped in their tracks from moving this bill forward, dealing \nwith and voting on those amendments. We should let the Senate work its \nwill. I know my colleagues are trying to cut through that, but I wish \nthe other side of the aisle would let us proceed to the bipartisan \namendments and move forward.\n  I see Senator Wyden is here on the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank Senator Udall for steering the Senate toward a \nvery sensible, important area.\n  Last year, it is my understanding we had the worst drought in our \ncountry's history since the Dust Bowl. So we are looking at some \nserious drought issues in the days ahead. The Senator from New Mexico \nis suggesting we start very modestly. The Senator has some voluntary \nefforts. These are not mandatory, not run from Washington, one size \nfits all--leviathans that would inflict pain and trauma on local \ncommunities. They are voluntary. They are about saving water, which is \nabout saving energy.\n\n  In our part of the world, the West, this is especially important. But \nI\n\n[[Page S6423]]\n\nthink what we saw last year, with these extraordinary drought \nconditions, is this is something that is not going to go away.\n  So Senator Murkowski and I have already begun to look at these \nissues. I will just say for myself, I am looking forward to very \nclosely working with the Senator on these issues, and I am very hopeful \nwe can get the Senator's amendment up and we can work out some way to \nadvance this idea because water is, frankly, an issue that has gotten \nshort shrift. It has gotten short shrift in the West. It has gotten \nshort shrift in terms of our policy debate. I think the Senator is \nclearly starting us in the right direction. I look forward to working \nclosely with the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, before the Senator from New Mexico \nleaves, I just want to also commend him for his work. I have not seen \nthe amendment he would like to offer. Like him, I am so disappointed he \nis not able to offer it right now, that it is being held up on an \nunrelated issue. But as the Senator pointed out, there is a clear nexus \nbetween water and energy use.\n  I remember visiting the wastewater treatment plant in North Conway, \nNH, and being told that 4 percent of our energy use in the country is \nwith wastewater treatment. I have seen that at the Portsmouth Naval \nShipyard, where they do such great work on Los Angeles class and \nVirginia class submarines. As they have cut back their energy use, they \nhave also been able to cut back their use of water in a way that has \nprovided for tens of thousands of gallons in savings in water, as well \nas tremendous savings in energy use. So this is a connection we all \nought to be making as we look at our energy use in the future.\n  I truly appreciate the Senator working on this amendment, his \ninterest in offering it, and I certainly hope we are going to get to \nthe point where we can actually debate the amendments people are \nbringing to the floor because we have so much bipartisan support for \nnot only the bill but for so many amendments.\n  I appreciate my colleague from Ohio, Senator Portman, his partnership \nin working on this legislation. This is a win-win-win, and we need to \nmove this forward.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, let me thank Senator Shaheen \nand Senator Wyden, and I see Senator Portman is on the floor too. I \njust want to say to Senator Portman that the partnership he and Senator \nShaheen have developed has been incredibly impressive. I know how hard \nthey have worked on this bill, and our intent is that many of us want \nto try to improve it. We want to try to bring forward bipartisan \namendments.\n  So I hope we can all work together to make sure whatever roadblocks \nand objections are out there, that we can deal with this bill in a way \nwhere bipartisan amendments can be voted on, we can move the bill \nalong, and let the Senate work its will because this is the kind of \nbill I believe can pass in the House of Representatives because these \ntwo Senators have worked so hard over the last couple years.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I understand where we are. I would make \nthe following comments to my colleagues who have not been here quite as \nlong as I have. Regular order, before they got here, was you could \noffer any amendment on any bill anytime you wanted. Since we have had \nthe leadership that we have, we have changed that, and now we consider \nit abnormal that somebody wants to address a critical issue in our \ncountry on a bill, and we find that distasteful.\n  I will remind you that 92 percent of the people in this country think \neverybody involved in the FEHBP who is working for the Federal \nGovernment ought to be in the exchanges. To not allow a vote on an \namendment is cowardly because it says: I do not want to vote on that \nissue.\n  So there is a very big difference from what we have heard said and \nwhat the reality has been--until 2006, the end of 2006 and the starting \nof the Congress in 2007. I think it is important.\n  I have several amendments to this bill, several that I think will \nmake it much more compliant with what the Constitution says, and I will \nnot offer them today until this logjam of lack of minority rights is \nrelieved. But I do have some comments.\n  The intention of this bill is good. I appreciate what Senator Shaheen \nand Senator Portman have done. But I have some real differences of \nopinion about the effectiveness and the command and controls centered \nin Washington that come about through this bill.\n  If you actually read this little book called the U.S. Constitution, \nwe are going down the same path again that says Washington knows best, \nbecause in this bill the Secretary is going to determine final plans, \nfinal efficiency standards--not the standards groups that are out there \nbecause the Secretary will have to do it.\n  So my hope is that we can get back to offering amendments on this \nbill--all the amendments that need to be offered, whether it is germane \nto the bill or not, as the Senate functioned for over 200 years. There \nshould not be an issue that we cannot debate an amendment in the Senate \nat any time. That is the history of the Senate. That is what makes it a \ngreat body. That is what allows our Republic, our constitutional \nRepublic, to function.\n  I would say I am disappointed that the majority leader does not want \nto have a vote on something that 92 percent of the people in this \ncountry agree with and that he is not allowing Senator Vitter to have \nhis amendment to address an issue people are burned up over--creating \nsomething better for us than what the average American can get. It is a \ntin ear. We do not pay attention to the American public at our own \nrisk.\n  I will not spend any more time. I have several amendments. I will try \nto offer them in the first part of next week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, first, I wish to thank my colleague from \nOklahoma. He does have some amendments, and we are looking forward to \nthem. We have talked about this bill and some of his amendments. I \nthink you are going to find it is a good debate and some of the \namendments will be helpful to the legislation.\n  We have tried, as you know, on this legislation to focus on exactly \nwhat my friend from Oklahoma talked about, which is to make sure we are \nnot putting new mandates on the private sector. There are none in this \nlegislation--none.\n  We do have some mandates on the Federal Government. It basically asks \nthe Federal Government to practice what it preaches. Being the biggest \nuser of energy, not just in the country but in the world, we believe \nthe Federal Government can do a lot better. So things such as requiring \nthe Federal Government to use some efficiency standards and some of the \nbest practices saves all of us, as taxpayers, money. It is the right \nthing to do for taxpayers. It is also the right thing to do for energy \nefficiency and for our environment.\n  We are not focused on mandates. In fact, we are explicitly focused on \nonly incentives, only best practices. There are lots of amendments that \nwill be offered on the floor that will try to add some mandates, and as \na group we do not think that is the way to go, just to be clear on \nthat.\n  Also, in terms of the development of building efficiency standards, \nit is not the Secretary who will establish them. The Secretary provides \nthe technical assistance, but the authority is preserved actually in \nthe private standard-making bodies. I think that is appropriate.\n  So we have gone out of our way to make this a voluntary bill, not a \nmandate bill. We have gone out of our way to ensure that this is \nresponsive to what we are hearing out there among the business \ncommunity: They are looking for better research, technology, looking \nfor some deployable technologies to be able to improve their \nefficiency, to make them more competitive with their global \ncompetitors, because around the world other companies are competing \nwith our companies in Ohio or in the other\n\n[[Page S6424]]\n\nStates represented in this great body. What we find is we are not going \nto want to compete on labor rates with developing countries. We do not \nwant to lower our standards. Where we can compete is on the energy \ninput into our manufacturing process. We are spending more than we have \nto because we are not as efficient as other countries, even some \nemerging economies, much less developed economies.\n  So that is part of the reason the National Association of \nManufacturers, the Chamber of Commerce, the Ohio manufacturers are \nsupporting this legislation strongly. Over 200 businesses are \nsupporting it because they believe this will help them to compete and \nwin in the global marketplace.\n  By the way, the Chamber of Commerce agreed today that they are going \nto key vote this legislation. They are strongly in support of it. I \nappreciate that. I think that will help to make the point this is not \nabout Washington knows best; this is about ensuring that people have \nthe information, the transparency, the technology, the research to be \nable to have a true ``all of the above'' energy strategy--yes, \nincluding producing more energy, which I am strongly for. We talked \nabout that earlier. We need to produce more in this country. But also \nwe could use the energy we have more efficiently. That combination is a \nrecipe for success because it will help create jobs, it will help \nensure we have a cleaner environment, and it will certainly help to \nmake us less dependent on foreign oil and other forms of energy, which \nis in our national security interests, as we have seen so poignantly \nover the last couple weeks in the Middle East and other dangerous, \nvolatile parts of the world we are relying on for our energy.\n  I thank my colleague from Oklahoma. I look forward to working with \nhim on his amendments when he is able to offer them. Again, I would \nstrongly urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to look \ncarefully at the actual legislation because there is some information \nout there that may or may not be accurate in terms of the subsidies or \nmandates in this legislation. There are no mandates in the private \nsector, period, and we have deliberately crafted it in that manner.\n  With that, I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, very briefly, Leader Reid has indicated \nto me that we continue to look for a way to move forward on the energy \nefficiency issue and there may be votes still today. The leader will \nhave more to say, certainly, as he has a chance to explore these issues \nin the afternoon.\n  Thank you.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. I know there are still discussions ongoing, including \nwith the majority leader, about moving forward with this bill and with \nthe important ``no Washington exemption'' issue. I want to encourage \nthat discussion toward a positive resolution and state again that I am \nopen to multiple ways in which all of that can be accomplished. Let me \nspecifically address one issue.\n  There is some concern that somehow I am going to demand multiple \nvotes on this between now and October. What I am looking for is one \nvote straight up on this issue between now and October 1. It can be on \nthis bill, it can be on the CR. But I am looking for that one vote. If \nwe do have, for instance, an amendment vote on this bill, and the issue \nis added perhaps to the CR from the House and comes over, then I am \nsure we would have to deal with it again. But that would not be of my \nmaking or of my demanding.\n  What I am looking for here in the Senate is simply to lock down and \nbe assured of one fair up-or-down vote on this crucial issue between \nnow and October. Of course, if this issue persists, I am sure I will \ntalk about it and bring it up again, including after October 1. There \nare plenty of different ways to get there, all of which would be \nconsistent with moving forward on the energy amendments and moving \nforward on this bill.\n  I think there are a lot of reasonable ways to solve this. I am open \nto any and all of them.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nset aside so that I may call up my own amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. VITTER. Reserving the right to object, I propose an alternative \nunanimous consent. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment \nbe set aside and the following amendments be made pending: the Sanders \namendment, Bennet amendment No. 1847, Udall amendment No. 1845, \nKlobuchar amendment No. 1856, Franken amendment No. 1855, Blumenthal \namendment No. 1878, and Vitter amendment No. 1866; that on Tuesday, \nSeptember 17, at a time to be determined jointly by the majority and \nthe minority leaders, my amendment No. 1866 and the side-by-side \namendment on the same subject by the majority leader be made pending \nand receive 60 minutes of debate evenly divided and controlled by the \nmajority bill manager and me; that no points of order be in order in \nrelation to these two amendments; that upon expiration of the time for \ndebate, without any intervening motions or debate, the Senate then \nproceed to votes on these two amendments subject to a 60-vote threshold \nfor passage; and that subsequent to each vote, a motion to reconsider \neach vote be made and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modified request?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard to the modified request.\n  Is there objection to the original request?\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, again reserving my right to object, I \nwish to outline another alternative which I think is a very reasonable \npath forward on this amendment and on the bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the Vitter amendment No. 1866 and \nthen on Wednesday, September 25, 2013, at 3 p.m., the Senate discharge \nthe relevant committees from consideration of my bill, the No Exemption \nfor Washington from ObamaCare Act, and then proceed immediately to \nconsideration of that bill; that without any intervening motions or \ndebate, the Senate proceed with 60 minutes of debate on that bill \nevenly divided and controlled by the majority leader and me; that the \nbill not be subject to any amendments or motions to commit; that after \ndebate has expired, the bill be engrossed for a third reading, read a \nthird time, and the Senate immediately vote on final passage subject to \na 60-vote threshold; and that the motion to reconsider be made and laid \nupon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modified request?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Is there objection to the original request?\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I do object, sadly, that we can't choose \nsuch a path forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. It is clear there are differences of opinion in this \nbody and in this country on how we proceed on energy matters. But I \nthink--at least I hope--that there is pretty unanimous agreement that \nenergy efficiency makes a whole lot of sense.\n  At a time when the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory tells us \nthat over half of the total energy produced in the United States is \nwasted due to inefficiency, I would hope that regardless of one's \npolitical perspective, we could all move forward together to create a \nmore energy-efficient society which will, A, lower the cost of fuel for \nmillions of Americans; B, cut back on greenhouse gas emissions and help \nus\n\n[[Page S6425]]\n\ndeal with the planetary crisis of global warming; and C, as we make our \nNation more energy efficient, we can create tens and tens of thousands \nof jobs. If there is a win-win-win situation out there, I think this is \nit, and I would hope we could move forward. This is why, because of the \nwin-win-win aspect of this bill, I think we should be supporting the \nShaheen-Portman bill, which has earned support from a wide array of \nSenators and organizations from across the political spectrum.\n  I think Senator Shaheen would agree this is a fairly modest bill. It \nis not transforming the world, but this is a small step forward in \ndoing what certainly needs to be done and that there should be very \nlittle disagreement about.\n  As part of this effort, Chairman Wyden and I are proposing what I \nthink is a significant amendment that complements the overall thrust of \nthe bill. Our amendment is called the Residential Energy Savings Act, \nwhich, in fact, is a strong complement to the Shaheen-Portman bill. Our \nlegislation focuses on residential energy efficiency--residential. We \ndo that because we understand that in Vermont, in Louisiana, in Oregon, \nall over this country, there are tens of millions of people who \nunderstand they are wasting energy. When it gets cold, the heat is \ngoing through their roofs, through their windows, and through their \nwalls. They are wasting money every single day, but they don't have the \nmodest investment they need to make their homes more energy efficient. \nThis is the problem Senator Wyden and I are trying to address. We are \nfocusing attention on homeowners all over this country.\n  The Residential Energy Savings Act will save money for homeowners and \ntenants and cut energy use by lowering the cost of energy efficiency \nupgrades. It will also create jobs for installers and for the companies \nthat manufacture windows, insulation, and other energy efficiency \nmaterials.\n  How does this amendment work? It is pretty simple. This bill makes \nloans available to States through the State Energy Program of the U.S. \nDepartment of Energy to create or expand existing financing programs. \nThis provides homeowners and tenants with access to low-cost, consumer-\nfriendly capital for energy efficiency projects. Homeowners and tenants \nuse the funding to invest in energy efficiency. Here is the exciting \npart of this concept: They pay back the loans through their energy \nsavings and the U.S. Treasury gets the money back. In other words, we \nlend somebody $15,000 to make their home more energy efficient. They \nsave $1,000 a year. They pay back the loan by those savings in their \nfuel bill. At the end of the day--for 15 years in that example--they \nare not paying any more for fuel, but in the 16th year they are going \nto see significant savings in their bill, and throughout the process we \nsee significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, we \nhave created jobs in a number of areas--the installers and those people \nwho manufacture energy-efficient products.\n  These are the key features of the amendment introduced by Senator \nWyden and me:\n  It is technology neutral. People will make their own choices about \nhow they want to go forward.\n  This amendment provides States with a high level of flexibility to \nsupport existing State and local programs or to design new financing \nprograms that best fit their own circumstances and need.\n\n  This amendment supports effective existing State and local programs \nand supports innovations designed to improve energy efficiency \nfinancing. There are no mandates. Participation is entirely voluntary. \nThe Department of Energy must consider regional diversity in issuing \nloans. This amendment encourages public-private partnerships and other \nstrategies for leveraging public dollars.\n  The bill incorporates annual reporting requirements to ensure \naccountability and provides valuable data to consumers, State and local \ngovernments, lenders, utilities, and the real estate industry about \nfinancing industry upgrades. The residential energy savings amendment \nis complementary to energy efficiency proposals by other Senators. \nSupporters of this amendment include the Alliance to Save Energy, the \nAmerican Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, the American \nInstitute of Architects, Efficiency First, and the National Association \nof State Energy Officials.\n  Residential energy efficiency--helping homeowners save energy and \nmoney while creating jobs at the same time--is an approach that is \nenjoyed by people all over the country.\n  Let me reiterate the bottom line. This is a very simple concept. The \nFederal Government lends money to the States to be repaid back in full. \nThis is not an expense for the Federal Government. There will be an \nadministrative cost.\n  We think at the end of the day there will be $1 billion of effort in \nmaking residential homes more energy efficient. In Vermont, you don't \nhave to be a genius or an economist to know that it is pretty stupid to \nbe heating your home in the wintertime and seeing that heat go out the \nwindow or the roof or the walls. In Vermont, and I am sure all over \nthis country, we have a lot of older homes. They are wasting a lot of \nenergy. People are spending much more money than they should.\n  I will never forget doing an event with two sisters from Barre, VT, \nwho were in their eighties. The State put forth a weatherization \nprogram. They reduced the cost of their fuel bill by something like 50 \npercent. Their home was much more comfortable. This is what we should \nbe doing all over this country, but working families and middle-class \nfamilies in many ways can't come up with that $10-, $15-, $20,000 they \nneed in order to make this happen. This bill gives money to the States, \nand they give it to the homeowners. The homeowners repay it based on \nreductions in fuel bills. The Federal Government gets its money back. \nWe create jobs, we cut greenhouse gas emissions, and we save consumers \nhuge sums of money. If this is not a win-win-win situation, I am not \nsure what is.\n  I thank Senator Wyden for his hard work on this amendment. We look \nforward to working with my colleagues to see that it gets passed.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I am going to be very brief.\n  I thank Senator Cornyn for his courtesy. To respond, I am very \npleased to be supportive of this amendment. I just want my colleagues \nto get one number with respect to this proposal. Our assessment is that \nfor every dollar made available under this particular amendment, it \nwould leverage $10 worth of loans for homeowners to weatherize across \nthe country. So when people talk about getting bang for the buck, that \nis the relevant number. Make $1 available through the States--this is \nnot run by the Federal Government--under this program, and that results \nin $10 worth of loans being made for weatherization across the country. \nI think that is getting bang for the buck.\n\n  I thank Senator Cornyn for his courtesy. I hope colleagues, when we \nget a chance to vote, will vote positively on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, our friends on the other side of the \naisle keep promising that once the President's health care law is fully \nimplemented it will deliver fabulous results. Unfortunately, they have \na massive credibility problem. Indeed, despite all the promises made to \nthe American people during the debate and passage of the Affordable \nCare Act in 2009 and 2010, every week brings more evidence the \nPresident's health care law is, No. 1, already discouraging full-time \njob creation; No. 2, destroying many existing full-time jobs; No. 3, \nhampering medical innovation; and No. 4, encouraging further executive \nbranch overreach.\n  And of course the worst is yet to come because, amazingly enough, \nonce this law was passed in 2010, it wasn't implemented before the 2010 \nmid-term elections, nor was it implemented fully between then and the \n2012 Presidential election. So the American people have yet to feel the \nfull force of the implementation of ObamaCare, even though what we see \nalready is discouraging, to say the least.\n  Once ObamaCare is fully implemented, it will drive up individual \ninsurance premiums. We have already seen some indication of that around\n\n[[Page S6426]]\n\nthe country in the rates that have been announced for the individual \nexchanges that have been created. That is because of phenomena such as \nthe guaranteed issue and age banding, which basically have engineered \nthe insurance industry so that it no longer is insurance but prepaid \nhealth care.\n  Secondly, it will cause millions of Americans to lose their current \ncoverage. Remember when the President said: If you like what you have, \nyou can keep it? That is proving not to be true.\n  Thirdly, it will weaken Medicare and Medicaid.\n  My colleagues may recall that during the 4th of July recess the \nadministration announced it would not be confirming taxpayer \neligibility for the ObamaCare premium subsidies until 2015, even though \nthe subsidies will begin flowing--taxpayer dollars will be flowing--1 \nyear earlier in 2014. In other words, for 1 year, under the \nadministration's current plan, people will be able to get taxpayer \ndollars without any independent verification of what they are \nrepresenting in terms of their eligibility for those tax dollars. That \nis correct, without any independent verification--no safeguards for \noverpayments or fraud.\n  Earlier today the House of Representatives passed legislation that \nwould delay the ObamaCare premium subsidies until the administration \nestablishes a system for verifying eligibility, to make sure those tax \ndollars are not stolen or obtained under false pretenses.\n  It is one of those measures that should be a no-brainer. After all, \nwhatever one thinks about health care reform, everyone should want to \nprevent waste, fraud, and abuse. Yet our colleagues on the other side \nof the Capitol, House Democrats, were almost unanimously opposed to the \nNo Subsidies Without Verification Act, and the majority leader in this \nbody refuses to allow a vote in the Senate on similar legislation.\n  Again, this is what one outside of Washington and the beltway would \nthink is a no-brainer, but here we have an alternate universe, \napparently. Apparently, our Democratic friends are okay with that, but \nI certainly am not, and neither are the 26 million people in Texas I \nhave the privilege of representing.\n  At a time when the Federal Government is almost $17 trillion in debt, \nshouldn't we be doing everything humanly possible to try and crack down \non wasteful spending and fraud? Well, I would think so. But here is yet \nanother question: Wasn't ObamaCare itself sold on the basis it would \nreduce health care fraud? Wasn't it supposed to improve oversight? That \nis what we were told during 2009 and 2010. Apparently those promises \nhave now been forgotten.\n  If the President and his allies are wondering why they have such an \nenormous credibility gap on ObamaCare, the answer is actually quite \nsimple: So many of the promises that were made in selling ObamaCare \nhave simply not been kept. It is simply not performing as advertised.\n  Think about what we have learned in the last few months alone. In \nJuly, the National Bureau of Economic Research published a study \nshowing ObamaCare may cause substantial declines in aggregate \nemployment. In other words, unemployment will go up and the number of \npeople getting work will go down. That same month, the Wall Street \nJournal reported that between 2009 and 2012 the number of doctors \nopting out of Medicare nearly tripled.\n  In my State, if you are covered by Medicare you might find a doctor \nwho will take a new Medicare patient and you might not. Only about two-\nthirds of Texas physicians will take a new Medicare patient because the \nreimbursements have been slashed to the point where many doctors simply \ncan't economically take a new Medicare patient. This is like the old \nshell game where people are told they have coverage but they can't find \na doctor willing to see them based on that coverage.\n  The problem for Medicaid is even worse. In mid-August the University \nof Virginia announced that ObamaCare is projected to add $7.3 million \nto the cost of the university's health plan in 2014 alone. That is just \nat the University of Virginia. About a week later, National Journal \nreported that for the vast majority of Americans, premium prices will \nbe higher in the individual exchanges than they are paying currently \nfor employer-sponsored benefits.\n  I have two daughters in their early thirties. They are the ones, \nunder ObamaCare, who are going to have to bear the financial burden for \nsubsidizing the health care costs for older Americans, and it is \nunfair. This is the very same cohort of the population that is finding \nit harder to find jobs and finding the burdens of our broken \nentitlement programs are going to be visited upon them, not to mention \ntheir share of the Federal debt, which boils down to about $53,000 \neach. If I were a 30-year-old or 30-something, I would be pretty \nirritated at my elders for not being responsible and pushing that debt \nand those responsibilities on me--if I were them.\n\n  Last week Investor's Business Daily reported that ``more than 250 \nemployers had cut work hours, jobs, or taken other steps to avoid \nObamaCare costs.'' We heard a lot about this, including from some of \nthe largest labor unions in the country, saying many employers, in \norder to avoid the employer mandate and other mandates associated with \nObamaCare, were simply taking full-time jobs and turning them into \npart-time work, obviously resulting in people taking a cut in their \nincome.\n  A few days ago, a local media outlet in Michigan reported ObamaCare \nwill cost the medical device company Stryker ``fully 20 percent of its \ntotal research and development investments.'' This has to do with the \nmedical device tax which is part of the way ObamaCare was paid for and \nwhich punishes medical device companies. These companies create jobs \nhere in the United States. They create new and innovative medical \nequipment that helps improve outcomes and makes our lives better. Yet \nthey are being targeted under ObamaCare with this medical device tax \nand it is chasing jobs overseas and stifling innovative medical \nresearch.\n  In addition, the Huffington Post has reported the Trader Joe's \ngrocery chain will be dropping health insurance coverage for all \nemployees who work fewer than 30 hours a week.\n  As I said, we have seen some of our organized labor unions, \nparticularly the one representing IRS employees that announced it does \nnot want its members to receive health insurance through ObamaCare \nexchanges, even though, under ObamaCare, the IRS will be implementing \nthe exchanges for everyone else, as well as the individual mandate. In \nother words, the very people responsible for administering ObamaCare \nwant no part of joining the exchanges, and that should speak volumes to \nall of us.\n  The truth is it wasn't supposed to be this way. Whether you were one \nof the most ardent advocates for the Affordable Care Act or whether you \nwere a skeptic, such as I, who didn't believe it could work, I think \nthe facts are undeniable. The Affordable Care Act was supposed to help \nthe middle class, not cut their work hours and threaten their benefits. \nIt was supposed to help young people, not drive up their insurance \npremiums. It was supposed to help medical innovation, not lead to \nfactory closures and cancellations. And it was supposed to help make \nMedicaid stronger, not overload a broken system. It was sold on the \nbasis it would strengthen Medicare, not trigger an exodus of doctors \nfrom seeing Medicare patients.\n  My point is: Whether you were one of the most ardent advocates or \nwhether you were a skeptic, ObamaCare is not living up to the hopes and \nthe promises made by its biggest fans, and we should work together to \ntry and find a way to deal with that in a responsible way.\n  One final point. The President has apparently decided ObamaCare says \nwhatever he wants it to say. For example, he has unilaterally delayed \nboth the employer mandate and the eligibility verification I spoke \nabout a moment ago simply because it has proven to be politically \ninconvenient. Many of my constituents are outraged at this and wonder \nhow a law that applies to everyone in America can be enforced on a \npiecemeal or cherry-picked basis. My only explanation to them is the \nPresident controls the executive branch of government, including the \nDepartment of Justice. Congress has no authority to enforce these laws, \nonly to pass the laws, expecting the executive branch will administer \nthe laws\n\n[[Page S6427]]\n\nand enforce the laws as written. But that hasn't happened. Meanwhile, \nthe IRS has announced it will violate the text of the law and issue \nhealth subsidies through Federal exchanges, even though the law clearly \nstates those subsidies can only be issued through the State exchanges.\n  Here again is another example in this case of the IRS rewriting the \nlaw where it proves to be convenient to achieve a particular outcome. \nThis should be and is an outrage. Indeed, on issues ranging from the \ntax subsidies to the employer mandate, ObamaCare has effectively become \ngovernment by waiver.\n  There is no way to sugarcoat it. The law is damaging our economy, \ndamaging our health care system, and weakening our constitutional \nchecks and balances and our legacy of being a Nation of laws, not of \nmen. That is why the best course of action, I believe, is to delay \nObamaCare, dismantle ObamaCare, and replace ObamaCare.\n  I have cosponsored legislation numerous times that would delay both \nthe employer and individual mandates, for example. It was introduced \nlast night, the latest version, as an amendment to the current energy \nefficiency bill. My ultimate goal is to replace ObamaCare with patient-\ncentered reforms that do several important things we could all, \nhopefully, agree are important principles for whatever our health care \nsystem is.\n  First of all, a replacement would make sure a health care system is \nin place where price and quality information is fully transparent and \nreadily available. That is so people can compare and shop and use the \nmarket system to make sure people who provide those goods and services \ndo so at as low a price and at as high a quality as they can get.\n  A replacement system would include a Tax Code that treats \nindividually purchased health insurance the same way as employer-\nprovided health insurance.\n  A replacement system would make sure every American is protected \nagainst catastrophic expenses.\n  This is one of the phony ways I have heard people talk against this \nidea. They say: Well, if you replace ObamaCare, you will eliminate the \nsystem against dealing with people with preexisting conditions. That is \nfalse. That is not true. You don't need this behemoth legislation that \ncosts $2.7 trillion--or whatever the final figure is--in order to deal \nwith people with preexisting conditions. What we can do is simply help \nfund the State-based insurance exchanges that provide coverage to \npeople with preexisting conditions at a far cheaper price and still \naccomplish the same goal.\n  So anyone who tells you we have to have ObamaCare to deal with \npreexisting conditions is trying to sell you a bill of goods.\n  We should have a system replacing ObamaCare that gives all Americans \nan opportunity to save money in tax-free health savings accounts so \nthey can use that money to pay for their health bills. If they don't \nneed the money for that purpose, they can save it like an IRA or some \nother savings account tax free.\n  We should have a replacement system where the States will have much \ngreater flexibility in improving Medicaid. We would be happy in Texas \nfor the Federal Government to write us a check for its share of \nMedicaid and let us administer it in a much more cost-effective and a \nmuch higher quality sort of way.\n  We need a system to replace ObamaCare that protects Medicare for \nfuture generations and a system that preserves the right for the most \nimportant decisions about medical care to be left to patients and their \nphysicians.\n  I remain confident that someday we can make this kind of health care \nsystem a reality. First, we need to delay if we can't replace it now. \nCertainly, as ObamaCare starts crumbling in on itself, we need to \nprotect the American people from this catastrophic and epic failure and \nprovide an alternative that has the sort of qualities I have described \na moment ago--which will make sure that people have access to quality \nhealth care at an affordable price in a way that doesn't let Washington \ninterfere with doctor-patient relationships or decisions we ought to \nreserve to ourselves and our families when it comes to our health care.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, often it is a little hard to divine what \nis actually going on here on the floor of the Senate.\n  I want to make sure folks understand that the pending business before \nthe Senate is a bipartisan bill offered by the Senator from New \nHampshire and the Senator from Ohio on energy efficiency. That is the \npending business before the Senate. One of the measures of this bill is \nthe extraordinary support. We have business groups such as the Chamber \nof Commerce, National Association of Manufacturers, and the Roundtable \njoining with the Natural Resources Defense Council. That is not exactly \na coalition that comes up every single day, but you have it because of \nthe good work Senator Shaheen and Senator Portman have done. They had \nall that in place as we came to the Senate.\n  Since that time--and it has been 1\\1/2\\ days now that we have been on \nthis bill--Senator after Senator has come to the floor of the Senate in \na bipartisan fashion, starting with Senator Inhofe and Senator Carper--\nand the list goes on and on--have come to the floor to say this is a \ngood energy efficiency bill and we have some ideas on how we can make \nit even better. So they have offered their bipartisan amendments, and \nthey have not been able to get a vote on those bipartisan amendments to \na bipartisan bill. I think it would be fair to say that if they could \nget votes on those bipartisan amendments, they would pass \noverwhelmingly. We have others certainly in the wings as well.\n  Who are the losers because we haven't been able to get those \namendments up and we haven't been able to move ahead on this bill? I \nwould say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, the people \nwho are the losers are the consumers. They are the job creators. If you \nlook at the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, a \nbusiness-oriented group, this is legislation that will create thousands \nof jobs. And taxpayers are the losers, because a bipartisan bill which \nwould be improved by the bipartisan amendments colleagues want to offer \ncannot go forward because it is stuck in this procedural morass.\n  So you have consumers losing out on billions of dollars of savings, \nthousands of jobs, and our country missing out on dramatic energy \nsavings.\n  That seems foolish even by the sometimes stilted standards of the \nbeltway, to pass up that kind of opportunity. The reason the breadth \nand support of this bill is so extensive is because this bill isn't run \nfrom a Washington Federal leviathan. This doesn't involve any mandates. \nThe focus is on States and the private sector.\n  Senator Sanders talked about an idea in terms of weatherization that \nI find very appealing. It is voluntary, like virtually this entire bill \nis.\n  I was very pleased when Leader Reid indicated he was continuing to \nlook for a way to move forward. I and others have been talking to \nvarious Senators in the leadership about how to do that. I hope that \nwill be possible and we will see tangible progress made here shortly.\n  I think it is so important to respond to what people said all summer \nto Senators, in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Oregon, and across the \ncountry; that is, people at home are tired of this food fight in \nWashington, tired of the bickering and the pettiness. They would like \nto see us show up, work together in a bipartisan way on issues that are \nfundamental to their well-being, and, in particular, grow an economy \nwith more opportunities for high-skilled, high-wage jobs in the middle \nclass. That is certainly what happens when we promote some of the top \ntechnologies associated with energy efficiency.\n  The public said Senators ought to go back to Washington and do \nexactly what Senator Shaheen and Senator Portman have been talking \nabout, an effort which has been supplemented by similar kinds of \nbipartisan proposals from various Senators.\n  That is where we are 1\\1/2\\ days after the bill, Senator after \nSenator coming to the floor wanting to offer relevant bipartisan \namendments to a bill that will be good for the productivity of the \ncountry, good for our environment, and good for our job creation.\n\n[[Page S6428]]\n\n  I am going to stay at my post here and hope we can find a path to go \nforward. I know there are discussions taking place. I am very grateful \nbecause Senator Shaheen and Senator Portman have been here at their \nposts trying to advance the bipartisan focus of this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I thank Chairman Wyden for making the \nclarification that we are here on the floor not to talk about health \ncare or other unrelated issues, but we are here to talk about energy.\n  As the Senator pointed out yesterday, as Senator Murkowski, Senator \nPortman, and I have pointed out, this is the first energy bill to come \nto the floor since 2007. On an issue that is so critical to the future \nof our country, it is nice to finally be having a debate. It is nice to \nfinally be able to listen to people on both sides of the aisle talking \nabout why energy is so important, and talking about their amendments \nand the difference those amendments will make for people across this \ncountry.\n  We were interrupted by health care after Senator Wyden and Senator \nSanders talked about the amendment on residential energy efficiency, \nbut I wanted to applaud both for that effort. Senator Sanders talked \nabout the challenges faced by people in his home State of Vermont. My \nneighboring State of New Hampshire, the Presiding Officer's State of \nMassachusetts, the State of Oregon are all States that are cold weather \nStates. In New Hampshire we have an inordinate number of people who \nheat with home heating oil which is very expensive, and we have a lot \nof old buildings. Because New Hampshire is one of the first States in \nthe original Thirteen Colonies, we have a lot of buildings in the State \nthat are old that need to be upgraded to be more energy efficient so \npeople can afford their heating bills. This amendment that Senators \nwould like to introduce--if we can ever get on the bill and get to some \nof these bipartisan amendments--would help address the challenges that \npeople in the Northeast, the upper West, and the upper Midwest all face \nwith the high costs of heating their homes in the wintertime.\n  I would also point out that it is not just important to us in the \nNorth to have more energy-efficient homes, even though in the northeast \nwe have more older homes. In the South it is equally important because \nair conditioning is very expensive as well. So people who can have \ntheir homes be more efficient when they are trying to cool them in the \nsummer also benefit.\n  This is an amendment that is a win-win. As Senator Wyden pointed out \nfor the last 1\\1/2\\ days, this legislation is a win-win for everybody. \nIt is a win on job creation, it is a win on helping to prevent \npollution in our environment, it is a win on reducing the threat from \ndependence on foreign oil. So the connection to national security is \nthere. And it is a win in terms of saving consumers the cost of energy.\n  In New Hampshire we have the sixth highest energy costs in the \ncountry, so we need to be able to save on energy costs because it is \ngood for our businesses, it is good for our residents to not have to \npay those high costs. I hope we can find some way to move forward on \nthis bill and move forward on these bipartisan amendments, because this \nis a place where we can come to some agreement, we can work together, \nand we can get this done. The people of this country are expecting us \nto do that.\n  I thank Senator Wyden for his leadership, and Senator Murkowski. \nHopefully we are going to stay here, we will hopefully keep having \npeople come to the floor to talk about their amendments and what we can \ndo, once we can get on this bill, to make a difference.\n  The bottom line here is that in addition to all the other good things \nit would do with the amendments that are being offered with the \nunderlying bill, this will help create jobs, and it will do it in a way \nthat doesn't cost a lot of money in terms of subsidizing those jobs. It \nis the private sector working in conjunction with public policy in a \nway that will encourage that job creation.\n  I continue to be hopeful we can come to some agreement and move this \nlegislation in a way that I know the people of this country are \nexpecting.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, we are going to stay and continue to work \nwith colleagues on both sides of the aisle to try to find a path \nforward on the bill.\n  I want to announce from Senator Reid, as a courtesy to all Senators--\nbecause we know their schedules are busy--there will be no recorded \nvotes today, so that Senators can have that information.\n  For all of us who are working on a path to move forward on this \nbipartisan energy efficiency bill, we will continue those efforts \nthrough the afternoon.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Access to Justice\n\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, I am confident the Presiding Officer is \nfamiliar with the phrase, ``Justice too long delayed is justice \ndenied.'' Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., wrote that from his jail cell in \nBirmingham. ``Justice too long delayed is justice denied.''\n  I rise to talk about justice and the budgetary choices Congress is \nmaking that impact the ability of the American people to access the \njustice promised them by our Constitution.\n  Our Federal courts translate laws into justice and effective courts \nrequire fair judges, well-trained lawyers, and efficient clerks. As the \nPresiding Officer well knows, the fewer judges and clerks we have and \nthe reduced resources in time-saving technology, the fewer cases can be \nhandled at a time, and the longer cases will take to process. ``Justice \ntoo long delayed is justice denied.''\n  Of course, staffing the courts costs money, but when we compare it to \nthe rest of the Federal Government, this whole branch is a relative \nbargain. For every $100 spent by our Federal Government, just 19 cents \ngoes to the entire Federal court system. We actually spend more every \nmonth on the ongoing conduct of operations in Afghanistan than we do an \nentire year on the whole Federal court system. It is, relatively \nspeaking, a bargain.\n  With caseloads growing and budgets shrinking, though, the Federal \ncourts have been cutting back where they could for years now, \nmethodically looking for ways to cut costs, reduce overhead, lower \npersonnel, and generally be more efficient. They are both \nmetaphorically and literally looking under every cushion for coins, \nlooking for ways to cut costs, reduce overhead, lower their personnel \ncosts, whatever they can do to keep up.\n  Then came the sequester. Of course, when it was first conceived, the \nsequester was designed to be so reckless, so dangerous that it would \ndrive Congress back to the negotiating table--House and Senate, \nRepublicans and Democrats--to confront our Nation's annual deficits and \ncraft a bipartisan agreement. But, sadly, it failed. Congress as a \nwhole failed, and the across-the-board spending cuts engineered in the \nsequester went into effect.\n  It has been almost 7 months since they came into effect and, in that \ntime, I have heard from hundreds of Delawareans, as I am sure all the \nMembers have heard from their constituents, directly impacted by the \nsequester. I have spoken with dumbfounded employees at Dover Air Force \nBase--more than 1,000 hard-working Delawareans, many of them veterans \nwho can't believe that they individually are paying the price because \nCongress, House and Senate, Republicans and Democrats, can't craft a \nresponsible deal.\n  Kevin from Magnolia asked me: Why are my family and I being punished \nwith a 20-percent pay cut this quarter? Bryan from Houston--both towns \nin Delaware--said he was tired of being the one to suffer the \nconsequences because, in his view, Congress can't get the budgetary job \ndone.\n  My heart goes out to Kevin and Bryan and every Delawarean who has\n\n[[Page S6429]]\n\ncalled my office, written to me, and talked to me about the sequester. \nI agree with them. It needs to be replaced responsibly and urgently. As \na member of the Budget Committee, I have worked with my colleagues to \ncraft a budget that would replace sequester in a way that is in keeping \nwith our core values and the priority of investing in America's future.\n  Not many people, though, are talking about how the sequester is \nimpacting our courts. We hear about how sequester is affecting defense. \nWe hear about how it is affecting research, and infrastructure, but our \ncourts have often gone without consideration. There is no natural \nconstituency, bluntly, that feels slighted; the number of furloughed \nemployees is relatively small and there is no real lobby in Washington \nfor the health of our courts.\n  But the sequester's impact on the Federal courts affects all of us--\nevery single American. The sequester is slowing the pace, increasing \nthe cost, and eroding the quality of the delivery of justice in this \ncountry.\n  At the end of our last session, I chaired a hearing of the Senate \nJudiciary Subcommittee on Bankruptcy and the Courts that looked at how \nthe sequester is impacting the public defender service in our Nation's \ncourts. These courts have been forced to cut past the fat and well into \nmuscle and soon into bone.\n  The Judiciary has looked at a variety of measures to address this new \nbudgetary reality and very few of them come without significant pain to \nthe businesses, individuals, and communities that rely on our courts. \nOne proposal--to simply not schedule civil jury trials in September--\nwould effectively impose a 30-day uncertainty tax on everyone. A judge \nin Nebraska has threatened to dismiss low-priority immigration status \ncrimes because of a lack of adequate capacity. In New York, deep \nfurlough cuts to the public defender's office caused the delay of the \ncriminal trial for Osama bin Laden's son-in-law and former Al Qaeda \nspokesman Sulaiman Abu Ghaith.\n  In my home State of Delaware, sequester has meant lengthy employee \nfurloughs at the clerk's office of the bankruptcy court, reduced \ninvestments in IT, and postponed essential upgrades. Simply put, the \nfinancial state of our Federal courts erodes our fundamental \nconstitutional rights. Individuals depend on the courts to be there \nwhen they need them, to seek relief from discrimination, to resolve \ncommercial disputes, to allow parties to stop fighting and get to work \ngrowing the economy or to guarantee fairness and efficiency in criminal \nproceedings.\n  The reality is our Federal courts were already stretched thin before \nthis sequester.\n  Chief Justice Roberts leads the Judiciary Conference of the United \nStates. The Judicial Conference was created by Congress to administer \nthe Federal court system and work with Congress to ensure \nappropriations keep up with the needs of our courts. The Judicial \nConference is and always has been nonpartison.\n  Earlier this year, the Judiciary Conference sent Chairman Leahy and \nme a letter recommending that in order for the courts to fulfill their \nmissions, we must add Federal judges to the bench. In the last two \ndecades, since the last comprehensive judgeship bill--23 years, to be \nprecise--article III district courts have seen their caseloads grow \nnearly 40 percent. Yet the number of judges has grown by four. Today, \njudges in the Eastern District of California, long recognized as one of \nthe most overburdened in the Nation, face over 1,000 waiting case \nfilings per judge. In the District of Columbia, case filings were over \n1,500 per judge. The Judicial Conference generally believes that \nadditional judgeships are needed when there are more than 500 per \njudge. So even before the sequester, our courts weren't keeping up with \ntheir caseloads.\n\n  Heeding the recommendations we received last month, Chairman Leahy \nand I introduced the Federal Judgeship Act of 2013, which will create \n91 new Federal judgeships, 2 Federal circuits, and 32 judicial \ndistricts across 21 States. This bill would provide much needed relief \nto our overburdened courts, ensuring they are better prepared to \nadminister justice quickly and efficiently.\n  Again, this proposal, this bill, is in direct response to the \nanalytical work of the nonpartisan Judicial Conference. This change is \nlong overdue. Congress has not comprehensively addressed judicial \nstaffing levels since 1990--23 years ago--and the trial court weighted \nfilings per judgeship have risen from 386 back then to 520 today. Those \nnational figures actually mask even more dramatic circumstances faced \nby the most burdened districts in Texas, Delaware, and California.\n  Yesterday, I chaired a hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee \nSubcommittee on Bankruptcy and the Courts to consider this act and, \nduring this hearing, District Court Judge Sue Robinson of Delaware \ntestified on the need for more judgeships. She explained that ``despite \nall the additional technologies we have, and an excellent staff, there \nis nothing more I can do at this point with respect to getting my cases \nresolved timely.'' At that hearing, I appreciated and was encouraged by \nthe statement of my colleague from Alabama that, in fact, the District \nof Delaware deserves another judge due to its incredible caseload. I \nwould argue, though, and the evidence suggests, that the need is not \nconfined to my State but to districts all across the country. We need \nto take on the whole problem, not just a small piece of it. Nobody \nwants to be in a courtroom, but when you need to be in court it is \nbecause something significant has happened in your life and you don't \nwant a judge rushing to move on to the next thing because of a crushing \ncaseload. You don't want clerks so awash in paperwork that yours gets \nlost.\n  In conclusion, we need to help our judges deliver justice by \nreplacing the sequester with a responsible, balanced approach that \nrestores the funding taken from our courts and allows us to add the \njudgeships we need to keep pace with demand.\n  Dr. King was right: Justice too long delayed is indeed justice \ndenied. By delaying the delivery of justice, the sequester is denying \njustice to too many Americans. We don't need more delays; we need more \njudges, and we need to act together to get it done now.\n  Thank you, and with that I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set \naside the pending amendment and call up my amendment No. 1860 to the \nEnergy Savings and Industrial Competitive Act of 2013.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I \ncertainly support a vote on this amendment and many other amendments--\nall amendments, my amendment--and, therefore, I propose an alternative \nunanimous consent request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside and \nthe following amendments be made pending: Gillibrand No. 1860, Franken \nNo. 1855, Inhofe No. 1851, Bennet No. 1847, Udall No. 1845, Klobuchar \nNo. 1856, Sessions No. 1879, Enzi No. 1863, and Vitter No. 1866; and \nthat on Tuesday, September 17, at a time to be determined jointly by \nthe majority and minority leaders, my amendment No. 1866 and a side-by-\nside amendment on the same subject by the majority leader be made \npending and receive 60 minutes of debate evenly divided and controlled \nby the majority bill manager and myself; that no points of order be in \norder in relation to these two amendments; that upon expiration of the \ntime for debate, without any intervening motions or debate, the Senate \nthen proceed to vote on these two amendments, subject to a 60-vote \nthreshold for passage; and that subsequent to each amendment vote, a \nmotion to reconsider each vote be made and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modified request?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Is there an objection to the original request?\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, reserving the right to object, let me \noffer another alternative because, again, I want this amendment to be \nvoted on, I want all the amendments I mentioned\n\n[[Page S6430]]\n\nto be voted on. I want my amendment or issue to be voted on.\n  So in that spirit, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to \nwithdraw my Vitter amendment No. 1866; that on Wednesday, September 25, \n2013, at 3 p.m., the Senate discharge the relevant committees from \nconsideration of my related bill, the No Exemption for Washington from \nObamaCare Act, proceed immediately to consideration of my bill; that \nwithout any intervening motions or debate, the Senate proceed with 60 \nminutes of debate on the bill, evenly divided and controlled by the \nmajority leader and myself; that the bill not be subject to any \namendments or motions to commit; then, after debate has expired, the \nbill be engrossed for a third reading, read a third time, and the \nSenate immediately vote on final passage, subject to a 60-vote \nthreshold; and that the motion to reconsider be made and laid upon the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modified request?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Is there an objection to the original request?\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, in that case, I must object, and I \nregret that we cannot choose these paths forward which would ensure a \nvote on these amendments that we are discussing.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam President, I have an amendment that will help \nanyone in America who has had to rebuild after a natural disaster and I \ntruly hope we can break this impasse and it can soon be considered.\n  My amendment would remove burdens and streamline the process that \nrecipients of disaster aid face when upgrading to more energy-efficient \ntechnology.\n  In the wake of Superstorm Sandy, we saw all too well that old \ntechnology can fail all too easily. Yet because of administrative \nburdens, recipients of much needed emergency funds will replace \nappliances and infrastructure with the same antiquated counterparts \nthat were damaged. In many cases this means replacing a 10-year-old hot \nwater heater with another 10-year-old unit or replacing a 20-year-old \nelectric transformer with similarly antiquated systems without any \nregard for modern safety and efficiency standards.\n  At a minimum we should provide the option of allowing these \nhomeowners, businesses, and utilities the ability to use emergency \ndisaster funding to upgrade to more energy-efficient appliances, \nmachinery or electrical infrastructure.\n  Not only will the use of energy-efficient technology save money, it \nwill reduce pollution, it will create jobs, and it will help ensure \nthat our infrastructure is more resilient to the increase in extreme \nweather events we have seen facing this country.\n  My amendment allows emergency funding recipients to voluntarily \nupgrade damaged equipment and structures with energy-efficient \ntechnology.\n  It is a budget-neutral alternative to current law. It does not direct \nFEMA to spend at higher levels. Remember, every $1 spent in upgrading \nto more energy-efficient technology provides upward of $5 in savings.\n  We should be streamlining the process and removing the roadblocks \nindividuals and businesses face when choosing to replace items \ndestroyed in natural disasters with more energy-efficient technology.\n  Thank you. I do hope we can consider this amendment soon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, just to respond to the distinguished \nSenator from New York, I want her to know I am very hopeful we will get \nher amendment formally in front of the Senate. I want the Senator from \nNew York to know and colleagues to know that I think Senator Gillibrand \nhas brought a first-rate idea to this already bipartisan bill.\n  Here is what Senator Gillibrand is talking about, because I know \nenergy is sometimes a little bit of a complicated area. What Senator \nGillibrand is essentially saying is that she wants to give folks who \nhave been clobbered by a disaster more choice in how they rebuild after \na disaster.\n  In effect, what the Senator from New York is saying is let's give \nthose folks who have been hard hit by disasters a chance to trade up \nfor those energy-efficient products that are going to save them energy \nand save them money.\n  This is the kind of idea, colleagues, that sometimes seems too \nlogical for Washington, DC. But it sure makes a lot of sense to me.\n  I commend the Senator from New York for offering this particular \nidea. As she has indicated, no mandates. This is not the Federal \nleviathan sweeping in and forcing people to do X, Y, and Z after a \ndisaster. This is about choice. It is being done without any extra \nmoney provided by the government. I think it is just a first-rate idea. \nFrankly, this is what Senator Shaheen and Senator Portman and I thought \nwould be part of this debate. It has been so long since anybody got \nserious about this issue on the floor we were convinced people would \nstart bringing good ideas to the floor--the fact that they have been \nwelling up all this time, when we have not had energy efficiency on the \nfloor.\n  So we have been here for a day and a half. I sure wish we were voting \non my colleague's amendment and other amendments relating to energy \nefficiency. I think it is an excellent idea. I hope colleagues will \nsupport it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, let me just echo, I hope Senator \nGillibrand gets a vote. I hope all these amendments mentioned get a \nvote. Of course, I hope my proposal gets a vote. The distinguished \nmajority leader several days ago announced that the floor was open for \namendments--no limitations, except one, which we all agreed to put the \nSyria debate on hold, as the President asked, and everyone agreed to \nthat. The majority leader said this would be an open amendment process; \nthe floor was open for any and all amendments.\n  Great. Let's have it. Let's have votes on all of these amendments, \ncertainly including those by Senators Gillibrand, Franken, Blumenthal, \nInhofe, Bennet, Udall, Klobuchar, Sessions, Enzi, and my amendment. \nAgain, the vote I am asking for--quite frankly, demanding--does not \nhave to be in the context of this bill. As I have made clear with my \nsecond UC request, I will put it aside and withdraw it from this bill, \nbut it is time sensitive. It does have to occur in a fair up-or-down \nway before October 1 because the illegal OPM rule--that is a bailout, \nan exemption for Washington--takes effect then. It is very time \nsensitive. I did not create that rule certainly and I did not create \nthat timeline and, therefore, I did not create that urgency. But it is \nthere because of that, in my opinion, illegal OPM action.\n  I will also happily accept that vote outside the context of this \nbill, and I have suggested multiple paths forward where we can vote. \nLet's vote. But everybody needs to get reasonable votes, not just those \nwho are approved by the majority leader. I look forward to that \nresolution. I have put multiple paths forward and look forward to that \nbeing resolved in the near future.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I would like to speak to a couple \namendments I have filed to the bill that is under consideration by the \nSenate today. I wish to talk about amendment No. 1876. Just to kind of \ngive you the background context, most of us know that when we were \ndebating the health care bill a few years ago, the labor unions were \nenthusiastic supporters of ObamaCare. It perhaps should come as no \nsurprise that they are having some buyer's remorse. I think they are \nrealizing they were sold a bill of goods, and similar to a lot of \npeople around this country whom I talk to, they would like to have a \ndo-over.\n  In fact, if we look at what has happened since the legislation has \nbecome law and what has happened to premiums--they continue going up. \nIn fact, there was a Kaiser study just this last month that had family \npremiums going up $3,000, on average, since President Obama took \noffice. Of course, that was after the promise that health care premiums \nwere going to go down by $2,500.\n\n[[Page S6431]]\n\n  We have seen employers either cut jobs or slash hours. In fact, 250 \nemployers have cut jobs, and there is hardly a day that goes by where \nthere is not a headline in a major newspaper about some employer who is \nhaving to reduce their workforce or not hire people they otherwise \nwould hire simply because of the additional cost, the requirements, the \nmandates, all the uncertainty created by ObamaCare.\n  Of course, what that means is the people who are getting hired are \ngetting hired for part-time jobs. If we look at the number of jobs \ncreated this year, about 77 percent of those are part-time jobs. What \nis happening? A lot of employers--those that are under 50 employees--if \nthey go over 50, obviously, they are covered by the mandate that says \nthey have to provide government-approved health care. So they are \nkeeping the number under 50 employees. Then the other requirement is to \nqualify as a full-time employee, you have to work 30 hours a week. So \nemployers are also reducing the hours of their employees. So we have, I \nthink, more now 29-hour-a-week jobs in this country than we have ever \nhad before. The numbers since the beginning of the year with regard to \njobs created--part-time time jobs--do bear that out. More and more \nemployers are finding their way to reduce the hours of employees and \nhire people for jobs that are part-time jobs as opposed to full-time \njobs.\n  What does that mean? That means the take-home pay of middle-class \nAmericans is going down, and in order to make ends meet, they are now \nhaving to get that second job. It is creating all kinds of distortions \nin the labor force. So it is no surprise, I would think, that the labor \nunions would like to have this issue revisited.\n  I wish to share with you a couple statements that have been made. The \nInternational Brotherhood of Teamsters, the UFCW, and UNITE-HERE sent a \nletter to House minority leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate majority leader \nHarry Reid in July stating:\n\n       On behalf of the millions of working men and women we \n     represent and the families they support, we can no longer \n     stand silent in the face of elements of the [health care law] \n     that will destroy the very health and wellbeing of our \n     members along with millions of other hardworking Americans.\n\n  The United Union of Roofers, Waterproofers, and Allied Workers--this \nfrom a letter several months ago in April--\n\n       I am therefore calling for repeal or complete reform of the \n     Affordable Care Act to protect our employers, our industry, \n     and our most important asset: our members and their families.\n\n  If we look at the letter that was sent on July 11 by the three unions \nI mentioned earlier, it goes on to say it will create nightmare \nscenarios, it will shatter benefits, and, actually, that it will \ndestroy the backbone of the middle class, which is the 40-hour \nworkweek--so very strong language by some of those who were the most \nenthusiastic and strongest advocates and supporters of ObamaCare when \nit was being discussed and debated in the Senate.\n  Last night, at their annual convention, the AFL-CIO passed a \nresolution calling for major changes to ObamaCare.\n  The unions are trying to get a special deal, and they want to work \nwith the administration in a way that completely ignores the text of \nObamaCare.\n  The law says anyone who has an offer from their employer of \ngovernment-approved health care coverage is not eligible--not \neligible--to go into the exchanges and receive refundable health care \npremium tax credits.\n  The law also states that union-provided insurance, known as Taft-\nHartley multiemployer health plans, is--is--government-approved health \ncare coverage.\n  Consequently, union employees enrolled in these Taft-Hartley plans \nare not eligible for the exchanges and the refundable premium tax \ncredits that are available in the exchange.\n  Obviously, the unions are not happy about that. In fact, on August \n27, 2013, the trade publication Inside Health Policy reported:\n\n       The Office of Management and Budget previously showed on \n     its regulatory review website that on Aug. 24 it received a \n     Department of Labor Proposed rule on ``Health Insurance \n     Premium Assistance Trust Supporting the Purchase of Certain \n     Individual Health Insurance Policies.'' The rule, which OMB \n     said is Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act-related \n     (PPACA), also appears to deal with the exclusion from a \n     definition of an employee welfare benefit plan, but this week \n     the description disappeared.\n\n  The unions are clearly seeking a way around the law and want a \nspecial fix that would apply to them and to them only.\n  If they have their way, what essentially happens is that union \nmembers will receive government subsidies for their insurance plans \nfrom three different sources, in three different ways--a benefit \nposition that no other organization or individual is in.\n  First, they get the tax deduction that an employer receives for \ncontributing to a union health plan.\n  Second, they will get the nontaxable income that the employee \nreceives when his or her employer purchases a union health plan. Third, \nfinally, a new premium assistance tax credit for union members who \npurchase the union health plan.\n  A recent analysis from the American Action Forum shows that if the \nadministration gives labor unions what they want, it would cost \ntaxpayers $187 billion over the next 10 years. The new health care law \nis clear that taxpayer-funded premium assistance credits are intended \nfor low- to middle-income Americans without access to affordable \ninsurance through an employer or who purchase health insurance on the \nexchanges.\n  The fact is that Taft-Hartley union health plans are not exchange-\nbased plans, they are employer-sponsored health plans. Providing union \nmembers with a premium assistance tax credit on top of the favorable \ntax treatment already afforded to them for their employer-sponsored \ncoverage amounts to double-dipping for union workers and is grossly \nunfair for every nonunion worker in America who would receive no such \nspecial benefit.\n  The law states that union employees should not receive both Taft-\nHartley coverage and premium tax credits, but the administration has \nmade it abundantly clear that they are willing to ignore this law in \nother areas. That is why I have introduced as a bill and an amendment \nto the pending legislation the Union Bailout Prevention Act that would \nseek to close off any possible loophole the administration might create \nor could use to give unions a special fix.\n  I do not blame at all the unions or other Americans around this \ncountry for not liking what they got. I think a lot of people had \nhigher hopes, and those, obviously, who supported this and \nenthusiastically supported the health care law are now realizing this \nis not what they were promised. As a consequence, a lot of them would \nlike to see a do-over. They want to see changes. They want to see \nreforms. Some want to see repeal. That obviously would be my preference \nin all of this. But it is not fair to carve out groups of people at the \nexclusion or detriment of other Americans who would be unfairly \nimpacted by that carve-out.\n  That is essentially what they are requesting here. They are trying to \nget special treatment that would allow them to claim not one, not two, \nbut three special tax provisions or tax treatments as a result of the \nnew Affordable Care Act when, in fact, under Taft-Hartley plans they \nalready receive favorable tax treatment and they are in government-\napproved plans. That is a government-approved plan and therefore not \neligible for the exchanges, as are many other Americans who do not have \naccess to some sort of employer-provided health care plan.\n  So if this carve-out were something the administration would approve, \nit would create a special treatment, a special provision that would \ncost taxpayers billions of dollars and be completely unfair to \ncountless Americans who would love to see the provisions of this law \neither repealed or delayed for them as well.\n  The better solution, I would argue, is let's delay this for \neverybody. I would like to see it repealed. I think we could have done \na much better job. We did not need a 2,700-page bill and 20,000 pages \nof regulations to deal with some of the challenges and problems we have \nin our health care system today, but that is what we have. We have a \ngovernment takeover of our health care system. We have 20,000 pages of \nregulations--which, by the way, is significantly taller than I am. It \nis about 7\n\n[[Page S6432]]\n\nfeet tall when you stack those regulations. Somebody has to interpret \nall of that. Somebody has to make sense out of it. Obviously, as people \nstart to interpret and make sense out of it, they are not liking what \nthey are finding. That should not come as any surprise because when you \nget a massive expansion of the government, which is essentially what \nthis was, a takeover of literally one-sixth of the American economy, \nyou are going to have a lot of associated unintended consequences.\n  I think it would make a lot of sense--there are so many better ways \nof going about this--if we were to repeal this and start over, but at a \nminimum, if one group is going to get special treatment, then all \nAmericans ought to get that same treatment. I would argue that the best \nway to do that is to delay this for everybody across this country, not \nto create special carve-outs, special treatment that would apply to \njust a small number of Americans when there are literally millions of \nAmericans who are impacted by this new law.\n  I would also like to address briefly, if I might--this is another \namendment I filed to this bill. It is amendment No. 1887. It has to do \nwith the Department of Energy loan program that has already cost \ntaxpayers millions in bad investments. It is the Advanced Technology \nVehicle Manufacturing Loan Program. It was intended to provide loans \nfor manufacturing facilities that produce fuel-efficient vehicles. \nHowever, after making only five loans over the past several years, this \nprogram was mothballed in 2011.\n  Remarkably, Secretary Moniz is considering reviving this program and \nis reportedly seeking new applications for the ATVM Program. I have \nintroduced this amendment because the Obama administration has not \nproven itself to be a very good venture capitalist. If you look at the \nrecord of the five recipients of ATVM loans, one is bankrupt and \nanother has suspended their payments on a $192 million loan. The \nGovernment Accountability Office has also questioned whether the \nDepartment of Energy has the expertise to properly assess loan \napplications. The GAO has also concluded that the Department of Energy \nlacks the engineering expertise needed for effective technical \noversight.\n  Not only is this program poorly managed, it is no longer needed. \nCredit markets in the auto industry have largely recovered from the \nrecession, and industry participants have shown little interest in the \nATVM Program in recent years. Additionally, stricter fuel economy \nstandards, which automakers supported, promote vehicle technologies \nthat are subsidized by the loan program.\n  The ATVM Program has $16.6 billion in outstanding lending authority. \nAccording to GAO, that is a credit subsidy risk of over $4 billion. I \nhave offered this amendment to prohibit any new loans from being made \nunder the ATVM Program and to protect taxpayers from this outstanding \nexposure. Given the Energy Department's poor track record and the fact \nthat these subsidies are no longer necessary, I would urge my \ncolleagues to support my amendment to stop the administration from \nmaking additional risky loans and losing even more taxpayer dollars.\n  I hope we will get a chance to vote on these amendments. I know the \nmanager of the bill, the Senator from Oregon, is working with others to \ntry to come up with a path forward in terms of processing amendments. \nBut this is certainly one that would save the government and the \ntaxpayers some money. If you look at the record, I think most Americans \nwould agree this is not the way they want to see their money used.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Energy \nSavings and Industrial Competitiveness Act, S. 1392. I am pleased to be \na cosponsor of this legislation, which would build on previous energy \nefficiency legislation and proposes cost-effective mechanisms to \nsupport the adoption of off-the-shelf efficiency technologies for \nbuildings, manufacturers, and the federal government.\n  As honorary Vice-Chair of the Alliance to Save Energy, I have been a \nlong-time proponent of efforts to improve energy efficiency. \nEncouraging the adoption of energy efficiency measures is one of the \neasiest yet most effective mechanisms for reducing energy consumption, \nlessening pollution, and ultimately saving families, businesses, and \nthe federal government money.\n  Legislation to improve our Nation's energy policy is long-overdue. I \nwould like to congratulate the bill sponsors, Senators Shaheen and \nPortman, for crafting this bipartisan, commonsense bill and for their \nefforts in working with the leadership of the Senate Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, Chairman Wyden and Ranking Member Murkowski, to \nbring this bill to the Senate floor. The provisions in S. 1392 will \nkick-start the use of energy efficiency technologies that are \ncommercially available now and can be deployed by residential, \ncommercial, and industrial energy users. It will also improve the \nenergy efficiency of the federal government, which is the largest user \nof energy in the country. Given the challenging fiscal environment, it \nis notable that all authorizations included in S. 1392 are fully \noffset.\n  Specifically, S. 1392 would strengthen voluntary building codes for \nnew homes and commercial buildings, train workers in energy-efficient \ncommercial building design and operation, help streamline manufacturing \nenergy efficiency, create a pilot program for highly efficient supply \nchains, and require the federal government to adopt energy saving \npractices for computers.\n  I am also pleased to be the lead cosponsor of two amendments that \ncomplement the goals of S. 1392. First, I have joined my colleague, the \nSenator from Colorado, Mr. Udall, in sponsoring an amendment which \nwould provide a streamlined, coordinating structure for schools to help \nthem better navigate available federal energy efficiency programs and \nfinancing options. This would be particularly helpful for rural schools \nin states such as Maine and would help these institutions save money on \ntheir rising energy costs. Decisions about how best to meet the energy \nneeds of their schools, however, would still appropriately be made by \nthe states, school boards, and local officials.\n  The second amendment I am pleased to be cosponsoring along with my \ncolleagues from Delaware, Senator Coons, and Rhode Island, Senator \nReed, would reauthorize and extend the core Weatherization Assistance \nProgram and State Energy Program activities at the Department of Energy \nthrough 2018, develop a competitive grant program for non-profits to \ncarry out weatherization projects, and require minimum professional \nstandards for weatherization contractors and workers. I am a long-time \nsupporter of weatherization, which plays an important role in \npermanently reducing home energy costs for low-income families and \nseniors in all states, lessening our dependence on foreign oil, and \ntraining a skilled workforce. Weatherizing homes and reducing energy \ncosts is particularly important for a State such as Maine, which has \nthe oldest housing stock in the Nation and a high dependence on home \nheating oil.\n  Earlier this week, the American Council for an Energy-Efficient \nEconomy, ACEEE, released new analysis demonstrating that S. 1392 would \nsave consumers and businesses over $65 billion on their energy bills by \n2030 and would help support thousands of new jobs by cutting government \nand industrial energy waste and assisting homeowners in financing \nenergy efficiency improvements.\n  S. 1392 has the support of a broad coalition of stakeholders, \nincluding energy efficiency, business, and environmental organizations, \nsmall and large businesses, utilities, and public interest groups. I am \npleased to be a cosponsor of S. 1392 and urge its swift passage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/12/senate-section/article/S6432-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6432]\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I know the Presiding Officer has some\n\n[[Page S6433]]\n\nthoughts on this efficiency bill, and we are going to hear from him \nlater. I appreciate that. I thank Senator Thune and others who have \ncome to the floor to not offer their amendments officially because we \nhave this issue we need to resolve on the health care front but to talk \nabout good amendments to the legislation and ways to improve it. I know \nSenator Gillibrand was earlier talking about her amendment, which is a \ncommonsense approach to ensure that as you do retrofits after natural \ndisasters, you can use more energy-efficient appliances and so on.\n  There are some commonsense ways for us to move the efficiency agenda \nforward with an ``all of the above'' energy strategy. We have had a \ngood debate today on that topic. I think we have actually gotten a \nnumber of amendments that have been proposed--I can count seven of them \nthat are bipartisan that have been discussed here on the Senate floor \nthat are going to help us as we proceed on this bill.\n  I am hopeful that we will have votes on Monday and Tuesday and that \nwe can move forward with resolving the outstanding issues on the health \ncare front to be able to move to the bill. I do hope my colleague from \nLouisiana does get a vote on his health care bill. I think it is \nimportant. I think it is important that the Senate be heard. But let's \nalso be sure that we actually move forward with this underlying \nlegislation. This is an unfortunately rare example of where Republicans \nand Democrats have come together here in the Senate to put forward \nlegislation that has been worked out carefully, thoughtfully over time, \nthat addresses one of the concerns we have as a country, which is that \nthe energy used in our manufacturing facilities and by us as \nindividuals and families and certainly by our Federal Government makes \nour economy less competitive and increases our costs.\n  There are ways to make our economy stronger, certainly improve the \nenvironment, and also make us less dependent on foreign energy by \nmoving forward with energy efficiency as one leg of really a \ncombination of things we need to do in an ``all of the above'' energy \nstrategy.\n  Some of that, of course, should be producing more energy. I think \nthis is a great opportunity for America, particularly in States such as \nOhio, which I represent, where we have a tremendous opportunity to \nproduce more natural gas--so called wet gas that is very valuable right \nnow--and also oil. That will help to have not only lower energy costs \nbut more stable energy costs going forward to bring back manufacturing. \nThat can actually lead to a rebirth of some of the great industries in \nStates like mine, Ohio, but also around our country to help get this \neconomy back on track as we face high unemployment and low economic \ngrowth. But along with producing more, we need to use less and use what \nwe have more efficiently. This is a conservative approach because we \nwant to be sure that what we have is used most effectively and \nefficiently.\n  We have seen a lot of gridlock on Capital Hill recently on other \nissues. Again, this is one where we do have Republicans and Democrats \nwho have worked together with the Senator from New Hampshire, who spent \n2\\1/2\\ years working on this. That is one reason we have over 200 \nbusinesses supporting us. We have over 260 organizations, ranging from \nthe Chamber of Commerce, which agreed today to ``key vote'' this \nlegislation, to the National Association of Manufacturers on the one \nhand and the Sierra Club, the Natural Resources Defense Council, and \nother groups on the other hand. So it is an interesting combination of \nfolks who believe energy efficiency is low-hanging fruit. It is a way \nfor us to use less energy and therefore have a more productive economy, \nhave a better environment, and make us less dependent on foreign oil.\n  This is an opportunity for us to do something else, in my view, which \nis to not just pass good energy legislation for the first time really \nin several years here on the floor but also to provide a model of how \nwe can maybe work on some issues that are even bigger than energy \nefficiency, such as dealing with the debt and deficit and broader \neconomic growth issues such as tax reform. So I am hopeful we can move \nforward with this debate.\n  I appreciate people being patient today as they came to the floor and \nwaited for their turn to be able to speak about their amendments. I \nalso appreciate those who are trying to work out some sort of unanimous \nconsent agreement with my colleague from Louisiana so we can move \nforward on the actual votes.\n  I know we are going to hear from our colleague who is currently \npresiding tonight and others this evening about energy efficiency, but \nI would like to end by saying that there is a way for us to make \nprogress on these issues. We have shown it with this legislation.\n  Let's get through these procedural hurdles, and let's be sure we can \nin this instance break the gridlock and get something done that helps \nmy State of Ohio, helps the American people, and helps us move forward \nin terms of better economic growth, a cleaner environment, and also a \nbetter national security situation, where we are not dependent on these \nforeign sources of oil, sometimes from very dangerous and volatile \nparts of the world. As we have seen in the last several weeks, that is \nproblematic. There is a better way. There is a better way forward. This \nenergy efficiency bill is one of the steps we can take moving forward.\n  With that, I appreciate the Presiding Officer's work on this issue \nand look forward to hearing his comments later.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I see my colleague from Ohio is on the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Ohio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/12/senate-section/article/S6433-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6433-S6435]\n                          TPP TRADE AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. BROWN. I appreciate my colleague's words and his work with \nSenator Shaheen on a very important energy bill.\n  I rise today to speak about how our Nation's efforts to combat \ntobacco products--the No. 1 preventable cause of death--are being \nthreatened by a pending trade bill.\n  Next week the Obama administration will continue negotiations on the \nTrans-Pacific Partnership called TPP. The TPP is a proposed trade \nagreement that currently includes the United States and about a dozen \nother countries. It would create a free-trade zone among the member \ncountries. Sounds good. Maybe it will create jobs, although trade \nagreements in the past have always been overpromised.\n  There are real opportunities for workers and businesses in this trade \ndeal if done right, but, like any agreement of this size, there are \nmany challenges, many issues that will require a close examination by \nCongress and the American people.\n  This sort of one-size-fits-all type deal with a broad set of \ncountries--from rich countries, such as the United States and \nAustralia, to poorer developing countries, such as Malaysia, to \ncommunist countries, such as Vietnam--it is a challenging undertaking \nto integrate these economies in a way that works for us.\n  Congress will have time to examine the details of the TPP as it moves \nalong, but today I would like to talk about one specific part of this \nagreement that hasn't gotten the attention it deserves. In fact, the \ntext of the TPP has not been widely available--except more to interest \ngroups than it has to the American public. I wish to talk about the \nU.S. proposal on tobacco products and how tobacco companies could \nchallenge anti-tobacco efforts in the United States and abroad under \nthis Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n  We know Big Tobacco will stop at nothing to replace the thousands of \ncustomers they lose each year to lung disease.\n  I remember many years ago--and I will talk a little more about this \nin committee later--we did a number of tobacco hearings when I was in \nthe House of Representatives. One thing that was clear that we talked \nabout in those days was that I believe the number--350,000, 400,000 \nAmericans died from tobacco use every year.\n  When tobacco executives came and talked to us, one thing was very \nclear: They understood that 350,000 of their customers were dying every \nyear, so they had to find 350,000 new customers every year. Where did \nthey go? They didn't go to people of the age of the Presiding Officer, \nme, or the Members of the Senate; they went to the people of the age of \nthe pages sitting on the steps next to the chair of the Presiding \nOfficer. They went after the 14-year-olds, 15-year-olds, and 16-year-\nolds because that is how they were going to\n\n[[Page S6434]]\n\nreplenish their customer base. Any business has a business plan to \nattract new customers, but when your business actually kills people, as \ntobacco does--350,000 to 400,000 a year, and the estimates right now \nare slightly in excess of that--that business has to figure out \ncreative and in this case immoral ways of getting young people to start \nsmoking cigarettes.\n  More than 440,000 Americans die yearly from tobacco-related \nillnesses, making it the leading cause of death in this country. This \nnow includes 50,000 deaths--something we weren't so sure of 20 years \nago--attributable to secondhand smoke.\n  In Ohio each year 20,000 people die from smoking and 2,100 adults die \nfrom exposure to secondhand smoke. Smoking kills more people in Ohio \nthan alcohol, AIDS, car cashes, illegal drugs, murders, and suicides \ncombined. This means that 20 percent of deaths in Ohio are attributable \nto smoking.\n  Each year 17,000 Ohioans start smoking. By the time they leave high \nschool, many are addicted. Ninety percent of adult smokers started \nbefore their 18th birthday. Of course they did. Not many people start \nsmoking when they are 25, 35, or 40.\n  Tragically, around 293,000 Ohio children under the age of 18 who are \nalive today will ultimately die prematurely because of their smoking \naddiction. And with the rise in electronic cigarette use among American \nteens, it is not a stretch that deaths of young people who use tobacco \nproducts may, in fact, increase. Last week the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention reported that the percentage of middle school \nand high school Americans who use e-cigarettes doubled from 2011 to \n2012, from 4.7 percent to 10 percent. I have no doubt that we will find \nthese devices to have their own negative health effects and that they \nwill be serving as gateway devices to conventional tobacco products. \nYou have to figure that is the hope of the tobacco companies.\n  We know that tobacco-related deaths represent the No. 1 preventable \ncause of death in the world. Thankfully, we are making progress. We \npassed and President Obama signed into law the Family Smoking \nPrevention and Tobacco Control Act 4 years ago, which empowers the FDA \nto regulate the manufacturing and the sale of tobacco products. The \nFamily Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act will finally take \naction to curb tobacco use and increase regulation of these deadly \nproducts.\n  This law though, don't forget, was decades in the making. Two decades \nago--I mentioned this hearing--in my first or second year in Congress, \nI sat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Chairman Henry Waxman \nof California, a Democrat, first brought the leaders from the seven big \ntobacco companies to testify about whether tobacco is addictive and \nwhether its marketing targeted children. These seven tobacco executives \nraised their right hands--a famous picture, front page amongst \nnewspapers in the country--and they pledged to tell the whole truth and \nnothing but the truth to this committee. Then they lied. Under oath, \nthey said nicotine is not addictive. They knew nicotine was addictive. \nTheir own tests showed nicotine was addictive. But they lied to the \nAmerican people. Their testimony strained the imagination.\n  By enacting stronger regulations of the tobacco industry, we helped \ndecrease the rates of respiratory and cardiovascular disease and \ncancer. We reduced the risks associated with tobacco use. For example, \nsmoking rates in the United States are down from 25 percent of the \npopulation in 1990 to 19 percent today--from 25 percent to 19 percent. \nThat is a huge public health victory. It is not good enough, but it is \na huge public health victory. Other countries with strong anti-tobacco \nlaws, such as England, Canada, and Australia, are seeing similar \nsuccesses. Currently, of the world's 1.3 billion smokers, 83 percent \nlive in low- or middle-income countries.\n  It is proven that anti-tobacco laws actually help curb this epidemic. \nAmerica has a moral imperative to stand for global public health. \nBesides the 1 billion people in the world predicted by the World Health \nOrganization to die this century from smoking, there are secondary \ncosts, including agriculture for food being diverted for tobacco fields \nand money spent by often malnourished people on tobacco rather than the \nstaples they need.\n  It is no accident that tobacco's predatory marketing strategies \ninvolve appealing to citizens who can least afford to waste tight \nfamily funds on a preventable addiction to tobacco. In Ohio health care \ncosts directly caused by smoking are more than $4 billion--$1.3 billion \nof that paid by Medicaid, by taxpayers. Our overburdened Medicaid \nProgram simply can't continue to bear the brunt of these costs.\n  We are all affected by tobacco use. Consider this: In Ohio the costs \nto taxpayers of government-related tobacco expenses add up to a virtual \n``tobacco tax'' of each Ohioan of about $600 per household. How does \nthat work? People who smoke end up spending more time in the hospital. \nThey end up with more diseases and illnesses that are expensive to \ntreat. That comes out to about $600 per household, whether you smoke or \nnot, paying for that cost. We can't afford those costs in human life \nand society if tobacco companies have the ability to challenge public \nhealth efforts under trade laws.\n  As we have made headway against this plague in America, Big Tobacco \nhas turned to trade deals. Amazingly enough, we wouldn't have predicted \nthis 30 years ago. Big Tobacco typically has lost fights in the \nCongress. Big Tobacco used to be like the NRA. They used to be like \nWall Street. Then, they rarely lost any big fight in the Congress. But \nthey have in the last 20 years because increasing numbers of Americans \nhave understood how Big Tobacco plays, how hard, the way they lobby, \nthe underhanded way they market, how they have marketed to children. We \nhave stopped a lot of that. What does Big Tobacco do? Now they have \nturned to trade deals as the most fertile avenues for defeating \ninternational public health efforts. Understand this: The tobacco \nindustry has deliberately made big trade laws its new potent and legal \nweapon.\n  Last year the U.S. Trade Representative--the key part of this--\nproposed a safe harbor provision that would have significantly limited \nefforts by Big Tobacco to challenge anti-tobacco efforts under trade \nrules created by the Trans-Pacific Partnership. They created a safe \nharbor provision.\n  The right thing to do was the administration was standing up to Big \nTobacco against the wishes and lobbying efforts of Big Tobacco. \nHowever, last month the administration changed course, arguing that the \nUnited States can best balance the priorities of public health \nadvocates and business by not excluding any one product, including \ntobacco, from rules of the trade agreement. Rather than giving tobacco \nsafe harbor, they said: We are not going to do it for anybody--the safe \nharbor to protect public health.\n  In my view, this desire to strike a balance on a public health issue \nlike tobacco is questionable, particularly when there is clear evidence \nthat tobacco causes cancer, heart disease, and lung disease. As we have \nsaid, tobacco use is the world's leading preventable cause of death.\n  My concerns are shared by leading public health advocates, such as \nthe American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, the American Academy \nof Pediatrics, and the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, as well as \nlongtime anti-tobacco voices such as New York mayor Michael Bloomberg.\n  Some will say the current U.S. tobacco proposal recognizes the unique \nnature of tobacco products, but neither the current nor the original \nU.S. proposal would prevent the most serious threat posed to global \npublic health--the tobacco industry's ever-growing use of something \ncalled investor-state disputes or country-to-country dispute cases \narising over tobacco product measures.\n  In other words, since NAFTA--and I was talking to the Presiding \nOfficer from Delaware about this a minute ago--the North American Free \nTrade Agreement, companies have been empowered to be able to go to a \ntrade court and challenge public health law. If there is a strong \nenvironmental law, as there was in Canada about additives in gasoline--\na company that made those additives in Richmond, VA, sued the Canadian \nGovernment, saying that their public health law banning this substance \nin gasoline,--their public health law--hurt their business and\n\n[[Page S6435]]\n\nwas, therefore, an unfair trade practice. That is an example of what \ninvestor-state lawsuits allow in provisions of these trade agreements. \nWe are afraid tobacco companies would do the same.\n  For example, Australia's Tobacco Plain Packaging Act of 2011 is \nalready under challenge under both the Australia-Hong Kong bilateral \ninvestment treaty and in a separate World Trade Organization dispute \nsettlement proceeding. These cases are pending despite the fact that \nAustralian courts--locally controlled laws, determined laws, locally \ncontrolled courts all in Australia--that Australian courts already held \nin favor of the plain packaging law.\n  What we are allowing is when a country has a strong public health \nlaw, if we in the United States write a strong public health law in \ntobacco, on clean air, on safe drinking water, the courts of the United \nStates said this is constitutional and should stay in effect--what this \ntrade agreement would do is allow companies in other countries to sue \nthe U.S. Government to undermine and weaken our public health laws.\n  There are similar cases launched against Uruguay over its proposed \ngraphic warnings proposal on cigarette packages and advertisements. \nUruguay has passed strong warning signs, warning labels on packages of \ncigarettes, but they have been challenged by tobacco companies in other \ncountries. Why should a tobacco company be able to tell the people of \nUruguay that their law shouldn't stand in a trade court? I mean, what \nis sovereignty all about?\n  The bottom line is that the tobacco industry will use every weapon in \nits arsenal. They did it in the House of Representatives, the Senate, \nHHS, and the FDA. They have done it wherever they can. It will use \nevery weapon in its arsenal, fortunately unsuccessfully recently--much \nmore successfully two decades ago--they will use every weapon in their \narsenal to protect their packaging and advertising, which is seen by \nmillions around the world each day. It is used to attract new \ncustomers, replacing those who inevitably lose.\n  Unfortunately, these investor-state challenges are being used by \ncompanies around the world more frequently.\n  The U.N. Conference on Trade and Development notes that the 62 cases \ninitiated in 2012 are the highest number of cases ever filed in 1 year. \nAllowing private enforcement of investment rights outside of domestic \nlegal systems can undermine and pose serious threats to public health, \nthe environment, and consumer efforts taken by our trading partners, as \nwell as our own agencies.\n  Americans are willing to support international trade agreements when \nthere is a clear public good, but public confidence in the \ninternational institutions and agreements is quickly diminished when we \nso clearly elevate corporate interests ahead of public health, ahead of \nthe environment, ahead of protection for workers, and ahead of public \nsafety. In the case of tobacco, of all things, such an upside-down \napproach will lead to greater global public health risk, disease, and \npremature death. Americans don't expect our trade negotiations to \nresult in a situation that makes tobacco regulation in the United \nStates and around the world more vulnerable to challenges.\n\n  I hope the Obama administration will put forward a new proposal and \nwill give favorable consideration to proposals of other trade partners \nthat reflect not only the American but the global consensus on tobacco \npriorities as they relate to protecting public health and the common \ngood.\n  Let me close with repeating something I think is particularly \nimportant. I remember my first understanding of this in the mid-1990s \nwhen we were told that 350,000 to 400,000 people died from tobacco use \nevery year. We then examined and listened to the tobacco companies talk \nand originally deny their knowledge and their efforts to sell to \nchildren 12 and 14 and 16 years old with very sophisticated, high-\npowered marketing techniques--with mailings--television and radio \ninitially, but mailings and other ways--handing out cigarettes and \nbillboards near playgrounds and high schools. You can fully understand \nthe way tobacco marketing works when you realize they lose 400,000 \ncustomers a year and they have to find 400,000 new customers a year. \nAnd they will do anything to find those new customers. They will aim at \nchildren--they will aim at 16- and 17-year-olds, they will aim at the \npoorest people in the world.\n  If you are an Indian public health official or a Chinese public \nhealth official or a public health official in Bangladesh, you have \nlots of problems stemming from cholera and typhoid, malaria, AIDS, and \ntuberculosis, and so you probably don't have the ability to fight back \nagainst Big Tobacco. We in this country have put a premium on public \nhealth efforts against Big Tobacco. In those countries their efforts \nhave to be against these terrible infectious diseases of tuberculosis \nand malaria and AIDS and cholera and typhoid and all those things, so \nthey simply can't fight back on tobacco.\n  That is why it is up to us, in our efforts in these trade agreements, \nto stand for something--to stand for public health and fairness and to \nstand up against Big Tobacco and to do the right thing.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak to the Energy Savings \nand Industrial Competitiveness Act of 2013, S. 1392 or more commonly \nreferred to here by the names of its lead cosponsors, Shaheen-Portman.\n  This is a bill that allows us to turn back to the issue so many \nAmericans have been asking us to focus on: jobs, competitiveness, \nmanufacturing, the steps we can take to put our country back on the \nright path for our future.\n  This bill is essentially about energy efficiency and all the \ndifferent ways energy efficiency, used wisely, can strengthen America. \nAn America that uses less energy is an America that is taking less from \nthe Earth, an America less reliant on other nations for the fuel that \npowers our lives and livelihoods, an America whose people won't need to \nmortgage their future in order to cool their homes.\n  An America that uses less energy is an America that will never again \nwait in long gas lines; that in the summers won't have to sweat through \nbrownouts and in the winters won't have to make the tragic choice \nbetween feeding their families and keeping them warm.\n  There have been some tough economic times for our Nation in recent \nyears. And while I haven't been in Washington all that long, I get the \nsense the climate here around the budget and our fiscal issues has \nalmost never been as toxic and difficult to navigate as it is right \nnow. Of course, the reality is broadly, across the whole Federal \nbudget, we do need to tighten our belts and we are going to have to \nprioritize investments that are the most important to America's future. \nBut energy efficiency is entirely about America's future. It is exactly \nthe sort of area where we can reach a bipartisan agreement on an \nimportant path forward together.\n  Energy efficiency is entirely about America's future. There is no \nwinning in the fight for energy efficiency. There is only progress. \nThere is doing better, conserving energy, and saving money. The pennies \nwe invest today in energy efficiency will save our governments, our \nbusinesses, and our families dollars down the road.\n  So how do we do it? How do we build our more energy-efficient future \nwhen cost efficiency is ruling the day here in this Chamber and in this \nCongress? It starts with this wise, balanced, and bipartisan bill we \nare considering today, the Energy Savings and Industrial \nCompetitiveness Act.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of this valuable bill, and I applaud the \ntireless work of my friends, Senators Shaheen of New Hampshire and \nPortman of Ohio, in crafting the bill, focusing this bill, and then \nultimately getting it to the floor. I am also grateful to the \nleadership of Senator Wyden, the chairman of the energy committee, and \nSenator Murkowski, his ranking Republican, in ably advancing it through \nthe committee where it passed by a\n\n[[Page S6436]]\n\nvote of 19 to 3 and in getting it to the floor today.\n  I am grateful to Senators Wyden and Murkowski for the bipartisan \nenergy they have crafted on the committee and for the positive tone \nthey have set. I have greatly enjoyed my years of service on the Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee and appreciate their work that has \nallowed Senators Shaheen and Portman and many of the other cosponsors \nof this bill to see it on the floor here today.\n  We are at a critical moment. If America is going to lead, we have to \nwork together to set a long-term strategy that moves us toward an \nefficient, clean energy-competitive economy. This bill helps us do \nthat.\n  It looks as though we are going to have a few more days to talk about \nthe full scope of this bill because, unfortunately, there have been \nother amendments offered--amendments that aren't directly germane to \nthis bill. And as has sadly, so often been the case in the months gone \nby, we have had a grinding halt to the opportunity to move forward on \nthis broad bipartisan bill that enjoys support from Republicans and \nDemocrats, that has an opportunity to be passed through the other \nChamber as well as this, and that could do great work for America.\n  It is my hope that next week when we return, this Chamber will take \nup, consider, and pass this bill; that we will consider dozens of \namendments germane to this bill, relevant to this bill that will bring \nother good ideas about energy efficiency to the floor, and that we will \nstrengthen it and pass it.\n  This bill has been scored as having a very real prospect of creating \n136,000 jobs in the next dozen years, by 2025. Imagine getting back to \nconsidering bills that actually help create jobs. There is a list of \nmore than 250 corporations, nonprofits, and associations from all \ndifferent sectors of the American society and economy that have \nendorsed this bill. It has a broad range of provisions that deal with \nenergy efficiency codes and voluntarily improving them, skills and \ntraining, improving manufacturing, improving the energy efficiency of \nthe U.S. Government, the single biggest purchaser and user of energy in \nour country--indeed, probably in the world. It achieves huge targets, \ngreat objectives, saving nearly 3 billion megawatt hours in energy by \n2030, and saving consumers more than $13 billion a year by 2030. These \nare great and robust goals, and I am truly hopeful we will turn to this \nbill in earnest next week and take up and consider some of the range of \namendments that have been offered.\n  I wish to now briefly review three of the amendments I have \nintroduced for consideration as part of Shaheen-Portman.\n  I know one of the best things about how the Senators and the \ncommittee leaders have crafted this bill is that it is open to \nconsideration of a broad range of ideas. All three of these amendments \nare directly related to energy efficiency. Not all three of them may \nend up being part of this bill, and I understand, but I am grateful for \na few moments of my colleagues' attention to bring them up and discuss \ntheir benefit, value, and relevance.\n  The first is 1842. It allows for the reauthorization of valuable \nenergy programs that have been at the heart of the Federal Government's \nenergy efficiency strategy for a long time; the Weatherization \nAssistance Program and the State Energy Program. Both are programs in \nplace for decades and that work daily in each and every one of our \nStates, helping to reduce energy usage and reduce energy costs.\n  In States such as your own, Mr. President, the State of \nMassachusetts, where the winters can be cold and long and energy \nexpensive, programs at the State level and weatherization assistance \nprograms can make a real difference in the lives of consumers. These \nprograms link national, State, and local interests in a critical way. \nThey create highly effective public and private partnerships that have \ndelivered real results. In fact, studies have shown that the \nWeatherization Assistance Program returns more than $2.50 in household \nsavings for every $1 invested. The program serves over 7 million \nfamilies in its existence, including more than 1 million in the last 4 \nyears. The results are equally strong for the State Energy Program, \nwhere every Federal dollar invested has an energy cost savings of more \nthan $7 a year and nearly $11 in non-Federal dollars is leveraged for \nevery Federal dollar spent.\n  These are highly effective programs, but both of their authorizations \nhave expired, so we need to reauthorize these programs so we can help \nAmericans save energy and save other energy costs.\n  Earlier this year I partnered with Senators Collins of Maine and Reed \nof Rhode Island to introduce the Weatherization Enhancement and Local \nEnergy Efficiency and Investment in Accountability Act. That is a \nmouthful, but it has a wide base of support, including from the \nAlliance to Save Energy, the Community Action Foundation, the National \nAssociation of State Energy Officials, Habitat For Humanity, building \nsuppliers such as Masco Corporation, business groups such as the \nBusiness Council For Sustainable Energy, environmental groups such as \nthe NRDC, and many more.\n  I have introduced that legislation as an amendment. To summarize what \nit does, it reauthorizes these two critical energy programs for 5 more \nyears, the State Energy Program and the Weatherization Assistance \nProgram. But it doesn't just reauthorize them, it modernizes them. It \nenhances them with new ideas and ultimately works to ensure their long-\nterm viability.\n  We call for a complementary, competitive innovation program as well \nas call for setting baseline standards. This amendment actually reduces \nthe funding levels to where they were 6 years ago, in order to attract \nthe bipartisan support and to be more fiscally responsible. This \namendment says that the new minimum efficiency standards the Department \nof Energy is working on must be in place by October of 2015, and it \ncreates a complementary competitive grant program to allow NGOs to \ncompete for their piece of the funding. Overall, we want to bring in \nnew partners, new approaches, new technologies, and new ideas to ensure \nthat more homes can be weatherized, more families have their heating \nbills reduced, and more energy saved with limited Federal funding. I \nurge the support of my colleagues for this a first amendment, No. 1842, \nabout the Weatherization Assistance Program.\n  Let me now turn to something that I think is just common sense, where \nI hope the Federal Government, one of the largest users of energy in \nthe world, will take advantage of a contracting tool to achieve energy \nsavings and cost savings in ways that both the private sector and local \ngovernment have as well. I am talking about Energy Savings Performance \nContracts, and I had personal experience with them when I was in the \nprivate sector with a manufacturing company in Delaware and when I was \na county executive. We used this tool, this technique, in both of those \ncontexts to finance very expensive capital investments in chillers and \nboilers and motors in elevators and lights and in energy efficiency \nretrofits throughout our buildings. But they were not paid for upfront \nby either the manufacturing company I worked for or the county which I \nran as county executive; they were financed off of dedicated future \nenergy savings. So these capital improvements were installed at the \ncost of a private company, not the government, not the manufacturer \nupfront, and then paid for over a long time by the energy cost savings \nthat the increased efficiency achieved.\n  That may seem complicated, but it is well known, well demonstrated \nand used widely across this country and is something the Federal \nGovernment should make better use of. As I mentioned, by contract, the \ncompany is paid for its upfront capital investments in these higher \nefficiency systems through future savings that result from decreased \nutility costs. If State, local, and Federal facilities are currently \ntaking advantage of these, if they are well known and well \ndemonstrated, why isn't the Federal Government making broader use of \nthem? Partly because of contracting and budgeting challenges, and it is \npartly because there is not enough push, enough energy behind the use \nof these ESPCs.\n  They also have a secondary benefit of creating lots of private sector \njobs, jobs that cannot be outsourced, jobs that require local workers. \nBecause what we are truly talking about are\n\n[[Page S6437]]\n\nsheet metal workers and electricians, folks who are installing things \nand taking things out, laborers and mechanics. These are great jobs and \nat no cost to the taxpayer.\n  Estimates are that there are more than $20 billion available to the \nFederal Government through the use of performance contracts, savings \nthat we know we can achieve and at no cost to the taxpayer.\n  In December of 2011, President Obama announced a Federal commitment \nto enter into Energy Savings Performance Contracts equal to $2 billion \nover 2 years. But what happens when that window ends? Now that we are \nin 2013 and about to hit the end of that window, there will be no \nauthority to continue to encourage the use of ESPCs in Federal \nfacilities. In the current fiscal climate, performance contracts offer \nthe Federal Government the best method for upgrading aging facilities \nand reducing energy costs.\n  Earlier this summer I introduced the Energy Savings Through Public-\nPrivate Partnership Act to push the Federal Government in the right \ndirection by encouraging increased utilization of these contracts. I \nintroduced that as an amendment to the Shaheen-Portman act. As I \nmentioned, it creates a new goal for the Federal Government, to be \nspecific, a goal to enter into $1 billion a year in energy savings \ncontracts over the next 5 years--$5 billion in savings at no cost to \nthe taxpayer.\n  It encourages more performance contracting by requiring that Federal \nfacilities managers ``shall consider'' implementing identified energy \nand water conservation measures. It increases energy savings \ntransparency by requiring the online publication of energy and water \nconservation measures, and it requires government energy managers to \npublicly explain why they chose not to use NSPC if they do not. It \nensures greater accountability by requiring the administration to \nreport to Congress on the status of the annual performance contracting \ngoal each year.\n  In previous hearings, I have asked the Secretary of Energy and others \ninvolved in the Federal performance system why this is not more \nactively used. The explanations have more to do with the complications \nof bureaucracy adrift in inaction than why it cannot be done. Positive \nresponses from the President and from departments and from facility \nmanagers strongly suggest that this amendment, this bipartisan \namendment, could be considered as a part of S. 1492.\n\n  Let me last turn to one I have worked hardest on and am most excited \nabout, amendment No. 1841, the Master Limited Partnership Parity Act. \nThis one has the potential to change the long-term playing field for \nenergy financing in the United States. Access to low-cost financing \nwill determine our Nation's energy future. It will determine how and \nwhen and which energy sources emerge as central players in the American \nenergy marketplace in the long term, and I think it is up to us to \nensure our vast national supply of clean renewable power as well as \nenergy efficiency are vital parts of that overall equation.\n  What am I talking about? What is a master limited partnership? It is \na business structure that is taxed as a partnership but whose ownership \ninterests are traded like corporate stocks on a market. It is a tax-\nadvantaged capital formation vehicle. They have been around more than \n30 years. There are more than 100 of them with a market cap over $40 \nbillion, and they have been overwhelmingly used by oil and gas and \npipeline interests. Oddly, by statute, MLPs are only available to \ninvestors in energy portfolios for oil, natural gas, coal extraction, \nand pipeline projects--nonrenewable energy. As I mentioned, these \nprojects get access to capital at a lower cost and are more liquid than \ntraditional financing approaches to energy projects, making them highly \nattractive to private sector investment.\n  Investors in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects, \nhowever, have been explicitly prevented from forming MLPs, starving a \ngrowing portion of America's domestic energy sector of the capital it \nneeds to grow. I introduced the bipartisan Master Limited Partnership \nParity Act to include renewable energy and energy efficiency projects \namong all those other areas of energy for which MLPs could be formed, \nand I am grateful for the tireless partnership of my lead cosponsor, \nSenator Jerry Moran of Kansas and for the courage and energy Senator \nLisa Murkowski of Alaska has brought to advocating for this bill as a \ncosponsor and for the early support of Senator Debbie Stabenow of \nMichigan. The four of us have now over two Congresses worked tirelessly \non this bill.\n  It has a corollary in the House that also has a strong bipartisan \ngroup of cosponsors. I recently testified about this bill, as has \nSenator Moran, both at the Senate Energy Committee and Finance \nCommittee, and I have been grateful for the interest of Chairman Ron \nWyden and an array of other Senators from both parties.\n  As I mentioned, this MLP Parity Act has the opportunity, the \npossibility of being the ``all of the above'' energy strategy that is \nso often talked about and to be the capital-financing piece of this, a \nstrategy that does not pick winners and losers but allows the markets \nto decide where to invest in the long term. It has generated a great \ndeal of interest and support. It has hundreds of supporters coming from \nthe private sector, from think tanks, from nonprofits, and from \nadvocacy groups.\n  It could not be simpler. It is a very short bill, just a few hundred \nwords. Instead of barring renewable projects and energy efficiency \nprojects from being able to organize as Master Limited Partnerships, it \nembraces them. It would bring new low-cost capital into the energy \nmarket and help get more renewable energy and energy efficiency \nprojects to get off the ground, increase domestic energy production, \nand increase our Nation's energy security.\n  I urge support for this amendment, which is a separate piece of \nlegislation being offered as an amendment to this bill. All three of \nthese amendments are good ideas. As we proceed next week, I may or may \nnot call them up as amendments to this bill to be considered on the \nfloor, but the last, the Master Limited Partnership Parity Act in \nparticular, is a public policy idea worthy of consideration by this \nbody at some point in the months and years ahead.\n  Let me in closing simply say I am grateful we have had the \nopportunity to return to a vigorous debate about a bipartisan bill that \nhas the very real prospect of saving energy, of creating jobs, of \ninvesting in manufacturing and in skills and of growing the economy of \nthe United States in a way that reduces our energy use, makes us less \nreliant on foreign energy sources, makes less of an impact on our \nenvironment, and gives us more hope for the future--a brighter and more \noptimistic future.\n  I can think of no better signal this Senate and this Congress can \nsend to the people of the United States but that we take up, consider, \nand pass many of the bipartisan amendments that have been discussed \nhere today and then finally pass the Shaheen-Portman bill and send it \nto the House for consideration, passage, and ultimately signature into \nlaw.\n  The people of my home State ask me all the time when will we get back \nto listening to each other, working together, and passing real \nbipartisan bills that can help create jobs. This bill will accomplish \nthose goals.\n  It is my prayer, my hope we will do that vital work next week when we \nreturn.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/12/senate-section/article/S6437-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6437-S6438]\n                      MCC COMPACT FOR EL SALVADOR\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, earlier today the Board of Directors of the \nMillennium Challenge Corporation voted to approve a second MCC compact \nfor El Salvador. This was expected, and it begins the last phase of \ndiscussions between the United States and El Salvador on the compact \nwhich, if finally agreed to and funded, could result in investments \ntotaling $277 million from the United States and $85 million from El \nSalvador.\n  The compact has three main components, described by the MCC as \npartnering with the private sector to enhance the country's investment \nclimate; strengthening the country's future workforce by teaching the \nskills demanded by the labor market; and reducing transportation and \nlogistics costs by expanding a highway in the coastal region and \nimproving the border crossing into Honduras. I agree that these \ninvestments would have a positive impact on the lives of the Salvadoran \npeople.\n\n[[Page S6438]]\n\n  However, I am also aware that some Salvadoran civil society \norganizations have concerns about the potential impact of MCC-financed \ndevelopment on the environment and the livelihoods of coastal \ncommunities. If the compact is funded these organizations should be \nconsulted on the design of the details of the compact in a transparent \nand inclusive process particularly relating to environmental and \nregulatory issues, and on the ongoing monitoring of compliance.\n  When the law to establish the MCC was written a decade ago it was not \nintended to be just another foreign aid program. I remember, because I \nwas involved in writing the law. Rather, it was designed to reward \ncountries whose governments are taking effective steps to address key \nissues of governance, particularly combating corruption, strengthening \nthe rule of law, and supporting equitable economic growth.\n  I supported the first compact for El Salvador, although during the \ndesign phase I raised concerns about the high level of violent crime \nand corruption in that country and encouraged the MCC and the \ngovernment of El Salvador to consider using a portion of the funds to \nstrengthen the judiciary and the rule of law. Regrettably, that was not \ndone.\n  While El Salvador can point to some success compared to its neighbors \nHonduras and Guatemala, it remains a country of weak democratic \ninstitutions where the independence of the judiciary has been attacked, \ncorruption is widespread, and transnational criminal organizations have \nflourished. Money laundering is a multi-billion dollar scourge in El \nSalvador and other Central American countries, and impunity is the \nnorm. The national police is discredited, infiltrated by organized \ncrime and distrusted by the public.\n  I have urged the MCC, the Department of State, and the government of \nEl Salvador during the preliminary discussions and prior to a decision \nto release the funds for a second compact in which the Congress will \nhave a say, to address a number of issues which I and others here and \nin El Salvador believe is necessary for the rule of law and economic \ngrowth in that country.\n  First is to significantly strengthen the capacity of the Attorney \nGeneral's office and the police to combat money laundering, which is a \ngrowing problem and is driving legitimate businesses out of business. \nPresident Funes recently announced the creation of a special police \nunit for this purpose and I commend him for doing so, but it remains to \nbe seen whether such a unit receives the necessary resources to be \neffective, and is not corrupted by the very criminals it is responsible \nfor investigating and bringing to justice.\n  Second is to respect the independence of the Constitutional Oversight \nCourt of the Supreme Court, or the Sala de lo constitucional as it is \nknown in Spanish, which is the chamber of the Supreme Court that rules \non constitutional issues. For the first time since the Peace Accords El \nSalvador has an independent judicial body of magistrates who are widely \nrecognized for being honest, who do not show fear or favor, and who \nhave consistently ruled in an independent manner. Because their rulings \nhave at times gone against the interests of the FMLN governing party \nand at other times against the interests of the opposition ARENA party, \nthere have been efforts to replace them with individuals who can be \nmanipulated.\n  Third is the concern I have raised about some public officials in \npositions of authority who have promoted individuals within the police \nand security forces who have no business being in public office because \nof their involvement in illegal activities.\n  An MCC compact is widely regarded as providing a kind of stamp of \napproval by the United States, indicating that the government of the \ncompact country has demonstrated a commitment to integrity, to good \ngovernance and respect for the rule of law, and to addressing the needs \nof its people. This should be doubly so for a second compact. If \norganized crime is operating with impunity, if corruption is pervasive \nincluding within the police, and if there are people in public office \nwho abuse their authority to the detriment of democratic institutions, \nthat is not consistent with the intent or purpose of the MCC.\n  The first round of El Salvador's next presidential election is \nscheduled for February 2014, and I have no doubt that the Funes \nGovernment wants that stamp of approval as the election approaches. I \nappreciate that MCC CEO Yohannes, U.S. Ambassador Aponte, and other \nState Department officials have echoed some of the concerns I have \nraised. Today's decision by the MCC Board is an important step, but it \nis not the final step. I urge the government of El Salvador to act \ndecisively to address those concerns.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/12/senate-section/article/S6438-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6438]\n                           CAPRONI NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, on Monday the Senate confirmed two of the \nPresident's Federal judicial nominees. One of these nominees, Ms. \nValerie Caproni, served for 8 years as the general counsel of the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation, and I interacted with her in that \ncapacity on a number of occasions as a member of the Select Committee \non Intelligence. I will say frankly that I was troubled by some of the \naggressive positions that Ms. Caproni took regarding domestic \nsurveillance while she was the FBI's general counsel, and I understand \nwhy a number of my colleagues had serious concerns about her \nnomination.\n  After giving the matter serious thought I decided to vote yes on Ms. \nCaproni's nomination based on the letter that she sent to Senator \nDurbin in July of this year, in which she stated that she would recuse \nherself from any cases that would require her to determine the legality \nof any surveillance programs about which she provided legal advice, in \naddition to any cases for which she had personal or supervisory \ninvolvement. This broad recusal commitment is somewhat unusual, but I \nbelieve it is appropriate given Ms. Caproni's long record of advocating \nfor particular surveillance authorities as FBI general counsel. As the \nSenate has seen in recent years, Federal judges play a critical role in \ninterpreting the government's surveillance authorities, so when \nconsidering nominees for judicial positions that are likely to consider \nsurveillance cases it is important to ensure that these nominees will \nnot be overly deferential to the government's interpretation of what \nits own surveillance authorities should be. I thank Senator Durbin for \nhis work on this nomination, and I look forward to continuing to work \nwith him and our other colleagues on this critically important issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/12/senate-section/article/S6438-2", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6438]\n                        AMERICAN LEGION POST 145\n\n  Ms. COLLINS.

Mr. President, today I would like to pay tribute \nto Catherine ``Kay'' S. Hill of Dayton, MD. Kay Hill is retiring after \na 38-year career with the National Security Agency, NSA, where she led \nthe Agency's efforts to forge partnerships with the State and local \ngovernments and the surrounding community. Ms. Hill has put a human \nface on an agency long known for its secrecy and is legendary in \nMaryland for her leadership and vision.\n  In 1975 Ms. Hill was recruited by the NSA to establish a commuter \ntransportation office. She oversaw the NSA motor fleet services \noperation and quickly recognized the need to expand ridesharing beyond \nthe gates. In 1976 she began working with State and local governments \nto develop a statewide vanpool program that grew to be the largest \nprogram in the State. In 1980 NSA was the only Federal agency to \nreceive a Presidential Award in recognition of its successful and \ngroundbreaking Ridesharing Program, which has since been duplicated by \nother Federal agencies.\n  As a result of her success in forging collaborative partnerships in \nthose early days, Ms. Hill became one of the few public faces of NSA, \nand Agency leadership began to place more emphasis on working with the \nbroader community. In 1999 NSA management established the office of \nState and Local Government Relations and Community Partnership and \nappointed Ms. Hill as its first Director. She has continued her work to \npartner with the community in a number of areas to address problems of \nmutual interest like education and workforce development, road \nimprovements, transportation, and other infrastructure issues.\n  Kay Hill is an outstanding Federal employee, dedicated to public \nservice. I am grateful and pleased that because of her advocacy, the \nNSA enjoys a reputation in the surrounding community as a good \nneighbor, business partner, and model employer. I wish her all the best \nas she begins the next phase in her life--one that I hope is both \nrelaxing and productive.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/12/senate-section/article/S6439-2", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6439]\n                   TRIBUTE TO AIRMAN DUNCAN KIRKLAND\n\n Mr. ISAKSON.

Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity \nto honor one of Utah's finest, Leo Floyd Argyle, a veteran of World War \nII and exemplary citizen. Leo turned 91 this year, and will soon be \ntravelling to Washington, D.C. to visit the memorials and honor his \nbrothers in arms.\n  Leo Floyd Argyle, of Bountiful, UT was born at the beginning of the \nroaring twenties in Woods Cross, UT. His father passed 13 short years \nlater, leaving his mother and three siblings at the height of America's \nGreat Depression. Leo dutifully continued his schoolwork and graduated \nfrom Davis High School in 1939. The value of hard work was instilled in \nthis generation of Americans, and Leo is a perfect example of that. He \nworked topping beets and weeding onions after high school and \neventually worked his way into the telecommunications business--at \nfirst digging trenches for phone lines.\n  Leo was digging a phone cable trench in 1942 when he received notice \nto report to Fort Douglas. He had 1 week to get his affairs in order \nprior to reporting for duty. He served in the 573rd Signal Air Warning \nBattalion, and was part of some of our most extraordinary military \nefforts in Great Britain, Normandy, the Ardennes, the Rhineland, and \nthroughout Central Europe. He related part of his noble service as \nfollows:\n\n       An experience I remember from World War II was that after \n     having 12 months of radio radar training, we boarded the \n     Queen Mary in New York. The Queen carried more than 800,000 \n     troops over the course of the War. We landed in Scotland five \n     days later. Hitler had put out a $250,000 reward for the \n     submarine that could sink her, but she was too fast. At this \n     time I realized how important the training I had received was \n     and the part I was to play during the war. Our first radar \n     location was in Dover, England. This was to track incoming \n     aircraft and later the V1 rockets aimed at England. After a \n     considerable amount of time we proceeded through Normandy and \n     Northern France, which had been liberated by American Troops. \n     There we found the US 3rd Army. From there we were sent all \n     over Europe. I was in France on VE Day and then we were \n     getting ready to be shipped to Japan when the United States \n     dropped the atom bombs on Japan, which led\n\n[[Page S6440]]\n\n     to their subsequent surrender. I was sent home December 28, \n     1945.\n\n  Simply put, Leo is a part of that generation who, when called to \nfight against the forces of despotism and evil, answered courageously.\n  Leo Argyle is not only a proper example of duty to country, but also \nan example of a good father and husband. He has been married to his \nsweetheart, Marline Brey Argyle since March 9, 1951, and they have \nlovingly reared their three children, Mike, Lisa, and Jennie. They have \neight grandchildren, and 10 great-grandchildren. His son Mike recently \nrecounted the lessons that his father teaches through example:\n\n       One of the things I remember most about my dad was that he \n     has always been a hard worker. He worked for the phone \n     company for 41 years, even though they changed the name of \n     the phone company over the years. His love for vacations at \n     Bear Lake has helped keep the family close. We spent most \n     weekends and dad's vacation there each summer. He taught me \n     to drive a tractor and an old Jeep. He taught me the value of \n     work and to be employed. He taught me to plow the orchard. It \n     seems that he is always busy, as he enjoys work even now. He \n     has been retired for many years but continues to work every \n     day, at his home, orchard, and cabin. He loves to sing, and \n     he enjoys going to see his friends at the senior center every \n     day. He also makes many visits to people in the hospital. He \n     has been an example of stability and goodness to me all my \n     life.\n\n  As we face harrowing challenges in our complex world today, might I \nsuggest that we look to the example of citizens like Leo Argyle. As we \nlook to the example set by our forebears, especially in the steady hand \nof hard work and the honorable performance of one's duty, we will find \nthat principles are constant, that goodness and virtue are real, and \nthat our prosperity as a Nation depends on our adherence to those \nprinciples. May we ever strive to emulate the firm resolve with which \nour grandfathers held the flame of liberty and the standard of justice \nand honor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/12/senate-section/article/S6440-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6440]\n                  NEW HAVEN MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION\n\n Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, today I wish to commemorate the \n100th anniversary of the New Haven Manufacturers Association.\n  Established in 1913 as the Employer's Association of New Haven \nCounty, the New Haven Manufacturers Association has served the \nmanufacturing community of Southern Connecticut and beyond for the past \ncentury. Since its inception, the New Haven Manufacturers Association \nhas endeavored tirelessly to encourage the growth and success of the \nmanufacturing sector in Connecticut's economy. It has advocated \npolicies critical to the manufacturing community, provided \nopportunities for manufacturers to network and share ideas, and \neducated members on business best practices.

Mr. President, today I wish to honor the 50th \nanniversary of the All-Ohio State Fair Youth Choir and the leadership \nof its founder, Glenville D. Thomas. In 1963, Mr. Thomas founded the \nchoir to provide high school singers in Ohio with the opportunity to \nenjoy a musical experience similar to that of the All-Ohio State Fair \nBand.\n  In 1975, the All-Ohio State Fair Youth Choir became the first \nmarching choir during its debut at the Tournament of Roses Parade. In \n1975, the group was also the first-ever choir to sing in the Macy's \nThanksgiving Day Parade, which included a pre-show performance atop the \nWorld Trade Center. Mr. Thomas and the choir also performed at the New \nYork World's Fair, appeared on several national and local TV and radio \nprograms, and sang for President Nixon at the White House.\n  This year, the 2013 Ohio State Fair featured a butter choir \nsculpture--in addition to an iconic butter cow--that honored the \nthousands of youth who have been members of the choir throughout the \nlast five decades. I was pleased to be able to visit with some of the \nmembers of the All-Ohio State Fair Youth Choir, hear some of their \ngreat singing, and congratulate them at the fair.\n  The All-Ohio State Fair Youth Choir is an asset to the Ohio State \nFair and I congratulate all who were involved in making its first 50 \nyears a success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/12/senate-section/article/S6440-3", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6440]\n                           COPPER CANNON CAMP\n\n Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nfiftieth anniversary of Copper Cannon Camp in Bethlehem, NH.\n  Each year, millions of American children pack their bags and prepare \nto spend their summers in the great outdoors, hiking, playing sports, \nand enjoying time with friends. While many people are fortunate enough \nto have the resources to send their children to camp, some family \nbudgets do not permit this opportunity for their children.\n  As a young boy, Copper Cannon Camp's founder, Hamilton Ford, received \nassistance to attend summer camp. That experience changed Mr. Ford's \nlife and inspired him to share his experiences with children who could \nnot otherwise attend camp. The Camp's mission is to provide \nunderprivileged New Hampshire youth with an opportunity to experience \nthe joys of attending summer camp at no cost to their families. Since \n1963, Mr. Ford's dream has been a reality, and the camp now welcomes \napproximately 600 campers each year.\n  Now in its 50th year, Copper Cannon Camp has provided a traditional \nsummer camp experience to more than 21,000 youths from New Hampshire. \nFor many of these children, their week at Copper Cannon Camp has \nchanged their lives.\n  The camp has earned a place in the hearts of countless individuals \nand families from New Hampshire, and its mission remains as relevant \nand important today as it was 50 years ago. That generous mission \nreflects the compassion and dedication demonstrated by the Camp's \nboard, staff, and community members.\n  There is much to celebrate in the first 50 years of Copper Cannon \nCamp, and with exciting expansion plans underway, we can look forward \nwith great anticipation to the Camp's next 50 years. I congratulate \neveryone involved in Copper Cannon Camp's success and wish them many \nwonderful summers ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/12/senate-section/article/S6440-4", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6440]\n                   REMEMBERING WILLIAM HENRY JOHNSON\n\n Mr. TESTER.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to increase \nthe preference given, in awarding certain asthma-related grants, to \ncertain States (those allowing trained school personnel to administer \nepinephrine and meeting other related requirements); to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, every day almost 50 million children pass \nthrough the doors of public schools across the country.\n  For these young people, school is a place to learn, make friends, and \nbe exposed to new things.\n  For a small number of children, however, lunch time, a classmate's \nbirthday party, or a piece of candy from a friend can risk exposure to \nfoods that can cause a severe and life-threatening allergic reaction.\n  Although food allergies are common--with one out of every 25 children\n\n[[Page S6449]]\n\nhaving a food allergy--you may not personally know a child that suffers \nfrom severe food allergies.\n  But I am sure you have heard the sad stories about students trying a \nnew food at lunch or accidentally eating something containing peanuts \nor soy.\n  Most of us wouldn't even notice the peanuts or soy, but for these \nkids the consequences can be fatal.\n  Their throats constrict, making them fight for every breath. And if \nthey don't get a life-saving shot of epinephrine within minutes they \ncan die.\n  Last year, I met with the mother of 7-year-old Amarria Johnson from \nVirginia.\n  One day at recess a friend gave Amarria a peanut, which triggered a \nsevere allergic reaction.\n  By the time emergency crews arrived they could not resuscitate her.\n  This was the first time Amarria had a severe allergic reaction, so \nshe did not have an epinephrine shot prescribed for her at the school \nto use in an emergency.\n  Almost 4 years ago in my home state, a 13-year-old named Katelyn \nCarlson passed away from a severe allergic reaction after she ate \nChinese food during a party in her 7th grade class.\n  Our hearts ache when we hear tragic stories like this, but in most \ncases they could have been prevented.\n  A year after Katelyn passed away, Illinois Governor Quinn signed a \nlaw that I hope will prevent another child from dying from an \nanaphylactic reaction because the school does not have epinephrine on \nhand.\n  Today I introduced, along with Senator Kirk, a bill that encourages \nevery state to follow Illinois' example.\n  The School Access to Emergency Epinephrine Act encourages states to \nrequire all schools to maintain a supply of epinephrine on the premises \nand to allow trained school personnel to administer epinephrine if a \nchild is having a serious anaphylactic reaction.\n  Schools can help by being prepared and allowed to treat a child in \nthe few minutes they have to save their life.\n  Considering that children spend about 28 percent of their time at \nschool, schools can and should play a role in responding to students \nthat have a severe and potentially fatal allergic reaction.\n  Currently students with severe allergies are allowed to self-\nadminister epinephrine if they are having a serious allergic reaction.\n  But what if the child forgets their epinephrine at home?\n  What about the many children who don't even know they have an \nallergy?\n  About 25 percent of epinephrine administrations in schools involve \nyoung people with no previous allergy.\n  Dying from a severe allergic reaction is preventable.\n  Unfortunately most of our schools are not prepared for the likely \nevent that a student has a severe allergic reaction.\n  A 2001 study on a small group of young people found that 28 percent \nof school-aged children who died due to allergic reaction, died at \nschool, and epinephrine was either not administered or was administered \ntoo late.\n  We can do better.\n  States should require schools to keep epinephrine on hand, and school \npersonnel need to be trained to identify a severe allergic reaction and \nknow how to respond.\n  I will work with Senator Kirk and my colleagues in Congress to pass \nthis bill, which I hope will help protect kids when they try a new food \nduring lunch time or are given a cookie from a classmate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1503\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SOCIAL COST OF CARBON.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) on May 31, 2013, the White House released monetized \n     estimates of the effects associated with carbon emissions to \n     be used in Federal agency evaluations of the costs and \n     benefits of carrying out regulations;\n       (2) the estimate described in paragraph (1) is often \n     referred to as ``the social cost of carbon'' and is crucial \n     to the environmental agenda of the Obama Administration, \n     because the higher the social cost of carbon is determined to \n     be, the more costly regulations can be justified;\n       (3) the estimate described in paragraph (1) was developed \n     behind closed doors, without opportunity for public comment \n     or participation, by an interagency working group;\n       (4) although Office of Management and Budget guidance \n     requires the use of a 3 and 7 percent discount rate when \n     predicting future costs and benefits, the interagency working \n     group referred to in paragraph (3) ignored that guidance and \n     used substantially lower discount rates, thereby leading to \n     higher estimates;\n       (5) depending on the discount rate used by the interagency \n     working group, the increase in the estimate ranges from 34 to \n     120 percent;\n       (6) Office of Management and Budget guidance requires that \n     economically significant proposed and final regulations be \n     analyzed from the domestic perspective while analysis from \n     the international perspective is optional;\n       (7) the interagency working group referred to in paragraph \n     (3) determined that the social cost of carbon should \n     incorporate the full global damages of carbon, thereby \n     greatly increasing the estimates without providing a United \n     States-specific analysis;\n       (8) the estimate developed by the interagency working group \n     is a de facto carbon tax that is buried in the cost-benefit \n     analyses of energy related rulemakings;\n       (9) the cost-benefit analysis referred to in paragraph (8) \n     will play a role in the decision of the Obama Administration \n     relating to the Keystone pipeline and the development of \n     emissions regulations for coal fired power plants; and\n       (10) the actions of the interagency working group \n     unnecessarily and unwisely results in increased energy costs \n     to consumers and households, thereby reducing economic growth \n     and opportunity.\n       (b) Social Cost of Carbon in Cost-benefit Analyses.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in any rulemaking \n     or other action, an agency head shall not monetize any direct \n     or indirect effects associated with carbon emissions to be \n     used in a cost-benefit analysis of the agency, including the \n     social cost of carbon estimate (as described in the document \n     entitled ``Technical Support Document: Technical Update of \n     the Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis \n     under Executive Order 12866'', dated May 2013, or any \n     preceding, succeeding, or substantially related document).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1903.

WATER EFFICIENCY, CONSERVATION, AND \n                   ADAPTATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1)(A) human-induced climate change is affecting the \n     natural water cycle, decreasing precipitation levels in the \n     West, especially the Southwest, and making droughts and \n     floods more frequent and more intense;\n       (B) declining precipitation levels will severely impact \n     water supplies in Southwestern States; and\n       (C) a sharp increase in the number of days with very heavy \n     precipitation throughout the Northeast and the Midwest will \n     stress aging water infrastructure;\n       (2) changes in the water cycle caused by climate \n     disruptions will adversely affect water infrastructure, \n     energy production and use, human health, transportation, \n     agriculture, and ecosystems, while also aggravating water \n     disputes across the United States;\n       (3)(A) the Colorado River, which supplies water for more \n     than 30,000,000 people, is experiencing the worst drought in \n     more than 100 years of recordkeeping; and\n       (B) the primary reservoirs of the Colorado River Basin and \n     Lakes Mead and Powell have lost nearly half of the storage \n     waters of the reservoirs and Lakes, and clean hydropower \n     generated from Hoover Dam risks reduction if the extended \n     drought persists;\n       (4) States and local governments and water utilities can \n     begin to address the challenges described in this subsection \n     by providing incentives for water efficiency and \n     conservation, while also planning and investing in \n     infrastructure to adapt to the impacts of climate change, \n     particularly those impacts already affecting the United \n     States;\n       (5) residential water demand can be reduced by 25 to 40 \n     percent using existing, cost-effective technologies that also \n     can reduce the water bills of consumers by hundreds of \n     dollars per year; and\n       (6) water and energy use are inseparable activities, and \n     supplying and treating water consumes around 4 percent of the \n     electricity of the United States, and electricity makes up 75 \n     percent of the cost of processing and delivering municipal \n     water.\n       (b) Definition of Administrator.--In this section, the term \n     ``Administrator'' means the Administrator of the \n     Environmental Protection Agency.\n       (c) WaterSense.--\n       (1) In general.--There is established within the \n     Environmental Protection Agency a WaterSense program to \n     identify and promote water efficient products, buildings, \n     landscapes, facilities, processes, and services so as--\n       (A) to reduce water use;\n       (B) to reduce the strain on water, wastewater, and \n     stormwater infrastructure;\n       (C) to conserve energy used to pump, heat, transport, and \n     treat water; and\n       (D) to preserve water resources for future generations, \n     through voluntary labeling of, or other forms of \n     communications about, products, buildings, landscapes, \n     facilities, processes, and services that meet the highest \n     water efficiency and performance criteria.\n       (2) Duties.--The Administrator shall--\n       (A) establish--\n       (i) a WaterSense label to be used for certain items;

SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE KEYSTONE XL \n                   PIPELINE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) safe and responsible production, transportation, and \n     use of oil and petroleum products provide the foundation of \n     the energy economy of the United States, helping to secure \n     and advance the economic prosperity, national security, and \n     overall quality of life in the United States;\n       (2) the Keystone XL pipeline would provide short- and long-\n     term employment opportunities and related labor income \n     benefits, such as government revenues associated with taxes;\n       (3) the State of Nebraska has thoroughly reviewed and \n     approved the proposed Keystone XL pipeline reroute, \n     concluding that the concerns of Nebraskans have had a major \n     influence on the pipeline reroute and that the reroute will \n     have minimal environmental impacts;\n       (4) the Department of State and other Federal agencies have \n     conducted extensive studies and analysis over a long period \n     of time on the technical, environmental, social, and economic \n     impact of the proposed Keystone XL pipeline;\n       (5) assessments by the Department of State found that the \n     Keystone XL pipeline is ``not likely to impact the amount of \n     crude oil produced from the oil sands'' and that ``approval \n     or denial of the proposed Project is unlikely to have a \n     substantial impact on the rate of development in the oil \n     sands'';\n       (6) the Department of State found that the incremental life \n     cycle greenhouse gas emissions associated with the Keystone \n     XL project are estimated in the range of 0.07 to 0.83 million \n     metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents, with the upper end \n     of this range representing 1,000 of 1 percent of the \n     6,702,000,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide emitted in the \n     United States in 2011;\n       (7) after extensive evaluation of potential impact to land \n     and water resources along the 875-mile proposed route of the \n     Keystone XL pipeline, the Department of State found, ``The \n     analyses of potential impacts associated with construction \n     and normal operation of the proposed Project suggest that \n     there would be no significant impacts to most resources along \n     the proposed Project route (assuming Keystone complies with \n     all laws and required conditions and measures).'';\n       (8) the Department of State found that ``[s]pills \n     associated with the proposed Project that enter the \n     environment are expected to be rare and relatively small'' \n     and that ``there is no evidence of increased corrosion or \n     other pipeline threat due to viscosity'' of diluted bitumen \n     oil that will be transported by the Keystone XL pipeline;\n\n[[Page S6460]]\n\n       (9) the National Research Council convened a special expert \n     panel to review the risk of transporting diluted bitumen by \n     pipeline and issued a report in June 2013 to the Department \n     of Transportation in which the National Research Council \n     found that existing literature indicates that transportation \n     of diluted bitumen poses no increased risk of pipeline \n     failure;\n       (10) plans to incorporate 57 project-specific special \n     conditions relating to the design, construction, and \n     operations of the Keystone XL pipeline led the Department of \n     State to find that the pipeline will have ``a degree of \n     safety over any other typically constructed domestic oil \n     pipeline''; and\n       (11) the Department of State found that oil destined to be \n     shipped through the pipeline from the oil sands region of \n     Canada and oil shale deposits in the United States would \n     otherwise move by other modes of transportation if the \n     Keystone XL pipeline is not built.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) construction of the Keystone XL pipeline will promote \n     sound investment in the infrastructure of the United States;\n       (2) construction of the Keystone XL pipeline will promote \n     energy security in North America and will generate an \n     increase in private sector jobs that will benefit both the \n     region surrounding the Keystone XL pipeline and the United \n     States as a whole; and\n       (3) completion of the Keystone XL pipeline is in the \n     national interest of the United States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1909.
