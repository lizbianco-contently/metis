Mr. President, yesterday I had the opportunity and good \nfortune to be invited to the White House with Speaker Boehner, Leader \nPelosi, and Leader McConnell. We spent more than an hour with the \nPresident and Vice President talking about what is going on in the \nworld.\n  We do know what is going on in the world separate and apart from that \nmeeting at the White House. There is a murderous, vile terrorist group \nthat is taking over parts of Iraq and is trying to move into other \nparts of the world in the Middle East. Their brutality is \nunprecedented, especially unprecedented in that they want to advertise \nhow vile they are. They are so vicious, going after everyone--\ncivilians, women, children--trying to eliminate anyone who they think \ndisagrees with them. They have targeted minorities, they have targeted \nJews, Christians, and anyone whom they disagree with--religious \nminorities. We saw that. We had thousands and thousands of ancient \nreligious minorities trapped on a mountain by these vicious, vile \npeople.\n  Of course, they are after any American. The two innocent journalists \nwho were out just covering the news were beheaded and they advertised \nthe beheadings. The Islamic State or ISIS--whatever we want to call \nthem--will be stopped. They must be stopped and they need to be \ndestroyed and they will be destroyed.\n  President Obama has taken decisive action during the month of August \nto protect Americans and help prevent a humanitarian catastrophe. \nYesterday the President described his initiative to take on this \nterrorist group as we move forward, and I support him. President Obama \nhas made it clear it is going to take decisive action to destroy the \nIslamic State through the use of air strikes and drones. This is a \nsmart, strategic, and effective approach and I support it.\n  But there are people in Congress who are taking advice from Dick \nCheney. He was here yesterday. I think they better be very careful of \nthe advice they take from Dick Cheney. Dick Cheney is more responsible \nthan anyone else for the worst foreign policy decision in the history \nof the country, the invasion of Iraq. Almost 6,000 dead Americans and \ntens of thousands\n\n[[Page S5466]]\n\nwounded, thousands and thousands grievously wounded. Our fighting men \nand women did a yeoman's job. They made us proud. But was that war \nnecessary? In hindsight, it appears to me it wasn't. Not only have we \nlost thousands of American lives, it has destabilized the whole Middle \nEast and hundreds of thousands--hundreds of thousands--hundreds of \nthousands--hundreds of thousands of Iraqis have been killed. They are \nnow gone.\n\n  But there are some pushing hard in Congress to authorize use of \nmilitary force right now--right now. Dick Cheney was here yesterday. I \nguess that is whom they are following. But wouldn't it be a good idea \nfor us to stand back a little bit and see what the President of the \nUnited States has to say tonight? He is addressing the Nation. Let's \nallow him to speak to our country, to our fellow citizens, and lay out \nhis plan.\n  It is absolutely critical that the American people and Congress hear \ndirectly from the President of the United States.\n  In the Senate we are going to have an all-Senators briefing tomorrow \nafternoon. The administration will come to one of our classified rooms \nin the Capitol complex and lay out to us in detail what is going on \nthat is not in the news. So every Member of this body will have a \nchance to get as much information as possible. The President speaks \ntonight. Tomorrow afternoon there is a briefing.\n  It is clear--the President has said so publicly, his administration \nhas said so publicly, and the officials who work directly with the \nWhite House--he is doing his utmost. He just returned from Europe and \nmuch of the time that was spent there in the NATO conference was about \nwhat they are going to do to go after this evil in the Middle East, \nthis ISIS group. He is doing his utmost to build a robust international \ncoalition including the Sunni Arab States.\n  For this mission to be successful, of course, Sunni Arab countries \nmust play a role and they will do that. That is being worked on as we \nspeak.\n  It is clear to me that we need to train and equip Syrian rebels and \nother groups in the Middle East that need some help. It is called title \n10 authority. The rebels have tried to get it from us and they should \nget it. That is our way of building an international coalition. \nCongress should do that. The Republicans are worried about money. There \nis money to do that. The chairman of the Armed Services Committee is on \nthe floor and he can certainly vouch for that. It would give authority \nfor the President to help equip these rebels.\n  Going it alone is not going to work. We must have the support of the \ninternational community if we are to rid the world of ISIS. We know \nFrance--I at least believe that--has stepped forward, I believe Great \nBritain has stepped forward, I understand Poland is part of the \ncoalition that has stepped forward, and there are many other countries \nthe President met with in Europe just a few days ago. We need to build \na coalition, and that is what he is doing, rather than declaring war \ntoday. Title 10 authority is something we need.\n  I repeat. Going it alone will not suffice. I also believe that as \nCommander in Chief the President has the authority he needs now to act \nagainst ISIS. I believe the vast majority of the Members of Congress \nagree with that. Now it is critical we support our Commander in Chief \nas he takes this decisive action. I am amazed--amazed--that some \nMembers of Congress want to rush to war, because that is what they are \ntalking about is a war. How did that work out for us last time? Not so \nwell. The Bush-Cheney strategy of rushing into conflict didn't work \nthen and it will not work now. Let's be cautious and let's be \ndeliberate.\n  I repeat. Former Vice President Cheney was here yesterday giving the \nRepublicans a pep talk. He gave them advice on foreign policy. Please--\nplease--taking advice from Dick Cheney on foreign policy, that is a \nterrifying prospect. We should be learning from our past mistakes, not \nrepeating them.\n  Air strikes and strategic use of drones and of course covert action \nare the most effective ways to take out ISIS without committing \nAmerican troops, placing troops in harm's way. So I support President \nObama's decision not to send in ground troops. That is not an option \nfor the American people. I can guarantee everyone that within the sound \nof my voice.\n  But now that the Republicans are taking advice from Dick Cheney on \nforeign policy, I am concerned they once again will rush to commit U.S. \ntroops to a ground war in the Middle East when we could accomplish the \nmission in a more strategic way.\n  I say to Democrats and Republicans, let's destroy these despicable \nterrorists, but let's do it the right way this time. The President \nknows and the American people know we have to take decisive action. The \nPresident knows how to destroy terrorists and their organization. Osama \nbin Laden is proof of that.\n  Let's give the President of the United States the time to do this the \nright way. Troops are out there defending us as we speak. They are not \nDemocrats. They are not Republicans. They are not Independents. They \nare fighting for us to protect Americans. We need committed, decisive \naction to stop ISIS.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/10/senate-section/article/S5466-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Last month I got to spend a lot of time with the \npeople of Kentucky, and since there has been no shortage of issues to \nkeep people up at night over the past few months, I got a lot of \nstraight talk on a lot of topics. I heard a lot about the crisis at the \nborder, about lost health care plans, the chronic shortage of good \njobs, stagnant wages, even Ebola, the spread of which is a threat that \nmust be taken seriously.\n  Yet one issue that kept coming up is America's role in the world and \nthe growing sense that some in Washington are more or less content to \nlet others shape our destiny for us. For many that concern was \ncrystallized when they witnessed the barbaric execution of an American \ncitizen by an ISIL terrorist and the halting reaction to it by a \nPresident who has yet to find his footing when it comes to dealing with \nthis group that clearly has the will, the means, and the sanctuary it \nneeds to do more.\n  Last week the White House announced that the President plans to \nexplain the nature of the threat ISIL poses in a speech to the American \npeople tonight. Well, after spending a month talking with folks in \nKentucky, it is pretty clear--to me, at least--that the American people \nfully appreciate the nature of this threat. After the beheadings of two \nAmerican citizens, they don't want an explanation of what is happening, \nthey want a plan. They want some Presidential leadership.\n  I hope the President lays out a credible plan to defeat ISIL. I hope \nhe outlines the steps he intends to take beyond simply the defense of \nBaghdad, Erbil, Sinjar, and Amerli, and what legal authorities and \nresources he thinks are required to execute a successful campaign \nagainst ISIL. But the fact is the rise of ISIL is not an isolated \nfailure. The spread of ISIL occurred in a particular context, and if we \nhope to defeat this threat, we need to come to terms with that now.\n  So before speaking with a little more specificity about ISIL and the \nongoing threat of global terrorism, I would like to briefly restate my \nconcerns about the consequences of the President's foreign policy, as I \nwarned a few months ago, because ISIL's military advance across Syria \nand Iraq carries a much larger lesson--a lesson that should prompt the \nPresident to reconsider and revise his overall national security policy \nand better prepare the country and our military to confront the threats \nthat will survive his time in office.\n  First, it is important to note a few of the consistent objectives \nthat have always characterized this President's national security \npolicy: drawing down our conventional and nuclear forces, withdrawing \nfrom Iraq and Afghanistan, and placing a greater reliance upon \ninternational organizations and diplomacy.\n  As I have noted on other occasions, I have serious differences with \nthe President over this approach. In my view, we have a duty as a \nsuperpower without imperialistic aims to help maintain international \norder and balance of\n\n[[Page S5467]]\n\npower, and that international order is maintained by American military \nmight. Indeed, American military might is its backbone. But that is not \na view this President seems to share.\n  The defining bookends to the President's approach were the Executive \norders signed his first week in office which included the declaration \nthat Guantanamo would be closed within a year without any plan on what \nto do with its detainees and the Executive orders that ended the CIA's \ndetention and interrogation programs at the same time. In May of this \nyear the President also announced that all of our combat forces would \nbe withdrawn from Afghanistan by the end of this term whether or not \nthe Taliban is successful in capturing parts of Afghanistan, whether or \nnot Al Qaeda's senior leadership has found a more permissive \nenvironment in the tribal areas of Pakistan, and whether or not Al \nQaeda has been driven from Afghanistan.\n  All of this underscores something I have been suggesting for some \ntime--that the President is a rather reluctant Commander in Chief--\nbecause between those two bookends much has occurred to undermine our \nNation's national security. Yet, tragically, the President has not \nadapted accordingly.\n  We have seen the failure to negotiate a status of forces agreement \nwith Iraq that would have allowed for a residual military force and \nlikely prevented the assault by the Islamic State of Syria and the \nLevant.\n  We have seen how the President's inability to see Russia and China as \nthe dissatisfied regional powers they are, intent on increasing their \nspheres of influence, has exposed our own allies to new risk. The \nfailed reset with Russia and the President's commitment to a world \nwithout nuclear weapons led him to hastily sign an arms treaty with \nRussia that did nothing to substantially reduce its nuclear stockpile \nor its tactical nuclear weapons. And, of course, Russia was undeterred \nin its assault upon Ukraine.\n  The President announced a strategic pivot to the Asia-Pacific without \nany real plan to fund it. This failure to invest in the kinds of naval, \nair, and Marine Corps forces we will need to maintain our dominance in \nthis region in the years to come could have tragic consequences down \nthe road.\n  Of course, we have all seen how eager the President was to declare an \nend to the war on terror, but as the President was focused on unwinding \nor reversing past policies through Executive order, the threat from Al \nQaeda and affiliated groups only metastasized. Uprisings in north \nAfrica and the broader Middle East resulted in additional ungoverned \nspace in Syria, Libya, Egypt, and Yemen. There were prison breaks in \nIraq, Pakistan, and Libya, and the release of hundreds of prisoners in \nEgypt. Terrorists also escaped from prisons in Yemen--a country that is \nno more ready to detain the terrorists at Guantanamo today than they \nwere back in 2009.\n  The President's response to all of this has been to draw down our \nconventional forces and capabilities and to deploy special operations \nforces in economy-of-force train-and-assist missions across the globe. \nSpeaking at West Point in May, he pointed to a network of partnerships \nfrom South Asia to the Sahel to be funded by a $5 billion counterterror \npartnership fund for which Congress has yet to receive a viable plan. \nIn those cases where indigenous forces prove insufficient and a need \nfor direct action actually arises, the President announced his intent \nto resort to the use of armed, unmanned aerial vehicles for strikes, as \nhas been done in Yemen and Somalia. By deploying special operations \nforces, the President hoped to manage the diffuse threat posed by Al \nQaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, Boko Haram, terrorist networks inside \nof Libya that now threaten Egypt, the al-Nusrah front, the Taliban, \nISIL, and other terrorist groups.\n  But as the nature of terrorist insurgencies has evolved, the \nPresident sees no need to reverse the harmful damage of the defense \ncuts he insisted upon, to rebuild our conventional and nuclear forces \nor to accept that leaving behind residual forces in Iraq and \nAfghanistan is an effective means by which to preserve the strategic \ngains we have made over the years through tremendous sacrifice.\n  The truth is that the threat of some of these al Qaeda affiliates, \nassociated groups, or independent terrorist organizations has simply \noutpaced the President's economy-of-force concept. In some cases the \nhost nation's military, which we have trained and equipped, has proven \nto be inadequate to defeat the insurgency in question, as is the case \nwith AQAP, the Taliban, or ISIL. In some cases the insurgency does not \naffiliate itself with al Qaeda or builds upon territorial gains before \naspiring to attack the U.S. homeland.\n  The growth, advance, and evolution of ISIL presents a turning point \nfor the President. Will the fall of Anbar Province and the threat posed \nby ISIL to Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey lead to a reconsideration \nof his entire national security policy, the kind I have alluded to here \nand elsewhere, or will the President confine himself within the \nbookends of shortsighted national security policies that were \noriginally conceived on the campaign trail back in 2008?\n  If prior events or arguments left the President unpersuaded, the \nemergence and recent actions of ISIL should convince him that the time \nhas come to revisit his prior assumptions and rethink his approach. \nISIL is large and lethal, and its rapid growth has outpaced the \ncapacity of either the Peshmerga, the Iraqi security forces, or the \nmoderate Syrian opposition to contain it. Ominously, ISIL has developed \nexpertise in small-unit infantry tactics, the use of insurgent tactics, \nand as a terrorist organization. As a result of oil sales, ransoms, \nbank robberies, and donations, it is also well funded.\n  We need a plan, and we need it now. The President has now declared \nthat defeating ISIL is his objective, and that is a very good start. \nBut Americans don't want a lecture, they want a plan--a credible, \ncomprehensive plan to deal with this menace that clearly wants to harm \nus here at home and is only becoming stronger by the day.\n  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Dempsey has said \nthat defeating ISIL will require military action within Syria, and the \nPresident has now declared that defeating ISIL is his objective. \nTonight the President needs to set forth the military strategy and the \nmeans required to defeat ISIL and to link those actions to any \nadditional authorization and appropriations he would like to see from \nCongress. If the President develops a regional strategy, builds a \ncombat-effective military coalition, and explains how his strategy will \nlead to the defeat of ISIL, I believe he will have significant \ncongressional support. This is no small matter. If Congress is asked to \nsupport a strategy, it needs to be a strategy that is designed to \nsucceed and not a mere restatement of current policy which we know is \ninsufficient to the task.\n  The President must seize this opportunity to lead. This is not the \ntime to shirk or put off his solemn responsibilities as Commander in \nChief because passing off this threat to his successor would not only \nbe irresponsible, it would increase the threat ISIL poses to Americans \nby enabling it to secure its gains within Iraq and Syria. In my view, \nISIL's campaign across Syria and Iraq presents the President with an \nopportunity. It is an opportunity to reconsider his failed national \nsecurity policy.\n  The President and his advisers may have convinced themselves of their \nstandard straw man argument that anyone who disagrees with this failed \napproach is bent on serial occupations or bent on invasions, but that \nis really a false choice, and it is certainly not a plan.\n  It is time to put the straw man aside and to realize the fight is not \nwith his critics here at home, it is with ISIL. That is why this \nmorning I am calling on the President to present us with a credible \nplan the American people have been waiting for, explain our military \nobjectives, and rally public support for accomplishing them. That is \nwhat the Commander in Chief should be doing at a moment such as this.\n  If the threat from ISIL demands the commitment of American resources \nand the risk of American life, the President has a duty to explain that \nto the Nation and Congress this evening even if it doesn't conform with \nthe tidy vision of world affairs he outlined as a candidate 6 years \nago. If his strategy is little more than a restatement of the current \npolicies, if all he plans to do is\n\n[[Page S5468]]\n\nmanage this threat and pass it off to his successor, well, we need to \nknow that too because Americans are worried and they are anxious. They \nwant and deserve the truth. Most of all, they want a plan, and that is \nwhat I am hoping for tonight.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/10/senate-section/article/S5468-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5468]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                   Lance Corporal Matthias N. Hanson\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to mourn the loss of a U.S. \nmarine and a Kentuckian from the hometown of Abraham Lincoln. LCpl \nMatthias N. Hanson hailed from Lincoln's birthplace of Hodgenville, KY, \nand was killed on February 21, 2010, of wounds suffered as a result of \nconducting combat operations in Helmand Province, Afghanistan. He was \n20 years old.\n  For his service in uniform, Lance Corporal Hanson received several \nawards, medals, and decorations, including the National Defense Service \nMedal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, and the Purple Heart.\n  ``Matt's our hero because of how he lived,'' says the Reverend Norm \nBrock, who spoke at Matt's memorial service. ``Matt didn't miss life. \nHe lived life.''\n  Service was a proud tradition in Matt's family. His father Lowell R. \nHanson, Jr., served in the Army. One of Matt's brothers is currently \nActive Duty Army, while the other is in the Army Reserve. Matt himself \nwas born in Germany on a military base. As Mary Huff, Matt's mom, puts \nit: Matt ``had to go rogue and join the Marines.''\n  Matt had a strong work ethic in high school says his father Lowell:\n\n       He used to get up at 4:00 in the morning to milk cows on a \n     nearby farm, then go to school, then onto football practice, \n     and back to work on the farm. Other people noticed and were \n     impressed by his work ethic, and I was proud of him. He was \n     determined that when he got old enough, he would join the \n     Marines and serve his country.\n\n  Growing up, Matt was known for his blue eyes and sneaky smile, and he \nhad a way of talking himself out of anything.\n  He had an easygoing manner and a lust for life. ``He was quiet, a \ntrickster and a charmer,'' says his mother. But ultimately, he was a \ncountry boy who wanted to do right by his country. Matt was a country \nmusic fan who particularly liked the song ``Way Out Here'' by Josh \nThompson. He was ``funny, energetic, really outgoing,'' says family \nfriend Emily Johnson. ``He could make anyone laugh. He had the \nbrightest blue eyes ever. That's what we'll remember him as.''\n  Matt graduated from LaRue County High School in Hodgenville, where he \nwas a member of the football team and the Student Technology \nAssociation. Next to his picture in the school yearbook he put the \nfollowing quote: ``Life moves pretty fast. If you don't look around and \npay attention, you could miss it.''\n  Soon after graduation he enlisted in the Marine Corps in the spring \nof 2008. ``He was very proud of what he had done when he signed up to \ngo to the Marines,'' remembers LaRue County High School football coach \nand assistant principal Rodney Armes. ``He got his hair cut short and \nhe was a Marine from the day he signed up.''\n  Matt was trained as a rifleman and assigned to the 3rd Battalion, 6th \nMarine Regiment, 2nd Marine Division, II Marine Expeditionary Force \nbased in Camp Lejenue, NC. He was deployed to Afghanistan in support of \nOperation Enduring Freedom in January of 2010. Matt played a key role \nin a crucial multiday battle in Afghanistan just days before his death \nin mid-February 2010. Matt's platoon came under fire from Taliban \nforces in the town of Marjah. Matt walked up, under air cover, to the \nfortified bunker where the enemy fire was coming from and fired a \ngrenade launcher into the bunker with great poise and accuracy, killing \nthe enemy forces. ``The battle was over,'' said Matt's father, thanks \nto his bravery. ``He played a critical role,'' says Capt. Gordon \nEmmanuel, Matt's platoon commander. ``Anytime he shot he was on impact. \nMarines were cheering with his shots.''\n  Matt's father was told by Matt's platoon sergeant and by Captain \nEmmanuel that Camp Hanson, once the biggest U.S. position in Marjah and \nwell known to any Marine who has served in the area, was established at \nthat site in Matt's honor because of his actions.\n  ``The last time I saw [Matt] was on Christmas Eve 2009,'' said Matt's \nfather. ``He hugged me around the neck and said: Daddy, don't worry \nabout me. Everybody dies. Not everybody has Jesus. Not everybody gets \nto be a Marine.''\n  We are thinking of Matt's family as I recount his life for my Senate \ncolleagues today. They include Matt's mother and stepfather Mary and \nLarry Huff; his father and stepmother Lowell R. Hanson, Jr., and \nCynthia Hanson; his siblings Megan, Samantha, Erika, Lowell, and \nBrendan; his grandparents; and many other beloved family members and \nfriends.\n  Matt was buried with full military honors in Hodgenville. The town \nthat is the birthplace of one of America's greatest patriots, Abraham \nLincoln, is also a fitting resting place for this brave young man and \nMarine. The Commonwealth of Kentucky will never forget the life and \nservice of LCpl Matthias N. Hanson or his ultimate sacrifice given \nfreely to his country. It is thanks to men like him that our Nation is \nfree.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/10/senate-section/article/S5468-2", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5468]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The President \nand Secretary Kerry are making every effort to help lead a broadly \nbased coalition which is so critically important to avoid the \nconsequences of a Western go-it-alone approach which was mistakenly \nused when we invaded Iraq.\n  This President, like all Presidents, will welcome bipartisan \nCongressional support, even though he has the authority in this \nsituation to act without explicit Congressional authority. I hope our \nfriends on the other side of the aisle will lay aside partisan attacks \nand make a true effort to find a way to take on ISIL in a united \nmanner. A strong bipartisan approach here in the United States will \nhelp the President and Secretary Kerry attain the explicit open support \nof a broad cross section of this world, including Arab and Muslim \ncountries.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about \nour constitutional amendment. I think we have had a very good debate \nthis week--an overdue debate. I want to thank my colleagues for coming \nto the floor and for speaking out. But there have also been many \nmisrepresentations by the other side about what our constitutional \namendment would do.\n  Michael Keegan, the President of People for the American Way, wrote a \npiece in the Huffington Post yesterday. He summed up the debate from \nthe other side of the aisle quite well. He said, ``a good rule of thumb \nin politics is that the scarier someone sounds, the more you should \ndoubt what they're saying.''\n  We heard some scary things in the last couple of days. Lorne Michaels \nis\n\n[[Page S5469]]\n\ngoing to jail. And he is sharing a cell with a little old lady who put \nup a $5 political yard sign. Books and movies are banned. The NAACP, \nSierra Club, and moveon.org have been prohibited from speaking about \npolitics--scary stuff but none of it is true.\n  Erwin Chemerinsky, a great constitutional scholar, recently wrote an \nop-ed in the Hill, rebutting many of the claims we have heard. He \nwrote:\n\n       The amendment--\n\n  He is talking about our constitutional amendment here.\n\n     --gives no authority to the government to ban or limit \n     anyone's speech. It provides the government no power to \n     ``muzzle'' messages the government doesn't like. It does not \n     change in any way the longstanding First Amendment principle \n     that the government cannot restrict speech based on the \n     content of the message or the views expressed. The amendment \n     would do no more than allow the government to regulate \n     spending in election campaigns.\n\n  That is the heart of what we are doing, regulating spending--out-of-\ncontrol spending--in election campaigns, dark money, big interests \nweighing in in an unprecedented way.\n  Professor Chemerinsky is right. S.J. Res. 19 reaffirms the First \nAmendment principle of equality. It will undo the damage done by the \nCourt over the years, most recently with Citizens United and McCutcheon \nthat said: Those with the most money have the most free speech. Nothing \nin the amendment would permit the arrest of anyone for engaging in \npolitical speech. It would not allow books or movies to be banned.\n  All the amendment does is restore to Congress and the States the \npower to set reasonable limits--reasonable limits--on campaign \ncontributions and expenditures, a traditional power that the Court has \nstripped from us. The amendment returns the First Amendment to its pre-\nBuckley interpretation when money and speech were not the same thing.\n  Prior to Buckley, we did not see the kind of legislation against free \nspeech that my Republican colleagues envision, offering extreme \nexamples of laws Congress could pass. That is one way to argue against \nthis amendment. But it ignores the long history of laws Congress did \npass to protect the voices of individual voters.\n\n  These reforms were not radical. They were narrowly tailored responses \nto restore America's faith in the political system after a lack of \nregulations led to scandals and corruption. Let's not forget that any \nlaw must pass both Houses of Congress and be signed by the President. \nThat is a significant check against any radical legislation getting \npassed or these days, against almost any legislation getting passed.\n  Critics also fail to acknowledge something else. Our amendment does \nnot give Congress free reign to pass any and all campaign finance laws. \nWhen the Court interprets any amendment to the Constitution, it reads \nin a reasonableness requirement. This means that even if Congress did \nabuse its authority and passed the extreme laws that conservatives \nsuggest, they could still be overturned as unreasonable.\n  But more importantly, Members of Congress who pass extreme laws can \nbe held accountable by their constituents. The same cannot be said for \nSupreme Court justices willing to strike down sensible regulations by a \nnarrow majority.\n  We also heard a quote from the late Senator Ted Kennedy. Senator \nKennedy did oppose a similar amendment in 1997 and 2001. The truth is, \nwe do not know if he would oppose the amendment today.\n  Citizens United and McCutcheon changed the landscape and changed it \ndramatically. Senator Kennedy was a champion for the underprivileged \nthroughout his career--in civil rights, education, health care, the \nminimum wage. He stood up for those who did not have a voice, the very \npeople who are harmed by most of these misguided Supreme Court \ndecisions.\n  We do know some of Senator Kennedy's colleagues who also opposed the \namendment in the past are still here in the Senate. They have \nreconsidered. Chairman Leahy, Senator Durbin, the chairman of the \nConstitution subcommittee. Thoughtful Senators who felt an amendment \nwas unnecessary in the past now see that it is the only way to fix a \nbroken system.\n  Changing the Constitution is a big step not to be taken lightly. In \nthe Federalist Paper No. 49, James Madison argued the Constitution \nshould be amended only on ``great and extraordinary occasions.'' I \nagree. I also believe we have reached one of those occasions.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the op-eds I \nreferenced by Michael Keegan and Erwin Chemerinsky be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Huffington Post, Sept. 9, 2014]\n\n            The First Amendment According to Mitch McConnell\n\n                          (By Michael Keegan)\n\n       Have you heard that Senate Democrats are working this week \n     to repeal free speech? I did, yesterday morning, from Mitch \n     McConnell.\n       Have you heard that Democrats are going to go out and \n     ``muzzle'' pastors who criticize them in the pulpit?\n       We did, from Ted Cruz.\n       Did you hear that Democrats are going to shut down \n     conservative activists and then ``brainwash the next \n     generation into believing that this is how it should be''?\n       We did, last month, from the Family Research Council's Tony \n     Perkins.\n       A good rule of thumb in politics is that the scarier \n     someone sounds, the more you should doubt what they're \n     saying. Another good rule in politics is not to trust what \n     Mitch McConnell says about money in politics.\n       Because, yes, that's what we're talking about here. Not a \n     secret new Orwellian regime. Not a new anti-pastor task \n     force. What we're talking about is simply limiting the amount \n     of money that corporations and wealthy individuals can spend \n     to influence our elections.\n       This week, the Senate is debating a constitutional \n     amendment that would overturn recent Supreme Court decisions \n     that have paved the way for an explosion of big money in \n     politics. In those decisions, including Citizens United and \n     this year's McCutcheon, the Supreme Court radically redefined \n     the First Amendment to allow corporations and the wealthy to \n     drown out the speech of everyday Americans with nearly \n     unlimited political spending. The Democracy for All amendment \n     would restore to Congress and the states the power to impose \n     reasonable restrictions on money in politics, just as they \n     had before the Supreme Court started to dismantle campaign \n     finance laws.\n       So, what are Mitch McConnell and Ted Cruz so scared of?\n       In fact, it wasn't that long ago that Mitch McConnell \n     supported the very laws that he is now dead-set on blocking. \n     Back in 1987, McConnell said he would support a \n     constitutional amendment to allow Congress to regulate \n     independent expenditures in elections--just as the Democracy \n     for All amendment would. And then he introduced that very \n     constitutional amendment. Either McConnell has dramatically \n     changed his mind regarding what constitutes a threat to the \n     First Amendment, or he's motivated by something more cynical.\n       So, if Mitch McConnell doesn't actually think that limiting \n     the amount of money that wealthy interests can spend on \n     elections is a violation of the First Amendment, what is he \n     up to? Could it be that he now finds it more useful to court \n     the dollars of major donors than the votes of his \n     constituents?\n       Washington is the only place where campaign finance reform \n     is a partisan issue. A poll this summer found that 73 percent \n     of voters support a constitutional amendment to get big money \n     out of politics. Americans know that our First Amendment is \n     about protecting the speech of citizens, not the interests of \n     wealthy campaign donors.\n       Faced with a large, bipartisan grassroots movement that \n     threatens their big-spending friends, the only arguments that \n     Mitch McConnell and Ted Cruz have left are wild accusations, \n     flat-out falsehoods, and outlandish interpretations of the \n     Bill of Rights.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                    [From thehill.com, July 3, 2014]\n\n                       Ted Cruz Should Be Ashamed\n\n                         (By Erwin Chemerinsky)\n\n       Reasonable people can disagree on whether it would be good \n     to amend the Constitution to overcome the Supreme Court's \n     decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, \n     but Sen. Ted Cruz's (R-Texas) false claims about the proposed \n     amendment have no place in an informed debate. In a series of \n     speeches and writings, Cruz has lied about what the amendment \n     would do. Surely we can and must expect more from our elected \n     officials.\n       The occasion for Cruz's wrath is a proposed constitutional \n     amendment concerning campaign finance that is now being \n     considered in the Senate Judiciary Committee. The amendment's \n     purpose is to overturn the Supreme Court's recent decisions \n     that have limited the ability of Congress and state \n     governments to regulate campaign spending.\n       In Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, in 2010, \n     the Court, 5-4, declared unconstitutional a provision of \n     federal law and held that corporations have the right to \n     spend unlimited amounts of money in independent expenditures \n     in election campaigns.\n\n[[Page S5470]]\n\n     This year, in McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission, \n     again by a 5-4 margin, the Court held unconstitutional \n     another provision of federal law that regulated the total \n     amount that a person could contribute to candidates or \n     political parties in a two-year period. As Justice Breyer \n     lamented in his dissent, these cases ``eviscerate'' federal \n     campaign finance law.\n       The proposed constitutional amendment seeks to restore the \n     power of Congress and the states to enact laws of the sort \n     that the Court declared unconstitutional in these cases. \n     These laws existed without problems for many years until the \n     Supreme Court declared them unconstitutional. In fact, seven \n     years before Citizens United, the Supreme Court upheld the \n     very provision that it invalidated in that case.\n       The proposed constitutional amendment, in its key \n     provision, simply would say: ``To advance democratic self-\n     government and political equality, and to protect the \n     integrity of government and the electoral process, Congress \n     and the States may regulate and set reasonable limits on the \n     raising and spending of money by candidates and others to \n     influence elections.'' Another provision would make clear \n     that the government can limit campaign spending by \n     corporations.\n       It is impossible to reconcile this language with Cruz's \n     claims about it. In a statement to the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee, Cruz declared: ``This amendment here today, if \n     adopted, would repeal the free speech protections of the \n     First Amendment. . . . This amendment, if adopted, would give \n     Congress absolute authority to regulate the political speech \n     of every single American, with no limitations whatsoever.''\n       Similarly, in an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, Cruz \n     said, the amendment ``gives Congress power to regulate--and \n     ban--speech by everybody.'' In remarks at the Family Research \n     Council, Cruz declared: ``What it [the proposed amendment] \n     says is that politicians in Washington have unlimited \n     constitutional authority to muzzle each and every one of you \n     if you're saying things that government finds inconvenient.''\n       The amendment does nothing of the sort. It gives no \n     authority to the government to ban or limit anyone's speech. \n     It provides the government no power to ``muzzle'' messages \n     the government doesn't like. It does not change in any way \n     the long-standing First Amendment principle that the \n     government cannot restrict speech based on the content of the \n     message or the views expressed. The amendment would do no \n     more than allow the government to regulate spending in \n     election campaigns.\n       Cruz's repeat statements are more than just political \n     hyperbole. They are false assertions intended to scare people \n     into opposing the proposed constitutional amendment.\n       In a statement before a subcommittee of the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee, Cruz said, ``Any politician who put his \n     or her name to an amendment taking away the free speech \n     rights of every American, in my view, should be \n     embarrassed.'' But it is Cruz who should be embarrassed by \n     his false assertions. Ted Cruz is a lawyer who had a very \n     distinguished career in government and private practice. I \n     have debated him on several occasions and know that he is a \n     person of great intelligence. He knows exactly what the \n     proposed amendment would do and yet has chosen to vilify it \n     by misrepresenting it.\n       Whether it is desirable to try and amend the Constitution \n     to allow campaign finance regulations is the question to be \n     debated. In this, and all debates, we should expect and \n     demand honesty from our elected officials. Cruz, in his \n     statements about the proposed campaign finance amendment, is \n     far below the most minimal standards of honesty.\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor \nand note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is recognized.\n\n\n                      America's National Security\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, most Members of the Senate and the House \nof Representatives and the American people are awaiting the President's \nspeech this evening. It is a critically important speech about \nAmerica's national security from our Commander in Chief. It is going to \naddress the horror of terrorism in the Middle East and particularly the \nIslamic state, a terrorist group like few others--maybe like none we \nhave ever seen.\n  This Islamic state, known as ISIS or ISIL, has been moving in full \nforce in Syria and in Iraq. They are different than other extremist \nterrorist groups because they take and hold territory. That has not \nbeen seen in the past. They are also hell-bent on establishing \nresources and ongoing visible treasury. Some say they generate $1 \nmillion a day in revenues from the oil production they are in charge \nof. They swoop into a city and take over the banks, raiding them of all \nthe money they can get their hands on.\n  In addition, they are engaged in some of the most barbaric and \ndepraved tactics we have seen. The beheading of two Americans comes to \nmind instantly. It is a heartbreaking situation for their families and \nfriends but an enraging situation for all of America, to think that \ninnocent journalists would be subjected to such horrific treatment. And \nthey threaten to do more. It isn't just Americans who are in their \nsights. They have targeted minorities. They have targeted those who are \nstruggling in Iraq to survive, and they are prepared to literally force \nthem into starvation or death. It is a harrowing situation. To think \nthat some 11,000 or 12,000 of these ISIS terrorists have wreaked such \nhavoc on the country of Iraq and the neighboring country of Syria \nreally is a wakeup call for America.\n  The President is going to speak to the situation this evening. We, of \ncourse, want him to lay out the threat, and he will. We want him to \nspell out why this threat is important to the security and the future \nof the United States. I am certain he will. I want him to speak as well \nto our approach and how we are going to deal with this threat, and I \nbelieve he will, in some detail. I want to know who else is on our side \nin this effort as we move forward, what the scope of our activities \nwill be, and the limitations of that scope of activities. The duration \nand the justification, the constitutionality and the legality are all \ncritical issues, and we await the words of the President of the United \nStates.\n  Most of us have held back at this point, waiting for the President's \nstatement, but some have not. Some have already come to the floor of \nthe Senate this morning to criticize the President when it comes to \nthis issue of foreign policy. That is unfortunate. I think the \nPresident is entitled to at least present his case this evening before \npeople come to the floor and condemn the President's foreign policy. We \nneed to hear from the President what his plan is. And my hope is--and \nit would be nothing short of a political miracle in Washington, DC--\nthat there would actually be bipartisan support for a plan emerging \nfrom the President's statement tonight.\n  Some of us may have our differences with some part of it. That is \nnatural. That is our responsibility in the legislative branch of our \ngovernment. But we should try to find common ground where we can. When \nAmerica speaks in unity, with one voice, with one determined effort, \nthat is when we are strongest.\n  There was a time in the history of this country--and I have lived \nthrough part of it--when there would be vigorous debates on foreign \npolicy on the floor of the House and on the floor of the Senate, \nleading up to a vote on a critical question such as the invasion of a \ncountry or a war. Even after a contentious and sometimes partisan \ndebate, without fail--without fail--there would be bipartisan support \nfor the emerging policy.\n  People remember the war in Kuwait. I was one who voted against it. Do \nmy colleagues know there was offered on the floor of the House \nimmediately after the vote in favor of the President's policy a \nbipartisan resolution supporting the President's policy? That was \nconsidered the natural, reasonable thing to do.\n  We can look back to the war in Iraq. Go back to October 11, 2002. On \nthe floor of the Senate we had a debate that ended in a vote on the \ninvasion of Iraq. It is one of those moments in my career I will never \nforget because 23 of us voted no, including 1 Republican, Lincoln \nChafee, and 23 Democrats. We voted no on the invasion of Iraq.\n  It wasn't long thereafter, though, that we were presented with \nappropriations bills to fund the military effort in Iraq. I voted for \nthem. The reason I voted for those appropriations is pretty obvious. If \nit were my son, my daughter, my spouse fighting in Iraq, I would want \nthem to have every resource necessary to accomplish their mission and \ncome home safely.\n  So there was a bipartisan consensus, even though there was a \ndifference in the formulation of foreign policy. I\n\n[[Page S5471]]\n\nhope that is what emerges tonight. I hope once the President has \nstepped forward and said that this is a plan, let us work together \ntoward that plan, that we will see some bipartisanship emerging in the \nSenate and the House of Representatives.\n  We can have our differences and questions, but at the end of the day \nwe need to come together as a nation. This horrible terrorist group, \nwhich has beheaded two innocent Americans and is absolutely depraved in \nits conduct, is going to continue. It is going to create chaos in Iraq. \nIt is going to destabilize that country, and it is going to endanger \nnot only innocent people but it is going to endanger innocent \nAmericans. Let's listen carefully to what the President has to say.\n  This morning the majority leader Harry Reid of Nevada came to the \nfloor and talked about a chance occurrence yesterday. Who should return \nto the Halls of the Capitol yesterday? Former Vice President Richard \nCheney. What a moment for him to return to Washington as we debate \nforeign policy. We remember the foreign policy of Vice President Cheney \nand others. We know the price we paid for what turned out to be some \nvery questionable, if not wrong, decisions.\n  At the end of the day in Iraq, 4,476 Americans lost their lives; \n30,000 came home with serious injuries. We added $1 trillion to our \nnational debt to pay for it.\n  It was Vice President Cheney's idea that the United States would be \nstrong and muscular after the 9/11 attack, and he picked Iraq as a \ntarget. We would take out Saddam Hussein. The purported weapons of mass \ndestruction never existed, never were found, but we invaded \nnevertheless. Now comes former Vice President Cheney again to inspire \nhis troops in terms of this conflict.\n  I hope not only Democrats but Republicans as well will think twice \nabout that advice. We have listened to this man's counsel before, and \nthe world did not turn out to be the place he promised it would be.\n  Let us listen carefully, objectively, and honestly to the President \ntonight. Let us try to find some common ground as Americans where we \ncan stand together against this terrorist threat.\n  The President has made it clear to all of us he is not going to be \nsending ground troops into this Iraq situation. We want to be careful \nthat we don't engage ourselves in a long-term war involving the \nvulnerability of our troops for a long period of time, so I was \ndisappointed with some of the statements made on the floor this morning \non the other side.\n  I hope Americans will listen carefully, as I will tonight, to the \nPresident.\n\n\n                Veterans Small Business Enhancement Act\n\n  Tomorrow marks the 13th anniversary of 9/11. Our thoughts turn to the \nAmericans we lost that day and to the men and women who showed such \nheroism above and beyond the call of duty. Firefighters, police, first \nresponders, and Americans from all walks of life showed on that day \nthat although terrorists might try to destroy our way of life, they \ncannot keep us down. Americans do stand together when we are \nthreatened.\n  Since that day, to support the global war on terror, the Defense \nDepartment says about 2.5 million Americans--members of the Army, Navy, \nAir Force, Marines, Coast Guard, and related National Guard units--have \nbeen deployed in Afghanistan and Iraq wars. Of those, more than one-\nthird were deployed at least one time. More than 11,000 lost their \nlives in those two wars.\n  There are ways we can show our gratitude and help our veterans, \nincluding service veterans from Operation Enduring Freedom and \nOperation Iraqi Freedom, now that they are home.\n  Tomorrow I am introducing, along with Senator Blumenthal of \nConnecticut, the Veterans Small Business Enhancement Act. It will allow \nveterans who own small businesses to participate in GSA's excess \nFederal property program. This program makes items that the Federal \nagencies no longer need available to nonprofits and other groups that \nhave a justifiable need for the property. We are talking about \neverything from vehicles to computers, office furniture, tools, and \neven heavy construction equipment. Participants in the program can \nclaim the items for their businesses if they demonstrate a justifiable \nneed for the property and they agree to pay for shipping and handling \nso there is no expense to the Federal Government.\n  By keeping their equipment overhead low, in this way the small \nbusinesses can grow their businesses. If unclaimed, the Federal \nproperty has to be disposed of by our government as excess property--\nand that costs money. The items have to be organized into one physical \nlocation, then photographed, catalogued, and ultimately auctioned off \nto scrap dealers who pay pennies on the dollar.\n  The National Association of State Agencies for Surplus Property, \nwhich helps facilitate the GSA's excess Federal property program, \nestimates that taking surplus property off the Federal Government's \nhands, pairing it with those who could use it, saved the United States \n$200 million last year alone.\n  Minority-owned small businesses participate in this program now and \nhave since 1999. My bill would extend that opportunity to veteran-owned \nsmall businesses as well.\n  Veterans throughout Illinois have contacted me to let me know how the \nsurplus property program might help their small businesses.\n  Jim Ward, for example, a retired Army veteran, owns a popular tile \nbusiness in Mount Sterling, in west central Illinois. His small \nbusiness could benefit from maintenance equipment typically found in \nthe Federal surplus program. Tile saws and cutters, kneepads, mixers, \nscrapers, trowels, and other hand tools are all items that appear from \ntime to time in the program. He says he doesn't need state-of-the-art \nequipment. Getting his hands on something that works would be a big \nhelp to his veteran-owned business.\n  Then there is veteran Jim Sodaro. He owns a bar and a snow removal \nbusiness in Springfield, IL. There are quite a few surplus items that \ncould help him operate his business and free up resources for employees \nand overhead. Jim says he needs things such as tables, brooms, paint, \nand hand tools to run his bar. His snow removal business needs a pickup \ntruck and other vehicles.\n\n  We heard from Jason Harris, a Marine Corps veteran who runs a popular \nlandscaping business in Carbondale, IL. Shawnee Landscaping designs and \ninstalls patios, fencing, and retaining walls for gardens and porches. \nMr. Harris would benefit from Federal surplus equipment too: Bobcats, \ntractors and loaders, hand tools and office supplies.\n  Tom Lomelino is a retired Army veteran and owner of the Lomelino Sign \nCompany in Jacksonville, IL. Mr. Lomelino makes and installs \nadvertising signs. He can use a bucket truck, a backhoe, or other \nequipment needed for installation and maintenance.\n  All of these Illinois veterans have a legitimate need for items that \notherwise would go to waste and we would pay to destroy. Wouldn't it be \nbetter to put these items in the hands of veterans so their businesses \ncan succeed and they can hire people in their local communities? I \nthink so. Small business is the engine of the American economy. Our \nveterans have served our country well. Let us serve their next phase in \nlife and make sure their businesses are successful.\n  I encourage my colleagues who want to support the veterans and \ndispose of surplus property in a productive way--not an expensive way--\nso that it continues to make money for the United States to join me in \nsupport of this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. MARKEY. I ask to speak for up to 10 minutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MARKEY. I rise today to speak about an issue that is fundamental \nto our democracy and vital to the future of our Nation. This is an \nissue so important that it requires us to take the monumental step of \namending our Constitution.\n  This is not an action any of us should take lightly, but our \ndemocracy is under assault and I will not stand by and watch the damage \nbeing done without trying to do something to repair it.\n  Because of the Supreme Court's decision in Citizens United, a tsunami \nof\n\n[[Page S5472]]\n\nundisclosed, unlimited campaign funding is corrupting our democracy. \nOur government is supposed to be about checks and balances. Citizens \nUnited and the recent McCutcheon decision make it more about who is \nwriting the checks and how big is their bank balance.\n  In the 2012 election, 60 percent of the contributions to super PACs \ncame from just 159 donors. Sixty-four percent of the money raised by \nthe Senate candidates came from a mere .04 of 1 percent of the \npopulation.\n  Our government is in jeopardy of no longer being of the people but \ninstead becoming of and for the wealthy. The voices of the majority of \nthe American people, those of middle-class families, seniors on fixed \nincomes, workers making minimum wage, are being drowned out by an ocean \nof campaign cash. This is utterly undemocratic and it needs to stop.\n  Congress has tried to stop this tidal wave of unlimited money, but \nthe Supreme Court interprets the First Amendment not as a guarantee of \nfree speech but of who can pay to speak. As a result, our democracy is \nin peril.\n  Campaign finance limits don't limit our free speech. They increase it \nby ensuring that every citizen can be heard and that no one gets unfair \naccess to our government at the expense of everyone else. Campaign \nfinance laws don't stifle democracy, they enhance it.\n  We need to fix our broken campaign system. We need a constitutional \namendment that overturns the Citizens United and McCutcheon decisions.\n  Our democracy is based on the fundamental principle that all voters, \nand each and every vote cast, are created equal. People, not dollars, \nare the true currency of our Constitution and democracy.\n  That is why I will be voting for Senate Joint Resolution 19, to \nsupport a democracy for all attitudes in the United States.\n\n\n                             Net Neutrality\n\n  I also rise in support of another principle that enshrines \ndemocratization to access of information and ideas: net neutrality.\n  Net neutrality is as basic to the functioning of the Internet as \nnondiscrimination is to the U.S. Constitution. In fact, net neutrality \nis just a fancy word for nondiscrimination.\n  The Internet is a success today because it is open to anyone with an \nidea. An open Internet enables freedom of expression and the sharing of \nideas across town or across the world. Yet the vitality of this open \nplatform is at stake. The FCC is currently considering a proposal that \ncould allow broadband providers to charge Web sites, applications, and \nservices more for faster delivery times to consumers. We cannot allow \nthat to happen.\n  That is why I am proud to stand with the netizens--all Internet \nusers--to show what the Internet would look like with fast and slow \nlanes.\n  Today is our battle for net neutrality. Today we demonstrate on our \nWeb sites what paid prioritization really means: Web users stuck on a \nbumpy gravel path while the select few whiz by on a sleek highway with \ntheir Internet E-Z passes.\n  In solidarity with netizens everywhere, I have posted on my Web site \na symbol familiar to Internet users everywhere--the loading symbol you \nget when your video is waiting to appear because there is congestion on \nthe net. My Web site today, along with countless others, serves as a \nharbinger of the dark days that lie ahead if we let the broadband \nbehemoths win.\n  I believe we should never forget that the net comes with a \nmanufacturer's guarantee: No one should have to ask for permission to \ninnovate.\n  To prevent this from happening, this summer I led 12 of my Senate \ncolleagues in urging the FCC to reclassify broadband as a \ntelecommunications service under title II, enabling the Commission to \nput the strongest rules on the books to prevent discrimination.\n  Internet access today is like traditional phone service was decades \nago, it is essential for everyday living. But if the ISPs have their \nway, the FCC would turn the Internet from a democratic ``Field of \nDreams'' into an exclusive set of gated communities.\n  But the good news is the online activist community--the Netroots and \nthe startups, the Internet investors--have spoken out in favor of \nimplementing title II to protect net neutrality.\n  I will continue to join with my colleagues in the Senate to fight for \nan open and nondiscriminatory Internet because the future of our \ncountry depends upon it.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, as many of you know, my wife and I still \nfarm, and for part of August I had the pleasure to be able to be on the \ntractor and have some quality time to think about what makes our Nation \ngreat. There are many reasons, but one of them is the belief that \neveryone has a say in the decisions we make in this democracy, that \neach of us--from the richest to the poorest--has an equal stake in \nelecting our leaders and impacting how we govern. Unfortunately, the \nSupreme Court has not figured that out.\n  From the Citizens United case to this year's McCutcheon decision, the \nJustices continually side with big money and corporations. They are \nsiding with those who think government should work for the rich and the \nelite. They are siding with those who think that money equals speech \nand think it is OK for the wealthy to drown out the voices of the \nworking folks, of the middle class, of everyone else.\n  Our current election system is hurting our democracy by reducing \npublic confidence in our elections and increasing apathy in the \npolitical process. After all, why should someone take time out to \nfollow our political process and vote when our system leads them to \nbelieve their vote does not make a difference? We simply cannot let \nthat happen.\n  I agree with my colleague from Arizona, Senator McCain, when he says \nthat sooner or later our current system is going to cause a scandal in \nthis body. This body cannot afford to fall further out of favor with \nthe American people. After all, negative numbers are right around the \ncorner.\n  The unprecedented amount of money--much of it unaccountable and \nanything but transparent--is allowing corporations to have an outsized \nsay in not just who gets elected but how they act once they get into \noffice. And trust me, corporate voices already have plenty of influence \nin Congress. It is putting up walls between regular folks and elected \nleaders who spend more and more hours on the phone with donors or \nbowing to those who might finance an outside ad campaign on their \nbehalf and leaves less time for constituents.\n  Too many of the Justices--and too many of our colleagues--do not \nunderstand that many of Washington's current problems are tied to our \ncampaign finance system. A lot of folks in the Senate and the House \ntalk about working together. They talk about reaching across the aisle \nfor responsible solutions that move our country forward. So what is \nholding them back? In many cases, it is the threat of big money coming \nafter them in their next election.\n  We are not talking about Rick who works at Walmart or Amanda who \nteaches third grade chipping in $20 for a candidate they believe in. We \nare talking about corporate executives plowing millions--sometimes tens \nof millions--of dollars into independent and often secretly financed \ncampaigns.\n  We have all seen colleagues hesitate to introduce legislation that is \npopular in their home State but were afraid it would spur big-moneyed \noutside groups to spend millions of dollars to defeat them. When that \nhappens, it leaves constituents without any real say in who represents \nthem.\n  Lawmakers are also held back by the hostile political climate that \nthese expensive campaigns create. When you constantly see an ad that \ndistorts your record, and then you see a fellow Senator from out of \nState endorse that ad, it makes it hard to compromise on legislation \nwith somebody that, quite frankly, you do not trust.\n\n[[Page S5473]]\n\n  Politicians also know that most of the money in campaigns is on the \nextremes of the political spectrum. And the extremes fight almost any \nsign of compromise and the folks who are willing to get things done. \nHeck, why are we having trouble confirming ambassadors? It is because \n``compromise'' is a dirty word. It leads me to wonder: Could we do big \nthings today like our predecessors did? Could we pull it together to \nbuild an Interstate Highway System or send a man to the Moon? Right now \nI think not.\n  Supporters of the current system defend their views by citing the \nConstitution. They put up some fun charts here on the Senate floor that \ncross out lines of the First Amendment, pretending as if this \nlegislation actually changes the First Amendment. It is entertaining, \nbut it is incorrect.\n  I guarantee you that our Founding Fathers--men such as George \nWashington and Thomas Jefferson--would not want to see the Constitution \nused to justify our current campaign system. Leaders such as Washington \nand Jefferson had a vision for our Nation. They knew America would \nchange with the times as new technologies were developed and new lands \ncame into the Union. Back in 1787 there was no Montana.\n  If the Framers warned against political parties, I can only imagine \nwhat they would have to say about the rise of super PACs.\n  Folks who support Citizens United talk about protecting free speech \nand the First Amendment, but who is protecting the free speech of \nregular working-class folks? Who is protecting the voice of the \nschoolteacher or the repairman being drowned out by special interests? \nWith this amendment, we are.\n  If the Congress needs inspiration, they should look at my home State \nof Montana. More than 100 years ago Montanans voted to limit the \ninfluence of Big Money elections. We were ahead of the curve. We called \nfor fair elections after wealthy mining corporations bought influence, \nsupport, and even a U.S. Senate seat--and our laws worked pretty well \nfor those 100 years. But 2 years ago the U.S. Supreme Court struck down \nMontana's law, citing its own Citizens United decision.\n  In 2012, Montanans stood once again to Big Money and its influence \nover a democratic process. In a voter referendum passed by a 3-to-1 \nmargin, Montana voters called on Montana's congressional delegation to \noverturn Citizens United, and I proudly accepted that challenge. That \nis why I am cosponsoring Senator Udall's amendment. Together we are \nsaying enough is enough.\n  Congress and the States should have the power to regulate campaign \nspending to ensure that election spending does not corrupt elections. \nStates should be able to decide whether to allow corporations' \nunchecked spending power in Governor and legislative races.\n  I heard one of my colleagues suggest yesterday that we are \nthreatening to silence the voice of the little old lady who wants to \nput up a yard sign in front of her home. In fact, it is quite the \nopposite. We are working to ensure that her voice is louder than that \nFortune 500 corporation--or at least as loud--when deciding the future \nof her town, her State or her country because that is what our country \nis supposed to be about, one person, one vote.\n  Spending for the Senate election in Montana in 2012 topped $50 \nmillion. That is more than $100 for every vote cast. In a State such as \nMontana, where the average household pulled in $45,000 in 2012, that is \na big sum of money. It is the kind of money that can buy a lot of ads \ncome election season. It can give a platform to drown out any other \nvoice.\n  According to the Center for Responsive Politics, spending by outside \ngroups in this 2014 election cycle is currently three times higher than \nthe amount spent at the same point in 2010, and as of the end of \nAugust, outside groups have spent about $170 million on Federal midterm \nraces--just the Federal part. Folks don't spend that kind of cash \nwithout thinking they are going to get a return on investment. Things \nare out of control, make no mistake.\n  Senator McCain is right. Sooner or later it will lead to another \nWatergate or worse, and that is what is frustrating. We know how the \nstory of unchecked money in politics ends. We have seen it before. Yet \nthe Supreme Court has opened the door to yet another scandal. So it is \ntime to overturn Citizens United, and it is time to overturn this \nyear's McCutcheon decision which invalidated a 40-year-old law that \nlimits the total amount of money an individual can contribute to \ncampaigns each cycle.\n  Since that ruling in April, about 300 folks have taken advantage of \nthat ruling, contributing over $11.5 million to political campaigns \nthis year--just since April--300 in this Nation of 300 million. We must \nput regular people and their ideas back in charge of our elections.\n  Amending the Constitution is not something we should take lightly. \nThe Constitution is our founding document, and it has held up under the \ntest of time. But Big Money interests and defenders of Citizens United \nare distorting our First Amendment for their own gain. Getting Big \nMoney out of elections is critical to improving how we govern, to make \nresponsible decisions for all Americans. It is critical to electing \nleaders who put people first. I am proud to step forward in this fight. \nOur democratic system has worked for over two centuries. It has made \nour Nation the greatest Nation in the world, and I will not let that be \njeopardized without a fight.\n  Back in Montana it doesn't matter whether someone has 5 acres or \n5,000 acres: They jump on that tractor, and that tractor is still going \nto break down; the weather can be good, the weather can be bad. It is \nstill going to happen.\n  The lesson is this. We are in this together, we all need to pitch in, \nand we all deserve a fair and honest say in how our election process \nworks and our leaders are elected.\n  I urge my colleagues to support Senator Udall on this important \namendment. It is simply the right thing to do for our democracy.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Madam President, I rise to speak against the bill before \nus, S.J. Res. 19. This is a constitutional amendment that would \nsignificantly curtail the free speech rights of all Americans.\n  I oppose this amendment because I believe that while it is critical \nto support speech with which we agree, it is even more crucial to \nsupport speech with which we disagree.\n  Whether it has been campaign finance laws or amendments to prohibit \nflag burning, I have consistently opposed amending the Constitution to \nlimit the First Amendment.\n  As others have mentioned, if this amendment is adopted, it would be \nthe first time Congress has limited rights protected in the Bill of \nRights. This would be a very dangerous precedent to set.\n  By limiting the amount of money individuals and corporations can \nspend on elections, this amendment would clearly limit their rights \nunder the First Amendment. The Supreme Court has made clear that this \nwould be tantamount to a restriction on ``the number of issues \ndiscussed, the depths of their exploration, and the size of the \naudience reached.''\n  This amendment would allow us to decide what amount of money is \nspeech and who can use it. This is a perilous amount of power to place \nin the hands of politicians. I don't think we need to protect incumbent \npoliticians. I think we need to protect the rights under the First \nAmendment.\n  In addition to concerns with what we know this amendment will do, I \nam even more concerned about what we don't know. Before we amend the \nConstitution, we are obligated to understand the effects of the \nlegislation.\n  What does it mean to ``influence elections,'' as the bill states? Who \nis a ``candidate''? What is the ``press''? Does this include bloggers? \nWhat about a citizen who writes his or her own newsletter to their \ncommunity association and prints it on her home printer? All of these \nterms and more seem ripe for litigation, which leaves the true meaning \nof this amendment in the hands of unelected judges.\n\n[[Page S5474]]\n\n  It also bears mentioning that opposition to this amendment is not \nlimited to Republicans or conservative organizations. The ACLU wrote a \nletter to the chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, \non which I serve, opposing this legislation. The ACLU stated: ``As we \nhave said in the past, this and similar constitutional amendments would \nfundamentally break the Constitution and endanger civil rights and \ncivil liberties for generations.''\n  I could not agree more.\n  Amending the Constitution is serious business. I believe limiting the \nBill of Rights for the first time in our history is a bad decision. I \nwill once again vote to preserve and protect the First Amendment, and I \nurge my colleagues to do the same by rejecting S.J. Res. 19.\n  As an incumbent politician, I am the first to concede that elections \nare daunting. They are unpredictable. It is unnerving to see other \ngroups and individuals spend money to run ads against you. But the \nalternative is to have me, as an incumbent politician, write rules and \nregulations to limit the speech of those who would run against me or \nsupport those who would run against me. That is wrong. It is wrong for \npeople in this body to define speech and to define who is entitled to \nit.\n  We need to tread carefully. That is why we need to reject this \namendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection.\n\n\n                            Racial Profiling\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. I rise today to discuss the tragic shooting of Michael \nBrown last month in Ferguson, MO.\n  Michael Brown did not need to die. This cycle of needless sacrificing \nof our teens to violent ends must end. It has been heartbreaking to see \nyet another American town gripped by such a tragedy. I welcome Attorney \nGeneral Holder's decision last week to begin a pattern or practice \ninvestigation into the allegations of unlawful policing by the City of \nFerguson's Police Department. I also strongly support the Justice \nDepartment's outreach efforts through their Community Oriented Policing \nServices Office. This office, known as the COPS Office, can help better \nevaluate and train local law enforcement to carry out fair and \nimpartial policing.\n  In addition to the recent investigation announced by the Department \nof Justice, I urge Attorney General Holder to expedite the issuance of \nnew guidelines that would, once and for all, prohibit racial profiling \nby law enforcement officers at all levels of government, including the \nfederal, State, and local law enforcement officials. Congress should \nalso examine the program that provides for the transfer of surplus \nmilitary equipment to local law enforcement agencies to ensure local \ngovernment is not inhibiting the First Amendment rights of people to \npeaceably assemble and petition their government for the redress of \ngrievances.\n  Local government must also respect the First Amendment rights of the \npress to do their jobs, report the story, and help provide the truth to \nthe American people.\n  For a more permanent fix, Congress should take up and pass \nlegislation that I authored, the End Racial Profiling Act, known as \nERPA, which is S. 1038. I want to thank my colleagues who have \ncosponsored this legislation, including Senators Reid, Durbin, \nBlumenthal, Coons, Harkin, Menendez, Stabenow, Levin, Mikulski, Warren, \nBoxer, Gillibrand, Hirono, Wyden, and Murphy. I also thank Congressman \nJohn Conyers, the ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee, for \nintroducing the House companion legislation, H.R. 2851, which has 54 \ncosponsors in the House of Representatives.\n  This legislation provides training and monitoring for law enforcement \nagencies at all levels of government. By enacting this legislation, we \ncan begin to reduce the racial disparities that plague our Nation's \ncriminal justice system. We need to better educate more of our law \nenforcement officials in the differences between specific suspect \ndescriptions and sweeping generalizations or profiling that wastes \nvaluable resources. Racial profiling is un-American. It has no place \nwithin the values of our country. It turns communities against the \npartnerships needed to keep our neighborhoods safe.\n  Two years ago, I want to remind my colleagues, the Senate and the \nAmerican people were having this very same conversation. So it is \nheartbreaking to me that we are having this conversation again without \nhaving taken more definitive action. In 2012 the Nation's attention was \nriveted to the tragic avoidable death of Trayvon Martin in Florida in \nFebruary 2012. As we all know from the news, an unarmed Martin, 17, was \nshot in Sanford, FL, on his way home from a convenience store while \nwearing a hoodie and carrying a can of iced tea and a bag of Skittles.\n  After the tragedy I met with the faith and civil rights groups at the \nCenter for Urban Families in Baltimore to discuss the issue of racial \nprofiling. Joining me were representatives of various faith and civil \nrights groups in Baltimore, as well as graduates from the Center's \nprogram.\n  I heard there first-hand accounts of typical American families who \nwere victims of racial profiling. One young woman recounted going to a \nbasketball game with her father, only to have her dad detained by the \npolice for no apparent reason other than the color of his skin.\n  Trayvon's tragic death led to a discussion in the Senate of the \nbroader issue of racial profiling. The Senate Judiciary Committee held \na hearing on ``Ending Racial Profiling In America'' in April 2012 which \nwas chaired by Senator Durbin. At the hearing I was struck by the \ntestimony of Ronald L. Davis, the Chief of Police of the City of Palo \nAlto, CA.\n  I want to quote in part from Chief Davis's testimony, in which he \nsaid:\n\n       There exists no national, standardized definition for \n     racial profiling that prohibits all uses of race, national \n     origin, and religion, except when describing a person. \n     Consequently, many State and local policies define racial \n     profiling as using race as the ``sole'' basis for a stop or \n     any police action. This definition is misleading in that it \n     suggests using race as a factor for anything other than a \n     description is justified, which it is not. Simply put, race \n     is a descriptor, not a predictor. To use race along with \n     other salient descriptors when describing someone who just \n     committed a crime is appropriate.\n\n  Then Chief Davis continued:\n\n       However, when we deem a person to be suspicious or attach \n     criminality to a person because of the color of his or her \n     skin, the neighborhood they are walking in or the clothing \n     they are wearing, we are attempting to predict criminality. \n     The problem with such predictions is that we are seldom right \n     in our results and always wrong in our approach.\n\n  After the hearing I was joined at a press conference by Baltimore's \nReverend Dr. Jamal Bryant, a leading youth activist and adviser to the \nTrayvon Martin family. Reverend Bryant echoed the call of ending racial \nprofiling by law enforcement in America, and let me quote him:\n\n       This piece of legislation being offered by my Senator, \n     Senator Cardin, is the last missing piece for the civil \n     rights bill from 1965 that says there ought to be equality \n     regardless of one's gender or one's race. Racial profiling is \n     in fact an extension of racism in America that has been \n     unaddressed and this brings closure to the divide in this \n     country.\n\n  I have called for putting an end to racial profiling, a practice that \nsingles out individuals based on race, ethnicity, national origin or \nreligion. My legislation would protect minority communities by \nprohibiting the use of racial profiling by law enforcement officials.\n  First, the bill prohibits the use of racial profiling by all law \nenforcement agents, whether Federal, State or local. Racial profiling \nis defined in a standard, consistent definition as the practice of a \nlaw enforcement agent relying on race, ethnicity, religion or national \norigin as a factor in their investigation and activities. The \nlegislation creates an exception for use of these factors where there \nis trustworthy information relevant to the locality and timeframe which \nlinks a person of a particular race, ethnicity or national origin to an \nidentified incident or scheme.\n  Law enforcement agencies would be prohibited from using racial \nprofiling\n\n[[Page S5475]]\n\nin criminal or routine law enforcement investigations, immigration \nenforcement, and national security cases.\n  Second, the bill would mandate training on racial profiling issues \nand require data collection by local and State law enforcement \nagencies.\n  Third, this bill would condition the receipt of federal funds by \nState and local law enforcement on two grounds. First, under this bill, \nState and local law enforcement would have to ``maintain adequate \npolicies and procedures that are designed to eliminate racial \nprofiling.'' Second, they must ``eliminate any existing practices that \npermit or encourage racial profiling.''\n  Fourth, the bill would authorize the Justice Department to provide \ngrants to State and local governments to develop and implement best \npolicing practices that would discourage racial profiling such as an \nearly warning system.\n  Finally, the bill would require the Attorney General to provide \nperiodic reports to assess the nature of any ongoing discriminatory \nprofiling practices. The bill would also provide remedies for \nindividuals who were harmed by racial profiling.\n  The legislation I have introduced is supported by a broad coalition \nof civil rights groups. These groups include the Leadership Conference \non Civil and Human Rights, the ACLU, NAACP, Rights Working Group, and \nnumerous other national, State and local organizations.\n  Racial profiling is bad policy, but given the state of our budgets, \nit also diverts scarce resources from real law enforcement. Law \nenforcement officials nationwide already have tight budgets. The more \nresources spent investigating individuals because of their race, \nreligion, national origin or ethnicity, the fewer resources are used \ntowards suspects who are actually demonstrating illegal behavior. Using \nracial profiling makes it less likely that certain affected communities \nwill voluntarily cooperate with local law enforcement and community \npolicing efforts, making it harder for our law enforcement community to \nfight crime and terrorism.\n  Minorities living and working in these communities in which racial \nprofiling is used may feel discouraged from traveling freely, which \ncorrodes the public trust in government. This ultimately demonizes \nentire communities and perpetuates negative stereotypes based on an \nindividual's race, ethnicity or religion.\n  Racial profiling has no place in modern law enforcement. The vast \nmajority of law enforcement officials who put their lives on the line \nevery day handle their jobs with professionalism, diligence, and \nfidelity to the rule of law, and they understand that racial profiling \nhas no place in their work.\n  However, the Congress and Justice Department should still take steps \nto prohibit racial profiling and finally root out its use.\n  I agree with Attorney General Holder's remarks to the American-Arab \nAnti-Discrimination Committee where he stated:\n\n       In this Nation, security and liberty are--at their best--\n     partners, not enemies, in ensuring safety and opportunity for \n     all. . . . In this Nation, the document that sets forth the \n     supreme law of the land--the Constitution--is meant to \n     empower, not exclude. . . . Racial profiling is wrong. It can \n     leave a lasting scar on communities and individuals. And it \n     is, quite simply, bad policing--whatever city, whatever \n     state.\n\n  The Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees the \nequal protection of law to all Americans. Racial profiling is important \nto that principle. It should be ended once and for all.\n  As the late Senator Ted Kennedy often said: ``Civil rights is the \ngreat unfinished business of America.'' Let's continue the fight here \nto make sure that we truly have equal justice under the law for all \nAmericans. I urge my colleagues to support the legislation I have \nintroduced that will end racial profiling once and for all.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, I rise to express my strong \nfrustration--and the frustration of Nebraskans--with the Senate's \ncurrent debate.\n  Similar to many of my colleagues, I spent the past 5 weeks traveling \nmy State and meeting with constituents. I held over one dozen listening \nsessions in communities all across Nebraska. Not a single Nebraskan \ntold me to go back to Washington and vote to limit free speech. Not a \nsingle Nebraskan told me to come and play politics or take show votes.\n  The message I received from almost every Nebraskan was the same: Get \nsomething done, turn the economy around, deal with overregulation, help \ncontrol the costs of health care, and help businesses create jobs. \nPrevailing concern with the economy and weak job growth exists all \nacross our country. According to several leading economists, 225,000 \njobs were supposed to be created last month. Instead, the number of \njobs created was just 142,000. The real unemployment rate--those who \nare unemployed or underemployed--remains unacceptably high at nearly 12 \npercent. That is 19 million Americans who are out of work or want to \nwork more hours.\n  It is a disgrace the Senate is not debating policies that will help \nthem. Instead, we are debating a bill to limit free speech. It is no \nwonder the American people have such a poor opinion of Congress. \nSeriously, what are we doing here? In Washington, those in power are \nmore concerned with winning elections so they can stay in power than \nwith actually governing and making tough decisions that will protect \nour country and help our families, and that is what we are doing today \nwith another show vote, another sound bite that is engineered by \ncampaign strategists who don't have any interest in sound policy.\n  I wish to address the two proposals before the Senate this week--a \nresolution to amend the Bill of Rights and campaign legislation that is \ntargeting women voters. The resolution offered by the Senator from New \nMexico is, I believe, a clear attack on the First Amendment and a \nseries of recent Supreme Court rulings. The measure grants unlimited \nauthority to Congress and State legislatures to criminalize speech on \nany platform, and that includes the Internet.\n  This proposal guts the First Amendment and the principles of free \nspeech that have endured since the Bill of Rights was ratified in 1791. \nIt further empowers incumbent politicians to make decisions with less \naccountability, and it muffles the voices of private citizens. It is \nperverse that the Senate is actually devoting time to debating the \nconstitutional amendment that would actually diminish democratic \nparticipation and decrease freedom.\n  What have we become?\n  In a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, the ACLU wrote that \nthe proposed amendment ``would severely limit the First Amendment, lead \ndirectly to government censorship of political speech and result in a \nhost of unintended consequences that would undermine the goals the \namendment has been introduced to advance--namely encouraging vigorous \npolitical dissent and providing voice to the voiceless, which we, of \ncourse, support.''\n  The ACLU is not exactly an ally of the Republican Party, but their \nletter shows there is broad concern over this poorly crafted \nresolution.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to stand for free \nspeech, to stand for democratic participation, and to reject this \nresolution.\n\n\n                           PAYCHECK FAIRNESS\n\n  At this time I wish to address the issue of equal pay and the \npaycheck fairness legislation. Make no mistake, some women in this \ncountry continue to struggle with gender-based pay discrimination. \nEqual pay for equal work is a principle I strongly support. With 60 \npercent of women working as primary breadwinners, lost wages hurt \nfamilies and single women alike. Republicans fully agree that gender-\nbased pay discrimination in the workplace is unacceptable.\n  In April I worked with Senator Collins, Senator Ayotte, and Senator \nMurkowski on a reasonable proposal to modernize key portions of the 51-\nyear-old Equal Pay Act. Our proposal prevents retaliation against \nemployees who inquire about, discuss or disclose\n\n[[Page S5476]]\n\ntheir salaries. In fact, one of the President's April Executive orders \nalso deals with nonretaliation, suggesting this is an area we can agree \nand work together.\n  Our proposal also reinforces current law which prohibits pay \ndiscrimination based on gender and it requires employers to notify \nemployees of their rights.\n  Finally, it addresses the opportunity gap or the need to provide both \nmen and women with good-paying jobs. It consolidates duplicative job \ntraining programs and provides Federal grants to States for the \ncreation of industry-led partnerships. This program is meant to provide \nwomen and men underrepresented in industries that report worker \nshortages with the skills they need to compete.\n  I believe this proposal could pass the Senate. It is reasonable, it \nis targeted, and it is a serious solution. Instead, we have a Senate \nthat is laser focused on election-year politics, bills that no \nRepublican can support, and bills that even some Democrats reject.\n  The majority leader does not appear to have any interest in putting \nbills on the floor that can pass--bills we can work on together. That \nidea doesn't fit into that election-year playbook. At the end of the \nday, this is raw politics. That is all it is. Nebraskans expect more. \nAmericans expect more. They expect us to do our jobs, to work together \nto offer solutions, to debate, to amend, and to vote.\n  There are so many proposals I would love to vote on. Sometimes you \nwin, sometimes you lose, but we should be voting. We have to start \nhaving meaningful debate. We have to start taking votes, and they \nbetter be real votes. That is the only way we are going to do our jobs, \nand that is the only way we will be held accountable by our \nconstituents. We should be tackling those very important issues we \nspoke to our neighbors and friends about when we were at home traveling \nour States during the August recess.\n  Enough with the sound bites, enough with the show votes, enough \nspeaking to cameras. Let's listen to the American people. Let's get \nback to the Senate we all admired when we were in school and read about \nin our country's history. As students we studied those serious--and \nmany times very heated--debates that took place on this floor.\n  As Senators we may not always agree on what is the best policy, but \nwe better start doing our jobs. We need to return to debating real \npolicy that addresses the very real needs of the American people.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  ISIS\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I was not scheduled to speak at this \ntime, but there is something going on today that is pretty exciting and \nI wish to share with everyone.\n  There is a new group that has been formed that is called the IDC, In \nDefense of Christians. I just came from addressing this group's summit, \nand it is pretty amazing. There are over 1,000 people in the Visitor \nCenter's big auditorium. It is the largest crowd that has ever been \ndown there, and it has been quickly formed because of the persecution \nthat has taken place throughout the world and primarily in the ISIS \narea.\n  Unfortunately I don't have charts that are big enough to project this \nissue well, but at least the President is there and can see them. This \nis the area where ISIS is working. They are not just in Syria and Iraq. \nThey are in Jordan and other areas. It is a very large area. They are \nnot confined to any particular area.\n\n  One of the problems that is being addressed--we know about what they \nare doing. We know they are probably the strongest force and greatest \nthreat against the United States we have ever faced.\n  I was very proud of the Secretary of Defense, Secretary Hagel. He was \nvery outspoken when he talked about the threat we are facing. He \ncharacterized it as a great threat.\n  Why is it a great threat? It is a great threat because they have \nalready declared war on America, and that is why I stood here yesterday \nto get support in the Senate for authority to use military force--that \nis AUMF--and we are going to make every effort to get that done.\n  Tonight the President is going to speak about this issue. Hopefully \nhe will come out stronger than he has in the past and say something \nmeaningful about how he, as the President of the United States, is \ngoing to win this war. I am not expecting it, but I am hoping for it. \nThere is no doubt that once we pass this resolution, he will have the \nauthority to do it. This group is concerned with that matter, but the \nreason they are together is because they are concerned with the \nChristian and religious persecution that is going on.\n  I have a lot of background in this area. Way back--before a lot of \nyou guys were born--in 1979, I was mayor of the city of Tulsa, OK, and \nI remember a man named Boris Penson. Boris Penson was sent to a \nSiberian gulag prison for 9 years. He was there because of the fact \nthat he would not relinquish his Jewish faith. He was persecuted \nbecause of his faith, and we were able to get him out. That was a long \ntime ago.\n  I had another experience in 1988 in Damascus. There was Christian \npersecution going on at that time. We were able to get them to change \nthe geography a little bit so the people there could openly pray to \ntheir lord and savior Jesus Christ. That was unheard of in Syria. It \nwas not like it is today. Today they are killing them. Back then they \nwere putting them in prison.\n  I think it is important for people to understand that ISIS is the \nmost well-organized, well-funded terrorist group in history. More than \n1 million people have fled their homes in Iraq after being given the \nultimatum by ISIS to convert to Islam or be put to death. Since they \ninvaded Iraq, hundreds and thousands of men and women have been \nenslaved and have been beheaded as a result of the ultimatum to \nChristians. I will read it to my colleagues because I don't want to be \nmisquoted. They issued the ultimatum to Christians living in the region \nI just showed: ``Convert to Islam or face death by the sword.'' That is \nwhat is going on today.\n\n  As I told this group a few minutes ago, now and then we have a happy \nending. I have been active--and a lot of people know this--in Africa \nnow for 20 years. I have actually made 135 African country visits. I \nhave seen all kinds of things take place in terms of religious \nintolerance, persecution. But I remember very well being in the new \ncountry called South Sudan. South Sudan is to the south of Sudan. Sudan \nis up there near Khartoum. We are all familiar with that and the \nproblems taking place there, and we know how intolerant they are there.\n  It happened there was a lady there named Mariam Ibrahim. I am going \nto show my colleagues a picture. We have never seen a prettier lady in \nher life. That is in her wedding dress. She is beautiful. She is \nSudanese. She had been a Muslim. However, she renounced that and she \nnow is a Christian. So they went to this beautiful young lady who had \none baby and she was 8 months pregnant with her next baby, and they \nsaid, We are going to put you on trial. You have to renounce \nChristianity. She said, I can't do it. They said, Well, you have to do \nit. So she was found guilty of not renouncing her Christianity. She was \nsentenced to 100 lashes, which would kill her, and then they would hang \nher up by her neck for public display as an example of what happens.\n  Several of us were involved in this. We had a lot of cooperation from \nsome of the surrounding African countries, including Uganda, President \nMuseveni came through; President Kagame from Rwanda; President Kabila \nfrom Congo, and our State Department and others, and we were able to \nget them to have an appeal. As of today, she is now out of prison. She \nis back. She has two children, and she and her husband and children are \nliving in the United States.\n  If it hadn't been for seeing what Mariam Ibrahim was facing and \nknowing that was going on and seeing the beautiful picture of her and a \nfew of us finding out about it, she would be right now still hanging up \nfor display.\n\n[[Page S5477]]\n\n  This is what is happening. A lot of people out there are saying, \nWell, ISIS is a very serious thing, but this isn't our problem. Yes, it \nis. I can remember 3 months ago I made the statement that ISIS is a \nthreat to our homeland and people didn't believe that was the case. \nThere is a poll that came out yesterday that I thought I had with me \nand I don't. But the ABC poll shows that 71 percent of the American \npeople believe ISIS is a direct threat to the homeland of the United \nStates of America. That is 71 percent of the people. They also \nbelieve--the same 71 percent of the people--that our President does not \nhave the strategy to win this war. So tonight we are hoping to hear \nsomething that is out of character for him. We are hoping it will be \nsomething strong that will allow us to win the war.\n  Let me wind up by welcoming those over 1,000 people who are \ndownstairs right now in the Visitor Center who are from the Defense of \nChristians Summit that is taking place as we speak. We have a lot of \npeople out there. They are doing the Lord's work and they will be \nrichly blessed for it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I come to speak today on a question of \nenormous importance. Before I do so, I wish to take a moment, as I was \njust with the majority leader and the deputy leader and a number of our \ncolleagues where we held a ceremony in commemoration of a Congressional \nMedal of Honor that was issued in remembrance of those who gave their \nlives on September 11, 13 years ago. Neither the Presiding Officer nor \nI were Members of the Senate at that time, but I think all of us \nremember where we were that early Tuesday morning, and the ceremony we \njust came from was an appropriate tribute.\n\n\n                           Student Loan Debt\n\n  Madam President, during the most recent recess in August, I \ncrisscrossed Virginia in a variety of efforts. One that was \nparticularly meaningful to me was where I did a statewide student debt \ntour, where literally I spoke with hundreds of students and graduates \nfrom families of nine Virginia colleges and universities about student \ndebt and what this crushing amount of student debt is doing to their \nopportunities to get the same kind of fair shot the Presiding Officer \nand I both had.\n  The schools I visited ranged from big 4-year public universities, \nsmall, private liberal arts colleges, to one of our historically Black \ncolleges, as well as a 2-year community college. The student debt \nfigure right now is at $1.2 trillion, exceeding credit card debt. \nStudent debt has exceeded the aggregate of auto loan debt, credit card \ndebt, and home equity debt balances, becoming, next to mortgages, the \nsecond largest debt of U.S. households. That means that for far too \nmany young people, and not so young people, they are forced to put off \ntheir decisions about starting a family, launching a startup business, \nor buying a home because of the burdens of student debt. Many young \npeople find themselves working in jobs they didn't want or necessarily \ntrain for just to pay off their student debts.\n  At Old Dominion University I spoke to Carina. She is a bright and \nambitious young woman who told me that in her sophomore year, she \nworked three jobs, at one point four jobs, to ensure that she met \ntuition. She mentioned that she was the first of all her family members \nto step foot on a college campus. She said: ``College is a foreign \nfield in my family.'' She said: ``I am a pioneer.'' She is not alone. \nThe challenges she faces are repeated time and time again.\n  At Virginia State University, one of our historically Black colleges, \nI met with Tobias, who mentioned that a lot of his peers had to drop \nout of school because they could not afford to take out any more loans \nor debt. He told me: Senator Warner, I have made the decision to stay \nin school. It is the key to my future, but I do so knowing that I will \nhave to spend a lot of years paying off student loans.\n\n  At one of our finer public institutions in Virginia, the College of \nWilliam & Mary, I had a great conversation with Jacob, a junior \noriginally from the far southwest part of our State, in Lebanon, VA. He \nis graduating from college in 3 years instead of 4 because of dual \nenrollment he took while he was in high school, at Southwest Virginia \nCommunity College. He told me that despite his ambition, it is \nfinancially impossible for him to go on to immediately get a graduate \ndegree or buy a home or buy a car or start a business, because even \nwith shortening college from 4 years to 3 years, he still has a \ntremendous amount of student debt.\n  I have to tell my colleagues, across Virginia I have heard over the \nlast year more about this issue than virtually any other issue, from \nyoung people, from families, from parents. I remember somebody in \nVirginia Beach not too long ago, a young man, 31 years old, who \nactually served in elective office. He had graduated from the \nUniversity of Michigan Law School, had worked as a lawyer, had been \nlaid off, and was moving back in with his parents at the age of 31. I \ncould almost see his ambitions being crushed because his student debt \npayments amounted to $2,000 a month. Where does he get the same kind of \nfair shot that many of us had?\n  I am the first member of my family to graduate from college. I got \nout of college and law school and worked for a while, started \nbusinesses, failed miserably twice. The third time I managed to do well \nin a startup industry called cell phones. But I came out of that \nexperience with a total of $15,000 worth of debt. I am not sure I would \nhave taken the first shot or second shot or, Lord knows a third shot, \nif I had come out with $50,000 $60,000, $70,000, $80,000, or $100,000 \nof debt that many people come out of school with now.\n  We have to get on this issue. This issue is having an effect on our \neconomic recovery. I meet with homebuilders on a regular basis and with \nrealtors on a regular basis. They are saying, The real estate market is \nrecovering for everybody except people buying starter homes. Why are \nthey not buying starter homes? Time and again because of crushing \namounts of student debt.\n  I hope during this shortened period we will get a chance to have a \nconversation about a broadbased proposal to refinance student debt at \nlower rates. I am not sure we are going to be successful in that \nproposal, but I think it is a conversation and debate we ought to have. \nI look forward to supporting that effort. But if we are not able to get \nthat effort across the finish line right now, we can't walk away from \nthis issue.\n  I have worked on a series of bipartisan, targeted reforms that would \nreduce costs, increase transparency, and allow students to better \nmanage their amounts of debt. Any one of these proposals isn't going to \ncompletely solve this problem, but this should not go into the bucket \nof issues we continue to kick down the road. The issue of student debt, \nthe affordability of college, are issues of enormous economic \nproportion and, frankly, one that shouldn't be viewed as a Democrat or \nRepublican issue.\n  Let me speak briefly about a couple of my proposals. First is a \nproposal I partnered with Senator Wyden and Senator Rubio on that in \nany rational place should be a complete no-brainer. It is a bill called \nKnow Before You Go. The idea is quite simple. Let's do with higher \neducation what we have done in real estate with the Zillow Web site or \nwhat we have done with the travel pricing, with Travelocity and a \nseries of other Web sites, and try to take every 4-year institution, 2-\nyear institution, career and technical education program, graduate \nprogram, and make them totally transparent on a single user-friendly \nWeb site, where before you go, you know what your chances of graduating \nare, how much debt you might want to take on, if you major in art \nhistory, the way my daughter did, what your chances of getting a job \nare and how much it is going to pay, so that we can actually make \npeople better informed consumers before they choose higher education.\n\n  Probably next to buying a house, higher education is the most \nexpensive investment you will make in a lifetime. Maybe students will \nfind out that\n\n[[Page S5478]]\n\nif they go to UVA and drop out after 3 years and come out with a lot of \ndebt, they will not have much with which to get into the job market, \nwhereas if they went to Piedmont Community College and actually came \nout with a 2-year degree in medical tech fields, they will have a 90-\npercent placement opportunity.\n  This Know Before You Go Act--we have collected most of this data \nalready, so it should not be that big a stretch to put this in a user-\nfriendly fashion. What if Tobias's friends at Virginia State had a \nbetter idea before enrolling in college how much they would be expected \nto pay, how this would actually break down grants versus loans, a \nrecognition of the actual graduation rate and their job prospects upon \ngraduation? Maybe some of them might choose a different path.\n  Better informed consumers of higher education would be one no-brainer \nstep.\n  A second opportunity--and I do not know where it falls on the \nideological spectrum, but on the commonsense spectrum it makes an awful \nlot of sense. Why does college have to be 4 years anymore? Why can't we \nhave more students--particularly first-generation students--getting a \njump-start on college with dual enrollment in high school? The key on \nthis is to make sure the credits they get in their dual enrollment at \ncommunity college actually count toward their degree requirement, which \nrequires what are called articulation agreements between the 4-year \ninstitutions and the 2-year institutions. It does not do much good if \nyou come into college with a lot of course credit but it does not count \ntoward your degree requirements. Let's try to make sure more students \ncan knock off a semester or a year of college in high school. That \nwould save families $10,00, $20,000, $30,000, in effect, if we could \nmake that happen.\n  If you are a low-income student and you qualify for a Pell grant, why \nnot be able to use part of those Pell grant proceeds in high school if \nthe credits you receive in high school in dual enrollment actually \ncount toward your degree requirements? Again, that is a jump-start on \ncollege. It would make sure that a student such as Jacob at William & \nMary, rather than being the exception, would become more the rule.\n  Let me talk about another proposal. Again, I am working with my \ncolleague from Florida, Senator Rubio, on this legislation. Senator \nRubio has a story similar to mine. He is the first generation in his \nfamily to graduate from college and law school. He tells stories as \nwell of years of repaying student debt.\n  In our student debt processes, we already have a series of payment \nproposals. Unfortunately, most of them are confusing. Many of them end \nup like the student I know or the young person I know in Virginia Beach \nwho is on a fixed payment proposal. This individual, as I mentioned--\n$2,000 a month, completely crushing his abilities to take any chances \nat all.\n  So what Senator Rubio and I have done is we put together a proposal \nthat would say the first option--it would still be the young person's \noption to opt out of, but the first option would be an income-based \nrepayment proposal that would cap your student debt repayment at 10 \npercent of your income. What would this do? Ten percent of your income \nwould allow you to take that chance on that startup business. Ten \npercent of your income, capped, would maybe give you the ability to \nsay: Oh gosh, if I hit a rough spot, I will not get crushed. I will not \nhave to move back in with my family.\n  This better structured, financially sustainable, income-based \nrepayment proposal would allow young people to better manage their debt \nand avoid the impact of default.\n  Part of our proposal includes loan forgiveness programs that will \nprovide borrowers such as Jacob in southwest Virginia the kind of \nrelief they want.\n  Even if we cannot agree on a grand refinancing proposal, this income-\nbased capping at 10 percent--which has been greeted by left and right \nalike as a dramatic step forward--ought to be part of our discussion.\n  Then I come to another proposal--one that, quite honestly, even this \nbody with all of its dysfunction ought to be able to get done. I \npartnered with my colleagues Senator Thune and Senator Ayotte on a very \nbusiness-friendly proposal that would be an option for an employer and \nemployee. Right now, if an employee wants to continue with their \neducation, an employer can take up to $5,000 of that employee's salary \nand apply it to their tuition, tax free, on continuing education. Well, \nif we are allowing an employer to do that for an employee to continue \ntheir education, to increase their skills, why not provide that same \nkind of option for an employer to apply that same amount--up to $5,000 \nof a person's salary--directly against an employee's student debt \npretax and tax free as well? It does not cost the employer another \ndime. This is purely at the option of the employee. It would be a great \nretention tool for a company to say: Hey, keep working with us. We are \ngoing to give you this benefit.\n  That young or not-so-young person will get this money pretax going \nagainst their student debt. It is common sense, bipartisan, and \nsomething on which--even with all of our bitter battles back and \nforth--we ought to be able to find common ground.\n\n  As I mentioned at the outset, like many Virginians, like many \nprobably in this body, as the first in my family to have graduated from \ncollege--I could not have gotten to college; my family did not have the \nresources. I had to work. I got grants. But I also had to take out \nstudent debt. The student debt that I had at $15,000 pales in \ncomparison to the average amount of debt with which people come out of \neven public universities in Virginia right now--more than $25,000. I \nhad $15,000 of debt after college and law school. Look at people who \ncome out of graduate school. On average those numbers more than double.\n  This is an issue whose time has come for us to address. In America in \nthe 21st century, you should not go broke if you decide to go to \ncollege. We all encourage our young people to get that education that \nwill allow them to prosper in a knowledge-based economy, but we hold \nout a false hope when we say: Go get that education, but we are going \nto put you into such debt that for the next 20 years you are not going \nto be able to exercise that education in the way you wanted to because \nyou are going to be scrambling to repay the obligations it took you to \nget those skills.\n  I say this as a former Governor. This is the case. I was proud of the \namount of the investment we made in higher education when I was \nGovernor. Quite honestly, if we look across the board at every State in \nour Nation as a whole, over the last 20 years Federal and State direct \naid to higher education has been virtually a straight line down. The \ncost of a higher education has been a straight line up. How have we \nfilled that gap? We have filled that gap with basically an unfair deal \nto a whole generation. We have said: Do not worry about the cost; just \ntake out more debt. For a while, when the economy was good and you \ncould get a job pretty much guaranteed coming out of college or \ngraduate school, this did not present a crisis. In the last 4 or 5 \nyears, as we have seen college graduates, law school graduates, \ngraduate school graduates coming out without job opportunities, we have \nseen this house of cards collapse.\n  I again remind my colleagues that there is $1.2 trillion of student \ndebt--greater than credit card debt. The cost of a higher education is \ncontinuing to escalate at a rate even higher than health care costs.\n  For those of us who are lucky enough to serve in this body, we all \ngot our fair shot. If we are really going to honor our commitment to \nthis next generation--and, quite honestly, the parents who are also \nhelping to pay off this next generation--we have to deal with this \ncrushing issue of student debt. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle as we address this problem in a \nreasonable, responsible, and timely manner.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin.) The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                                  ISIL\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, we all are anticipating the President's \nspeech tonight in which hopefully he will make the case for why it is \nin America's national security interest to eliminate the ISIS or ISIL \nthreat from the Islamic State that is forming a new\n\n[[Page S5479]]\n\ncaliphate in what used to be called Iraq and Syria and which hopefully \nwill be restored.\n  When the President first campaigned for President in 2008, I know he \ndid not promote himself as a future war President--just the opposite. \nHe told supporters that on his first day in office he would give U.S. \nmilitary forces in Iraq a new mission, which was ending the war. But \njust because one side of a war quits does not mean the war ends. I \nthink now we found that to be painfully obvious.\n  When the President was running for reelection, time and time again he \nboasted that he upheld that 2008 campaign promise and brought the Iraq \nwar to a close. He further assured us that the tide of war was \nreceding. I am sure if he had a chance he would probably take back \nthose words because history has disproved those very arguments.\n  As recently as mid-June, even after the so-called Islamic State in \nIraq and Syria had conquered the second largest Iraqi city, the city of \nMosul, a national security spokeswoman was still repeating the White \nHouse talking points that are 3 years old, telling the Wall Street \nJournal that President Obama promised to responsibly end the war in \nIraq and he did.\n  Of course, America's complete withdrawal from Iraq in 2011 did not \nend the war, as I suggested a moment ago. It just ended the U.S. \ninvolvement in the war in Iraq until now. But it did make the \nresurgence of war much more likely. It was, in hindsight, a tragic \nmistake. We were the glue that held Iraq together, but once we left and \npulled the plug without--because we did not negotiate a status of \nforces agreement or a bilateral security agreement, the old sectarian \nstrife that is perhaps centuries or more old came back to the \nforefront. Iran continued its aggression in Iraq, as it had been doing \nall the time we were there, as well as their support for Bashar al-\nAssad and his support for Hamas and other terrorist organizations. \nMeanwhile, in Libya--remember, NATO went to war in Libya as well, \nprimarily using U.S. assets and money.\n  Our complete and utter neglect of Libya following the neglect of \nMuammar Qadhafi did not end that war either; it merely created a \nsecurity vacuum that was quickly filled by radical militias and \nterrorist groups with ties to Al Qaeda.\n  If we learned anything from 9/11--and I just returned from a \nCongressional Gold Medal service in the Capitol--if we learned anything \n13 years ago, it is that vacuums get filled. If we do not fill the \nvacuum with constructive self-governance and respect for the rule of \nlaw and individual human worth and dignity, then that vacuum will be \nfilled by terrorists and others who reject all of those fundamental \nvalues of our country. We did not learn it. We did not learn the \nlesson. We did not learn it in Libya. We did not learn it in Iraq. \nEleven months after Qadhafi's death and less than a week after \nPresident Obama told the Democratic National Convention that Al Qaeda \nwas on the path to defeat, Al Qaeda-linked terrorists killed four \nAmericans in Benghazi, including our U.S. Ambassador--less than a week.\n  I mention all this recent history because it all comes back to the \nissue of credibility, not only of our Commander in Chief in the United \nStates, but of the American people. It comes down to our Nation's \ncredibility around the world.\n  Will we be trusted by our friends and allies? Will we be feared by \nour would-be adversaries, the bullies, the tyrants, the thugs, and the \nterrorists who will take advantage of the vacuum left once America \nwithdraws?\n  From the Middle East to the Far East, from Baghdad to Beijing, to \nMosul, to Moscow, this administration has done tremendous damage to \nAmerica's credibility.\n  America is the one indispensable nation in the world. We may not like \nthat sometimes; it may seem like too big a responsibility, but no one \nelse can fill a void left when America retreats. Ronald Reagan \nunderstood that. That is why he stood for what he called peace through \nstrength, and you know it works.\n  But when the President announced a withdrawal date from Afghanistan \nin the very same speech in which he announced a U.S. troop surge, he \ndamaged America's credibility again. Is that any way to encourage \npeople to support the United States and NATO's mission in Afghanistan, \nto tell them: Well, we are going to surge troops today, but we are \ngoing to be gone tomorrow, so you better make your bets in terms of \nyour long-term interest--which, in Afghanistan, means they are betting \nwith America's adversaries.\n  Of course, as we saw in Iraq, tragically--the investment the United \nStates made in terms of blood and treasure, which was squandered in \nIraq--he created another prospect of the squandering of America's blood \nand treasure in Afghanistan unless we have learned the lesson of Iraq.\n  Then there is Syria. The President has given speech after speech. The \nDepartment of State, Hillary Clinton, others, the national security \nadvisors, have said it is American policy that there be regime change \nin Syria, that Bashar al-Assad has to go.\n  But then nothing happened--well, I take that back. Something did \nhappen; 200,000 civilians have died in Syria as a result of that civil \nwar.\n  The President came to Congress to ask for authority to conduct air \nstrikes in Syria, but then when he couldn't explain what his strategy \nwas, he got a lifeline from Vladimir Putin. Putin said: We will help \nyou get rid of those chemical weapons in Syria. And the President \nretreated from that red line and nothing seemed to happen.\n  In addition to those 200,000 Syrian civilians killed since the civil \nwar started, we have seen millions of Syrians displaced in refugee \ncamps in Turkey, in Lebanon, in Jordan.\n  Then there is Ukraine. When the President promised to help Ukraine \ndefeat Russian aggression, and to help it maintain its full territorial \nintegrity and sovereignty, he subsequently refused to give the \nUkrainians even modest defensive weapons. I think we sent them MREs, \nmeals ready to eat. We sent them, maybe, some medical supplies which \nare important. But they needed not MREs but weapons to defeat Russian \naggression, to raise the cost to Putin and his regime in their \ncontinued invasion of Ukraine and Crimea.\n  Then the President decided: Well, we are just going to use economic \nsanctions against Putin. Putin could care less about the economic \nsanctions.\n  Again, as to the extent to which our allies and friends can rely on \nus when they get in trouble, they begin to doubt our credibility. The \nbullies, tyrants, and terrorists lick their lips and take full \nadvantage of the situation. We have seen that time and time again.\n  Then there was when the President--I bet this is another couple of \nwords he wished he could take back in light of subsequent events--\ndismissed the Islamic State terrorists as the JV team. Even though they \nwere gaining a stranglehold over eastern Syria and western Iraq, again \nthe President--by underestimating a threat, a threat I am sure he will \nconfront head on tonight--undermined America's credibility.\n  Make no mistake. America's credibility does matter. And when America \nloses credibility, the world becomes a much more dangerous place. That \nis exactly what has happened over the past several years.\n  I would say that despite the criticism I have made of the President's \npolicy, I believe he has an opportunity tonight, starting tonight, to \nreverse some of that damage. Beginning with this speech on U.S. policy \nin Iraq and Syria, he has an opportunity to reverse the impression that \nhe is aloof and detached from the ongoing chaos. He has the opportunity \nto lay out a clear strategy for destroying perhaps the richest, most \nwell-armed terrorist group on the planet. He has an opportunity to \ndescribe how our strategy might utilize Syria's more moderate anti-\nAssad rebel groups and describe how he plans to work with Congress on \nimplementing that strategy. He has an opportunity to sell the American \npeople on his strategy.\n  Make no doubt about it. While the President thinks he can go this \nalone and he doesn't need to come to Congress for additional \nauthorization, he does need and we do need the support of the American \npeople. There are practical reasons why the President should come to \nCongress. Because if he makes the case to a bipartisan Congress and \nCongress issues the authorization for him to act because we actually \nbelieve he has a strategy that can\n\n[[Page S5480]]\n\nwork, then I think the American people will be much more inclined to \nsupport that strategy.\n  Tonight I hope he will speak not only to Congress, he will speak to \nthe American people candidly about the threat and about our military \ngoals and how he intends to achieve those goals by the strategy he lays \nout.\n  He has an opportunity to explain the evolving nature of the terrorist \nthreat and also explain what he is going to do and what we can do \ntogether to defend U.S. interests and to keep America safe.\n  Yesterday the Washington Post-ABC News poll revealed some very \nimportant data with regard to the American people's understanding of \nthe threat and their support for what the President is talking about \ndoing. In some ways it seems as if the American people were way ahead \nof their leadership in Congress and in the White House. From the \nWashington Post-ABC poll I will read three questions.\n\n  No. 1:\n\n       As you may know, a group of Sunni insurgents called the \n     Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, also known as ISIS, has \n     taken control of parts of Iraq and Syria. How much, if at \n     all, do you see ISIS as a threat to the vital interests of \n     the United States?\n\n  Ninety-one percent of the respondents responded said they see it as a \nserious threat to the vital interests of the United States.\n  No. 2:\n\n       Do you support or oppose U.S. air strikes against the Sunni \n     insurgents in Iraq?\n\n  Seventy-one percent support.\n  No. 3:\n\n       Do you support or oppose expanding U.S. air strikes against \n     the Sunni insurgents into Syria?\n\n  Sixty-five percent support.\n  So we can see from the first question people recognize ISIS as a \nthreat. Fewer support kinetic strikes against the insurgents in Iraq \nand Syria, but still a two-thirds majority do.\n  My point is, while the President of the United States may take what I \nthink is a very generous view of his authority as Commander in Chief \nand under the Constitution to do this without congressional \nauthorization, I think it is a terrible mistake for him to do so for \ntwo reasons, one I just mentioned, which is he needs and we need the \nsupport of the American people before we send any American into harm's \nway to deal with this threat. We need to have a robust debate and there \nneeds to be bipartisan support for this effort in order for the \nAmerican people then to see we are united and thus to unite them in \ncommon cause against this terrible threat.\n  Then the last reason is practical too. The President wants, it is \nreported, $5 billion. We have already burned up about $\\1/2\\ billion \nwith air strikes in Iraq. War is expensive, and if the President says \nthis is going to go on for another 3 years, which is one estimate I \nsaw, he needs to come to Congress in order to get the appropriations, \nto get the money, in order to carry this out. If he thinks he can just \ncome and request $5 billion and Congress is going to rubberstamp that \nor write him a blank check without any strategy, I think he is terribly \nmistaken. From what we have seen, since our Nation has been at war in \nAfghanistan and Iraq for these many years, 13 years in Afghanistan, we \nknow war is expensive and $5 billion is a very minimal downpayment on \nwhat it will cost the American taxpayer to conduct this effort.\n  The President may have a very narrow view of his responsibility to \ncome to Congress and get authority, but there are very practical \nreasons why he should, as I said--both in terms of gaining the support \nof the American people for this effort before he sends more Americans \ninto harm's way, and the fact that under the Constitution the \nExecutive, the President, can't appropriate one penny. That is going to \nhave to come from Congress.\n  One party can't do this. Heaven forbid our national security would \nbreak down along purely partisan lines. But if the President doesn't \nhave a plan and if he doesn't lay it out tonight, it is hard to see how \nhe will get either the support of Congress, whether it is official or \nnot, or of the American people.\n  It is hard to see where this is going to go if he thinks he can fund \nthis on the cheap when, in fact, by his own estimate and others' it is \ngoing to take 3 years or more to defeat ISIS.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business \nfor up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Income Equality\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, as the Presiding Officer is well \naware, as one of our great leaders on our economic agenda, of what we \nare calling a fair shot, it is incredibly important in the time we are \nin session that we have an opportunity to vote again on each of those \nitems and hopefully pass each of the items at the front line of what \nAmerican families, American people, care about in terms of lifting \ntheir standard of living and creating more opportunities.\n  It is great that we have seen the stock market more than double in \nthe past 5, 6 years. It is great that someone who is living off of \ninterest earnings has a better portfolio. That is great.\n  But the person who is getting up every day, going to work, and maybe \ntakes a shower after work, ought to have the same fair shot to get \nahead so that this economy is growing--and that is great--but it needs \nto grow and create opportunity for everyone.\n  We can help with that by having the right support and the right \npolicies, and that is what the fair shot agenda is all about.\n  This afternoon we are going to be voting on a very important piece--\nwhich I frankly can't believe we are even having to talk about in \n2014--whether we are going to actually enforce equal pay for equal work \nlaws.\n  When I think about my own family, my daughter, daughter-in-law, and \ngranddaughter at 7 years old--I hope by the time she grows up we are \nnot still going to be talking about this issue. I think about they are \nworking hard every day and the assumption they have is that they will \nget paid just as their male counterparts are.\n  There are those who have said: Well, this is a distraction. This \nisn't really an issue. There are some in Michigan who have said: Women \ndon't care about equal pay. What they care about is flexibility.\n  My response is flexibility doesn't buy my groceries. It does not buy \nmy daughter's groceries. It does not put gas in her car. It does not \npay her mortgage.\n\n  The reality is, in America, in 2014, there is absolutely no reason--\nzero--that we would not have a 100-percent vote not just on the \nprocedural vote to proceed but on a final bill to make sure enforcement \nis in place on equal pay--a pretty big deal. An awful lot of women who \nare the sole breadwinners in their families are counting on us to get \nthis right so they can make sure their kids, who are now going back to \nschool, can have the school clothes they need, they can put the food on \nthe table, they can put the gas in the car to get them to school and \nget to work, and so on.\n  Another big piece of all this agenda in terms of creating opportunity \nfor people is to make sure you can afford to go to college. That same \nperson who is trying to put food on the table would love to put money \naside in a bank account for their kids to go to college and would love \nto know that, when they are doing the right thing--they are making the \ngrade, they are going to college--they will not be stuck with mounds of \ndebt, buried in debt, because we do not have the right kind of system \nthat provides funding for higher education and access to low-interest \nloans.\n  So another piece of the fair shot agenda, which is absolutely \ncritical, is to make sure--let's start with ground zero, which is ``at \nleast''--that anybody who has a student loan now will have a chance to \nrefinance it, just like you would a house, at the lowest possible \ninterest rate, which is impossible today.\n  Now, what does that do? We know there is more student loan debt today \nthan credit card debt. Think about that for a minute. There is more \nstudent loan debt than credit card debt--$1 trillion. There are \nmortgage bankers in Michigan saying to me: You have to fix this because \nI have folks who want to buy a house and they cannot qualify because of \ntheir student loan debt. They want to start a small business and they \ncannot get a loan because of their student loan debt. We also know \nthere are actually people who are on Medicare who are holder than 65 \nyears\n\n[[Page S5481]]\n\nof age in this country who are still paying off student loan debt. When \nwe talk about opportunity and a basic value of America: Work hard, go \nto school, have opportunity, it seems to me this flies in the face of \nthat.\n  So another really important piece we want to get to and we want to \npass is the ability to allow people, step one, to renegotiate and to \nrefinance their student loans at the lowest possible interest rate from \nlast year, which is 3.86 percent for undergraduate students. So that \nneeds to get done so we are addressing one of the huge burdens and \ncosts on middle-class families.\n  We also know that, unfortunately, we have another agenda item that \ncame about because of the Supreme Court deciding that for women--that \nfor women only--our choices on preventive health care, on birth \ncontrol--if we are on the job covered by insurance our boss can \nactually overrule personal decisions about what type of birth control a \nwoman will choose for herself, for her family. So we have a bill called \nNot My Boss's Business. I think it is pretty clear. It is not your \nboss's business what decisions you make, and you should be able to have \nyour birth control decisions and what you need covered just like \nanything else in terms of preventive health care for men are for women.\n  So that is another piece of all of this that needs to get passed to \nmake it clear. This is an economic issue for people. I know in my own \nfamily, when I think about my daughter and son and nieces and nephews \nwho are planning their families and making decisions, these are \neconomic issues about health care coverage.\n  We have two other critically important economic issues that are part \nof what we want to get done before this session ends in September. One \nis raising the minimum wage. It seems to me pretty basic that if you \nare working 40 hours or more a week you should not be in poverty, plain \nand simple. If we are going to reward work, if we are going to expect \npeople to work, then working should pay more than not working. If you \nare working 40 hours a week, you ought to be making more than the \npoverty level. It has been way too long for American workers to get a \npay raise.\n  So that is an important part of it.\n  Then finally there is a bill that I have introduced that, to me, \nought to be a no-brainer. I do not understand; we tried to pass it a \ncouple years ago. It was blocked. And it was blocked again by \nRepublican colleagues a few weeks ago. We need to get this done. It has \nto do with a part of our Tax Code that allows a company that packs up \nshop and moves the factory overseas to write off the cost of the move, \nso the American taxpayers, including workers who just lost their job, \nwould be paying for it.\n\n  Unfortunately, over the years, we have seen too much of that in \nMichigan. Now things are coming back. Manufacturing is coming back. We \nare very happy about that. But we want to send a very strong message \nthat if you pack up shop and decide to move overseas, American \ntaxpayers, the workers and their families, the communities are not \ngoing to pay for the move. But if you want to come back, we are more \nthan happy to allow you to write off those costs through the Tax Code, \nand we will even give you another 20 percent tax credit for those costs \non top of it.\n  So it is very simple. The Bring Jobs Home Act simply says: If you \nwant to come back to America, great, we will help you do that. We will \nhelp you pay for those costs to come back to America. But if you want \nto leave the country, you are on your own.\n  So those are the five items that we want to get done before the end \nof this month that all relate to whether we are going to have \nopportunity and we are going to focus on the middle class of this \ncountry. Too many folks are barely holding on or are not holding on or \nused to see a path to get to the middle class and cannot anymore. That \nis not going to work for America. If we do not have people who know \nthey have a fair shot to make it--that they have opportunity, that they \nsee opportunity for their children--if they do not have money in their \npocket so they can take care of their family and invest in the future, \nwe are not going to have a strong economy. That is just a fact.\n  So we are glad that Wall Street is doing well. But it is time to \nfocus on Main Street, middle-class Americans. That is what the fair \nshot agenda is all about, and I hope colleagues will come together and \nhelp us get this done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, when I was home last month, I heard a lot \nfrom Missourians, for really the first time over and over: What about \nall of the bills the House has passed that the Senate has not taken up? \nWhat about funding the government? My good friend from Michigan just \nmentioned the five things she would like to get done before we get to \nthe end of the year. I think everybody on the other side of the aisle \nknows those five things, for various reasons, will not happen this \nyear.\n  But what are we not doing? We are less than a month away from the \nbeginning of a new spending year. We have not voted on a single one of \nthe appropriations bills. There is no budget. The fundamental work of \nthe government is not going on while we continue to debate the same \nthings over and over because there are some people who think there is a \ngood title to the bill or a good headline: The five things we want to \nget done.\n  Equal pay. Who is not for equal pay? The law requires equal pay. In \nfact, when the President signed the Lilly Ledbetter Act, he said: This \nsolves the problem. Well, suddenly, it does not solve the problem \nbecause we want to get that title back out there again where we can \ntalk about the title.\n  Access to college. I am the first person in my family to ever \ngraduate from college. I had the chance to be a university president. I \nbelieve people's lives are affected by the right kind of education \nafter high school. Nobody is opposed to access to college. We ought to \nbe talking about that. But we ought to be talking about that in a way \nthat can produce the right kind of result.\n  When the people of Missouri are saying: You are not getting the work \nof the country done, that is clearly right--just the fundamental things \nthat need to get done, and here we are back in Washington, reminded by \nour friends on the other side that really we are here to just hold \nvotes we have already had. Not a single thing was mentioned in the \npreceding remarks that we have not voted on already and not a single \nthing was mentioned in the preceding remarks that has any chance of \npassing both the House and the Senate and, frankly, has no chance of \nadvancing in either the House or the Senate. But here we take these \ncritical 2 weeks--the government is unfunded, no budget to talk about, \nwith work not being done--to talk about these things.\n  Right now, the joint resolution we are on--with all the critical \nchallenges we have not solved, we are talking about changing the \nConstitution. The only person in the Senate who can decide what bill \ncomes to the floor is the majority leader, and the majority leader has \nbrought a joint resolution to the floor, an amendment to the \nConstitution, an amendment that would take 67 votes in the Senate to \npass, an amendment that has 45 sponsors, all from the other side--not \nvery close to 67. Nobody believes this is going to happen.\n  To amend the Constitution, two-thirds of the Senate has to agree. \nThat will not happen. Two-thirds of the House has to agree. That will \nnot happen. Two-thirds of the States have to approve the amendment. \nThat will not happen. More importantly, it should not happen. We are \ntalking about amending the Constitution of the United States when there \nis no chance of doing it. So the only thing we are surely talking about \nis just trying to score some kind of last-minute election-year points. \nBut if people are paying attention, the points that will be scored will \nbe scored by those defending the Bill of Rights and those defending the \nConstitution.\n  What is being proposed here would have a chilling effect on the First \nAmendment, which says ``Congress shall make no law . . . abridging \n[among other things] the freedom of speech.'' We are thinking, for the \nfirst time ever, we would amend the Bill of Rights? Now, nobody really \nthinks we are going to do that so apparently everybody thinks, as long \nas it is just a show vote, it does not matter. But if you can take \nthese freedoms today and decide they are worth bandying around as a \nshow vote, I suppose you could\n\n[[Page S5482]]\n\ntake them tomorrow and actually think about taking these freedoms away.\n\n  The Constitution would not have become the Constitution of the United \nStates without the promise of the Bill of Rights. The Founders got a \nlot of things right. They did not get everything right. But one of the \nthings they got right was the Bill of Rights. One thing that the States \ndemanded when the Constitution was shown to them was: We can do that, \nbut we are not going to do that unless we are promised that these \nfundamental rights that make us who we are and have the potential to \nmake us more than we are--that these fundamental rights are guaranteed. \nWe have never amended the Bill of Rights. So suddenly 45 Members of the \nSenate--with no enthusiasm for this anywhere else that I can find in \nthe country--45 Members of the Senate have decided that for the first \ntime ever we would amend the Bill of Rights.\n  Now, what does the Bill of Rights give us? It gives us freedom of \nreligion--the first right. There will be another debate, I assume, late \nin the next 2 weeks to once again talk about how important is that \nright of conscience, that the Constitution in the Bill of Rights \nguarantees--the very first freedom it gives us is the freedom to \nbelieve what we believe. In fact, President Jefferson said in the \ndecade after the Constitution was written that of all the rights, that \nis the one we should hold most dear: the freedom to hold our beliefs \nand not let the government decide how you conduct yourself in ways that \nviolate your faith beliefs.\n  But right after that comes--what we are talking about--freedom of \nspeech, the second of all those freedoms. There may be people here not \nat all offended by the fact that we can just bandy that around with no \nchance we are going to change this amendment. It is not like there are \n67 cosponsors of this amendment.\n  I find it offensive we would talk about this as if it is a freedom so \neasily discussed and so easily utilized for political reasons that we \njust bring it up here a few weeks before the election and talk about \nit, even though there is no chance it could possibly be changed at this \npoint and shouldn't be changed in the future.\n  The right of conscience, the freedom of speech, the freedom of press, \nthe right to peaceably assemble, the right to petition the government--\nthose are the five freedoms given in the First Amendment to the \nConstitution, and here we are talking about them as if they are nothing \nmore than political talking points. They are who we are as a nation.\n  The chilling effect this discussion has on the First Amendment is \nconcerning. I suppose part of it is to convince people: You don't want \nto participate in the system because you are going to be criticized if \nyou participate in the system.\n  One of the great rights we have as Americans is the right to \ncriticize those who are participating and, if we do participate, the \nright that others have to criticize us. This is an effort that if it \noccurred would certainly be a great thing for the current occupants of \npublic office because you begin to write the rules in a way that makes \nit harder for those who don't hold public office to challenge those who \ndo. No one likes being criticized, but in our country it is a \nfundamental part of who we are.\n  The Constitution wouldn't have been agreed to without the Bill of \nRights. The Bill of Rights, as I said before, hasn't been changed. The \nfreedom of the press is one of those rights, but it is not the only \none. This amendment would go a long way toward making the press the \nonly way people get their information and news. The press--the media \ngenerally--has a guaranteed right to do what they do, but individuals \nhave a guaranteed right to say what they want to say, to participate as \nthe courts and the Constitution allow in this great debate we call \nAmerica.\n  To see that dealt with in this way--I actually wonder what people \nwould think if they thought this was going to happen. Nobody believes \nthis is going to happen because it is not going to happen. We are \ntaking the people's time. We are taking the time given to us by the \nConstitution and the people to do the people's work, to instead talk \nabout things that shouldn't happen, to talk about things that will not \nhappen.\n  To suggest there is a real debate going on in Washington, when this \nis exactly what people are tired of--people in Washington not doing \ntheir job and trying to convince the people whom Washington should be \nworking for that somehow great debates are going on, when all we are \ndoing is getting ready for the next election, I am tired of that. I \nthink most citizens of our country are tired of it.\n  For those who want to defend the Constitution, count me on their \nside.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/10/senate-section/article/S5482-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5482-S5487]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SCHOOL CERTIFICATION\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on Thursday this country will \ncommemorate the 13th anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks.\n  We learned many lessons from that day. One key lesson was that \nterrorists can and will exploit our immigration system and policies to \nenter and remain in the United States and now and into the future \npotentially harm Americans.\n  The 9/11 attacks were carried out by 19 hijackers, some of whom \nentered on student visas and trained in flight schools in the United \nStates. The 19 individuals applied for 23 visas. They lied on their \napplications. They failed to abide by the terms of their visas. This \nwas a wake-up call that we needed better oversight of our visa \nprograms, especially student visas. But this wasn't our first wake-up \ncall.\n  In 1993 the American people were confronted with the first terrorist \nattack on the World Trade Center. One of the instigators of that attack \nwas on an expired student visa.\n  Since 1993 we have mandated the tracking of foreign students and gave \nschools and universities a responsibility to help us monitor these \nprograms while these students are on U.S. soil. Unfortunately, while \nthis tracking system is up and running today, it is still antiquated \nand the Federal Government remains incapable of ensuring that those \nstudents who enter the country are truly attending our educational \ninstitutions.\n  Today nearly 10,000 schools across the country accept foreign \nstudents, and those schools are responsible for communicating with our \ngovernment about the whereabouts of these students. Enrollment of \nforeign students is increasing.\n  According to the Brookings Institution, the number of foreign \nstudents on F-1 visas in U.S. colleges and universities grew from \n110,000 in 2001 to 524,000 in 2012. Despite this overwhelming increase, \nthe technology and oversight of the student visa program has \ninsufficiently improved.\n  Now, 13 years after 9/11, we have sham schools setting up in strip \nmalls with no real classrooms. We have foreign nationals entering the \nUnited States with the intent to study but then disappear and never \nattend a class. I will give just two examples of sham schools.\n  In 2011, Tri-Valley University reported that they would bring in less \nthan 100 students but actually brought in over 1,500. Tri-Valley \nUniversity officials were caught giving F-1 visas to undercover agents \nposing as foreign nationals who explicitly professed no intention of \never attending classes. Students paid $5,400 per semester in tuition to \nthe school to obtain those student visas until that school was shut \ndown.\n  On May 29 this year, the Micropower Career Institute in New York was \nraided by Federal officials. Its top officials were arrested on student \nvisa fraud. Allegedly, school officials did not report foreign \nnationals when they didn't attend classes, and they falsified those \nstudent records so the school could continue to collect Federal \neducation dollars for those students. But despite the indictment of \nofficials at this so-called school, it still remains open for business.\n\n  The Government Accountability Office reported to Congress in 2012 \nthat sham schools posed a problem. We put a lot of faith in the work of \nthe Government Accountability Office. The GAO said the Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement does not have a process to identify and analyze \nrisks across schools. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has \noverlooked\n\n[[Page S5483]]\n\nmajor indicators of fraud, and they cannot follow trends or predict \nabuse. Two years later the problems continue to exist and the Obama \nadministration just fiddles while the problem burns.\n  ABC News investigated the student visa program and made it public \nlast week. They said 6,000 foreign nationals on student visas have \ndisappeared. An ICE official acknowledged that they had ``blended into \nthe landscape somewhere.'' Yet this number of 6,000 is not the total \nnumber of student visa overstays. This is the number of students that \nthe Immigration and Customs Enforcement is trying to locate. That ought \nto be alarming news that it is only 6,000.\n  It is time to close the loopholes and clamp down on schools that have \na poor track record with regard to foreign students. So this week I am \nintroducing legislation that requires schools to be certified in order \nto bring in foreign students, and it would suspend schools if there are \nnoncompliance issues. My bill would increase penalties for those who \nperpetrate fraud and require background checks and training for school \nofficials. It would also put an immediate end to a flight school's \nparticipation in the foreign student program if they are not FAA \napproved.\n  Finally, it would require the Department of Homeland Security to \ndeploy an upgrade to the existing tracking system. This upgrade can be \npaid for by using fees from student visas and the schools that \nparticipate.\n  What I just said aren't new ideas. These are provisions that were \ntaken from a 2012 bipartisan bill led by the senior Senator from New \nYork. That bill never passed the Senate. When the Gang of 8 wrote their \nmisguided immigration bill, they failed to include these reforms. So I \noffered an amendment during committee consideration of the immigration \nbill last summer and it was included in the bill that passed the \nSenate.\n  The bill I am introducing today is the exact same language. It has \nbeen debated. It was accepted by unanimous consent in the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  I hope my colleagues will seriously consider the bill I am \nintroducing. It is well past time that we close loopholes and be more \nvigilant in the foreign student visa program, especially with the \ngrowing terrorist threat we face.\n\n\n                     Remembering James M. Jeffords\n\n  Madam President, I wish to pay tribute to Senator Jeffords of \nVermont, who passed away last month.\n  Senator Jeffords died this last August while the Senate was in \nrecess. Yesterday, the Senate appropriately adopted a resolution \ncommemorating the former Senator.\n  Senator Jeffords is probably best known for switching parties, from \nbeing a Republican to an Independent and caucusing with the Democrats \nback in 2001. As much as that switch hurt at the time, I always held \nJim in very high regard and I knew him to be a very honorable man.\n  Jim and I were both so-called Watergate babies--two of the very few \nnew Republican House Members who survived the 1974 election after \nNixon's resignation and subsequent pardon. So we joined the House of \nRepresentatives together and became friends then.\n  It wasn't only a tough political environment back then, it was also a \nphysical challenge for us. During that campaign year I had surgery on \nmy leg and was walking on crutches. Jim had been in a car accident and \nhad a neck brace as a result of that accident.\n  An amusing story has been reported about the two of us. I didn't hear \nit myself, but it had been brought up in a report on the funeral. The \namusing story is about the two of us walking down the aisle of the \nHouse to be sworn in as freshmen after that devastating election for \nRepublicans--this Senator on crutches and Jim with his neck brace.\n  Somewhere in the Chamber, a Democratic Member yelled out, ``There's \ntwo more that we almost got!''\n  The two of us laughed for years about that because of course we had \nthe last laugh, serving for many years and being elected to the Senate \nand both becoming chairmen of committees in this body.\n  One of the most honorable things Jim did for me and, I believe, for \nthe country was in regard to the 2001 tax relief bill that was by some \nmeasures the largest tax cut in history. Not many know the history of \nthat bill. I was chairman of the Finance Committee and so was in charge \nof putting the bill together and getting it passed in the Senate. The \nprocess started with a budget resolution with reconciliation \ninstructions to our Finance Committee.\n\n  The Bush administration pressed that year for a $1.6 trillion tax \ncut. Senator Jeffords and others insisted that the number had to be cut \nby $300 billion because they feared the money wouldn't be there in the \nend. Of course, as we now know from history, they ended up being right \non that point a few years later when we sank into years of deficit \nspending, but we needed their votes. I made it clear to President Bush \nand our leadership that if we wanted to get something done and have a \nhistoric tax cut, we had to lower our sights some and still get most of \nwhat we wanted.\n  Unfortunately, I took a lot of criticism from my side for supporting \nSenator Jeffords and others, but I knew where the votes were and where \nthe votes weren't. I remember a bunch of House Members even had a press \nconference saying some not-so-nice things about me and the idea of only \naccepting a $1.3 trillion tax package. But our Senate Republican \nleadership wanted a good result, and they agreed to compromise in order \nto get it. That is not something you see nowadays around here on very \nbig bills. If the majority cannot have their way, they just file \ncloture and let the bill die, which is why we don't get much done \naround here anymore.\n  But the pivotal point on the 2001 tax bill came right before the time \nSenator Jeffords switched political parties. I could never really blame \nJim for his decision. I didn't agree with that decision, but I know he \nfelt he had been mistreated by some in our party and had strong \ndisagreements with some of us on issues.\n  During floor consideration of the tax bill that year, we were near \nthe end, and the Democratic minority at that time was offering \namendment after amendment to stall the bill. We had gotten to the point \nwhere they were just changing a few words in an amendment and offering \nthe same amendment again.\n  At that point I walked over to then-minority whip--who happens to be \nthe current majority leader--Senator Reid and asked what was going on. \nHe said: Well, we think things may be changing around here very soon. \nOf course, I didn't know what he was talking about and I assumed that \nsome votes were going to change. But of course he was talking about the \nimpending party switch that none of us knew anything about involving \nSenator Jeffords. Remember, at that time we were split 50/50. Of \ncourse, what that meant was the Senate leadership would change and \npresumably the new Democratic leadership would pull the tax bill from \nthe floor and kill it. So it was important for the Democrats to stall \nas long as they could on the bill, anticipating the Jeffords switch. \nBut to his great credit, Senator Jeffords came to me and told me that \nout of respect for me and the way I worked with him on this tax bill, \nhe would not officially change parties until after the tax bill was \npassed. So we were able to finish that historic bill and get it signed \ninto law.\n  This little-known episode demonstrates what an honorable man and true \nfriend Jim Jeffords was. He didn't let politics dictate whatever he was \ndetermined to do, and he stood by his word. I only wish we could see \nmore of that now in today's Senate. If we did, we would all certainly \nbe better off, it would be a better place, our policies would be a lot \nbetter, and we would be more productive.\n  I commemorate Senator Jeffords in his death. My sympathies are with \nhis family. I will miss him, and I wish him Godspeed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Thank you, Madam President.\n\n\n                        Facing Great Challenges\n\n  As I come to the floor today, the Senate is debating a plan by which \nWashington Democrats seek to restrict the First Amendment rights of \nAmerican citizens--part of the Constitution. Under this proposal \ncertain people would no longer enjoy the same right to free speech and \nthe same right to express themselves.\n\n[[Page S5484]]\n\n  I believe this amendment is a terrible idea, and it really has no \nchance of becoming law. Majority Leader Reid wants the vote anyway. He \nthinks this outrageous amendment that he dreamed up will somehow help \nDemocrats win elections this November. The majority leader has come to \nthe floor repeatedly to criticize and to demonize American citizens who \ndon't share his views. It is nothing but political grandstanding and \nshowboating.\n  President Obama was on ``Meet the Press'' last Sunday. The President \ntalked about what is going on in Washington. The President said that \n``people want to get stuff done.'' That is what he says the American \npeople want from their representatives in Congress. So if the American \npeople want us to get stuff done, why are the Democrats in the Senate \nso determined to do nothing? Why are they wasting time on political \nshow votes? Why are they not allowing amendments and debate on \nimportant bills? Why are they blocking legislation that has passed the \nHouse of Representatives with bipartisan support and is right now \nsitting on Senator Reid's desk waiting for a vote?\n  Our Nation faces great challenges, and many Americans are hurting. \nRepublicans have solutions that will create jobs while strengthening \nour energy security, improving our health care, and cutting government \nredtape. New numbers came out just last week that show America's labor \nforce participation rate is at about the lowest level it has been in \ndecades. The House of Representatives--where Republicans are in charge \nof the schedule--has passed more than 40 bills to help get Americans \nback to work. Those bills are sitting in the Senate waiting for a vote. \nIs that what the President means when he says people want to get stuff \ndone?\n  There was a headline in Politico on Tuesday morning that read \n``Majority say that President Obama a failure.'' A new poll found that \n52 percent of Americans think the Obama Presidency has been a failure. \nSo what do Washington Democrats do in response? Absolutely nothing.\n  People want Washington to deal with the challenges that matter most \nin their individual lives. We could start by doing something about the \nPresident's health care law that is causing so much harm to people \nacross the country.\n  A bipartisan plan has already passed the House that would stop the \nemployer mandate that businesses provide expensive Washington-mandated \nhealth insurance. That part of the President's health care law forces \nsmall businesses to cut hours--therefore cutting paychecks--for the \nworkers and is also holding back hiring. We should take up that \nlegislation here in the Senate.\n  We should restore people's freedom to buy health insurance that \nactually works for them and their families because people know what \nworks best for them. They don't need Washington to tell them. We should \nreplace the President's health care law with reforms that actually get \npeople the care they need from a doctor they choose at lower costs.\n  The people I talk with back at home in Wyoming are also worried about \nenergy costs--especially since it is starting to get colder in much of \nthe country. Washington should be looking for ways to help Americans \nproduce more affordable, reliable, and efficient energy right here at \nhome. The opportunity is there. That would mean jobs for American \nfamilies, and it would also mean energy security for our Nation.\n  We could start right now by approving the Keystone XL Pipeline. For 6 \nyears the application has been sitting waiting for action. A bill to do \nthat passed the House of Representatives with bipartisan support. Why \naren't we voting on that today in the Senate? The Obama administration \nadmits the pipeline would actually support thousands of good American \njobs. The application to build the Keystone Pipeline has been stalled \nfor 6 years. The administration should demand action today. If the \nPresident won't do it, Congress still could and should.\n  Congress should pass legislation to speed up exports of liquefied \nnatural gas. Our Nation has abundant supplies of natural gas, and \nproducers want to export it to customers around the world who are \nseeking it. The Obama administration has delayed the permits to let \nthem do it. Democrats right here in the Senate have delayed the \nbipartisan solution that has already passed the House. We should take a \nvote on that bill today and pass it.\n  We should pass a bill that would reform the regulations blocking \nenergy production on Federal lands.\n  We should end the Obama administration's pointless and destructive \nwar on coal and let the men and women across this country who work in \nthat industry get their jobs and their lives back.\n  American businesses are waiting to create jobs. The only thing \nstanding in the way is the Senate majority leader. Senate Democrats \ndon't want to vote. They don't want to vote to help the millions of \nAmericans who are out of the labor force. They would rather protect the \nWashington bureaucracy--a bureaucracy that slows down and stifles \neconomic growth.\n\n  Cutting through the redtape to help Americans get back to work is one \nof the top priorities of Republicans, and it should be the top priority \nof every Senator in this body. We could do it by passing a bill--one \nthat has already passed the House--that would rein in excessive \nregulations that make it tougher for small businesses to invest, to \ngrow, and to hire.\n  We could pass another bill from the House that helps businesses \ndefend themselves against abusive patent lawsuits. That is going to \nhelp small businesses hire more people and help them grow. There were \n130 Democrats in the House who voted in favor of it. Why aren't we \nvoting on that today? We cannot get a simple up-or-down vote in the \nSenate. The majority leader will not bring it to the floor. Why won't \nhe allow it?\n  There is one bill after another that Republicans have offered, \nRepublicans have passed in the House of Representatives--bipartisan \nbills--and the Senate Democrats don't want to talk about them. They \ndon't want to talk about Republican ideas for tax reform that would \nlower tax rates and make the whole tax system simpler, more fair. They \ndon't want to talk about Republican ideas to strengthen and stabilize \nthe entitlement programs--such as Social Security and Medicare--to make \nsure they are there for future generations. They certainly don't want \nto talk about Republican ideas to address Washington's out-of-control \ndebt.\n  Those are the kinds of measures we should be talking about today on \nthe floor of the Senate. That is the legislation which Republicans have \nintroduced and which we are going to keep fighting for in the Senate. \nThat is what the American people are talking about when they say they \nwant Washington to get stuff done. They don't mean more terrible ideas \nlike the President's health care law and its multiple damaging side \neffects. They don't mean job-killing redtape and Washington mandates. \nThey don't mean political show votes that would restrict Americans' \nfree speech.\n  President Obama and Democrats in the Senate have turned their backs \non middle-class families who are desperately in need of jobs. Democrats \nwant to waste time while they are trying to salvage their political \ncareers. Republicans want to help get Americans back to work.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Tribute to Priscilla A. Ross\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, one of the joys of being an elected \nmember of Congress is getting to hire and know and work with dedicated \npublic servants who toil behind the scenes--our staffs. One of those \nindividuals is my policy director Priscilla Ross, who first joined my \nstaff over 16 years ago when I was serving in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  I rise this afternoon in a bittersweet moment to thank Priscilla for \nher service to me, the citizens of Maryland, and all Americans on the \noccasion of her departure from the Senate.\n  Starting next week she will be the senior associate director for \nFederal\n\n[[Page S5485]]\n\nrelations at the American Hospital Association, AHA, which is the \nnational organization that represents and serves all types of \nhospitals, health care networks, and their patients and communities. \nThe AHA is comprised of nearly 5,000 hospitals, health care systems, \nnetworks, other care providers, and has over 43,000 individual members.\n  Priscilla Ross is a consummate Senate staffer. She is extremely \nintelligent. She has mastered her subject areas, which include health \ncare and budget. She works hard. She is both a pragmatist and an \noriginal creative thinker. She works well with her colleagues across \nthe aisle and across the Hill. She is a problem solver. She sees the \nbig picture but pays attention to detail.\n  Her political acumen and sense of timing are first rate. She tells me \nwhat I need to know and, more importantly, what I need to hear--even \nwhen I don't want to hear it. Above all, Priscilla has been driven by a \npassion to help people and make things better for Americans, especially \nthe disadvantaged and vulnerable among us. The disparity of health \noutcomes between different communities and racial groups in this \nNation--I know--continues to concern Priscilla, who has made me more \naware of the problem.\n  Members of Congress, especially Senators, depend on their senior \nstaff to sort through the innumerable demands on our time and to help \nus concentrate our time on the most important opportunities and \npriorities. To do that as well as Priscilla has done for 16 years \nrequires not only deep policy expertise but a shrewd understanding of \nthe Senate and a comprehensive familiarity with the people and the \ninstitutions of Maryland. It also demands a willingness to bring a \nseasoned, respectful skepticism to the scores of requests every Senate \noffice receives every week to support this or that legislative \ninitiative and to have the judgment to sort out the strong policy cases \nfrom the powerful interests. In that, Priscilla has excelled. I am \ngrateful for the high standard she has met.\n  Priscilla came to Capitol Hill to improve people's lives. She has \nsucceeded in that regard--far beyond what most of us are able to \naccomplish. She has had an extraordinary career.\n  While I am sad that she is leaving the Senate, I take solace in the \nfact that she is not leaving ``the arena.'' She will continue to find \nways to make health care better, more accessible, and more affordable \nfor all Americans in her new post at the AHA.\n  Priscilla is a proud native of the District of Columbia--born and \nraised in the shadow of the Capitol building, so to speak. She likes to \nreminisce about taking the number 30 bus along Independence Avenue to \nher school at Tenley Circle every day. She said that as a child she \nnever imagined she would some day work in the Capitol building she \npassed on her way to and from school.\n  Fortunately, at some point, she did get that idea and pursued it. \nFortunately for me, I was the one who hired her. Before that happened, \nPriscilla went to Boston University before finishing her college career \nat American University, where she received a B.A. in political science. \nShe held a summer internship in the office of Yvonne Braithwaite in \nCalifornia.\n  She was an outstanding student. She was inducted into Pi Sigma Alpha, \nwhich is a national political science honor society, and the Golden Key \nNational Honor Society. She is also a member of the Zeta Phi Beta \nsorority, a national sorority founded nearly 95 years ago at Howard \nUniversity here in the District.\n  Before Priscilla joined my staff, she was the political affairs \nmanager for the American Association of Health Plans, the trade \nassociation for more than 1,000 managed care plans across the country. \nPriscilla also represented the investor-owned hospital industry as an \nassistant vice president for legislation at the Federation of American \nHealth Systems where she lobbied Congress on issues important to 1,400 \nhospitals and health care systems with a specific focus on Medicaid and \nMedicare reimbursement.\n  In that position she also represented the association in various \nWashington-based health care coalitions, prepared congressional \ntestimony for association members, designed and coordinated the FAHA \ngrassroots program, staffed the legislative steering and PPS-exempt \nhospital committees, and drafted comments to proposed Health Care \nFinancing Administration regulations affecting hospital reimbursement.\n  Priscilla has also worked in health care delivery settings as a new \nmember representative for the Harvard Community Health Plan in Boston, \nas administrative services coordinator at the Psychiatric Institute of \nWashington, a private 201-bed acute-care facility, and as an \ninformation assistant with Blue Cross Blue Shield of the national \ncapital area. She came to me with some experience, and she used that to \nhelp people.\n\n  With regard to Priscilla's accomplishments while working on my staff, \nthe list is so long and comprehensive, I will only be able to comment \non a few items.\n  Priscilla has staffed my efforts to repeal arbitrary and unfair \noutpatient physical, occupational, speech-language therapy caps for \nMedicare beneficiaries since they were enacted in 1997--first in the \nHouse and now in the Senate. Because of Priscilla's efforts we have \nbeen able to prevent the caps from being implemented.\n  With Priscilla's help, the legislation I authored to expand Medicare \nto include preventive benefits, such as colorectal, prostate, \nmammogram, and osteoporosis screening was enacted into law.\n  Thanks to Priscilla's persistence, Congress finally passed the \nPatients' Bill of Rights, which means that individuals with private \nhealth care plans will have the right to choose their primary health \ncare provider, that women will have direct access to obstetrics and \ngynecology services and be able to pick their own providers, and that \npatients with medical emergencies will be guaranteed coverage for \nnecessary emergency room visits in accordance with the ``prudent lay \nperson's standard.'' Because of Priscilla's work, we were able to move \nforward in these areas.\n  Because of the work of Priscilla Ross, tens of thousands of retired \nveterans and their spouses have access to the health care benefits to \nwhich they are entitled, including Medicare Part B, without being \npenalized for signing up too late. So let me explain.\n\n  Under current law, people who do not enroll in Medicare Part B when \nthey are first eligible, to do so must pay a 10-percent penalty for \nevery year they have not participated. But 10 years ago, military \nretirees could not have anticipated the rules changes that have \noccurred in military health systems since 1996 when the Department of \nDefense replaced CHAMPUS with TRICARE, nor could they have known that \nparticipation in TRICARE after 1965 would eventually require Medicare \nenrollment. In some cases, the military advised retirees that Medicare \ncoverage was duplicative, recommending that they do not enroll. We \nfixed that. I would note that a couple from Oklahoma--not Maryland--\nbrought this problem to Priscilla's attention and the result was we \nwere able to get it done.\n  While Priscilla has spent most of her time working on health care, \nshe has aptly demonstrated her ability to get things done on other \nissues. Let me speak for a moment about the fiscal year 2012 \nconsolidated appropriations bill that contained $919 million for the \nSmall Business Administration--$189 million more than previous years. \nThis was the first time in many years that the SBA got a bump-up in \ntheir appropriation. I was on the Budget Committee at the time.\n  The Disaster Loan Program received an increase of $72 million. With \nPriscilla's help, I authored an amendment to the American Recovery and \nReinvestment Act that increased the surety bond limits from $2 million \nto $5 million to help small businesses. Each of these initiatives was \nstarted by Priscilla Ross. She marshaled them carefully through the \ncommittee and through the process, and the end result is they became \nlaw.\n  A moment ago, I mentioned that my and Priscilla's concern is about \nhealth disparities. The United States spends nearly $1 trillion in \nexcess health care costs due to racial and ethnic health disparities. \nPriscilla has taken the lead in fashioning policies to close the gap. \nIt is not just about economics; it is a social justice that strikes at \nthe heart\n\n[[Page S5486]]\n\nof who we are as a nation. At Priscilla's suggestion, I authored \nprovisions that establish in statute Offices of Minority Health in the \nkey agencies in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, \nincluding the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Food and \nDrug Administration, and the Agency for Healthcare Research and \nQuality. Without the basic research needed to discover the causes of \ndisparities and develop new treatments, we will not be able to make \nsignificant progress in closing the gaps, so Priscilla successfully \nadvocated to elevate the National Center for Minority Health and Health \nDisparities to the newest institute at the National Institutes of \nHealth. We now have a National Institute on Minority Health and Health \nDisparities, thanks to Priscilla Ross.\n  In 2007, shortly after I became a Senator, 12-year-old Marylander \nDeamonte Driver died of a toothache just a few miles from this \nbuilding. As the Washington Post recounted:\n\n       A routine, $80 tooth extraction may have saved him. If his \n     mother had been insured. If this family had not lost \n     Medicaid. If Medicaid dentists weren't so hard to find . . . \n     By the time his aching tooth got any attention, the bacteria \n     from the abscess had spread to his brain, doctors said. After \n     two operations and more than six weeks in the hospital, the \n     Prince George's County boy died.\n\n  Priscilla was determined to turn this terrible tragedy into something \npositive. She immediately began working to expand access to health care \nfor all Americans, regardless of their income. Thanks to Priscilla we \nwere able to secure guaranteed dental benefits for children in the \nreauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program, along with \na dental education program for parents of newborns, and a new HHS Web \nsite and toll-free number with information about the State's dental \ncoverage, and a list of participating providers. We were able to secure \nfunding for a mobile dental health care lab dedicated in 2010 that now \ncarries Deamonte's name. To encourage public service activities that \npromote oral health, the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act includes \nthe provision ensuring that activities assisting individuals in \nobtaining dental services can qualify for funding.\n  Each of these accomplishments was initiated by Priscilla Ross.\n  These are just a few of Priscilla's accomplishments. Suffice it to \nsay that young children across America too numerous to count now have \naccess to dental care, thanks to Priscilla Ross, although they will \nnever know her name. Suffice it to say that seniors across America will \nbe saved from premature death by preventive health screenings, thanks \nto Priscilla Ross, although they will never know her name. Because of \nPriscilla, we are closer to a more perfect union, which is the \nbirthright of each and every American, regardless of race, color, \ncreed, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, or economic status.\n  When Thomas Jefferson followed Benjamin Franklin to Paris as Minister \nof America, he remarked that no one could replace Franklin. He, \nJefferson, was merely a successor. I feel the same way about Priscilla: \nThere may be a successor, but no one will be able to replace her.\n  I thank her for her wise counsel, indomitable spirit, outstanding \npublic service, and enduring friendship, and I wish her the best of \nluck in her new career.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Paycheck Fairness Act\n\n  Ms. HIRONO. Madam President, I rise today to support the Paycheck \nFairness Act. Equal pay for equal work is the law of the land. It has \nbeen for over 50 years. Yet the law is one thing and the reality is \nquite another. Women still get paid far less than men for the same \nwork.\n  Last year Hawaii News Now, a TV station in Hawaii, shared the story \nof a woman in Honolulu. She had been asking for a raise for over a \nyear, to no avail. Her employers acknowledged that she was underpaid, \nbut they didn't do anything about it. Then she found out a new male \nhire with less experience would be paid $5,000 more to do the same job.\n\n  She is not alone. In Hawaii a woman makes, on average, 83 cents for \nevery dollar a man makes. While that is better than the national \naverage, it is still not equal pay for equal work.\n  Research shows that the gender gap in pay begins with a woman's first \njob and widens from there. So when a young woman graduates and takes \nher place in the workplace, her starting line is already behind that of \nher male colleagues. That makes it harder for her to catch up, no \nmatter how hard she works.\n  The women I know work incredibly hard. Many of them are heads of \nhouseholds and sole breadwinners, which makes the pay inequality that \nmuch tougher for them.\n  The gender pay gap persists even for workers with the same level of \nexperience and education. The gap is even wider for older women.\n  Congress passed the Equal Pay Act over 50 years ago. As I said \nearlier, this is the law of the land. Yet the pay gap persists. While \nthe gap has shrunk--not by much--women only earn 77 cents on the dollar \nnationally. As Senator Mikulski often says, in 50 years, women have \nonly gained a few cents.\n  In 2009, I was proud to support and vote for the Lilly Ledbetter Act \nwhich President Obama signed into law. It was the very first bill he \nsigned into law after his election. Without this law, women had only \n180 days after their first discriminatory paycheck to challenge it, \neven if they only found out about it years and years later. After all, \nLilly's employer did not announce they were discriminating against her \nin pay. So in her case it took many years, and she was far beyond the \n180 days the Supreme Court said would be the timeframe in which she \ncould try and get redress.\n  While the Lilly Ledbetter Act addressed one part of the equal pay \nproblem, if we are going to make sure all women get a fair shot, we \nneed to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act. This bill would require \nemployers to prove that pay gaps between men and women are based only \non a business reason and not on gender.\n  The Paycheck Fairness Act will make it easier for workers to compare \ntheir salaries and figure out whether they are victims of \ndiscrimination. Right now, without this act, employers can still fire \nworkers for sharing the basic information about how much they are \ngetting paid. This bill strengthens penalties for companies that \ndiscriminate against women. It would bring class action protection for \nwomen in line with other civil rights laws.\n  The bill includes an exemption for small businesses and a phased-in \ntime for businesses to learn what they are required to do.\n  In addition, the Paycheck Fairness Act would help prevent pay \ndiscrimination in the first place by providing training for both \nmanagement and workers. This past April 8 was Equal Pay Day. That is \nthe day when women's earnings in this country caught up with men's \nearnings from the previous year. In other words, it took women 16 \nmonths to catch up with what their male counterparts were making in 12 \nmonths.\n  The very next day, here on the Senate floor, every single Republican \nSenator voted to filibuster the Paycheck Fairness Act, which failed on \na procedural vote. I hope our Republican friends will reconsider their \nposition on this important issue this time around.\n  This year President Obama signed an Executive order to implement \nparts of the Paycheck Fairness Act for Federal contractors. That is a \nmajor step forward for thousands of women. But there are millions more \nwho are not covered by this executive action. Today in the Senate we \nhave another chance to give the women of our country a fair shot, \nanother chance for us to live up to a law that we passed 50 years ago.\n  I urge my colleagues to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act without delay. \nFifty years is long enough to wait.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S5487]]\n\n  Mr. REID.

The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                            Border Security\n\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, Americans across the country have been \nriveted by the crisis occurring on our southern border.\n  President Obama is correct with one regard: What we are seeing is a \nhumanitarian crisis. But it is a crisis, sadly, of the President's own \ncreation, and it is the direct consequence of President Obama's laws. \nTo understand why, one merely has to look at the numbers.\n  Three years ago, in 2011, there were roughly 6,000 unaccompanied \nchildren entering the country illegally. Then in June of 2012, just \nbefore the election, the President unilaterally granted amnesty to some \n800,000 people here illegally who entered as children.\n  As a direct foreseeable consequence of that--the predicted \nconsequence of that is: If you grant amnesty to people who enter as \nchildren, you create an enormous incentive for more and more children \nto enter the country illegally. That is exactly what we have seen \nhappening.\n  As a result of the President's amnesty, we have seen the numbers go \nfrom 6,000 kids 3 years ago to this year, it is expected, when there \nwill be 90,000 unaccompanied children entering the country illegally, \nand next year the Department of Homeland Security predicts it will be \n145,000.\n  I have traveled down to the border of Texas many times. As recently \nas the last couple of months I have been down to McAllen. I visited \nwith the Border Patrol chief in McAllen. I visited with the Border \nPatrol agents and line agents down there. I have been to Lackland Air \nForce Base where there are roughly 1200 children being housed. I am \nsorry to say that President Obama, when he visited Texas, had time to \ndo neither. He had time to go to Democratic Party fundraisers, to pal \naround with the fat cats in the Democratic Party and to raise money but \nno time to travel to the border and see the human suffering his failed \nimmigration policies have produced.\n  It is worth underscoring, these are little boys and little girls who \nare not being brought into this country by well-meaning social workers \nwith beards and Birkenstocks trying to help the kids. They are being \nbrought in by hardened, drug-tough coyotes, cartels. And these little \nboys and little girls are being physically victimized, physically \nabused, sexually abused.\n  When I was at Lackland Air Force Base, a senior official there \ndescribed to me how the cartels, when they have control of these kids \nand are smuggling them illegally into this country, sometimes will hold \nthe kids hostage and try to extract more money from the families. In \norder to do so, horrifyingly, they will sever body parts from these \nkids. This senior official at Lackland described to me how these \ncoyotes will put a gun to the back of the head of the little boy or \nlittle girl and order that child to cut off the fingers or ears of \nanother little boy or little girl, and if they don't do it they will \nshoot that child and move on to the next one. They describe how on this \nend we are getting, No. 1, some children who have been horribly maimed \nby these vicious coyotes and, No. 2, we are getting children who have \nenormous psychological trauma from being forced to participate in such \nhorrors.\n  The crisis at the border cannot be solved without ending the promise \nof amnesty. The data demonstrates that, compellingly, it was when the \nPresident granted amnesty that the numbers spiked, but more recent data \ndemonstrates that as well. A few months ago the Border Patrol conducted \na survey of over 200 people who entered illegally, many of them \nchildren, and asked the obvious question: Why are you coming? What has \nchanged? Just 3 years ago it was only 6,000 kids and now it is 90,000. \nWhat has changed? Ninety-five percent of them told the Border Patrol \nthey were coming because they believe they will get amnesty. They \nbelieved they will get a permiso, a slip of paper that lets them stay \nonce they get there.\n  When I was in McAllen, I took the time not just to meet with the \nchief but to meet with a number of Border Patrol agents who spend every \nday out on the river, up in the air, on horseback, working to secure \nthe borders. I asked the line agents the obvious question: Why are they \ncoming? What has changed? What has caused this humanitarian crisis? \nEvery single Border Patrol agent gave me the exact same answer: They \nsaid they are coming because they believe they will get amnesty.\n  In fact, they explained to me, they said: Right now the Border Patrol \nis not apprehending these kids. When they cross the river, they often \nhave nothing, sometimes just rags on their back after a long, arduous \njourney where they have been subjected to horrible physical and sexual \nabuse, but the one thing they almost inevitably have is their \ndocuments. And these children immediately look for the first person in \nuniform they can find. The Border Patrol isn't apprehending them; they\n\n[[Page S5489]]\n\nare looking for the Border Patrol, because they come to the Border \nPatrol and hand them their documents because they believe they will get \namnesty; they will get a permiso; they will be allowed to stay.\n  If we want to solve this crisis, if we want to stop these children \nfrom coming and from being abused, the only way to do so is to end the \npromise of amnesty.\n  Before the August recess, I introduced legislation in this body to do \nexactly that. It was very simple legislation. It was directed to the \nsource of the problem. It provided in black-and-white law that the \nPresident of the United States prospectively has no authority to grant \namnesty to anyone. The legislation doesn't address the 800,000 who were \nthe subject of the 2012 order. It simply says going forward the \nPresident cannot grant amnesty to anyone else, and the reason for that \nis the cause of this crisis is these children coming believing they \nwill get amnesty.\n  The White House, in their talking points, routinely said that \nchildren coming today are not eligible for amnesty.\n  I see my colleague from Illinois nodding in agreement with that \nstatement. If that is the case, then my colleague from Illinois should \njoin me in sponsoring this measure because the legislation I have \nintroduced would simply put into law what the White House talking point \nis, which is that----\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I will be happy to yield to the Senator for a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Can the Senator tell me what the cutoff date is for \neligibility for DACA?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I don't have the precise cutoff date in my mind, but the \npoint that is being raised is these children don't fall under the \nprecise terms of DACA, but they believe they will get amnesty.\n  I would respond to my friend from Illinois, does my friend from \nIllinois believe these children who are coming today should get \namnesty, yes or no?\n  Mr. DURBIN. No. I would say, if I might, through the Chair, it is not \nthe argument that anyone is making that these children should receive \namnesty. What we are saying is they should be treated humanely----\n  Mr. CRUZ. Absolutely.\n  Mr. DURBIN. And go through an orderly process returning to their \ncountries. But what the Senator from Texas is asking us to do is to \ndisqualify up to 2 million young people who are here in the United \nStates and can qualify for DACA as DREAMers--people who were here long \nbefore these unaccompanied children showed up at the border. That \nwas the proposal that came from the House which the Senator inspired \nthem to vote for. They stood for a standing ovation because they denied \nan opportunity to 2 million young people in this country to be able to \nstay here without fear of deportation. That is what the Senator is \nasking for today.\n\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank my friend from Illinois, but I would note that the \ncomments he made are not connected to the facts of the proposal. The \nproposal is explicitly post-DACA.\n  Some 800,000 people have already received amnesty. Let's be clear. \nThe President had no legal authority to grant amnesty at the time. He \ndid so unilaterally, contrary to the rule of law.\n  Now we are in a broader context where the President has quite \npublicly promised to grant amnesty--again unilaterally and illegally--\nto some 5 or 6 million people. Yet at the behest of our friends on the \nDemocratic side of the aisle, he announced this weekend he is delaying \nthe decision until after the election, because apparently Senate \nDemocrats up for election have noticed their constituents don't support \nthe President in illegally and unilaterally granting amnesty.\n  I would suggest that Members of this body cannot have it both ways.\n  My friend from Illinois stated he doesn't think we should be granting \namnesty to these children, and yet the legislation I introduced, the \nlegislation the House of Representatives passed, does not act \nretroactively, does not address anyone who has fallen within the \nprevious DACA. It simply says going forward the President doesn't have \nthe authority to grant amnesty. Instead it is Congress that has the \nauthority to pass or not pass immigration.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I wish to ask the Senator this question: If amnesty means \nthe person has a right to citizenship or legal status on a permanent \nbasis, is the Senator from Texas suggesting the deferral of deportation \nunder DACA--is that a kind of amnesty?\n  Mr. CRUZ. The deferral of deportation under DACA is a written \ndetermination from the President that the individuals who receive this, \nNo. 1, will be immune from the black-letter text of the immigration law \nthat subjects them to removal; and No. 2, the administration has \ncreated an authorization-to-work document as a component of DACA that \nhas no basis or authority in existing Federal law.\n  Let us be clear. The President has been absolutely explicit. He \nintends to expand that to another 5 or 6 million people who are here \nillegally.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I will yield for a question in a moment.\n  The President intends to expand this to 5 or 6 million people who are \nhere illegally to give them presumably the same authorization to work \nunilaterally and with no authorization in law to transfer their status \nfrom being illegally here to legally here on executive dispensation. I \nunderstand my friend from Illinois and other Members of the Democratic \nParty support that decision. I believe--and I would allow him in his \nquestion to clarify that. If I mischaracterized it, I would welcome his \nclarification. But there certainly are some members of the Democratic \nCaucus who do support that. But the American people powerfully don't, \nprofoundly don't. They recognize it is inconsistent with the rule of \nlaw, is bad policy, and is creating this crisis at the border.\n  I have to say the President's decision to delay the amnesty until \nright after the election reflects a cynicism that even in Washington, \nDC, is unusual. Because what it is saying is: I understand the policies \nthat I, President Obama, am trying to force that are completely \nunpopular with the American people, so I am going to jam them through \nright after the election. Because what it reflects is that President \nObama and unfortunately many of the Senate Democrats hold their \nconstituents in very low regard. It reflects the view that if we do \nthis after the election, even if the people don't like it, they will \nforget about it in 2 years.\n  If my friends in the Democratic Party believe the right policy \nsolution is amnesty for 5 or 6 million more people and the President \nacting unilaterally, then we have a very simple solution. Let's bring \nthis up for a vote before the October recess.\n  The House of Representatives took the legislation I introduced in \nthis body and they stayed over an extra day, they voted on it, and they \nstood up and led, acting to solve the crisis at the border. And what \nhappened in the Senate? The majority leader of the Senate refused to \nallow a vote on the proposal and sent every Senator home for August \nwhile having done nothing to address this crisis.\n  If my friend, the Senator from Illinois, believes amnesty is the \nright policy decision, then let's have a debate, let's bring it up for \na vote, and let's have every Senator in this body go on record.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Most people believe amnesty means a free pass. Whatever you have \ndone, you stay in the United States and you stay in the United States \nand you become a citizen.\n\n  Let me say to the Senator from Texas that DACA is a temporary \nsuspension of deportation. It is temporary. It has to be renewed. And \nin order to qualify for it, you must have been in the United States as \nof June 15, 2007.\n  What we have now are 600,000--my number is 600, you say 800--600,000 \nwho have come forward. They have paid the fee--a substantial fee--and \nthey are allowed to stay here, without being subjected to deportation, \non a temporary basis that needs to be renewed. There are another 2 \nmillion who may be eligible.\n\n[[Page S5490]]\n\n  What the Senator is doing is not addressing the unaccompanied \nchildren at the border. The Senator is saying to the remaining 2 \nmillion: You don't have a chance. You have got to leave. You are \nillegal. You are going to be deported.\n  This isn't about amnesty. It is about whether those who are qualified \nunder the DREAM Act, which incidentally was endorsed by the House \nRepublican Caucus when they put out their statement of principles--\nwhether those under the DREAM Act are going to have a chance to stay.\n  And to think that the Senator's colleagues in the House stood and \napplauded themselves for denying 2 million young people a chance to \nstay in the only country they have ever called home to me doesn't speak \nwell of that caucus or their sensitivity to the reality of their lives.\n  These children who are brought here by their parents--some as \ninfants--didn't vote on it. They were brought here. They have been \nraised in our schools. They have been taken care of in our hospitals. \nThey pledge allegiance to the flag, as Senator Menendez says, every \nday. They pledge allegiance in the classroom to the only country they \nhave ever known. And you are glorying in the possibility that you can \ndeport these children.\n  Is that what you consider to be--and in your own background--I am a \nfirst-generation American. I believe you have similar claims to make. \nDo you believe this is what this country is all about?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I appreciate my friend from Illinois impugning the \nintegrity of our friends in the House and also describing the plight of \ninnocents.\n  As you rightly noted, 67 years ago my father came here. He came from \nCuba and spoke no English. He had $100 sewn into his underwear. He came \nhere legally on a student visa to study. He followed the rule of law. \nAnd I would note--my friend from Illinois knows full well--there is no \nstronger advocate of legal immigration in the Senate than I am. Indeed, \non the Senate Judiciary Committee I introduced two amendments, one for \nhigh-skilled workers, H-1B workers, to increase that fivefold from \n65,000 to 325,000 because temporary, high-skilled workers are \nprogrowth. Every one of those who comes along produces 1.7 American \njobs. I am sorry to say my friend from Illinois and every Senate \nDemocrat on the Judiciary Committee voted against that proposal--voted \nagainst increasing legal immigration for temporary, high-skilled \nworkers.\n\n  My friend from Illinois is also aware--since we are both members of \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee--that I introduced another amendment \nthat would take our current failed legal immigration system and \ndramatically simplify it by reducing the barriers and costs and \neliminate the per-country caps which have the effect of discriminating \nagainst nations such as Mexico, China, and India and take the legal cap \nfrom 675,000 and double it to 1.35 million so we can have a legal \nsystem we can continue that welcomes legal immigrants who come here to \ncelebrate the American dream.\n  Again, I was sorry to see every single Democrat on the Senate \nJudiciary Committee vote against increasing legal immigration, \nstreamlining it, making the system work better, and eliminating the \ndiscriminatory per-country caps on nations such as Mexico, India, and \nChina.\n  I understand the Senator from Illinois just gave a passionate speech \nin defense of granting amnesty to people who are here illegally. He is \ncertainly entitled to those views. We should indeed have a full and \nrobust debate, but I will note that the Democratic Senator from \nArkansas, the Democratic Senator from Louisiana, the Democratic Senator \nfrom North Carolina, and the Democratic Senator from Alaska are all \nbusily telling their constituents they disagree with what my friend \nfrom Illinois just said. They are at home telling their constituents: \nNo, no, no, no. We don't want amnesty. No, no, no, no. We don't want \nthe President to unilaterally grant amnesty.\n  If that is indeed their position, I welcome them to come to the floor \nright now. If that is indeed their position, there is an easy action. \nFor centuries this body has been called the world's greatest \ndeliberative body. Unfortunately, that label is no longer accurately \napplied because this body, sadly, under Majority Leader Reid and the \nDemocratic majority, neither deliberates nor votes on much of anything.\n  There are over 350 bills the House of Representatives has passed to \naddress the great challenges in this country--mostly with substantial \nbipartisan support--and over 350 pieces of legislation are sitting on \nHarry Reid's desk and he will not allow a vote on them.\n  When it comes to solving the crisis at the border, the only way to do \nso is to end the promise of amnesty. The 90,000 children who are coming \nbelieve when they get here they will get amnesty. The position, sadly, \nof President Obama and the majority leader and the Senate Democrats is \nthat they will do nothing--zero--to fix that problem.\n  Let me say it is not compassionate, it is not humane to continue a \nsystem where tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of little boys \nand little girls are being victimized and assaulted physically and \nsexually by violent coyotes. Under the Democratic plan that will \ncontinue. It will continue this year. It will continue next year. In \nresponse, they do nothing--zero, nada--to fix the problem. That is a \nhard-hearted approach to this challenge.\n  We have a demonstration, a study in contrast. Looking at a \nhumanitarian crisis, the House of Representatives stood and voted on \nlegislation to lawfully make it clear that the President of the United \nStates has no authority to grant amnesty to people who are here \nillegally. The Senate had a chance to do the same.\n  President Obama has promised the American people that right after the \nelection he intends to unilaterally and illegally grant amnesty to \nanother 5 or 6 million people. Every Senate Democrat has an opportunity \nto make clear where he or she stands.\n  In a moment I am going to ask for this body to take up the bill the \nHouse has passed to make clear in law that the President has no \nauthority to grant amnesty prospectively. I understand my Democratic \nfriends are going to object to this. That should surprise no one \nbecause my Democratic friends for the last 2 years have objected to \nconsidering almost every major piece of legislation to address the \nchallenges in this country.\n  What this means is that the 55 Democrats in this body who are \nstanding united in blocking this legislation that the House of \nRepresentatives has passed--all 55 Democrats bear responsibility for \nPresident Obama's amnesty, for the amnesty of 5 or 6 million people.\n  I understand the President thinks it is politically clever to delay \nthe amnesty until after the election, but I have real faith in the \nAmerican people, that it is too clever by half, that all 55 Senate \nDemocrats who are standing together, standing united with President \nObama and saying we want the President to have the ability to illegally \ngrant amnesty, every Senate Democrat in this body bears responsibility \nfor that choice. If they did not, any Senate Democrat is welcome to \ncome to the floor. I will note that other than the Democratic Senator \nfrom New Jersey, who is the chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee--and I expect will object to my unanimous consent \nmomentarily--there is not a single Democrat in this Chamber speaking \nout on eliminating the President's authority to grant amnesty.\n  Clarity in elections, enabling the American people to hold all of us \naccountable is a very good thing. One body, the House of \nRepresentatives, is leading. The other body, the Senate, under \nDemocratic control, refuses to even allow a vote on solving the crisis \nat the border or stopping the President's illegal amnesty.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 5272\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of Calendar No. 551, H.R. 5272. I further ask \nconsent that the bill be read a third time and passed and that the \nmotion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I will \nfirst respond to the unanimous consent request made by the Senator from \nTexas, the son of immigrants himself, to prohibit certain actions with \nrespect to\n\n[[Page S5491]]\n\ndeferred action for students in the United States whom we call \nDREAMers. For these young people, as Senator Durbin said, the only flag \nthey have ever pledged allegiance to is that of the United States. The \nonly national anthem they have every sung is the ``Star-Spangled \nBanner.''\n  They came to this country not because they made a decision to do so \nbut because their parents came here, just as Senator Cruz's parents \ncame here. He now ultimately enjoys the benefit of being an American, \neven though it was a different time and under a different set of \ncircumstances. Nonetheless, he didn't have a choice in that decision \nand neither did these children.\n  We have learned and we have often heard in this Chamber that you \nnever subscribe to the child whatever errors exist of the parent, but \nthat is exactly what the Senator from Texas would do.\n  My friend from Texas is entitled to his views and his opinions, but \nhe is not entitled to his own set of facts. The reality is that he \ncontinuously refers to the deferred action on deportation for these \nyoung people as amnesty. Amnesty suggests that someone is forgiven for \nsomething they did wrong and they have a clear pathway to permanent \nresidency and ultimately to U.S. citizenship. That is not what the \nPresident did for these young people who know no other country than the \nUnited States. Any action that would be taken on these young people \nwill be deferred until after Congress has acted on the pressing \nquestion of immigration reform.\n  The Senator from Texas suggested that the Senate has failed in \nleadership. I wish to say to the Senator from Texas that the Senate \nexerted leadership over 1 year ago, when in broad bipartisan votes--\nnotwithstanding the Senator from Texas--a group of eight Senators, four \nRepublicans and four Democrats, joined together and got two-thirds of \nthe Senate to send comprehensive immigration reform to the House of \nRepresentatives. We sent over commonsense immigration reform that was \nthe toughest on border protection that has existed in the history of \nthe country, that was in the national security interests of the United \nStates, that provided for the economic imperative as described by the \nCongressional Budget Office of the opportunities that immigration \nreform would provide for the country by raising the gross domestic \nproduct of the United States, raising the wages of all Americans, and \nreducing the national debt, all by virtue of immigration reform.\n  Two-thirds of the Senate voted on that at a time when it was rare to \nsee two-thirds of the Senate come together on controversial or \nsignificant issues of the day. It was sent to the House of \nRepresentatives over 1 year ago, and they did not once cast a vote on \nthat legislation or their own vision of what immigration reform should \nbe.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I will be happy to do so a little later.\n  At the end of the day, the Senator from Texas argues that this \nmeasure is necessary to deal with the humanitarian crisis at the \nborder. I will say that has gone dramatically in a downward slope.\n  He may argue that immigration policy is driving these children to \nmake a dangerous and deadly journey. While I agree we need a long-term \nsolution to the humanitarian crisis on the southern border, saying that \nthis opportunity for DREAMers to stay in the United States is the cause \nis simply not true.\n  DACA, which is the law we refer to that the President did by \nadministrative order, was announced in June of 2012. The influx of \nunaccompanied minors was reported months before that announcement. As a \nmatter of fact, we can ask Senator Cruz's own Governor, Rick Perry, who \nsent a letter warning about the influx of children months before the \nPresident's DACA announcement.\n  The fact is that all of this talk about ending deferred action for \nchildren who have been here sometimes well over a decade or more \nignores the elephant in the room; that is, that DACA does not cover \nthese children. It only covers children who were brought here before \nthe announcement was made. Eliminating DACA, as the Senator from Texas \nwishes to do, would not make any of these children less likely to come \nhere. These children are fleeing extreme violence in Guatemala, El \nSalvador, and Honduras, which have some of the highest murder rates per \ncapita in the world.\n\n  If I saw my father killed and my sister raped, it is likely I would \nthink about trying to flee that set of circumstances regardless of what \nthe promise might or might not be, and that is in fact what drove this \nhumanitarian crisis.\n  We should solve the roots of the crisis and not try to create some \nconnection to something that has absolutely nothing to do with it.\n  I know we are in the season in which--even if 10 angels came swearing \nfrom above that DACA is not the cause of the unaccompanied minor \ncircumstances or that it is not amnesty, there will be those who will \nsay, no, those angels are wrong. The reality is that one is entitled to \ntheir own views but not their facts.\n  Finally, the undeniable consequence of the Senator's attempt to \ndismantle these deferred actions for DREAMers would serve only to \nfurther separate families. I have listened time and time again to my \nRepublican colleagues say they are the heart of family values. Well, \ntearing apart families is not my sense of a family value. Tearing \nchildren away from their mothers and fathers is not my sense of family \nvalues. Destroying any hope of a better life and a chance at success is \nnot the doctrine of family values.\n  There is a reason the Senate hasn't voted on this bill--and it won't. \nI think the Senate Democratic leadership understands it would be a \ndisservice to our country, a disservice to hundreds of thousands of \nthese young people who we have already invested in through our public \nschools. Now is the time to take advantage of their service, whether in \nthe military of the United States or whether through their intellect. \nSome of them are the valedictorians and salutatorians of our schools \nand colleges and universities. It is an opportunity to ensure they can \nbe productive members of our society, with no guarantee--with no \nguarantee--as it relates to their ultimate status.\n  I hope the immigrant community in this country--I hope the Hispanic \ncommunity in this country, I hope the Asian and Indian communities in \nthis country, I hope the Eastern European community in this country, \nall who are rightly concerned about comprehensive immigration reform--\nare listening to this debate, because as disappointed as some may be \nabout the President saying: Well, we cannot move forward at this time \nuntil we get it right because of the politics that have been generated \nby the undocumented children along the border--as disappointed as some \nmay be with the President--listen to what we will get if, in fact, this \nNovember there is a change of who ultimately has the majority in this \nChamber. This is what we will get: We will get what we got in the House \nof Representatives, which is over a year of not casting one vote for \ntheir own vision of immigration reform. And every vote they have cast \nhas been anti-immigrant at the end of the day.\n  For all of those reasons, I have to object to the unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. CRUZ. The Senator from New Jersey talked about legislation that \nwas debated and voted on a year ago--legislation that I believe, if \npassed into law, would only make the problem worse, would only increase \nillegal immigration, would only exacerbate the problem.\n  I, as do most Americans, want to see commonsense immigration reform, \nbut not reform that fails to secure the border, that grants a pathway \nto citizenship for those here illegally, and that incentivizes further \nand further illegal immigration.\n  But that legislation was a year ago. The President of the United \nStates tells us we have a humanitarian crisis on the border today--\nright now, not a year ago, today--with little boys and little girls \nbeing subjected to physical and sexual violence and being victimized.\n  The question I would ask my friend from New Jersey is: Why is it that \nneither President Obama nor the Senate Democrats have introduced any \nlegislation or allowed a vote on any legislation whatsoever that would \nactually solve the problems?\n\n[[Page S5492]]\n\n  Now, the President did introduce a $3.7 billion social services \nspending bill, less than 5 percent of which went to securing the border \nand none of which went to the underlying amnesty that is causing this \ncrisis. That was a bill designed to deal with the symptoms to care for \nthe kids once they come, but that bill assumed that tens of thousands \nand hundreds of thousands of kids would continue to come, continue to \nbe victimized.\n  So the question I ask of my friend from New Jersey is: Why have the \nDemocrats not allowed a vote on anything to solve the problem and \nprevent these little boys and little girls from being victimized this \nyear and next year and the year after that?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, first of all, I would say to my friend \nfrom Texas that he totally mischaracterizes the comprehensive, \nbipartisan immigration reform that was passed in the Senate. Do we know \nwho voted for that? A whole host of Senators on the Republican side of \nthe aisle who represent border States and who said: This is the most \nsignificant border protection and security effort we have had in a long \ntime. They believed the national security of the United States was \nbetter preserved by virtue of that legislation. Our colleague John \nMcCain worked assiduously on that question, as well as others.\n\n  So the bottom line is, that reform was going to end the process of \nthose coming in an undocumented fashion; it controlled the border, \nmoved the economy, and would bring out of the darkness those who are \nhere to pursue the American dream, which is the only way we can secure \nAmerica, to differentiate from those who might be here to do harm to \nthe United States. I can't know that if people who are in the dark \ndon't come and register with the government, pay their taxes, go for a \ncriminal background check, and earn their way over the course of a \ndecade to the possibility of becoming a permanent resident. That is \nwhat the Senate did.\n  So failure in this regard rests in the House of Representatives--\nfailure on the border, failure on national security, failure on the \neconomy, and failure to reunite millions of people with their families.\n  Now, with reference to the second part of the question, the President \nacted. It is the President who brought the Central American presidents \nhere and said: You have to work with us to stop your young children \nfrom coming to our country and you have to create better conditions in \nyour country, and we want to work with you to do that. We want to work \nwith Mexico to ensure that what they call the Beast--the train of \ndeath--ultimately Mexican authorities interceded to stop immigrants \nfrom getting on that train to the United States. It is the President \nwho ultimately took the resources that existed in the Department of \nHomeland Security and reauthorized them to send them to the border and \ndeal with the challenge. All of that, among other efforts, ultimately \nhas found us with a dramatic reduction.\n  So I understand the politics of this. I appreciate everybody in this \nChamber has the right to pursue that. But the bottom line is the \nPresident acted and the reality is we have dramatically reduced it, and \nthe core challenge here is to have comprehensive immigration reform.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I wish to make two final comments to \nconclude this exchange. My friend from New Jersey admitted that Senate \nDemocrats introduced nothing--zero, nada--to do anything to fix this \nhumanitarian crisis. Indeed, the majority leader dismissed the Senate \nand sent the Senators home for the month of August, perfectly content \nto let the crisis continue, to let tens of thousands and hundreds of \nthousands of children be victimized. He suggested instead the solution \nwas Presidential action, unilateral action.\n  There was a time when the Senate believed we had a responsibility to \nlegislate, to actually pass laws to address challenges. Yet under the \nSenate Democrats, we have a do-nothing Senate. That is why over 350 \nbills passed by the House of Representatives are sitting on Harry \nReid's desk, because this body no longer votes on meaningful \nlegislation to address the challenges facing this country.\n  My friend from New Jersey suggested that the reason the legislation \nthe House of Representatives passed prohibiting the President from \nillegally granting amnesty--the reason it is not going to come up for a \nvote is because he said it is a bad idea. Well, I recognize the Senator \nfrom New Jersey may well think that. Indeed, the Senator from Illinois \nmay well think that. But no one who is paying attention to the Senate \nthinks that is the reason it is not coming up for a vote.\n  If it were objectively a bad idea--if it were a bad idea and the \nDemocrats agreed on that, bringing it up for a vote would be very \nsimple. We would bring it up for a vote. The Democrats have 55 \nDemocrats in this body. They could all vote it down and it would be \ndefeated. If the point were on the merits it is a bad idea, bringing it \nup for a vote would be very straightforward.\n  The reason the majority leader is fighting so hard to prevent a vote \nis that a great many of the Members in his caucus are doing everything \nin their power to convince their constituents back home they don't \nsupport amnesty.\n  As we travel the country, the most frequent thing we hear all \nthroughout the country is that the men and women in Washington aren't \nlistening to us. Something happens. I don't know if it is the water or \nwhat it is, but they get to Washington, they stop listening to us, and \nthey don't tell us the truth. They are lying to us. We hear this from \nRepublicans, from Democrats, Independents, Libertarians, all across \nthis country. There is a reason why the popularity of Congress rivals \nthat of Ebola, because the American people recognize the people in this \nbody aren't telling them the truth. There is one reason and one reason \nonly that Majority Leader Reid does not want to vote on this \nlegislation: because he wants to allow Senators in red States--the \nSenator from Arkansas, the Senator from Louisiana, the Senator from \nNorth Carolina, the Senator from Alaska, even the Senator from \nColorado, even the Senator from New Mexico--he wants to allow them to \ntell their constituents, No, I don't support amnesty. And the reality \nis, of the 55 Members of this Senate who are Democrats, who caucus with \nthe Democratic Party, today it has been conclusively demonstrated that \nall 55 support President Obama's illegal amnesty and are responsible \nfor his promised amnesty of 5 million to 6 million more people right \nafter the election. If that were not the case, we would have seen one \nDemocrat show up and speak out to the contrary. Not a single Democrat \nshowed up.\n\n  There is a reason we don't have a vote, because if we had a vote, it \nwould force Members of this body to be on record.\n  The Senator from New Jersey is entitled to make the case on the \nmerits why he thinks amnesty for 5 million or 6 million or 12 million \nis a good idea. He is entitled to make that case, and if his \nconstituents agree with him, he will keep getting reelected. But far \ntoo many Senate Democrats want to pretend they disagree, and a vote \nmakes that impossible because if we had a vote, we would see all 55 \nSenate democrats vote in favor of amnesty. They are right now hiding \nbehind their leadership because they don't want that vote. They don't \nwant their constituents to understand they support amnesty. So, \ninstead, they shut this body down.\n  The American people are frustrated. They are disgusted with the \nSenate that won't do its job, that won't allow votes, that won't \nconsider legislation to address the problems in this country, and that \nconsistently lies to the voters.\n  I will tell my colleagues on my side of the aisle, I am happy to have \nas many votes as we like. It is interesting. The Senate majority leader \ntoday seems to view as his principal obligation protecting his Members \nfrom hard votes. I wish to point out the concept of a hard vote only \nmakes sense if there is a disconnect between what a Senator says at \nhome and what he or she does in Washington. Votes are hard if we have \nDemocratic Senators who go home to their States and tell their \nconstituents: I am really conservative and I don't agree with that \ncrazy stuff President Obama is doing. Then they come here and vote \nlockstep\n\n[[Page S5493]]\n\nwith the majority leader and the President. Then votes are hard.\n  I will tell my colleagues from my perspective, I don't consider votes \nhard. In 2 years, what I have tried to do in the Senate is very \nsimple--2 things: Do what I said I would do, and tell the truth. The 26 \nmillion Texans I represent, I believe, understood the principles I am \ndefending when they elected me. And whether we have 1 vote or 10 or 100 \nor 1,000, it doesn't surprise the men and women back home, because what \nI say in Texas is exactly the same as what I say on the floor of the \nSenate, and it is the way I have tried to vote since I arrived here. \nThe reason the majority leader has 350-plus bills sitting on his desk \nis because a substantial number of Senate Democrats tell their \nconstituents one thing and vote a different way. This is all predicated \non deception.\n  So I am glad for this exchange because this exchange has shined light \nand made clear to the voters that, No. 1, amnesty is coming and \nPresident Obama intends to grant amnesty to 5 million to 6 million \npeople right after the election; and No. 2, all 55 Senate Democrats \nbear direct responsibility for President Obama's illegal amnesty \nbecause all 55 Senate Democrats are standing in lockstep, preventing \nlegislation that would stop that amnesty. That clarity is good. It \nallows accountability. It allows decisionmaking to be made by we the \npeople.\n  The one thing I would encourage of my Democratic friends is, given \nthat reality, go home and be honest with your constituents. All 55 of \nyou go home and say: Yes, I stand with President Obama. I stand with \nmajority leader Harry Reid in support of amnesty.\n  Those are not the views of the American people, but they are the \nviews of every Democratic Senator in this body. We have a natural check \nwhen elected officials ignore the views and values of the people for \nwhom we work in the place where sovereignty resides in our system: We \nthe people.\n  I yield the floor, and I would suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Walsh). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Women's Health Care\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I have come to the floor today to talk \nabout an important piece of the Democrats' ``fair shot'' agenda: \nensuring that women across America have access to the basic and often \nlifesaving health care benefits guaranteed under the Affordable Care \nAct.\n  Just a few months ago five men on the Supreme Court decided that \nthere should be a group of woman across America who are required to ask \ntheir bosses for permission to access basic health care and that a \ncorporation should have more rights then the women it employs. Just a \nfew months ago those five men rolled back the clock on millions of \nwomen across America.\n  As the ink was still drying on Justice Alito's misguided opinion in \nthe Hobby Lobby case, I made an unwavering commitment to do everything \nI could to protect women's access to health care since the five male \nJustices on the Supreme Court decided they would not. That is why I \nworked with my partner, the senior Senator from Colorado, to introduce \nthe Not My Boss's Business Act to restore those lost benefits and \nprotect women's health care. I am proud that in the months since we \nhave received strong support from men and women across the country.\n  Our straightforward and simple legislation would ensure that no CEO \nor corporation can come between you and your guaranteed access to \nhealth care, period. This should not be a controversial issue. In fact, \nnearly 7 in 10 people say health plans should cover birth control. The \nonly controversy about birth control today is the fact that it is 2014 \nand we are still fighting for this basic health care that is used by 99 \nperson of sexually active women in this country.\n  Despite the resounding outrage we have heard from women and men \nacross America, Senate Republicans stood with this misguided Supreme \nCourt decision and blocked our efforts to right this wrong. If our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle thought their obstruction of \nthe Not My Boss's Business Act in July would end this conversation, \nthey were dead wrong. Since then, millions of Americans have taken \naction. They have voiced their outrage on social media. They have \norganized action in their communities. They will continue to speak out \nuntil our Congress in turn takes action.\n  Unfortunately, it appears this message has fallen on deaf ears among \nsome Senate Republicans. It has become increasingly clear on that side \nthat some of the Members have decided to put the tea party ahead of \nwomen and have no intention of even allowing a debate on the Not My \nBoss's Business Act in the near future. I am extremely disappointed by \nthat. I would have hoped our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nwould have maybe--just maybe--spent a little time at home in August \nlistening to women in their States. If they had, they would have heard \nthe women across America asking Congress to fix this horrible decision \nthat resulted from Hobby Lobby.\n  By the way, it is not just women who want Congress to act. People \nacross the country understand that if bosses can deny birth control, \nthey can deny vaccines or HIV treatments or other basic health care \nservices for employees and their covered dependents. I think what men \nacross America understand is that it is not just the female employees \nat businesses who are affected, it is their wives and their daughters \nas well who share that health care plan.\n  The data is clear. Ensuring access to contraception coverage is not \njust the right thing to do, it is also a critical part of making sure \nwomen and their families have a fair shot in the 21st century. Women \nand their family members should not be held back by outdated policies \nand unfair practices. As I said yesterday on the Senate floor, it is \nnot just about access to contraception, it includes pay equity, access \nto childcare, a higher minimum wage, and it absolutely includes the \nright to make their own medical and religious decisions without being \ndictated or limited by their employer.\n  The bottom line is this: Women use birth control for a host of \nreasons, none of which should require a permission slip from their \nboss.\n  Unfortunately, Americans are most likely not surprised at what they \nare seeing. This obstruction is coming from Members of the same party \nthat has been threatening to subject women to invasive and degrading \nultrasounds; the same party that had candidates making outrageous \nstatements, as we all remember, about legitimate rape and then \ndefending those comments during their disastrous book tour; the exact \nsame party that on Capitol Hill, in State houses across America, and in \ncourtrooms at all levels is actively attempting to block \nwomen's ability to make their own decisions about their own health. \nThey have shown they will go to just about any length to limit access \nto care.\n\n  Just in the past few weeks we have seen last-ditch efforts from \nRepublicans to distract from their embarrassing record on women's \nhealth by claiming to support ``cheaper and easier access to \ncontraception'' by simply making it over the counter. Well, the reality \nis that these proposals would actually cost women more by forcing them \nto pay out of pocket for the birth control they are getting now at no \ncost thanks to the Affordable Care Act. This is a basic piece of \nwomen's health care. It should not be available only to those who can \nafford it.\n  The American people are not fooled. In fact, just yesterday \nPolitiFact rated one Republican birth control claim as ``Mostly False'' \ngiven that it was ``lacking in concrete detail.''\n  Time and again Republican leadership has put politics between women \nand their health care. Now, with their continued obstruction, they have \nput employers between women and their access to free or low-cost basic \nhealth care under the Affordable Care Act. They have shown us they are \nnot focused on what is best for women; they are focused on political \ncalculations, appeasing the far right, and their continued efforts to \ndo whatever it takes\n\n[[Page S5494]]\n\nto pitch their extreme agenda even when it burdens working women and \ntheir families.\n  Despite this disappointing turn of events, I stand here today to say \nthe deck is stacked against them because millions of women who benefit \nfrom this basic and often lifesaving health care will not be silenced. \nThey are still watching.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, how much time am I allocated?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has up to 1 hour postcloture.\n  Mr. CORKER. Well I assure you that will not be the case. I will speak \nfor possibly 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n\n\n                                  ISIS\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, tonight the President is going to address \nan issue on which I know almost every American has been focused; that \nis, the rise of ISIS in Iraq and Syria and the beginning of that in \nmany other places around the world. This is obviously a big speech. It \nis one that I know all of us will be paying attention to and watching.\n  I am hopeful that what the President will do tonight is, first of \nall, explain to the American people from his perspective what our \nnational interest is in ISIS. I think that should be very easy to do. I \nalso hope that what he will do is lay out a general strategy. \nObviously, in a speech such as this you never want to give every detail \nof what it is you want to do, but I hope he lays out the objectives he \nwishes to accomplish as he talks to the Nation and really the world \nabout how he plans to deal with ISIS.\n  So I wanted to say at the onset that I look forward to listening. I \nhope this is a speech that is meaty. I hope it is a speech that speaks \nto the essence of why we as a nation need to deal with the threat ISIS \nposes not only in the Middle East but, over time, in the West, with us \nbeing the greatest symbol.\n  I know there have been many conversations with the administration \nabout ISIS. I know that obviously their concern about ISIS has risen \nover time. Again, I look forward to very clearly listening to the \nspeech.\n  Most of us here in the Senate, if we were in the White House, might \nchoose to guard the authorities we have. Many Presidents have said--\nmost Presidents have said they themselves have the authority to conduct \noperations of this nature. While that is debatable, that is not a topic \nI wish to debate. I know the President has said he has the ability to \ngo about these actions, to take these actions without any additional \nauthority from Congress. What they have said is they plan to not come \nto Congress. I think that is absolutely preposterous.\n\n  If you think back in history, back in 1991 President Bush 41, in \ngetting ready to undertake the activities in Desert Storm, felt as \nthough he had the authority to move ahead with those activities. Yet \nthey realized within the administration that the best thing they could \ndo was to get the American people behind what they were doing, and the \nbest way to do that was to seek an authorization from Congress, to have \nthat debate, to have Members of the Senate be able to ask questions \nabout how this operation was going to take place, to get people \ncomfortable with what the objectives were going to be, and to finally \nwin over the Senate. As a matter of fact, as I understand it, Sam Nunn, \nthe chairman of the Armed Services Committee at the time, was opposed \nto this effort. Yet, with Bush 41 coming up with his Cabinet members to \ntalk to Members of Congress, they were able to pass it over the \nobjection of the chairman of the Armed Services Committee. But what \nthat meant was there had to be interaction, there had to be questions \nand answers, and there had to be a feeling by Members of this body that \nwhat was getting ready to happen was something that was going to make a \ndifference. So they came and did that. They were successful, and the \noperation itself was successful.\n  President Bush 43 did the same. In 2001, after what happened with the \nTwin Towers and other activities around 9/11, the country was outraged. \nHe actually sent forth his own AUFM, the Authorization for Use of \nMilitary Force. Action was taken. It was 60 words, it was broad, but \naction was taken. The same thing occurred in 2002, which led us to what \nhappened in Iraq. So President Bush 43 did those same things even \nthough he felt as if he himself had the authority to take on those \nactivities without Congress approving them. But they felt it was much \nbetter for the American people to see what was going to happen and for \nCongress to be fully informed, to understand what the objectives were, \nand then to have Congress authorize it.\n  This President, President Obama, came before us last year--almost 1 \nyear ago exactly--and asked for an authorization on Syria.\n  I find it truly preposterous and hugely lacking in judgment that this \nPresident is discussing--and hopefully he will change his mind in the \nnext few days--undertaking activities in Iraq. Remember, the President \ndeclared that in 2011 the war in Iraq was over, that we had won, that \nit was a stable country. Yet this new enemy--I do not want to get into \nthe past too much, but because of policies of this administration in \nboth Iraq and Syria, things have changed. So now we have a new enemy--\nISIS--that has arisen. They are incredibly well funded, well equipped, \nwell energized, and savvy to social media.\n  We have seen the detestable things that this group is doing to people \nof all kinds of ethnic persuasions in Iraq. We understand the threat \nthis is to Iraq and to the Middle East.\n  What we also know is this is something that is affecting directly \ntoday not only Iraq but Syria. There is really no border there. It is \nporous.\n  We actually know the ISIS headquarters are in Syria. So this is an \noperation that can in no way be confined just to Iraq. We have to deal \nwith this in Syria.\n  The President hopefully tonight--while laying out what our national \ninterest is, while laying out what his general strategy is, while \nlaying out what his objective is--certainly will talk about the fact \nthat we have to deal with this in Syria.\n  I will say to the Presiding Officer of the Senate that it seems to \nme, even if the President feels that he has the authority to do this \nwith his own constitutional powers under article 2--even if he feels \nthat--it is totally preposterous that he would not seek our \nauthorization to take on a different enemy. Certainly, to take this \ninto another country that we have not been involved with in this way in \nthe past--Syria--to take on operations in that country with a different \nenemy and not come to Congress, to not seek the approval of the people \nwhom the people of this country have elected to weigh in on these \nmatters to me, again, is tremendously lacking in judgment.\n  One of the benefits of the President coming to seek our approval is \nthat he has stated over the weekend that he believes this could take 3 \nyears. Let me say this one more time. This is a conflict that he \nbelieves could take 3 years in duration and take us into another \ncountry where we are now not involved in this matter anyway. He is \ntalking about not coming to us.\n  Again, bad things happen in conflict. Our Presiding Officer has a \ndistinguished career in serving our country--and I honor that--a \ndistinguished public service in the military, and he knows that things \ndon't always go the way we intend.\n  For the President to undertake something of 3 years in duration--by \nhis own words, in another country and an enemy that is one of the most \nwell-funded terrorist operations that we have dealt with, knowing that \nhe has to pull together a coalition of people with very different \ninterests but with like interests relative to this particularly \ndetestable group of folks--to think that this President would undertake \nthat without Congress being behind him and having 535 Monday morning \nquarterbacks because there was never any buy-in by Congress to me is \nfoolish.\n  But because of what happened 1 year ago where our allies in the \nregion who were going to help us deal with Assad were waiting by the \ntelephone to respond because they, with us, were going to conduct \nactivities against Assad about 1 year ago today--they watched on CNN as \nthe President had changed his mind without even notifying them, without \nnotifying their leaders or their armed services--there is a credibility \nissue.\n\n[[Page S5495]]\n\n  The President has talked about building a coalition, and he says that \nthere are 12 countries that are already interested.\n  I would say to him that coming to Congress would show that there is \ndurability, that he has sought our support, that he has answered our \nquestions, that his Cabinet members have laid out their plan, both in \npublic and in private--talking about details that have no business in \nthe public sphere--and that he has the buy-in of the Congress.\n  I would say to the other members of the coalition, the people in the \nregion who question our durability, question, candidly--I hate to say \nit--his credibility. They would say that after he had done this that \nthey believe this Nation is unified in dealing with this issue.\n  I just want to say again I hope the President is good tonight. I hope \nhe delivers to the American people why this is in our national \ninterest. I hope he lays out a strategy that makes sense. I hope he \ndeals with the objectives that he wants to come forth with.\n  Importantly, to me, I understand how we are going to deal with the \nground in Iraq. I understand we have an Iraqi military--as weak as they \nare--that we can build off of. I understand that we have the \nPeshmerga--the Kurds--who we can build off of in support.\n  What I don't understand in Syria, especially since year after year we \nhave done nothing to support the moderate opposition like we have said \nwe would do--or very little--let me not say nothing, but really very \nlittle. Since we have nothing of substance on the ground in Syria, how \nare we going to deal with that?\n  Our Presiding Officer knows more about military officers than I do by \nfar. But how do we deal with a country with nothing on the ground. I \nwant him to explain that. But I think all of us would like to \nunderstand that.\n  But, again, I think if he were to come to the Senate to seek our \nsupport overtly and to explain to the Presiding Officer, myself, and \nmany others in this body how he has a strategy that could be effective, \nI believe that he would receive overwhelming support, and I believe he \nwould have the durability necessary to deal with an enemy of this sort.\n  I do hope, again, the President is on target tonight. I hope the \nPresident will seek our authorization for the use of military force--\nnow.\n  I hear people say: Well, gosh, Corker, it is right before an \nelection.\n  So our President is going to talk to the Nation about what we are \ngoing to be doing with this enemy in Iraq, in Syria--candidly--and in \nother places. Because there is an election coming up, maybe he is not \ngoing to--I don't know that this is his reason, but I know there are a \nlot of people in Congress who say they don't want to deal with it \nbefore the election.\n  Are you kidding me--the most significant decision that is made; that \nis, sending men and women in harm's way--because it is 2 months before \nan election. If there are people in this body who don't want to be put \nto the task by the President of asking for an amount, whether it is 2 \nhours, 2 days, 2 weeks, 2 months or 2 years before an election. Someone \nshouldn't serve in the Senate if they don't want to take up these \nissues and deal with them.\n  I hope the President will change his mind. I hope the President will \ncome to the Senate and seek our input and say that he wants an \nauthorization and send us that authorization.\n  That is what he did with Syria. Let's look at it. Let's deal with his \nCabinet Members, both in public and private. Let's deal with him. Let \nus see his commitment. Let's understand the coalition that is being put \nforth and let's deal with this in the manner that people in the Senate \nshould deal with it, but it should come only after the President seeks \nthat authorization. That is an important thing for him to do. I hope he \nwill do it tomorrow after giving his speech.\n  I stand by ready to work with him in that regard, and I close with \nthose comments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                        Constitutional Amendment\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, later this week, one of the most \nimportant Senate votes in the modern history of this country will take \nplace, and that vote will be about whether the Senate begins the \nprocess to move forward on a constitutional amendment which overturns \nthe disastrous 5-to-4 Supreme Court decision on Citizens United.\n  What the Citizens United Supreme Court decision was about 4 years ago \nis to say to the billionaires in this country, to say to the largest \ncorporations in this country: OK, you already own much of the economy \nof the United States of America, but now by a 5-to-4 Supreme Court \ndecision we are going to allow the billionaires and the large \ncorporations of this country to own the U.S. Government because they \nwill now be allowed to spend unlimited sums of money on political \ncampaigns.\n  Poll after poll tells us that whether you are a progressive, as I am, \na moderate, or a conservative, all over this country people are \nprofoundly disgusted by the ability of big money to buy elections. What \ndemocracy means, what people fought and died for is the right of you, \nher, and him to have one vote.\n  What democracy is not about is allowing the Koch brothers--a family \nworth $80 billion, the second wealthiest family in this country--to \nspend hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars to elect candidates \nwhose job it is to make the wealthiest people in this country even \nwealthier while they continue to attack the needs of the middle class \nand working families of this country.\n  There was a piece the other day in the Washington Post talking about \nhow the Koch brothers alone--just one family--has already in this \nelection cycle put 44,000 ads on television and radio, and we have 2 \nmonths left before this election.\n  Does anybody believe that is what democracy is about?\n  In this country today we are suffering a major economic crisis. What \nthat crisis is about is the disappearance of the middle class, the fact \nthat since 1999 the typical middle-class family has seen its income go \ndown by more than $5,000 after adjusting for inflation. The crisis is \nthat all over America, working people are not working 40 hours a week, \nthey are working 50, 60 hours a week. They are not working at one job--\nthey are working at two jobs, they are working at three jobs, trying to \ncobble together an income and maybe some health care to take care of \ntheir family.\n  The crisis in America today is that unemployment is not the official \nrate of 6.1 percent, it is the real rate of 12 percent if we include \nthose people who have given up looking for work and are working part-\ntime.\n  The crisis is that youth unemployment today is 20 percent; African-\nAmerican youth unemployment is 35 percent. The American people are \ncalling out. They are saying to the Congress: Why doesn't Congress \ncreate the millions of jobs our people need. Why don't you rebuild our \ncrumbling infrastructure. Why don't you transform our energy system so \nwe can address the crisis of climate change and move away from fossil \nfuel to energy efficiency, wind, solar, geothermal, biomass, and create \nhuge numbers of jobs. Why don't you rebuild our crumbling bridges, \nroads, water systems, and wastewater plants. Why don't you raise the \nminimum wage to a living wage.\n  That is what people tell me in Vermont and that is what people are \nsaying all over this country.\n  People ask that today, despite the modest gains of the Affordable \nCare Act, how does it happen that the United States is the only major \ncountry on Earth that doesn't guarantee health care to all people as a \nright?\n  We have 40 million people uninsured, even more paying large \ncopayments and premiums.\n  Why don't we join the rest of the world and guarantee health care to \nall of our people?\n  The answer is very simple. The answer is that Members elected to the \nHouse and the Senate increasingly are dependent upon big money campaign \ncontributions in order to win their seats. That is not what democracy \nis about; that is what oligarchy is about. Oligarchy is when you have a \nnation owned and controlled by a handful of wealthy families. That is \nwhere we are moving today.\n\n  On issue after issue, the American people are very clear about where \nthey\n\n[[Page S5496]]\n\nwant to be going. On this issue of Citizens United, the American people \nare very clear that we need real campaign finance reform to prevent \nbillionaires from buying elections. That is what the American people \nwant. That is what they say in poll after poll. Yet it remains to be \nseen whether, in a few days when we vote on this issue, we will get one \nRepublican vote. And I can understand that because the Republicans \ntoday are the beneficiaries in a very big-time way of all of this \nbillionaire money.\n  A couple months ago a constituent of mine in Vermont made a very \ninteresting suggestion. He said: Bernie, do you ever see these guys in \nNASCAR, the racing car drivers, and they wear their jackets, and their \njackets have all of the sponsors on them? They are sponsored by \nGoodyear Tire Company, and they are sponsored by this oil company, and \nthey are sponsored by this brake company. Maybe we should have the \nMembers of the U.S. Senate wear jackets which tell us who is sponsoring \nthem. So somebody can come forward in their nice blue blazer and say: \nHey, I am owned and sponsored by the Koch brothers. Somebody else can \ncome forward and say: No, I am not owned by the Koch brothers, I am \nowned by the oil industry or I am owned by Big Energy or I am owned by \nWall Street. It would be very instructive, when you see people get up \nand vote, about why they do not want to raise the minimum wage, to find \nout they are controlled by significant contributions coming from large \ncorporations.\n  I think it would be very interesting to see Members of the Congress \nwear those types of coats.\n  The men and women of our country know there is something profoundly \nwrong when 95 percent of all new income generated in this country goes \nto the top 1 percent. They know there is something profoundly wrong \nwhen one out of four profitable corporations pays nothing in Federal \ntaxes in any given year. Yet the reason we are unable to come up with \nreal tax reform--so we can find the money to help our kids go to \ncollege, so we can deal with the fact that we have the highest rate of \nchildhood poverty in the industrialized world--has everything to do \nwith large corporations not paying their fair share, and that has \neverything to do with the types of campaign contributions these \ninstitutions make.\n  There was a poll that came out just the other day. They asked the \nAmerican people: Should we cut Social Security? Do you know what the \nAmerican people say, whether they are progressives, moderates, or \nconservatives? They say: You have to be nuts. We can't make it on \nSocial Security benefits today, and you want to cut Social Security? \nYou want to cut Medicare? But that is exactly what the Business \nRoundtable from corporate America wants us to do.\n  So we are living in two separate worlds. On the one hand you have an \nagenda here in the House and among many of my Republican colleagues \nthat says: What we need to do is give huge tax breaks to the wealthiest \npeople and the largest corporations. Is that what the American people \nwant? Overwhelmingly, they do not want that.\n  You have an agenda among many who say: We have to cut Social \nSecurity, Medicare, and Medicaid. Is that what the American people \nwant? No, they do not.\n  There is an agenda among some Republicans that says: Not only should \nwe not raise the minimum wage, we should do away with the concept of \nthe minimum wage so that in high-unemployment areas people could work \nfor $4 or $5 an hour. Is that what the American people want? Quite the \ncontrary. They want to raise the minimum wage to at least $10.10 an \nhour.\n\n  So you have an amazing dynamic right now in American society. On the \none hand in the real world outside of the beltway, ordinary people are \nhurting. They are struggling. They are worried about their kids. They \nare worried about their grandchildren. They are worried about their \nparents. They want the U.S. Government to do something to create jobs, \nto raise the minimum wage, to change our disastrous trade policies. \nThey want us to do something to make college affordable, to lower \ninterest rates on student debt. They want us to create jobs by \nrebuilding the infrastructure. They want everybody in this country to \nhave health care as a right. They want us to address the crisis of \nglobal warming. But we do not do that. Why not? Because increasingly \nthe Congress is not responsive to the needs of ordinary Americans. They \nare responsive to the big-money campaign contributors, and that has \neverything to do with this constitutional amendment beginning the \nprocess to overturn Citizens United.\n  So of all of the issues out there--whether you are concerned about \neducation, health care, the environment, the economy--the most \nimportant issue underlying all of those issues is the need to end this \ndisastrous Supreme Court decision which allows billionaires to buy \nelections. That is not what people fought and died for in the name of \ndemocracy. That is called oligarchy. Abraham Lincoln talked about a \ngovernment of the people, by the people, and for the people, not a \ngovernment of the billionaires, by the billionaires, and for the \nbillionaires, and that is where we are today.\n  I hope the American people are watching. The media has not paid, for \ninteresting reasons, a lot of attention to this issue, but there is no \ndomestic issue that I can think of more important for the future of \nthis country.\n  Do we elect Members of Congress who are beholden to the constituents \nback home, to the middle class, to working families, or do we elect \nMembers of Congress who are beholden to corporate America and the \nbillionaire class? Do we fight to sustain the democratic foundation of \nthis country or do we move toward an oligarchic form of society \ncontrolled by a handful of billionaire families? That is the issue. \nThat is what this debate is all about, and that is what this vote in a \nfew days will be about. I hope very much the American people will \ndemand that every Member of this Senate vote for this piece of \nlegislation which begins the process of overturning this disastrous \nCitizens United Supreme Court decision.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I would like to follow up on the Presiding \nOfficer's comments a moment ago about the crux of this issue--why this \nbig money in campaigns is so bad for our country.\n  The public does not really care who has an advantage, who has a \ndisadvantage. They do not really care if a Republican wins or a \nDemocrat wins. They care about what we do here and how we can help \npeople's lives.\n  The Presiding Officer talked about the minimum wage. In my first year \nin the Senate, 2007--my first speech on the Senate floor, four or five \ndesks over from here, was about the minimum wage. It passed the Senate \nwith a bipartisan vote. It was signed by a Republican President, \nincreasing the minimum wage. That was then. Today we cannot even get a \nminimum wage out of the Senate because of a Republican filibuster.\n  The minimum wage is worth one-third less in real dollars, in \npurchasing power, than it was in 1968. The subminimum wage--the tipped \nwage--has been stuck at $2.13 an hour for 20 years. People who push \nwheelchairs at airports, valets, and waiters in downtown diners can \nmake as little as $2 or $3 an hour, and they hope to get up to $7 or $8 \nor $9 on tips.\n  If it were not for the political pressure, the money that just rolls \nacross the political landscape, that washes across the candidates for \nthe Senate, the candidates for the House, we could pass the minimum \nwage. But Members of the Senate, when they think about voting on this, \nthey think about the big money that might come in against them if they \nvote for the minimum wage.\n  I am convinced that if we could pass this constitutional amendment, \nwe could begin to address the issues of Wall Street and oil companies \nand Big Tobacco buying elections, spending not millions, not even tens \nof millions, but hundreds of millions of dollars. We could pass the \nminimum wage. We\n\n[[Page S5497]]\n\ncould pass a real jobs bill. We could reform Wall Street. We could pass \nconsumer protection bills. We could invest in education and community \ncolleges and federally qualified health centers and veterans' benefits \nthe way we should. That is why this constitutional amendment is so \nimportant on campaign spending. That is why it matters.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as we all know, we are discussing a \nconstitutional amendment sponsored by 45 members of the Democratic \nParty to restrict free speech.\n  This constitutional amendment pending before the Senate is a real \nthreat to one of the two most vital developments in our Nation's legal \nand constitutional history.\n  One of those legal successes was the development of a body of civil \nrights laws to protect the basic freedoms of all Americans. That took a \nlong time and required massive effort and even bloodshed as well as \njudicial rulings. The second development was the enhancement of free \nspeech as protected by the First Amendment. That process also required \nmassive time and effort and judicial rulings.\n  Both of these struggles were made necessary because the Supreme Court \nfailed to give effort to the intent of the authors of the First and \n14th Amendments in guaranteeing liberty and equality. It took President \nJefferson assuming office--not the courts interpreting the First \nAmendment--to address the criminalization of free speech under the \nAlien and Sedition Acts.\n  When Congress in the 1830s and 1840s denied the right to petition for \nredress of grievances to those who opposed slavery, it took John Quincy \nAdams and Congress--not a court relying on the First Amendment--to \nchange those rules.\n  The reality is the First Amendment had a very limited scope until \nwell into the 20th century. After a judicial sea change, the courts now \ngive broad protection to free speech.\n  Political speech is now constitutionally protected unless the \ngovernment has a compelling interest, and the restriction is narrowly \ntailored to further that compelling interest. Those free speech battles \ntook many years to win. If the arguments that proponents of this \nconstitutional amendment are making were adopted, we would be turning \nthe clock back on 100 years of progress of protecting free speech. The \nconstitutional amendment before us is a content-based restriction on \nfree speech.\n  Speech influencing campaigns for elective office would be restricted. \nNo other speech content, however, would be restricted. Some of that \nspeech by corporations and other entities could be prohibited entirely, \nand those who engage in such speech could be criminally prosecuted.\n  The Supreme Court has allowed content-based restrictions on speech in \nonly a very few cases, such as obscenity, defamation, child \npornography, and threats.\n  The proposed constitutional amendment would restrict the most \nimportant speech the First Amendment protects--and that happens to be \ncore political speech. It would treat that speech as if it were like \nchild pornography.\n  In the Judiciary Committee, one Democrat actually compared core \npolitical speech to child pornography. It is incredible that would be \nsaid. Comparing the core political speech the Bill of Rights protects \nto the video recording of an unspeakable crime against a child doesn't \nmake any sense.\n  That same Senator and the sponsor of the amendment on the floor both \nargued that campaign-related speech can be restricted because free \nspeech doesn't include the right to falsely shout fire in a crowded \ntheater. This is the argument that would reduce free speech protection \nin this country to the minimal level that it enjoyed 100 years ago, \nbefore there was expansion of protection under the First Amendment.\n  When Justice Holmes made that famous fire statement in that case, the \nSupreme Court wasn't being asked to rule on the legality of a \nconviction of someone who had falsely yelled fire in a crowded theater. \nRather, the case involved a man who was convicted of distributing \nleaflets urging young men not to comply with the draft laws during \nWorld War I.\n  Justice Holmes compared that peaceful protest to a shout that would \nimmediately lead to serious bodily injury and perhaps loss of life for \nlarger numbers of people. That is obviously a false analogy.\n  Those who speak in support or opposition to candidates are comparable \nthen to those who pass out leaflets in opposition to government policy. \nIt is obviously false analogy to compare that speech designed to \npersuade fellow citizens in their voting to falsely yelling fire in a \ncrowded theater.\n  It is easy for the government to determine whether a cry of fire is \ntrue or false, but a campaign ad isn't often clearly false. Even a \nfalse ad doesn't create the risk of death. When a government prosecutes \nthose who falsely cry fire in a crowded theater, that prosecution will \nhave the beneficial effect of deterring others from engaging in that \nsame conduct. But when government criminalizes ads that it determines \nare false or limits how much can be spent on those ads, backed up by \ncriminal penalties, that in fact will produce the harm of reducing the \nlikelihood that others will speak about important public subjects--\nhence, weakening our democracy.\n  Justice Holmes quickly came to realize the errors of his ways. In \nsubsequent Supreme Court decisions, he and Justice Brandeis dissented \nwhen the majority applied the clear and present danger test that the \nfire-in-the-theater analogy supported. They voted to protect peaceable \nfree speech. They understood that in a free country, the way to address \ncontroversial speech was through speech by others with different \nviews--not by shutting up people with the threat of jail.\n  It took a long 50 years for the Court to adopt the protections for \nfree speech that Justice Holmes and Judge Learned Hand had advocated to \nno avail. And if this constitutional amendment passes, that glorious \nhistory of the understanding of the importance of free speech in a \ndemocracy will be undone.\n  It was only a few years after its 1969 ruling providing strong \nconstitutional protections of free political speech that the Supreme \nCourt ruled on its first campaign speech case; that is, Buckley v. \nValeo. In that case the Court ruled that the independent expenditures \ncould be limited. The decision wasn't the work of supposed conservative \njudicial activists. Wealthy individuals have been able to spend \nunlimited amounts on campaign-related speech since then. That isn't a \nnovel development that dates only to Citizens United. Buckley also \npermitted nonprofit corporations to engage in independent expenditures \ndesigned to influence campaigns. Corporations and others could \ncontribute to these nonprofit entities.\n\n  In context, Citizens United represents an advance over the prior law, \nespecially in promoting transparency. Floyd Abrams, the Nation's \nforemost First Amendment litigator, wrote to the Judiciary Committee in \nquestions for the record:\n\n       What Citizens United did do, however, is permit \n     corporations to contribute to PACs that are required to \n     disclose all donors and engage only in independent \n     expenditures.\n       If anything, Citizens United is a pro-disclosure ruling \n     which brought corporate money further into the light.\n\n  So I don't think my colleagues are correct in saying this amendment \nis about so-called ``dark money.'' And limiting speech is totally \nseparate from disclosure of speech. This amendment says nothing about \ndisclosure.\n  It is the constitutional amendment, not Citizens United, that fails \nto respect precedent. It doesn't simply overturn one case. The Supreme \nCourt has repeatedly found that engaging in campaign speech is fully \nprotected by the Bill of Rights. Time after time it has ruled correctly \nthat because effective speech can only occur through the expenditure of \nmoney, government cannot restrict campaign expenditures by candidates \nor others. Repeatedly, the Court has recognized that effective campaign \nspeech requires that individuals have the right to form groups that\n\n[[Page S5498]]\n\nwill spend money on campaign speech. Those Supreme Court decisions were \njoined and sometimes written by great liberal Justices.\n  This proposal represents a radical departure from long-established \nfree speech protections. It is at war with an entire body of \njurisprudence. It extends well beyond corporations.\n  Despite the sponsors of this amendment limiting their criticism to \none or two cases, the amendment would overturn not just those few cases \nbut 12 Supreme Court decisions, according to that expert, Mr. Abrams. \nAs the amendment has been redrafted, it may be only 11.5 cases now, \ndepending upon what the word ``reasonable'' means. And why the word \n``reasonable'' was left out in the first place and why it was included \nnow, I don't know, but it is included now because people realize the \nextremities to which this constitutional amendment would take it. But \neven with the word ``reasonable,'' that extreme position would take us \ndown a slippery slope, amending the Bill of Rights, and I don't think \nwe want to go down that slope.\n  Justice Stevens, whom the committee Democrats relied on at length in \nsupport of the amendment, voted with the majority in three of the cases \nthe amendment would overturn.\n  It is hard to imagine what would be more radical than the Congress \npassing a constitutional amendment to overturn a dozen Supreme Court \ndecisions that have protected individual rights. Free speech would be \ndramatically curtailed. That is why the arguments made here on the \nSenate floor that matters were fine before Citizens United 4 years ago \nare beside the point.\n  Also off-point is the argument by another Democrat that the debate \nhere concerns only whether Citizens United was correctly decided under \nthe First Amendment and that the overall protection of free speech is \nnot at issue whatsoever. The amendment before us doesn't just reverse \nCitizens United. It doesn't just take us back 4 years. It reverses \ndecades of precedent that gave broad protection to free speech. That is \nwhy the stakes are so high and why we are spending so much time \ndebating this constitutional amendment.\n  Yet another argument was raised on the floor that overturning \nCitizens United through a constitutional amendment is comparable to \noverturning earlier Supreme Court decisions on women's suffrage or poll \ntaxes. In response to a written question from the Judiciary Committee, \nthe same scholar, Mr. Abrams, forcefully rejected any such comparison. \nHe wrote this back to us Senators:\n\n       The notion that a Supreme Court opinion protecting First \n     Amendment rights should be viewed as comparable to one \n     depriving slaves or women of their rights is both \n     intellectually flawed and morally repugnant.\n       How can constitutional amendments assuring freedom of \n     slaves or equality for women possibly be viewed as analogous \n     to taking away--\n\n  Emphasis on ``taking away''--\n\n     citizens' First Amendment rights?\n\n  This morning the lead sponsor of the amendment contended that the \namendment wouldn't lead to banning books or putting people in jail. He \nalso claimed that Congress had not provided for such results in earlier \nyears and would not do so now. He said that even if Congress tried, it \nwould be very unlikely that both Houses would pass such a measure. He \nmaintained that even if such extreme measures were enacted, the \nSupreme Court would strike down them as unreasonable. It reminds you \nthat the alien and sedition laws never put anybody in prison. But this \nsponsor did not deny that Congress could, in fact, pass legislation \nthat would have the effect the opponents have raised. What does he \nthink would happen if someone violated the reasonable spending limits? \nSome government agency would have to enforce them with criminal \npenalties. Violating them would subject people to jail for speaking. \nThe Obama Justice Department, which would enforce those criminal laws, \ntold the Supreme Court that if Citizens United had been decided as the \nsponsors of the amendment desire, it would prosecute book publishers.\n\n  In this country constitutional rights do not depend on the kindness \nof politicians not infringing them. Otherwise, we wouldn't have had the \nAlien and Sedition Acts. Those limits prevent Congress from violating \nrights in the first place.\n  The Bill of Rights was adopted precisely because the citizens \nrejected the argument that the Constitution's difficult passage to \nlegislative enactment by itself was adequate to protect fundamental \nliberties such as free speech. And it is cold comfort that after the \nelection is over and they have been barred from speaking, citizens can \nspend money to ask the Supreme Court to reverse their convictions.\n  I have made clear that this amendment abridges fundamental freedoms \nthat are the birthright of Americans. The arguments made to support it \nare very unconvincing. The amendment will weaken, not strengthen, \ndemocracy. It will not reduce corruption but will open the door for \nelected officials to bend democracy rules to benefit themselves, and \nthat is benefiting incumbency.\n  The fact that the Senate is considering such a dreadful amendment is \na great testament to the wisdom of our Founding Fathers in insisting \nupon and adopting the Bill of Rights in the first place, a necessary \nforerunner to whether the Colonies would approve the Constitution in \nthe first place.\n  Justice Jackson famously wrote:\n\n       The very purpose of a Bill of Rights was to withdraw \n     certain subjects from the vicissitudes of political \n     controversy, to place them beyond the reach of majorities and \n     officials and to establish them as legal principles to be \n     applied by the courts.\n       One's right to life, liberty, and property, to free speech, \n     a free press, freedom of worship and assembly, and other \n     fundamental rights may not be submitted to vote; they depend \n     on the outcome of no elections.\n\n  We must preserve our Bill of Rights, including our right to free \nspeech. We must not allow officials to diminish or ration that right. \nWe must not let this proposal become part of the supreme law of the \nland.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to discuss legislation pending before \nthe Senate which wages an unprecedented attack on a fundamental \nAmerican freedom. The Framers of our Constitution were clear when they \nstated in the Bill of Rights .  .  . ``Congress shall make no law .  .  \n. prohibiting the free exercise of speech.'' However, this week, the \nSenate majority has sought to undermine this fundamental freedom by \noffering a constitutional amendment to give Congress more control over \nthe free speech rights of Americans.\n  I opposed moving forward with this amendment because political speech \nis essential to the American way of life. Our Nation was founded on \nthose who openly criticized the king and argued for a better form of \ngovernment. All branches of our government rely on the ability for \nAmericans to passionately defend their interests. Additionally, when we \nelect candidates for office we the electorate rely on open dialog about \nwhy he or she ought to serve a particular community or State. The \nConstitution would have never been adopted without the Bill of Rights. \nPolitical speech is exactly the type of expression the Founders sought \nto protect when they adopted the Bill of Rights--however, this proposal \ncompletely forgets about that freedom.\n  Giving the Federal Government the ability to regulate what we say is \nflat out dangerous. What is a reasonable limitation on political \nspeech? The sponsors of this proposal can't answer that and it is \nreckless to assume that Federal courts will determine the correct \nanswer. What concerns me the most is where does this regulation stop? \nThe answer is not clear and at the very end of the day this \nconstitutional amendment limits the way in which Americans can voice \ntheir concerns about their elected officials.\n  With all that the Senate needs to accomplish it is an embarrassment \nthat the majority leader would bring this up now, not allow amendments \nand expect this institution to forget about the very freedoms our \nFounders sought to protect when they drafted our Federal Constitution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Lamest Lameduck Session\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I became a practicing physician over 30 \nyears ago. I delivered well in excess of 4,000 babies. And right now in \nmy Senate career and where the Senate is, I\n\n[[Page S5499]]\n\nfeel as if I am the father in the waiting room. I keep wondering when \nwe are going to make any progress, when we are actually going to have \nthe delivery of something positive for the country.\n  What we are seeing this week is really disappointing to me because if \nyou read just the headlines in the last 4 days, here are the headlines \nabout Congress.\n  Here is today's Politico: ``The Lamest Lame Duck Looms Over \nCongress.''\n  ``Lame Ducks Will Roost in a Do-Nothing December.''\n  ``December will be the lamest lame-duck session in a long time.''\n  The Economist: ``Congress is useless.''\n\n       America's legislature has become something of a joke in \n     recent years, a place where good policy ideas go to die and \n     where decent policy ideas go to be twisted into something \n     incomprehensible.\n\n  It is enough to make one lose faith in representative democracy, I \ntell you.\n  CNN:\n\n       Congress has taken off the whole year. But here's the \n     current math: What is less than nothing? And if you do less \n     than nothing, at what point does it become completely \n     counterproductive and silly?\n\n  That is our debate. The sum total of our big ideas right now is not \nwanting to start any fights within our own party and unity above all \nelse as we head into the midterm election.\n  What is the political solution? No substance, no ideas, no serious \ndebate that might actually engage voters. Instead, each side suits up, \narmed with its slogans and its bromides.\n  This is a quote from CNN: ``Congress defined: `Useless,' `worthless,' \na `joke.' '' That is according to the most recent response of the \npopular responses on CNN's Web site from 5,000 respondents on social \nmedia.\n  Also:\n\n       Still trying to get a pulse on the most common feelings \n     toward Congress? The other words on the top 10 list are \n     ``corrupt,'' ``incompetent,'' ``lazy,'' ``inept,'' \n     ``idiots,'' ``selfish'' and ``dysfunctional.''\n\n  The article goes on to say: ``I'll describe Congress with two \nwords,'' he said. ``Term limits!!''\n  The CNN article also had a Washington Post poll that said a majority \nof Americans feel their representatives in Congress are part of the \nproblem.\n  From the Washington Post: ``Congress is making a lot of history by \nbeing so unpopular.''\n  The real topic of today is what is not happening in the Congress. I \nwill describe where we are. This year we are going to have borrowed an \nexcess of $500 billion that we won't pay for. We have a continuing \nresolution coming up with $49 billion worth of fake dollars in it. That \nway everybody can say they stayed within the requirements of the Ryan-\nMurray agreement. So there is no integrity in that.\n  We have done nothing to markedly increase the opportunity for jobs in \nAmerica. What is not happening is a reversal of the decline in the \nmedian family income in this country, which is now at 1988 levels.\n  The big story is what is not happening. The big story is that \nCongress is not addressing the needs of the Nation. The big story is \nthat Congress has not passed its first appropriations bill. The big \nstory is what is not happening. It is not what is happening. What is \nhappening is a political farce. Everybody knows it. It is all about the \nelection, it is all about reemphasizing where we are, and the country \nsuffers for it.\n  We know that there is no opportunity to actually amend the bill on \nthe floor, but I have filed an amendment which would place term limits \non Members of Congress. The No. 1 requirement--right now in this body--\nfor most politicians on both sides is to get reelected. That is why we \nare not addressing the real issues; that is why we are not addressing \nthe fraud in the Social Security disability system; that is why we \nthrew $30 billion at the VA system rather than effectively rearrange \nand totally rewrite the VA health care system.\n  Cyber security is important for this country. Bills have passed out \nof the Homeland Security Committee. Bills have--these are all \nbipartisan bills--passed out of the Senate Select Intelligence \nCommittee. What is not happening is that they are not coming to the \nfloor even though that is a great threat to our country right now \nbecause what is important is what is important to the politicians and \nnot what is important for the long run, the best for our country.\n  If we are going to amend the Bill of Rights and take free speech away \nfrom people in this country, we should at least do something to secure \nthe future--so our own worst tendencies won't be exaggerated in the \nfuture--and put term limits on Members of Congress. This system is \nrigged for incumbents. It is totally rigged for incumbents.\n  At one point last year the approval rating for Congress got down to 8 \npercent. That means only 1 in 12 people in this country thought \nCongress--and it is a little better than that now. I think it is 12 or \n14 percent; 1 in 6 or 7 people have confidence that we have their back \nand that our motivations are pure in terms of wanting to fix the \nproblems with our country. They see the lack of leadership. They see \nthe political posturing, and they don't like what they see because what \nthey see is selfishness. They see politicians putting themselves first \nand the country second. That is where we are. It is the dirty little \nsecret that people won't talk about but Americans outside of Washington \ninnately know is true.\n  So we have a bill on the floor to amend--for the first time in \nhistory--the Bill of Rights to limit First Amendment speech. Why? \nBecause the Supreme Court rulings have maybe changed the dynamics in \nterms of elections. Well, if you didn't care if you got reelected, you \nwould not care about that.\n  So we are only going to be here in session--actively in Congress \nbefore the election in early November--for 7 or 8 more days so that \neverybody who is up for reelection, and those who are not, can go out \nand campaign and raise money so we can continue the progress of career \npoliticians and the rigged incumbent advantage can stay in process.\n  So I know it is not in order to offer my amendment. It has been \nfiled. One way to fix this is to put term limits on Members of the \nSenate. Oklahoma has term limits for its Members of Congress. \nOklahomans believe in it. It is a 72-to-80 percent issue all across the \ncountry. Americans believe in it, but the politicians in Washington are \nnever going to vote for it because it puts them second and the country \nfirst.\n  We have a Defense authorization bill that needs to be passed. It is \ncritical for the future of our country. We are not talking about it, \nand we are not doing anything on it.\n  As I have mentioned, we have several cyber bills that need to be \npassed that have gone through committee--bipartisan bills--and they are \nnot on the floor. We have significant appropriation bills that need to \nhave the attention of the Members of Congress--and this is not the \ncommittee's fault.\n  The committee is a bipartisan committee and has done good work. This \nis a leadership problem within the Senate. They have done their work, \nbut the bills can't come to the floor because we don't want to have to \ntake up and defend those votes back home. So when you read what the \npress says about Congress, they are actually pretty nice to us given \nwhere we are today. We are lame ducks. We have taken the year off. We \nare worthless. We are a joke. We are useless, incompetent, corrupt, \nlazy, and inept. I don't think those words are too harsh. We are \nrepeating votes that we have already voted on that are political votes \nthat are designed to enhance turnout in certain groups.\n  So this place is a show place, and the downside is that the country \nsuffers for it--our country. Whether you are a conservative male who is \n66 years old like me or you are a liberal Latino female at 18, our \ncountry suffers because our eye is off the ball. Our eye is off the \noath that we took. Our eye is off our commitment and the historical \nlineage that has been here before us as Members of Congress willing to \ndo what was necessary to solve the problems for the country. What is \nnot happening in the Senate is that there is no leadership. We say \nleader, but there is no leadership in the Senate.\n  The leadership of the Senate is now totally disconnected from what is \nneeded by the country. So instead of the greatest deliberative body in \nthe world, what we have in the Senate today is the greatest political \nbody in the world that doesn't care about deliberation\n\n[[Page S5500]]\n\nand only cares about winning the next election. There are a lot of ways \nto cure that, and when you read and see the poll about Congress and \nread the words and look at it, the majority of Americans today believe \nthat their Member of Congress is part of the problem. The average \nMember of Congress has a lower reelect than nonreelect.\n  The American people get it. The question is: What can they do about \nit? What you have to do is you have to eventually have term limits so \nthat we take the inherent bias of the career politician out of the mix, \nand we make it not about the politicians but we return the Senate to \nits original intention; and that is, what is in the best interest of \nthe country.\n  Quite frankly, for the last 3\\1/2\\ years, that is not what has been \nhappening in this body. It is a soulful, shameful period in the history \nof our country. The thoughts and creative power of our Founders as they \ninstituted a body that was meant to consider very straightforward, very \nsolemnly, every issue that came--that was meant to drive consensus, to \nforce consensus. We have no consensus when the whole goal is not to \nsolve problems for the country but to win elections.\n  I would love to be able to take a poll of Democrats, Republicans, \nWhigs, Independents, and everybody else who has ever been in this \nbody--it is less than 2,500, although I don't know the exact number--\nand see what they would say about how the Senate operates today and how \nit is not doing its job and what is not happening at a time when our \ncountry's economic growth is anemic at best, when job creation doesn't \ncome anywhere close to what we need, where deficit spending is kind of \na yawn, and the moral fact that every day we have mortgaged the future \nof the next two generations. I would love to hear what the other \nSenators who stood in this building would say about what we are doing \ntoday. I think there would be a rousing round of condemnation.\n  So I think it is important for the American people right now to look \nat the Senate and say: What are we doing? I mean, it is true that \nSocial Security disability will go bankrupt next year. It is true that \nin less than 15 years Medicare will be bankrupt. It is true that in \nless than 18 years Social Security will be gone. Those are all true \nthings. It is true that we are going to have a $500 billion deficit--at \nleast $500 billion--which is about $1,400 a person. We are spending \nmore than we are taking in this year, and we are charging it to the 2, \n3, 4, 5, and 6-year-olds in this country today. Those are true \nstatements.\n  Is that anywhere close to integrity? Is there any moral value in \nmortgaging the future of the next generation? Probably not.\n  I have listened to a lot of speeches on the floor this week. I hardly \never come down and talk except for maybe once every 2 weeks now since \nwe have no opportunity to offer or debate our amendments.\n  I wonder what the American people must be thinking about what we are \nnot doing, what we are not addressing, the problems that are unfixed \nthat need a fix, that need a bipartisan solution, that need compromise, \nthat need the power of the original Senate, with the rights of the \nminority and the majority running toward a compromise that gives us the \nbest we can get based on where we are as a country. There is no \nopportunity for that anymore in this body. We don't pass muster, and we \ndon't pass muster not because there are a lot of those on both sides of \nthe aisle who don't want to pass muster but because the leadership \nisn't there.\n  The Senate has been run into the ground as far as its intended \nfunction and its intended working. I think that is highly unfortunate \nfor our country. I think it is highly unfortunate for our children. In \nthis time of world morass and trouble all around the world--conflict, \ncomplications, difficulty--and in this time when we are having trouble \nourselves staying above water, in almost every aspect of what we are \ndoing, we need a vigorous, alive, functioning Senate that is full of \nriveting debate about the issues of today that are presented to our \ncountry. Instead, we have political games, and we are going to have \npolitical games the rest of the week.\n  I wonder what our future holds when we have this kind of leadership. \nWhat does it portend for the country when the U.S. Senate no longer \ndebates the current topics and issues before the country and spends all \nits times trying to get its Members reelected. That is a sad \ncommentary, and it is a Senate that is very far away from the Senate I \njoined 10 years ago.\n  I yield the floor. I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I first wanted to acknowledge the severity \nof the challenges we face as a country right now, whether it is \nmilitary action to stop the threat of ISIS or the crisis in Ukraine. \nColorado is waiting to hear from the President tonight. We are all \nconcerned with that, as we should be.\n  Today on the floor of the Senate is a proposed constitutional \namendment. While it is on the floor I wanted to take a minute to talk \nabout it.\n  Tonight in Colorado, a swing State, families will endure an avalanche \nof political ads. Many of them will come from obscure interests with \ndeceptive names such as America, Inc., the Government Integrity Fund \nAction Network, something called Citizens for a Working America, and so \non and so forth. There will be no way to tell who these folks are, \nbecause under the laws of the United States many of these organizations \ndo not have any obligation to disclose where their money comes from, a \nprivileged status that individual Americans do not have when it comes \nto funding political campaigns. It is enough to make everyone in our \nState, in Colorado, hate their TV, much less American politics, and \nprobably not in that order.\n  In Washington, on the other hand, which--I guess I should say only in \nWashington, which has become a Disneyland when it comes to any sense of \nreality, there are people defending the current system--the current \ncampaign finance system--on the grounds that it is a great victory for \nfree speech and a great victory for our democracy. It is the position--\nit is the position of the defenders of the current system that what we \nneed in our politics is more money, not less, that more money is going \nto help our politics, not less.\n  I have never met a Coloradan who thinks what is wrong with our \npolitics is that we do not have enough money. In fact, they believe the \nreverse. They believe the exact opposite. That is because they know our \nsystem of financing campaigns, far from being about elucidating the \ntruth, is a system expressly designed to obscure the truth. From \nColorado's perspective, it is a system that is really good for the \nspecial interests and the occupiers of the past, and really terrible \nfor the American people and for our future.\n  Over the last several months, almost every one of us at some point \nhas lamented the Senate's inability to address the big issues facing \nour Nation, whether it is reforming our broken immigration system, \ncreating a more competitive Tax Code that encourages innovation and \nhelps produce an economy that lifts middle-class family income again in \nthe country. Energy, climate, education, and infrastructure are left \nunanswered as we barely summon the votes to approve another \nnoncontroversial judge or nominee.\n  My colleagues, we share the pathetic distinction of being on target \nto becoming the least productive Congress ever. Ever. Close readers of \nAmerican history will know this is a particularly ignominious \nachievement. How will it feel when the next history books are written \nto know that we managed to do even less than the do-nothing Congress? \nThat is how you acquire a Congress that now has a 14-percent approval \nrating, below President Nixon even had during the height of Watergate.\n  This less-than-do-nothing Congress is not just failing the American \npeople on the big issues. We have given up on those for now around \nhere. We are struggling to pass basic appropriations bills, to keep the \nHighway Trust Fund solvent over the long term. Some of my colleagues in \nthis Chamber, this land of flickering lights, have argued that the\n\n[[Page S5501]]\n\ntea party and obstruction are to blame. Others have argued that the \nmajority's limits on debate and floor amendments are at the root of the \nproblem. But I think it all starts with our broken campaign finance \nsystem, which has never been perfect but recently has become \nsubstantially worse.\n  First, let me say when I first studied the Court's most significant \nprior opinion on finance, the case of Buckley against Valeo, decided in \nthe early 1970s, it seemed to me that if the Court had actually \nunderstood what had happened as a result of that decision, they might \nreconsider their holding that money is speech. But by then it was \nabundantly clear that the wealthier you are the louder your voice, an \noutcome that seemed to me at odds with a democracy grounded on the \nnotion of one person, one vote. This is not to say we should expect to \nlive in a country where everybody has equal speech. We could never \nsucceed in ensuring that, and we would certainly fail if we tried. But \nwe could address unfair practices and advantages. We could devise \ncommonsense regulations of our campaign finance laws to make sure our \ngovernment could actually function. We could hope to lift the voices in \nthe town square and on every street corner in the country and reward \nthe effort of each individual American, no matter what they believe, no \nmatter who they were, who became involved in politics to help create \nthe future of this country. We could do that. In fact, we did do that \nfor decades. We could do it until Citizens United was decided, when the \nCourt not only did not wince at its holding in Buckley, but doubled \ndown, holding, among other things, that independent expenditures do not \ngive rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption, an absurd \nproposition on its face to anyone who serves in the Congress.\n  Also, in McCutcheon, another opinion, the Supreme Court held that \nthere is ``only one legitimate governmental interest for restricting \ncampaign finances: preventing corruption or the appearance of \ncorruption.''\n  That is it. It can't be regulated to do anything else.\n  The Court went on to hold that ``spending large sums of money in \nconnection with elections, but not in connection with an effort to \ncontrol the exercise of an officeholder's official duties, does not \ngive rise to quid pro quo corruption. Nor does the possibility that an \nindividual who spends large sums may garner `influence or access to' \nelected officials or political parties.''\n  Think about that for a minute. The majority in McCutcheon doesn't \nbelieve that an individual who spends large sums of money would garner \ninfluence or access to elected officials? The Court doesn't think they \nare trying to influence our official duties? Could anyone in this \nChamber agree with this conclusion with a straight face?\n  In fact, some do agree, but there isn't a single soul in Colorado who \ndoes.\n  But to me the more significant point is that the Court failed to \nrecognize how unlimited and undisclosed campaign spending corrupts the \nvery act of government. This extends far beyond the traditional notion \nof quid pro quo corruption.\n  In search pretty much in vain--not entirely but pretty much in vain--\nfor the pitiful politician hiding cash in his icebox or somewhere \nbeneath the south 40, the Court missed the real corruption. In doing so \nthese decisions and the looming threat of unchecked spending have led \nto almost complete paralysis--the end of principled compromise on \nbehalf of the public interest.\n  In his dissent in Citizens United, Justice Stevens warned of this \npotential problem when he wrote:\n\n       The influx of unlimited corporate money into the electoral \n     realm also creates new opportunities for the mirror image of \n     quid pro quo deals: threats, both explicit and implicit. \n     Starting today, corporations with large war chests to deploy \n     on electioneering may find democratically elected bodies \n     becoming much more attuned to their interests.\n\n  That is precisely what we found. Inertia has become the new reality \nin the Senate and in the House. Congress is now frozen by its own fear \nof taking on incumbent interests, whether it is our failure to address \nlong-term deficits or to create a coherent energy policy.\n  We can see this corruption in the difficult decisions we avoid. It is \nthe tough vote that we will not take. It is the bill we can't pass even \nin the face of urgent need. It is the deal that can't be reached. It is \nthe speech that is never made. It is the story of the do-less than the \ndo-nothing Congress.\n  This corruption, by its nature, is difficult to prove because it is \ninvisible, but it suits the incumbent interests just fine.\n  The Court imagined a world where people with bags of money are \nwandering around Capitol Hill--and only then could you regulate it--\ntrying to get people to do something for them. Ninety percent of what \nhappens around here is people coming and trying to keep you from doing \nsomething, trying to keep things the same, trying to keep the incumbent \ninterests embedded in our Tax Code, in our regulatory code, and in our \nstatute book.\n  The Supreme Court was silent completely on that corruption. I would \nargue that is at the core of our dysfunction as a Congress.\n  There is a reason the dysfunction that is so hated by the people I \nrepresent coincided with the era of these Supreme Court opinions.\n  This is why everybody in Colorado continue to scratch their heads and \nwonder how we can be so disconnected from their set of priorities, so \ndecoupled from their set of priorities--what they care about, for the \nfuture of their families, the future of their business--and how we can \ncome here all week and just vote on judges.\n  To my knowledge, there are no super PACs devoted to votes on judges \none way or another, which is maybe why that is what we spend our time \ndoing.\n  I have a lot of respect for the Supreme Court, as I know the \nPresiding Officer does, and the separation of powers, and I know how \nserious it is to consider a constitutional amendment, an amendment to \nthe Constitution, which is why it should be a last, not a first resort.\n  But the Court got it wrong when it came to the practical day-to-day \noperations of this Congress and the way its campaigns work, and its \ndecisions have unleashed a new torrent of spending that is corroding \nthe vibrancy of our democracy.\n  I think it is useful for us to take a moment to think about or to \nconsider the practical effect of these decisions.\n  During the entire 2010 election cycle--that is the year Citizens \nUnited was decided--super PACs spent a total of $63 million in this \ncountry.\n  So far, September 10, in this election cycle, super PACs have spent \n$116 million. That is almost twice what was spent in 2010, and it is \nonly the beginning of September. There are States where you cannot buy \nTV time because so much TV time has been bought by these outside \ngroups.\n\n  For the three election cycles before Citizens United, outside \nspending totaled about $113 million. In contrast, in the three election \ncycles since Citizens United was decided, outside spending has totaled \nabout $530 million. This is almost a fivefold increase in spending.\n  There probably are people around the country who aren't beneficiaries \nof this incredible speech. Unfortunately, folks in Colorado are because \nwe are a swing State, as I mentioned at the beginning. You can't \nactually at this point watch anything else on television.\n  In 2012 the top 100 individual donors to super PACs--the top 100 \npeople, people along with their spouses--represented 1 percent of all \nindividual donors to super PACs, but their donations totaled 67 percent \nof the funding and therefore 67 percent of the spending.\n  But the spending doesn't only affect how this place works, as I \nmentioned earlier, it affects what we work on in Congress.\n  That is why Congress has repeatedly enacted reasonable limits on \ncampaign spending, which have largely been upheld until very recently, \nuntil 2010.\n  In fact, as recently as 2003, in FEC v. Beaumont, the Supreme Court \nfound that ``any attack on the federal prohibition of direct corporate \npolitical contributions goes against the current of a century of \ncongressional efforts to curb corporations' potentially `deleterious \ninfluences on federal elections.' ''\n  The Court made the point that our current laws grew out of the late \n19th century belief ``that aggregated capital unduly influenced \npolitics, an influence not stopping short of corruption.''\n  It is an influence that stops the work of the Senate and the House \ndead in its tracks.\n\n[[Page S5502]]\n\n  This concern about aggregated capital and its effect on our democracy \nactually goes back to the earliest days of our country.\n  In the Federalist Papers James Madison wrote:\n\n       We may define a republic to be, or at least may bestow that \n     name on, a government which derives all its powers directly \n     or indirectly from the great body of the people. . . . It is \n     essential to such a government that it be derived from the \n     great body of the society, not from an inconsiderable \n     proportion, or a favored class of it.\n\n  So there is nothing unprecedented about seeking to regulate campaign \nspending. What is unprecedented is the ease by which the Supreme Court \nhas undone decades of campaign finance laws, which has led to this \ndysfunction in Congress and the misery the folks in Colorado are \nsuffering as they watch these ads.\n  What is unprecedented is the sheer volume of money that is flooding \nthe Senate and congressional races. What is unprecedented is the \ncorrupting influence this money is having on the institution of \nCongress.\n  Because of this new world of unlimited spending, Members of Congress \nare a lot less likely to seek compromise than they once were and work \ntogether if they know they may become the target of a super Pac from \npeople who can write checks that are larger than my imagination.\n  Reasonable limits on campaign spending can help address this problem. \nWe believed for decades and decades and decades that the Constitution \nallowed us to do that.\n  The Supreme Court has now decided that we can't, and we are looking \nat this choice.\n  I would say also on this point that notwithstanding my observations \nabout the Court, it is also true that eight of nine Supreme Court \nJustices have said that disclosure requirements are constitutional, \nthat disclosure does not require a change to the Constitution. I, for \none, say at least let's pass that, Republicans and Democrats coming \ntogether and saying, You know what. We have always had an expectation \nabout the First Amendment that we are going to be willing to stand and \nsay who we are--or maybe we will not require people to say who they \nare, but we will just say at the end: Paid for people who are so \nembarrassed about what they are doing that they refuse to put their \nactual names on this advertisement.\n  But it seems to me that if we can be required to say: I am Senator so \nand so and I paid for this message, we ought to be able to say that \nabout everybody who is advertising in political ads.\n  Changing these rules would bring more compromise and consensus \nbuilding to this institution but, most important, above all else, it \nwould help give individual families a greater say in the political \nprocess. We offer this amendment not as a one-size-fits-all solution \nbut to allow Congress and the States to place reasonable limits on \ncampaign spending to experiment with what works and put away what \ndoesn't work, similar to the rules that had existed for decades, \nsimilar to the rules that existed when the Congress actually \nfunctioned, similar to the rules that existed when Democrats and \nRepublicans didn't seem to have such difficulty working across the \naisle.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Calhoun, of Oklahoma City, \nOK who died on June 23, 2007, of wounds suffered when his vehicle \nencountered an improvised explosive device while serving his Nation in \nTaji, Iraq.\n  Derek was born on September 8, 1983 in Oklahoma City, OK and attended \nMoore High School. After completing high school, he enrolled at Wright \nBusiness School where he received his associate degree. In 2005, he \nenlisted and was assigned to 2nd Battalion, 8th Cavalry Regiment, 1st \nBrigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division, Fort Hood, TX.\n  Derek had been in Iraq for 8 months and was on his first tour of duty \nwhen he was killed. He was injured several months earlier when a car \nbomb exploded outside a building he was in. He had shrapnel in his \nwrist, abdomen and shoulder and spent the several months in the \nhospital having two surgeries. Because of his injuries, Derek was \nunable to use his right hand and was going through physical therapy to \nget his hands back to normal.\n  A funeral service was held on July 3, 2007 at South Lindsey Baptist \nChurch in Oklahoma City, OK with internment in Moore City Cemetery with \nfull military honors.\n  Derek is survived by his parents Alan and Lou Calhoun of Oklahoma \nCity; one sister Lanesha Morris of Oklahoma City; grandparents Jean and \nJoAnn Calhoun of Choctaw, OK; three nieces Sierra, Cheyenne and Autumn \nMorris; and one nephew Takoda Morris.

Mr. President, it is my privilege also to honor the life \nand sacrifice of Army SPC Ryan S. Dallam, of Norman, OK who died with \ntwo other servicemembers on April 6, 2007, of wounds suffered from a \nroadside bomb while serving his Nation in Baghdad, Iraq.\n  Ryan was born September 22, 1982 in Norman and lived in Midwest City, \nOK for a time after his parents divorced. When his mother Laura went to \nteach on an American Indian reservation in AZ, he accompanied her and \ngraduated from Show Low High School in 2002. He later attended Oklahoma \nCity Community College.\n  His father Scott Dallam retired in 2003 after 23 years in the Army. A \nthird generation soldier, Ryan joined the military during the early \nspring of 2005 and reported to Fort Leonard Wood, MO for basic \ntraining. As a member of the Headquarters Company, 1st/18th Infantry, \n2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division Schweinfurt, Germany, \nRyan deployed to Iraq in September 2007 and he was scheduled to come \nhome on leave the next week. His family was enjoying making plans to \nspend time with him when the chaplain arrived at their home with the \nunwelcome news.\n  A memorial service was held at First Christian Church in Norman on \nApril 12, 2007 with interment at Fort Sill National Cemetery in Fort \nSill, OK.\n  ``He really liked what he was doing,'' Scott Dallam said. ``That \nmakes us feel pretty good. He really enjoyed it and the camaraderie of \nbeing in the military and being around other soldiers.''\n  Ryan is survived by his mother Laura Dallam; father Scott Dallam; \nstepmother Leslie Dallam; and a younger brother and sister.\n  Today we remember Army SPC Ryan S.

Mr. President, it is my privilege also to honor the life \nand sacrifice of Army CPL Jaron D. Holliday, of Tulsa, OK who died with \ntwo other servicemembers on August 4, 2007, of wounds suffered from a \nroadside bomb while serving his Nation in Hawr Rajab, Iraq.\n  Jaron always wanted to be in the Armed Forces and began researching \nwhich branch he wanted to go into when he was 11, his mother, Kelly \nHolliday, said. ``That was always his desire--to go into the military \nand serve,'' his mother said. ``When 9/11 happened, he was 15, and he \nsaid, `If I were old enough to serve, I would.' ''\n  The oldest of eight siblings--seven boys and one girl--Jaron was \nhome-\n\n[[Page S5503]]\n\nschooled and graduated through the Christian Home Education Fellowship \nof Oklahoma in 2004. He joined the Army in 2005 when he was 19 and was \nassigned to the 1st Squadron, 40th Cavalry Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat \nTeam (Airborne), 25th Infantry Division, Fort Richardson, AK.\n  Funeral services were held August 16, 2010 at Tulsa Bible Church with \ninterment at Memorial Park Cemetery, Tulsa, OK.\n  Jaron is survived by his parents John and Kelley Holliday and seven \nsiblings.\n  ``He was a people-watcher,'' his mother said. ``He loved people. He \nwas the kind of person who, if he saw someone sitting by themselves \nlooking depressed or upset, he made it his mission to make them smile \nbefore he left, and usually accomplished that goal.''\n  ``We didn't want to waste time going to an amusement park or sitting \nin a movie theater because you can't look at each other and talk to \neach other in those places. We decided to make memories by just being \ntogether,'' said his mother.\n  Today we remember Army CPL Jaron D. Holliday, a young man who loved \nhis family and country, and gave his life as a sacrifice for freedom.\n\n\n                     Specialist Thomas R. Leemhuis\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I also wish to remember Army SPC Thomas R. \nLeemhuis who died along with four other servicemembers on June 21, 2007 \nof wounds sustained when their vehicle struck an improvised explosive \ndevice in Baghdad, Iraq.\n  Tom was born in Lawton, OK on August 2, 1983 and attended Binger-Oney \nHigh School in Caddo County, OK before moving to nearby Anadarko after \nhe graduated in 2002.\n  In 2005 he was inspired to join the Army after the death of his uncle \nMelvin Jody Stevens, a Vietnam veteran. Upon completing basic training \nhe was assigned to 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Brigade \nCombat Team, 1st Infantry Division, Schweinfurt, Germany.\n  About 500 friends, relatives and fellow soldiers attended a memorial \nservice at Binger-Oney High School Auditorium with internment at \nWilliams Family Cemetery in Binger. At the service, Tom was remembered \nas a fun-loving young man who enjoyed cracking jokes and playing video \ngames. ``His No. 1 football team was the Nebraska Cornhuskers, and he \nloved to wear his Nebraska hat around the University of Oklahoma,'' \nsaid his mother. ``He loved to push it to the limit.''\n  Tom had first thought of becoming a teacher and basketball coach when \nhe got out of the military, but then decided to become a police officer \nbecause he hated drugs. He had decided to return to Binger after he \ncompleted his commitment with the Army because he wanted to make a \ndifference there. He was extremely proud of the military and being a \nNative American.\n  Tom is survived by his mother Patty Leemhuis; father Paul Whitehorn \nof Birmingham, AL; a brother Paul Whitehorn Jr. of Binger, OK; and \nthree sisters, Stephanie Leemhuis of Dublin, CA; Renee Whitehorn of \nAnadarko, OK; and Dream Cox of Birmingham, AL.\n  Today we remember Army SPC Thomas R. Leemhuis, a young man who loved \nhis family and country, and gave his life as a sacrifice for freedom.\n\n\n                    Staff Sergeant William D. Scates\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I would also like to honor the life and \nsacrifice of Army SSG William D. Scates, of Oklahoma City, OK who died \nwith three other servicemembers on August 11, 2007, of wounds suffered \nfrom a roadside bomb while serving his Nation in Arab Jabour, Iraq.\n  Born March 8, 1976 in Oklahoma City, Dan was a graduate of Western \nHeights High School and had a lifelong passion to join the military. \n``When he was a little boy, he was always drawing pictures of soldiers. \nThat's all he ever wanted to be,'' said his mother. He had been in the \nOklahoma Army National Guard before joining the Active Duty Army where \nhe was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 30th Infantry Regiment, 2nd \nBrigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division, based at Fort Stewart, GA.\n  A memorial service was held September 1, 2007 in Oklahoma City with \ninterment in Fort Bliss National Cemetery in El Paso, TX. His mother \nMoreana Whitson said her son wanted to be buried there because it was \nin El Paso where he met his wife Raquel, while in training.\n  Dan is survived by his wife Raquel; daughters Jade 9, and 7-month-old \nKendra; his mother Moreana Whitson; his stepfather Randy Whitson; and \ntwo sisters Courtney Champagne of Idaho and Shannon Scates of Oklahoma \nCity. He was preceded in death by his father William Leon Scates, who \ndied when Dan was a child.\n  At the memorial service, the Rev. Michael Jackson noted that Dan ``as \na child protected kids in the neighborhood from the bullies'' and said \nhe was doing the same thing in Iraq.\n  The minister read a poem that Dan's mother had written some time ago \nabout her son, who was serving his third tour of duty in Iraq.\n  ``A long time ago, when you were just a little bitty fellar,'' she \nwrote, ``little did I know the hero in you. We are not here today to \nmourn,'' Jackson said. ``We are here to celebrate a hero who is going \nhome to receive his greatest award . . . his greatest honor.''\n  ``I believe he was a hero before he was born,'' Jackson said. ``Then \nhe lived up to that calling, not just as an adult, but through his \nwhole life.''\n  I extend our deepest gratitude and condolences to Dan's family. He \nlived a life of love for his family, friends, and our country. He will \nbe remembered for his commitment to and belief in the greatness of our \nNation. I am honored to pay tribute to this true American hero who \nvolunteered to go into the fight and made the ultimate sacrifice of his \nlife for our freedom.\n\n\n                 Private First Class Jerimiah J. Veitch\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is my privilege also to honor the life \nand sacrifice of Army PFC Jerimiah J. Veitch, of Dibble, OK who died \nwith four other servicemembers on June 21, 2007, of wounds suffered \nwhen his vehicle was struck by a rocket propelled grenade while serving \nhis Nation in Baghdad, Iraq. He was assigned to 2nd Battalion, 12th \nInfantry Regiment, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 2nd Infantry Division, Fort \nCarson, CO.\n  Born in Moore, OK, Jerimiah moved to San Jose, CA and then back to \nDibble, OK with his mother Valorie Sanchez and stepfather Tony Sanchez \nbefore high school. According to his sister Amanda Testerman, he gave \nhis all at Dibble High School where he graduated in 2005 so that he \ncould play football and use the weight room.\n  A memorial service was held at Union Hill Baptist Church with \ninterment in Dibble Cemetery in Dibble, OK.\n  At the funeral, LTC Steven Michael said that Jerimiah was only 5 foot \n4 inches, but was ``strong as an ox, tenacious.'' One year he took \nsecond place in a State weightlifting competition, lifting more than \n1,000 pounds in three lifts in the 132-pound weight class. More than \n400 pounds of the total he lifted with a single deadlift.\n  After returning home from the Army he planned to go to Dibble, buy \nsome land and build a house. He wanted to go to work for his stepfather \nin the roofing business. ``He is more of a son than anyone could ask \nfor,'' his father said. ``He was my partner. He was the heart of our \nfamily.''\n  Jerimiah is survived by his mother Valorie Sanchez; stepfather Tony \nSanchez; his sister Amanda Testerman; and two brothers Caleb and Jacob \nVeitch.\n  I extend our deepest gratitude and condolences to Jerimiah's family. \nHe lived a life of love for his family, friends, and our country. He \nwill be remembered for his commitment to and belief in the greatness of \nour Nation. I am honored to pay tribute to this true American hero who \nvolunteered to go into the fight and made the ultimate sacrifice of his \nlife for our freedom.\n\n\n                         Sergeant Ryan M. Wood\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is my privilege also to honor the life \nand sacrifice of Army SGT Ryan M. Wood, of Oklahoma City, OK who died \nwith two other servicemembers on June 21, 2007, of wounds suffered from \na roadside bomb while serving his Nation in Baghdad, Iraq.\n  Born June 11, 1984 in Oklahoma City, OK, Ryan graduated from Putnam \nCity North High School in 2002 and signed up for the Army after the \nSeptember 11 terrorist attacks. ``The war gave Ryan a mission,'' said \nhis sister, Candice Bunce. He was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 26th \nInfantry Regiment, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division, \nSchweinfurt, Germany. ``He accomplished his mission and left this world \nwith dignity and honor.''\n\n[[Page S5504]]\n\n  Ryan was an accomplished artist who had received an acceptance letter \nfrom the University of Central Oklahoma to study art and political \nscience. On his second tour to Iraq, he had the names of two other \nsoldiers who died in combat tattooed on his chest.\n  His stepfather Scott Vincent said he hoped Wood's death will remind \nothers that American soldiers are dying for their country in Iraq. \n``The majority of them are proud to be there,'' he said. ``They don't \nwant to be forgotten. They want to have the tools to do their job.''\n  Funeral services were held at the Church of the Servant in northwest \nOklahoma City, OK.\n  Speaking at the funeral, Ryan's uncle Army Maj. John Litchfield said \nhis nephew had a noble spirit that his men could sense.

A bill to provide support for the development of middle \nschool career exploration programs linked to career and technical \neducation programs of study; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, the key to America's continued success lies \nin improving our Nation's educational system to meet the demands of the \n21st century job market. Today, many students enter high school and \ncollege with little knowledge of the careers available to them outside \nof traditional pathways. With college costs continuing to rise, it is \ncritical that students have exposure to the wide range of available \nwork and career choices early in their academic careers so that, by the \ntime they enter high school, they are more informed about future paths \nand what they need to do to pursue them.\n  Career and technical education, CTE, are a proven way to help \nstudents explore their own strengths and preferences, as well as how \nthey match up with potential future careers. However, limited funding \nfor middle school CTE programming often means students have to wait \nuntil high school for this exposure.\n  Studies have found that middle school students greatly benefit from \ncareer and technical education development programs that promote career \nexploration skills, as well as increase knowledge of career options and \ncareer pathways. Middle school is an important time for students to \nexplore their own strengths, likes, and dislikes, and career and \ntechnical education exploration programs are great tools to educate \nthem about the type of course or training that goes into a career field \nthat matches their interests.\n  This is why I am pleased to introduce the Middle School Technical \nEducation Program Act, which establishes a pilot program for middle \nschools to partner with postsecondary institutions and local businesses \nto develop and implement career and technical exploration programs. \nThis legislation will provide support for middle schools to create \ncareer and technical education programs that will provide students with \nintroductory courses, hands-on learning, or afterschool programs. \nCareer guidance and academic counseling is vital to ensuring that our \nstudents understand the educational requirements for high-growth, in-\ndemand career fields. Many times students receive this information too \nlate in their academic careers.\n  We need to make middle school more career-relevant and expose \nstudents to the career pathways they may choose. This legislation also \nrequires that programs helps students draft a high school graduation \nplan that demonstrates what courses would prepare them for a given \ncareer field. If we give students at a younger age applied career and \ntechnical opportunities, they will be more informed about future paths \nand what they need to do to pursue them. I hope this bill spurs \ndiscussion on how vital middle school is for exposing students to \ncareer choices.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Murray, \n        Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Reed, Mr. Johnson of South Dakota, Mr. \n        Bennet, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. Casey, Mr. Blumenthal, Ms. Warren, \n        and Mrs. Hagan):\n  S. 2789. A bill to amend part B of the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act to provide full Federal funding of such part; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, throughout my career in public service I \nhave focused on ensuring that each and every child with a disability is \nensured the right to a good education. To this end, I have fought \ntirelessly to safeguard the rights of children with disabilities under \nthe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, IDEA, landmark \nlegislation that has been improving the educational outcomes of \nmillions of students across the nation since 1975 on the bedrock \nprinciples of inclusion and equality.\n  When Congress passed IDEA, we understood that our commitment to \nprovide high-quality educational opportunities and serve the needs of \nstudents with disabilities in our classrooms entailed excess costs \ncompared to others students, which would have a significant financial \nimpact on States and school districts. That is why Congress committed \nto covering up to 40 percent of the excess cost of educating students \nwith disabilities. However, we have failed to deliver on that promise, \nand the law has been consistently and grossly underfunded.\n  This is why I am pleased to introduce the IDEA Full Funding Act, \nwhich will allow us to make good on the full federal commitment. Given \nthe current financial difficulties that many state and local \ngovernments are facing, this legislation is more essential than ever \nfor ensuring that students with disabilities get the high-quality \neducation and services they need in order to fulfill their potential.\n  Since enactment of IDEA, students with disabilities across the United \nStates have made tremendous progress. Today, nearly 6.6 million \nstudents receive special education services designed to meet their \nindividual needs. Ninety-five percent of students with disabilities \nattend a neighborhood school, and almost two-thirds of those students \nspend at least 80 percent of their day in the regular school \nenvironment. Nearly 350,000 infants and toddlers receive early \nintervention services. More than 6 out of 10 students with disabilities \ngraduate high school with a regular diploma--twice the percentage of 25 \nyears ago. Moreover, approximately half of students with disabilities \nenroll in postsecondary education. We must do our best to continue this \nprogress and make good on our 39-year-old promise because there is \nstill a long way to go. For instance, students with disabilities who \ngraduate from high school have an employment rate that is less than \nhalf the employment rate of the general population.\n  Today, the Federal Government provides about 16 percent of the \nadditional cost of educating a student with a disability, less than \nhalf the 40 percent that Congress committed to when we passed IDEA. In \nthe current fiscal year, this means Federal funding for IDEA is almost \n$24 billion short, which forces states and school districts to make up \nthe federal shortfall at a time when they are cash strapped.\n  The IDEA Full Funding Act will fully fund the federal commitment to \nIDEA by gradually increasing the federal government's share of the \nexcess costs of educating students with disabilities to its committed \nlevel over 10 years. Specifically, this legislation will increase the \nFederal dollars appropriated from $11.5 billion in fiscal year 2014 to \n$35.6 billion in fiscal year 2023.\n  This bill is supported by 34 organizations including: ACCSES, the \nAssociation of Assistive Technology Act Programs, the Autism National \nCommittee, the Autism Society of America, the Council of Parent \nAttorneys\n\n[[Page S5510]]\n\nand Advocates, the Collaboration to Promote Self-Determination, the \nConference of Educational Administrators of Schools and Programs for \nthe Deaf, the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund, the \nEpilepsy Foundation, Easter Seals, the Kentucky Protection and Advocacy \nDivision, the Jonathan Foundation for Children with Learning \nDisabilities, the National Association of School Psychologists, the \nNational Association of State Directors of Special Education, the \nNational Center for Learning Disabilities, the National Center for \nSpecial Education in Charter Schools, the National Down Syndrome \nCongress, the National Down Syndrome Society, the National Disability \nRights Network, Perkins School for the Blind, TASH, the School \nSuperintendents Association, the American Federation of Teachers, the \nAmerican Speech Language Hearing Association, the Association of \nEducational Service Agencies, the Council of Great City Schools, the \nCouncil for Exceptional Children, the National Association of \nElementary School Principals, the National Association of Secondary \nSchool Principals, the National Association of State Directors of \nSpecial Education, the National Education Association, the National \nSchool Boards Association, the National Rural Education Advocacy \nCoalition, and the National Rural Education Association.\n  By making good on our 39-year-old promise, we will supply schools \nwith the necessary funding to enhance the quality and range of services \navailable to students with disabilities. The funding increase will help \nto raise salaries for teachers and related services personnel, thereby \nallowing districts to enhance recruitment and retention high-quality \nstaff. It will support school districts in increasing graduation rates \nand postsecondary enrollment rates of students with disabilities.\n  In these difficult times, it is essential for Congress to provide \nthese revenues without increasing the deficit. The IDEA Full Funding \nAct is fully paid for by increasing income taxes for those with an \nadjusted gross income greater than $1,000,000 per year. This increase \nin funding for schools will have a powerful impact on the lives of \nchildren with disabilities by improving their educational and future \nemployment outcomes.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this long-\noverdue legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself and Ms. Mikulski):\n  S. 2790. A bill to amend the Individuals with Disabilities Education \nAct to permit a prevailing party in an action or proceeding brought to \nenforce the Act to be awarded expert witness fees and certain other \nexpenses; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President: Ensuring that all students, regardless of \nbackground or ability, have access to an education that gives them the \nopportunity to live a successful and fulfilling life has always been a \nmajor focus of my career in public service. To achieve this goal, I \nhave fought hard for students with disabilities to have access to the \ngeneral education curriculum and the services and supports they need to \nsucceed, and to safeguard their rights under the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act, IDEA. That is why I am pleased to \nreintroduce the IDEA Fairness Restoration Act. This critical \nlegislation will remove the financial barrier that families, especially \nlow- and middle-income families, face when they pursue their children's \nrights to the free, appropriate public education they deserve and are \nentitled to under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n  When Congress originally passed IDEA, we recognized the vital \nimportance of parent and school collaboration in special education and \nrequired they jointly develop an Individualized Education Plan, IEP, to \nidentify goals to promote the academic achievement of students with \ndisabilities. Usually, this partnership serves students well. There \nare, however, times when parents believe schools have not fulfilled \ntheir responsibilities to provide an appropriate education to their \nchildren. In these cases, IDEA provides parents the right to challenge \nthe schools through mediation and due process. The educational needs of \nchildren with disabilities can be quite complex and when there is a \ndisagreement between the family and the school it may be necessary for \nexperts to lend their help in determining what interventions and \nsupports are best for the child. For families asking for mediation or a \ndue process hearing, the use of expert services can be costly, ranging \non average from $100 to $300 per hour. In one case, a single mother \nwhose son struggled with dyslexia and written expression disorders had \nto borrow $1,400 to pay an independent evaluator to testify at a \nhearing. She also had to pay for the expert's time spent being cross-\nexamined by the school district for two days. Without access to expert \nwitnesses, families may be unable to make an argument for the \neducational needs of their children.\n  When Congress amended IDEA in 1986, it recognized the financial \nbarriers that parents face in pursuing due process to resolve \ndisagreements with their school and specified in the Conference \nCommittee Report that when the court finds in favor of the parents a \njudge could award attorney's fees, including ``reasonable expenses and \nfees of expert witnesses and the reasonable costs of any test or \nevaluation which is found to be necessary for the preparation of the \nparent or guardian's case.'' For years, parents who prevailed in \njudicial proceedings were awarded these fees, as Congress intended. But \nin 2006, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Arlington Central School \nDistrict v. Murphy that courts could no longer award these fees because \nCongress made its intention explicit in the Conference Report rather \nthan in statute. As a result, many parents are discouraged and even \nprevented from pursuing meritorious cases to secure the rights of their \nchildren. Low- and middle-income families are particularly put at a \ndisadvantage by this ruling.\n  The IDEA Fairness Restoration Act clarifies Congress' express intent \nthat parents should recover expert witness fees, as they currently can \ndo with attorneys' fees, if they prove that the school system has \nwrongfully denied their child an appropriate education as defined by \nIDEA. By including ``reasonable expenses and fees of expert witnesses \nand the reasonable costs of any test or evaluation which is found to be \nnecessary for the preparation of the parent or guardian's case'' and \nreestablishing the right of judges to award such fees to parents who \nprevail in IDEA cases, as Congress intended, this legislation will \nlevel the playing field and restore the ability of low- and middle-\nincome parents to be effective advocates for their children's \neducational needs.\n  This bill is supported by 18 advocacy organizations including: \nACCSES, the Autism National Committee, the Autism Society of America, \nthe Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates, the Conference of \nEducational Administrators of Schools and Programs for the Deaf, \nCollaboration to Promote Self-Determination, the Disability Rights \nEducation and Defense Fund, the Epilepsy Foundation, Easter Seals, the \nKentucky Protection and Advocacy Division, the Jonathan Foundation for \nChildren with Learning Disabilities, Our Children Left Behind, the \nNational Center for Learning Disabilities, the National Center for \nSpecial Education in Charter Schools, the National Down Syndrome \nCongress, the National Down Syndrome Society, the National Disability \nRights Network, and TASH.\n  This legislation is an essential step for protecting the rights of \nstudents with disabilities and ensuring that all families, regardless \nof their financial resources, can advocate for and protect their \nchildren's rights through due process, consistent with Congressional \nintent and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n\n[[Page S5511]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/10/senate-section/article/S5511-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5511-S5512]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n     SENATE RESOLUTION 540--RECOGNIZING SEPTEMBER 15, 2014, AS THE \nINTERNATIONAL DAY OF DEMOCRACY, AFFIRMING THE ROLE OF CIVIL SOCIETY AS \n A CORNERSTONE OF DEMOCRACY, AND ENCOURAGING ALL GOVERNMENTS TO STAND \n   WITH CIVIL SOCIETY IN THE FACE OF MOUNTING RESTRICTIONS ON CIVIL \n                         SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS\n\n  Mr. CARDIN (for himself and Mr. McCain) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 540\n\n       Whereas in 2007, September 15 of each year was established \n     by the United Nations as the International Day of Democracy, \n     a day set aside to review the state of democracy in the \n     world;\n       Whereas democracy is a means of government that makes \n     manifest the free exercise of certain inalienable rights, \n     among them being the freedom of assembly, the freedom of \n     association, the freedom of the press, and the freedom of \n     speech;\n       Whereas democracy allows for participatory governance, \n     mobilizing citizens to strive for their version of the good \n     and instilling hope that the aspirations of the people may \n     one day be realized;\n       Whereas an analysis of 84 independent studies shows that \n     democracy has a favorable impact on the formation of human \n     capital, the rate of inflation, the level of economic \n     freedom, and the stability of political institutions;\n       Whereas democracy promotes tolerance and respect by \n     recognizing the human dignity of all people and is necessary \n     to the full realization of the values enshrined in the \n     Universal Declaration of Human Rights;\n       Whereas the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and \n     Development (OECD) defines ``civil society'' as associations \n     around which society voluntarily organizes itself and which \n     represent a wide range of interests and ties, including \n     community-based organizations, indigenous peoples' \n     organizations, and non-government organizations (NGOs);\n       Whereas a vibrant civil society is an essential element of \n     democratic societies and plays a key role in providing \n     transparency, ensuring the legitimacy of elections, \n     advocating for marginalized groups, and making clear the will \n     of the people;\n       Whereas, since 2012, the International Center for Not-for-\n     Profit Law has identified 69 new restrictive measures in over \n     50 countries hindering the ability of civil society \n     organizations (CSOs) to freely operate;\n       Whereas of the 98 countries for which data is available, \n     research presented in a 2013 article for the Journal of \n     Democracy explains that 12 prohibit and 39 restrict foreign \n     funding of domestic NGOs;\n       Whereas in 2000, the Community of Democracies was founded \n     ``to bring together governments, civil society, and the \n     private sector in the pursuit of a common goal: supporting \n     democratic rules and strengthening democratic norms and \n     institutions around the world'';\n       Whereas in 2011, the United States joined other like-minded \n     governments to establish the ``Lifeline: Embattled Civil \n     Society Organizations Fund'' to provide small grants to CSOs \n     for immediate needs and to support short-term advocacy \n     projects;\n       Whereas, through the Open Government Partnership, 63 \n     countries have committed to protecting the ability of CSOs to \n     operate in a manner that is consistent with the rights to \n     freedom of expression, association, and opinion;\n       Whereas in September 2013, on the sidelines of the United \n     Nations General Assembly, the United States launched a \n     coordinated multilateral effort encouraging countries to \n     stand with civil society and push back against growing \n     restrictions on CSOs;\n       Whereas the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Rights \n     to Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and of Association stands on \n     the front lines of civil society protection, documenting \n     extensive global threats to civil society and strengthening \n     international norms; and\n       Whereas the United States remains committed to its stand \n     with civil society by developing new mechanisms to combat \n     restrictions on civil society and bolster civil society's \n     efforts to support democracy around the world: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of the International Day \n     of Democracy;\n       (2) recognizes the importance of civil society to the \n     healthy development of nations;\n       (3) celebrates the invaluable contributions civil society \n     has made to the creation, strength, and preservation of \n     vibrant democracies and democratic institutions;\n       (4) reaffirms the commitment of the United States to the \n     protection, advancement, health, and sustainability of \n     democracy throughout the world;\n       (5) condemns the use of restrictions, coercion, threats, or \n     force to impede the activities of civil society \n     organizations;\n       (6) recognizes the important multilateral work of the \n     Community of Democracies, the ``Lifeline: Embattled Civil \n     Society Organizations Fund'', the Open Government \n     Partnership, and the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the \n     Rights to Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and of Association to \n     protect global civil society;\n       (7) recognizes the important role diplomacy plays in \n     defending global civil society and creating new openings for \n     civic space;\n       (8) emphasizes the value of programs of the United States \n     Government in protecting civil society and defending civic \n     space, including the work by the Senior Advisor for Civil \n     Society and Emerging Democracies and the Bureau of Democracy, \n     Human Rights, and Labor of the United States Department of \n     State, and the United States Agency for International \n     Development (USAID);\n       (9) calls on private sector partners and other governments \n     to develop new tools and leverage existing technologies to \n     support the efforts of civil society; and\n       (10) encourages the people of the United States and the \n     world to observe the International Day of Democracy, \n     September 15, 2014, with appropriate programs and activities.\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I rise to recognize the important \nrole civil society plays in the promotion of democracy as we observe \nInternational Day of Democracy this September 15.\n  Twenty-five years ago, I stood in Berlin as the wall was coming down. \nI will never forget that moment when the will of the people was finally \nrecognized. It's true that we have seen extraordinary progress over the \nyears. But in too many parts of the globe, basic rights continued to be \ndenied to those fighting for democratic ideals.\n  Today, there is an unprecedented global crackdown on civil society \norganizations seeking to express their voice and exercise their rights. \nWe've seen pervasive restrictions on civil society organizations \nenforced around the globe. Russia, in its worst political crackdown in \npost-Soviet history, has stamped the label of ``foreign agent'' on any \ncivil society organization that receives support from other countries. \nEthiopia's 2009 Charities and Societies Proclamation continues to \nhinder the work of human rights organizations and other civil society \ngroups that receive more than 10 percent of their funding from foreign \norganizations. In 2012, Sudanese security forces violently attacked \ncivil society representatives who were protesting against government \nrestrictions. Egypt has prosecuted over 40 international aid \nimplementers, sentencing them to prison for up to five years. In Laos, \nactivist Sombath Somphone--a leader who dedicated his career to \nexpanding civic space in Laos--has been missing for nearly two years \nafter video footage documented his abduction at a police checkpoint. In \n2013, government harassment in Sri Lanka forced the German Friedrich \nEbert Stiftung Foundation to close its office.\n  The developments that we see today have several notable features. \nFirst, the pushback against democracy is a global phenomenon and \ncountries like Russia have established antidemocratic practices that \nare being emulated elsewhere. Second, global democratic reversals are \nnot merely temporary aberrations but are likely to pose challenges for \nyears to come. Finally, the global response has thus far been \ninadequate to meet these threats.\n  Moreover, democratic achievements cannot be taken for granted. A few \ndays ago, Hungary's National Investigative Office raided the offices of \ntwo organizations which help distribute civil society funds from the \ngovernment of Norway. Thirteen NGOs are currently under investigation \nin Budapest, including the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union, HCLU, the \nlocal office of Transparency International, and the Roma Media Centre. \nThese raids signal further deterioration of good governance, the rule \nof law, and human rights in Hungary.\n  I regret that the Hungarian government is pursuing practices at odds \nwith the historic path to freedom Hungary pursued 25 years ago when \nthat country opened the door for East German refugees and courageously \nhelped pave the way for the end of communism. At a time when we need \nmore democracy in Europe, not less, Hungary's actions are not only \nharmful for democracy in Hungary, they undermine efforts to build \ndemocratic institutions throughout the region.\n  To call attention to widespread infringements upon civil society, I, \nas Chair of the U.S. Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe \nand a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, introduced the \nInternational Day of Democracy resolution. This resolution urges the \nrecognition of the International Day of Democracy,\n\n[[Page S5512]]\n\naffirms the role of civil society as a cornerstone of democracy, and \nencourages all governments to stand with civil society in the face of \nmounting restrictions on civil society organizations.\n  We cannot take success for granted; every day we must work to protect \ndemocratic progress. As we observe the International Day of Democracy \nthis September 15, the international community must push back on these \ngrave threats to civil society as well as protect the efforts by these \norganizations to build strong democratic institutions.\n  I would like to thank my colleagues for joining me in support of the \nInternational Day of Democracy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/10/senate-section/article/S5512-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5512]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 541--RECOGNIZING THE SEVERE THREAT THAT THE EBOLA \n    OUTBREAK IN WEST AFRICA POSES TO POPULATIONS, GOVERNMENTS, AND \n  ECONOMIES ACROSS AFRICA AND, IF NOT PROPERLY CONTAINED, TO REGIONS \n  ACROSS THE GLOBE, AND EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THOSE AFFECTED BY THIS \n                                EPIDEMIC\n\n  Mr. COONS (for himself, Mr. Flake, Mr. Menendez, and Mr. Durbin) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 541\n\n       Whereas Ebola hemorrhagic fever is an extremely infectious \n     virus that causes severe illness with a fatality rate that \n     can well exceed 50 percent;\n       Whereas Ebola is spread through contact with blood, \n     secretions, or other bodily fluids of infected humans and \n     animals and can have an incubation period of up to 21 days;\n       Whereas the Ebola virus first appeared in the Democratic \n     Republic of the Congo in 1976 and has afflicted communities \n     in Africa at least 20 times since then;\n       Whereas the current Ebola outbreak first occurred in \n     February 2014 in forested areas of southeastern Guinea and \n     subsequently spread to Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, and \n     Senegal, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo recently \n     discovered the outbreak of a separate strain of the virus;\n       Whereas this is the first outbreak of Ebola in West Africa \n     and the biggest and most complex to date, due to its \n     emergence in populated, transient border areas, making \n     containment a significant challenge;\n       Whereas, to date, Ebola had infected more than 3,600 people \n     in West Africa and caused almost 2,000 deaths;\n       Whereas the current Ebola outbreak has occurred in \n     countries with some of the weakest health systems in the \n     world facing severe shortages of healthcare workers, \n     laboratories essential for testing and diagnosis, clinics and \n     hospitals required for treatment, and medical supplies and \n     protective gear, such as latex gloves and face masks required \n     to prevent contamination of health facilities;\n       Whereas these weak and inadequate healthcare facilities, a \n     lack of health staff trained in Ebola response, and \n     misconceptions about the virus have resulted in numerous \n     infections of health workers and patients unable to receive \n     appropriate response and care;\n       Whereas effective countermeasures for stemming the spread \n     of Ebola, such as isolation, meticulous infection control \n     practices, case investigation, and contact tracing require \n     more trained personnel and resources than are currently \n     available in West Africa;\n       Whereas, although Ebola can be contained with good public \n     health and burial practices, it continues to spread due to a \n     lack of accurate public information, insufficient treatment \n     facilities, limited local language capacities required for \n     health education, and an unwillingness to allow those \n     infected to be isolated from family members;\n       Whereas governments are collaborating closely with \n     international donors and taking strong measures to contain \n     the virus, including announcing states of emergency and \n     establishing emergency response centers;\n       Whereas the limitations on transportation and travel and \n     closing of businesses have had a devastating economic impact \n     throughout the region and may cause social instability and \n     exacerbate the humanitarian crisis if not properly managed \n     and offset;\n       Whereas the international community has committed to \n     support solutions to the current limitations on air traffic \n     and establish a common operational platform to address acute \n     problems associated with food security, protection, water, \n     sanitation and hygiene, primary and secondary health care, \n     and education, as well as the longer-term recovery effort \n     that will be needed in the face of the complex social \n     consequences of this emergency;\n       Whereas the Governments of the Democratic Republic of the \n     Congo and Uganda have sent experts familiar with such \n     outbreaks to Liberia to assist with the outbreak response, \n     and the Government of Ghana has agreed to serve as the \n     international community's logistics and coordination center \n     and is providing a vital corridor for supplies and personnel;\n       Whereas, after visiting affected communities in West \n     Africa, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director \n     Tom Frieden said on September 2, 2014, ``There is a window of \n     opportunity to tamp this down, but that window is closing . . \n     . we need action now to scale up the response.'';\n       Whereas the United States Government has provided more than \n     $101,400,000 in support through the Centers for Disease \n     Control and Prevention, the United States Agency for \n     International Development, the World Health Organization, and \n     the United States Armed Forces since February 2014;\n       Whereas the United States Government helped to fund the \n     development of the Zmapp biopharmaceutical experimental drug \n     that was given to 2 United States health workers afflicted \n     with the virus and was recently donated to 3 Liberian doctors \n     with encouraging effect and has prompted calls for further \n     research and development of such vaccines;\n       Whereas, on August 5, 2014, the United States Government \n     deployed a multi-agency Disaster Assistance Response Team \n     composed of staff from Federal agencies, including the United \n     States Agency for International Development, the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of Defense, \n     the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Forest \n     Service to coordinate the United States Government's response \n     efforts;\n       Whereas the World Health Organization published on August \n     28, 2014, a roadmap for scaled-up response that aims to stop \n     the virus in 6 to 9 months and calls for 750 international \n     and 12,000 local health workers to contribute to the halt of \n     the Ebola outbreak; and\n       Whereas, earlier this year, the United States Government \n     joined with partner governments, the World Health \n     Organization, other multilateral organizations, and \n     nongovernmental actors to launch the Global Health Security \n     Agenda, a 5-year commitment to prevent, detect, and \n     effectively respond to infectious disease threats such as \n     Ebola: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the severe immediate threat that Ebola poses \n     to populations, governments, and economies in Africa;\n       (2) recognizes that the limited capacity of the initial \n     outbreak countries of Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia to \n     combat the epidemic has been exhausted and the potential \n     threat to regions beyond Africa if this, the largest of all \n     Ebola outbreaks, is not contained;\n       (3) expresses support for those affected by this epidemic \n     and affirms its sympathy for victims of Ebola and their \n     families;\n       (4) supports the Governments of Guinea, Liberia, Sierra \n     Leone, Nigeria, Senegal, and the Democratic Republic of the \n     Congo for their ongoing efforts to combat the Ebola virus in \n     their countries and regionally;\n       (5) urges citizens of affected countries to respect \n     preventative guidelines provided by their governments and \n     medical professionals from Africa and around the world in \n     order to stem the outbreak;\n       (6) supports the work of the Centers for Disease Control \n     and Prevention, the United States Agency for International \n     Development, the Department of Defense, the Department of \n     Health and Human Services, the Department of State, the \n     Forest Service, and other United States Government agencies \n     providing technical, logistical, and material support to \n     address the Ebola crisis in West Africa;\n       (7) encourages deepened United States and international \n     commitments to the global Ebola response;\n       (8) welcomes the delivery of assistance and increased \n     engagement from donors such as the Economic Community of West \n     African States (ECOWAS) and the African Union, the World \n     Bank, the European Union, and the Government of Canada;\n       (9) expresses support for the promotion of investments in \n     global health in order to ensure that governments can better \n     prevent and detect, contain, and eventually eliminate \n     outbreaks of disease while also providing other essential \n     health services;\n       (10) supports the World Health Organization's Ebola \n     Response Roadmap and a common operational platform in \n     response to the crisis;\n       (11) encourages the Governments of Guinea, Liberia, \n     Nigeria, Senegal, and Sierra Leone to work together and with \n     other nations and regional and subregional organizations to \n     establish institutional emergency response systems to more \n     effectively respond to this and future outbreaks of Ebola and \n     other highly infectious diseases;\n       (12) welcomes proactive measures taken by governments in \n     West Africa to formulate national plans of action in response \n     to the crisis; and\n       (13) recognizes the work of thousands of African, United \n     States, and international officials and volunteers on the \n     ground in West Africa, particularly healthcare workers, who \n     are working diligently and at great risk to help address this \n     multidimensional crisis, and encourages other healthcare \n     workers and logisticians to volunteer.\n\n

I thank the Presiding Officer and appreciate the \nopportunity to share some thoughts on an important subject tonight.\n  Earlier this week I spoke about the President's promise that he would \nissue an Executive amnesty, a grant of amnesty to 5 or 6 million people \nby some form of Executive order with his own pen. The planned amnesty \nwould include work permits, photo ID's, and Social Security numbers for \nmillions of people who illegally entered the U.S., illegally overstayed \ntheir visas, or defrauded U.S. immigration authorities.\n  The Senate Democratic Conference has supported and enabled the \nPresident's actions and blocked--so far--every effort to stop it. Not \neven one of our Democratic colleagues has backed the House legislation \nthat would stop this Executive amnesty or demanded that Senator Reid \nbring it up for a vote at least. Every Senate Democrat is therefore the \nPresident's partner in his planned lawless acts. Plainly the President \nmust execute the law that was passed by Congress, and the law does not \nallow for unlawful immigrants to work in the U.S. It doesn't allow for \nmany other things they are suggesting the President may plan to do by \nExecutive order.\n  Tonight I would like to talk about the influence of special interests \non our nation's immigration laws and how it is creating unwise and \nunlawful policies. How did we get to the point where elected officials, \nactivist groups, the ACLU, and global CEOs are openly working to deny \nAmerican workers the immigration protections to which they are legally \nentitled?\n  How did we get to the point where the Democratic Party is prepared to \nnullify and wipe away the immigration laws of the United States of \nAmerica? And we are at that point, colleagues.\n  Just yesterday Majority Leader Reid wrote in a tweet something that \nwas shocking. He said:\n\n       Since House Republicans have failed to act on immigration, \n     I know the President will. When he does, I hope he goes real \n     big.\n\n  That is the majority leader of the Senate. He intends to do nothing \nin the Senate to stop the President's actions. But colleagues, we \nknow better. This body is not run by one man. We don't have a dictator \nin the great Senate. Every Member has a vote. And the only way Senator \nReid could do such a thing to block this Senate from voting in a way \nthat would stop the President's Executive actions is to not support him \nin his plan.\n\n  Every Senator needs to stand up and represent their constituents, not \nbig business, not the ACLU, not activist groups, not political \ninterests but the American interests, the workers' interests. That is \nwhat we need to expect from them, and we don't have but a few weeks, it \nlooks like, to get it done.\n  Let this sink in for a moment. The majority leader of the Senate is \nbragging that he knows the President will circumvent Congress to issue \nExecutive amnesty to millions, and he is encouraging the President to \nensure this amnesty includes as many people as possible. And the White \nHouse has acknowledged that 5 to 6 million is the number they are \nlooking at.\n  Has one Senate Democrat stepped forward to reject Mr. Reid's \nstatement? Has one Senate Democrat stepped forward to say: I support \nthe legislation passed by the House of Representatives that would \nsecure the border and block this Executive amnesty? Have they ever said \nthey support that? Have they ever said: I will do everything in my \npower to see that the House legislation gets a vote in the Senate so \nthe American people can know what is going on? No. All we hear is \nsilence.\n  In effect, the entire Senate Democratic Congress has surrendered the \njobs, wages, and livelihoods of their constituents to a group of \nspecial interests meeting in secret at the White House--what Congress \nhas refused to pass and the American people have rejected. They are \nplotting at the White House--maybe even more so today--to move forward \nwith Executive action anyway, no matter what the people think, no \nmatter what Congress, the people's House, votes on.\n  Politico reports that ``White House officials conducted more than 20 \nmeetings in July and August with legal experts, immigration advocates \nand business leaders to gather ideas on what should be included in the \norder.'' Now that is a quote from Politico. Twenty meetings with legal \nexperts, immigration advocates, and business leaders to gather ideas on \nwhat should be included in the President's order. So who are these so-\ncalled expert advocates and business leaders? They are not the law \nenforcement officers; they are not our ICE officers; they are not our \nBorder Patrol officers; they are not the American working man and \nwoman; they are not unemployed Americans. They weren't in the room. You \ncan be sure of that. Their opinions weren't sought.\n  No, White House officials are meeting with the world's most powerful \ncorporate immigration lobbyists and activists who think Border Patrol \nis for the little people. We know better. The administration is meeting \nwith the elite, the cosmopolitan set who scorn and mock the concerns of \neveryday Americans who are concerned about their schools, jobs, wages, \ncommunities, and hospitals. These great and powerful citizens of the \nworld, we know, don't care much about old fashioned things like \nnational boundaries, national sovereignty, immigration control, let \nalone the constitutional separation of powers or even the consistent \nand even-handed enforcement of plain law, passed by the elected \nrepresentatives of the American people in due fashion.\n  Well, don't you get it? They believe they are always supposed to get \nwhatever it is they want. They are used to that. They spend hundreds of \nmillions of dollars. In fact, one report says they have spent $1.5 \nbillion since 2007 trying to pass their desired immigration bill--$1.5 \nbillion. They think whatever they want is good for America. They tried \nand tried and tried to pass the bill through Congress, but the American \npeople said: No, no, no. So they decided to just go to the President. \nThey decide to go to President Obama, and we will insist that he \nimplement these measures through Executive fiat. And Senate Democrats \nhave apparently said: Well, that is just a wonderful idea. We support \nthat. Just do it. Go big. But, Mr. President, wait a little bit. Wait \nuntil after the election. We don't want the voters to hold us \naccountable for what you are doing. We want to pretend we in the Senate \nhave nothing to do with it.\n  One of the groups that has joined the chorus of special interests \ndemanding Executive action on immigration is FWD.us, run by Facebook \nCEO Mark Zuckerberg. He just turned 30, and I understand he is worth \nabout $28 billion.\n  Mr. Zuckerberg has been very busy recently. One of his fellow \nbillionaires,\n\n[[Page S5520]]\n\nMr. Carlos Slim--maybe the world's richest man--invited Mr. Zuckerberg \ndown to Mexico City to give a speech. What did Mr. Zuckerberg promote \nin his speech? Well, this is a report of it.\n  I guess I will first note that young Mr. Zuckerberg maybe doesn't \nknow there is a deep American tradition--a tradition in most developed \nnations--that you don't go to a foreign capital to criticize your own \ngovernment. I suppose he doesn't know about that. They probably didn't \nteach him about that when he was at one of the elite schools he \nattended.\n  This is what he said in Mexico City:\n\n       We have a strange immigration policy for a nation of \n     immigrants. And it's a policy unfit for today's world.\n\n  Well, the ``masters of the universe'' are very fond of open borders \nas long as these open borders don't extend to their gated compounds and \nfenced-off estates.\n  I have another article from late last fall that was printed in \nBusiness Insider about Mr. Zuckerberg's actions. The headline is ``Mark \nZuckerberg Just Spent More Than $30 Million Buying 4 Neighboring Houses \nFor Privacy.'' The article says:\n\n       Mark Zuckerberg just made an unusual purchase.\n       Well, four purchases.\n       Facebook's billionaire founder bought four homes \n     surrounding his current home near Palo Alto, Mercury News \n     Reports. The houses cost him more than $30 million, including \n     one 2,600 square-foot home that cost $14 million. (His own \n     home is twice as large at 5,000 square-feet and cost half as \n     much.)\n       Larry Page made a similar move a few years ago so he could \n     build a 6,000-square-foot mansion. But Zuckerberg's reason is \n     different. He doesn't want to live in excess, he just wants a \n     little privacy.\n\n  That is a world the average American doesn't live in.\n  So Mr. Zuckerberg, who has become the top spokesman for expanding the \nadmission of foreign workers, championed the Senate immigration bill \nfor which all of our Democratic colleagues voted. One of the things the \nbill did was double the supply of low-wage foreign workers brought into \nthe United States for companies such as Facebook.\n  We have been told for a long time--and most of us have heard this \nrepeatedly--that there is a shortage of STEM and IT workers. STEM \nstands for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. This has \nbeen the central selling point of these massive demands for increases \nin foreign worker programs across the board--programs that bring in \nworkers for every sector in the U.S. economy. But we know otherwise \nfrom the nation's leading academics, people who studied this issue and \nare professionals in it. I have a recent op-ed here from USA TODAY \nwhich reports that there is actually not a shortage but a surplus of \nAmericans who have been trained in the STEM and IT fields and that this \nis why wages have not increased since 1999.\n  If you have a shortage of workers in a field such as information \ntechnology or science and mathematics, wages go up, do they not? If \nwages are not up and are basically down since 1999, I think the case \nfor our free-market friends is pretty clear--we don't have a shortage.\n  So rich high-tech companies are using the H-1B visa program to keep \nwages down and to hire less expensive workers from abroad. Indeed, the \nsame companies demanding more guest workers are laying off American \nworkers in droves.\n  I would like to read some excerpts from that op-ed published in USA \nTODAY. The article was recently co-authored by five of the nation's \nexperts on labor markets and the guest worker program. I think it tells \na story that has not been refuted. We have partisans and advocates who \nhave been claiming there is a shortage in these fields, but the experts \nsay no. And since they have been speaking out on this issue, we have \nseen no real data that would dispute what they say in this article \ndated July 27, 2014.\n  Headline: ``Bill Gates' tech worker fantasy.''\n  Subheadline: ``Silicon Valley has created an imaginary staffing \nshortage.''\n\n       Business executives and politicians endlessly complain that \n     there is a ``shortage'' of qualified Americans and that the \n     U.S. must admit more high-skilled guest workers to fill jobs \n     in STEM fields: science, technology, engineering and math. \n     This claim is echoed by everyone from President Obama and \n     Rupert Murdoch to Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates.\n       Yet within the past month, two odd things occurred: Census \n     reported that only one in four STEM degree holders is in a \n     STEM job, and Microsoft announced plans to downsize its \n     workforce by 18,000 jobs.\n\n  The five writers of this article--referring to themselves--go on to \nsay:\n\n       None of us have been able to find any credible efforts to \n     support the IT industry's assertions of labor shortages.\n\n  The article was written by Ron Hira, Paula Stephan, Hal Salzman, \nMichael Teitelbaum, who has recently written a book on this subject, \nand Norm Matloff. These are labor economic experts who have studied \nthese issues for years. Many of them have testified before Congress. \nThey say:\n\n       None of us have been able to find any credible evidence to \n     support the IT industry's assertions of labor shortages.\n\n  What a statement that is.\n  They go on to write--they all signed this article together--that:\n\n       If a shortage did exist, wages would be rising as companies \n     try to attract scarce workers. Instead, legislation that \n     expanded visas for IT personnel during the 1990s has kept \n     average wages flat over the past 16 years. Indeed, guest \n     workers have become the predominant source of new hires in \n     these fields.\n\n  The `predominate source of new hires' in information technology \nfields is coming through guest worker programs from abroad.\n  They go on to say:\n\n       Those supporting even greater expansion seem to have \n     forgotten about the hundreds and thousands of American high-\n     tech workers who are being shortchanged--by wages stuck at \n     1998 levels, by diminished career prospects and by repeated \n     rounds of layoffs.\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       There is an ample supply of American workers who are \n     willing and qualified to fill high-skill jobs in this \n     country. The only real disagreement is whether the supply is \n     two or three times larger than the demand.\n\n  There is no doubt we have a surplus of IT workers. The question is \nwhether the supply is two or three times as big as the number of job \nopenings.\n  They go on to say:\n\n       Unfortunately, companies are exploiting the large existing \n     flow of guest workers to deny American workers access to STEM \n     careers and middle-class security that should come with them. \n     Imagine, then, how many more Americans would be frozen out of \n     the middle class if politicians and tech moguls succeeded in \n     doubling or tripling the flow of guest workers into STEM \n     occupations.\n\n  That is exactly what the bill before this Senate--the bill the House \nof Representatives rejected--would have done. It would have doubled the \nnumber of guest workers coming into America just to take jobs--coming \nin for the very purpose of taking a job that we need Americans to be \ntaking.\n  The article goes on:\n\n       Another major, yet often overlooked, provision in the \n     pending legislation--\n\n  That is the bill President Obama is pushing for, the Gang of 8 bill\n\n     would grant automatic green cards to any foreign student who \n     earns a graduate degree in a STEM field, based on assertions \n     that foreign graduates of U.S. universities are routinely \n     being forced to leave. Such claims are incompatible with the \n     evidence that such graduates have many paths to stay and \n     work, and indeed the ``stay rates'' for visiting \n     international students are very high and have shown no sign \n     of decline. The most recent study finds that 92 percent of \n     Chinese Ph.D. students stay in America to work after \n     graduation.\n\n  So that just meant we have thousands and thousands of students \ngraduating from schools and being sent home. That is not accurate, \naccording to the experts who study the data.\n  The article continues:\n\n       The tech industry's promotion of expanded temporary visas \n     (such as the H-1B) and green cards is driven by a desire for \n     cheap, young and immobile labor. It is well documented that \n     loopholes enable firms to legally pay H-1Bs below their \n     market value and to continue the widespread age \n     discrimination acknowledged by many in the tech industry.\n\n  I talked to a gentleman whom I knew a little bit who worked at a \ncomputer company. He is well into his forties, maybe close to 50. I \nasked him what kind of security there is. He said, Well, in the tech \nindustry these companies go and fall. I said, What happens if you were \nto lose your job? He said, At my age, it would be very difficult.\n  That was a poignant moment for me. This man, with a family, raising \nchildren, doing the right thing, is worried at his age whether he can \nget a job, when the majority of people being hired in these fields are \nH-1B guest workers.\n  The USA Today op-ed concludes by saying:\n\n\n[[Page S5521]]\n\n\n       IT industry leaders have spent lavishly on lobbying to \n     promote their STEM shortage claims among legislators. The \n     only problem is that the evidence contradicts their self-\n     interested claims.\n\n  I think this is a dramatic article. It is an article by undisputed \nexperts in their field. To my knowledge no one has disputed it. The \nfalse, tech world fantasy claims, the USA Today op-ed referred to, is \nan imaginary shortage, not a real shortage.\n  So I would pose a question to Mr. Zuckerberg, who is a brilliant man \nwith so many fabulous qualities, and I respect that. But I read in the \nnews that Facebook, his company, is now worth more than $200 billion. \nIs that not enough money to hire American workers for a change? Your \ncompany now employs roughly 7,000 people. Let's say you want to expand \nyour workforce 10 percent or hire another 700 workers. Are you claiming \nyou can't find 700 Americans who would take these jobs if you paid a \ngood wage and decent benefits?\n  Let me just say one more thing: Facebook has 7,000 workers. Microsoft \njust laid off 18,000. Why doesn't Mr. Zuckerberg call his friend Mr. \nGates and say: Look, I have to hire a few hundred people; do you have \nany resumes you can send over here? Maybe I will not have to take \nsomebody from a foreign country for a job an unemployed U.S. citizen \nmight take.\n  It is a serious matter. I want to continue to talk about this. There \nis this myth that we have surging employment in the high-tech industry. \nAccording to a recent Reuters report, U.S. employers announced 50,000 \nlayoffs in August of 2013, up 34 percent from the previous month, then \nup 57 percent through August 2012.\n  As Byron York reported, Hewlett-Packard, a high-tech company, laid \noff 29,000 employees in 2012--29,000. In August of 2013, Cisco \nannounced plans to lay off 4,000 workers in addition to the 8,000 cut \nin the last 2 years, and Cisco was right in the White House this summer \nwith a group of other companies demanding more workers from abroad. \nCisco was signing a letter with a bunch of other companies; United \nTechnologies has announced 3,000 layoffs this year; American Express \ncut 5,400 jobs; Procter and Gamble announced 5,700 jobs cut in 2012; T-\nMobile announced plans to lay off 2,250 employees in 2012.\n  The shortage is not there. The experts tell us and the plain facts, \nif we look around, indicate that.\n  But instead FWD.us and other immigration lobbyists are working with \nthe White House to extract Executive orders from the President that \nprovide them with the same financial benefits that were included in the \nSenate bill that was rejected by the House of Representatives. One \nproposal would increase by as much as 800,000 the number of foreign \nworkers admitted for the explicit purpose of taking jobs in the United \nStates.\n  This is an article that talks about that. It is a matter of \nimportance. The Associated Press article, the title of it: ``Obama \nWeighs Broader Move on Legal Immigration.''\n\n       President Barack Obama is considering key changes in the \n     nation's immigration system requested by tech, industry and \n     powerful interest groups--\n\n  Not by the American people was he being requested to do this, not by \nthe national interests but by powerful special interest groups that are \nreferred to here.\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       After recent White House meetings, top officials have \n     compiled specific recommendations from business groups and \n     other advocates.\n\n  ``Other advocates.'' Who are they? We know the ACLU has been there. \nWe know La Raza has been meeting there on a regular basis. It goes on. \nThe article says:\n\n       One of the more popular requests is a change in the way \n     green cards are counted that would essentially free up some \n     800,000 additional visas the first year, advocates say.\n\n  Other requests would extend work permits to the spouses of all \ntemporary H-1B skilled workers who have not been able to work. But how \nabout the fact that a single mom might like that job? An unemployed \nsingle mom or a single mom who has a job prospect that would pay $3 \nmore than the job she is now working while trying to raise a family? Or \nan unemployed father? Maybe they would like those jobs first.\n  So these actions fall on the heels of previous Executive action in \nwhich the President already acted unilaterally earlier this year to \ngrant companies an additional 100,000 guest workers. He has already \ndone that. In just the first year of this order, we added 100,000 guest \nworkers by providing work authorizations to the foreign spouses of \ntemporary guest workers. So he would increase the supply of guest \nworkers by approximately 30,000 each year thereafter--this at a time \nwhen we have 58 million working-age Americans who are not working. \nSince 2009 the number of adults has increased by 13 million, while the \nnumber of people actually working has decreased by 7 million.\n  Median household income has dropped $2,300 since 2009. According to \nthe National Employment Law Project, wages are down across all \noccupations. According to a CBS report titled ``Why American workers \nfeel increasingly poor\":\n\n       Real median hourly wages have declined across low, middle \n     and high income levels from 2009 to 2013, the study found. No \n     matter if workers were in the lowest bracket ($8.84 to $10.85 \n     an hour) or the highest ($31.40 to $86.34) median hourly \n     wages declined when you take into account the impact of \n     inflation.\n\n  It goes on:\n\n       Across all occupations, real median hourly wages slipped \n     3.4 percent since 2009. While even better-paid workers saw \n     median hourly earnings erode, the worst hit segments were at \n     the bottom--\n\n  The people who got hurt the most were at the bottom--\n\n     with declines in their wages of more than 4 percent.\n\n  We have business CEOs, lobbyists, activists, immigration groups, and \nclever politicians who are able to demand that we have to have more \nworkers in America even when we have a decline in wages and a decline \nin jobs. But what does the President do? His administration issues an \nExecutive order to provide foreign spouses--the citizens of other \ncountries, not American citizens--with 100,000 jobs in the United \nStates, precious jobs that many Americans would love to have. How many \nAmerican spouses struggling to support their families would benefit \nfrom one of those jobs? How many single moms would benefit from a \nchance to earn a better paycheck?\n  Our Senate Democratic friends talk about paycheck fairness \nrepeatedly. Yet they are supporting policies that take jobs and wages \ndirectly from American women by the millions.\n  Immigration policy is supposed to serve the national interest and the \npeople of the United States, not the interests of a few activist CEOs \nand the politicians who are catering to them. We have had 40 years of \nmass immigration combined with falling wages, a shrinking workplace, \nand exploding welfare rolls. We know that, don't we, friends and \ncolleagues? It is time for a shift in emphasis. It is time to get our \nown people back to work and our communities out of poverty and our \nschools back on their feet.\n  Harvard professor Dr. George Borjas--probably the leading academic in \nthis entire area and has been for many years--estimates that our \ncurrent immigration rate results in an annual loss of more than $400 \nbillion in wages for Americans competing with immigrant labor. Between \n2000 and today the government issued nearly 30 million visas to \ntemporary foreign workers and permanent immigrants, largely lower \nskilled and lower wage.\n  A recent Reuters poll showed that Americans wish to see record \nimmigration reduced, not increased, by a huge 3-to-1 margin, as the \nGang of 8 bill would have done.\n  Another poll from pollster Kellyanne Conway recently showed that 80 \npercent of Americans think companies should hire from among the \nexisting unemployed rather than bringing in new workers from abroad to \nfill these jobs. Yet Senate Democrats have unanimously supported \nlegislation to double the annual supply of labor brought into the \nUnited States.\n  Some people think this is agricultural work. Not so. The increase in \nimmigration under that bill would be more than 90 percent \nnonagricultural work. These jobs are going to be taken by anyone. So \nwhat about the good, decent and patriotic citizens of our country who \nfight our wars, who obey our laws, who follow our rules, and want a \nbetter future for their children? Should their needs not come first?\n\n[[Page S5522]]\n\n  As the National Review explained, ``we are a nation with an economy--\nnot an economy with a nation.'' We cannot put the parochial demands of \na few powerful CEOs ahead of an entire nation's hopes, dreams, and \naspirations.\n  The basic social contract is that citizens agree to follow the law, \npay their taxes, devote their love and loyalty to their country, and in \nexchange the nation commits to preserve and protect and serve their \ninterests, safeguard their freedom, and return to them in kind their \nfirst allegiance of loyalty.\n  The job of elected officials is to answer to the people who sent them \nto Washington, not to scorn them, not to demean them, not to mock them, \nnot to sell their jobs and dreams to the highest bidder.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/10/senate-section/article/S5522-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5522]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
