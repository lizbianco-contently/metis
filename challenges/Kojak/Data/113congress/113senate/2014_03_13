Over the last couple of weeks I have taken some heat from \nSenate Republicans and conservative pundits for exposing two \nmultibillionaires. These are two oil barons, and they are trying to rig \nthe political system to favor the rich and especially favor themselves.\n  After the 14th statement adverse to me issued by a spokesman for the \nKoch brothers, it seems abundantly clear I have gotten under their \nskin.\n  As the saying goes, from the great Senator Pat Moynihan: ``Everyone \nis entitled to his own opinion, but not to his own facts.''\n  But I had guessed the Koch brothers have been able to buy their facts \nover the years, not paying any attention to whether they are true or \nfalse. This week media outlets from New York, and especially the New \nYork Times, to the Washington Post, to the Detroit News, revealed the \ntruth. The truth is millions in political ads sponsored by these two \nmultibillionaires are misleading at best and outright false in many \ninstances.\n  The truth is the Koch brothers are willing to do anything, even \nexploit Americans suffering from cancer, to advance their campaign of \ndistortion.\n  I am not afraid of the Koch brothers. None of us should be afraid of \nthe Koch brothers. These two multibillionaires can spend millions of \ndollars of their money rigging the political process for their own \nbenefit, but that doesn't mean we have to lie down and take it--because \nwe are not going to. They may believe that whoever has the most money \ngets the most free speech. That is wrong, it is unfair, and it is \nuntrue. I will do whatever it takes to expose their campaign, their \ncampaign to rig\n\n[[Page S1598]]\n\nthe American political system to benefit the wealthy at the expense of \nthe middle class.\n  A number of Republican Senators have rushed over here to defend the \nKoch brothers. That is hard to comprehend, but they have done it. If \nsomeone asked me--and no one has, but I will give my opinion anyway--\nbillionaires seem perfectly capable of defending themselves. They do it \nwith hundreds of millions of dollars. I am sure it has over the past \ncouple of years reached close to $1 billion spreading these falsehoods. \nRemember, they don't just do it under the phony banner of Americans for \nProsperity, they divert money to a lot of other organizations; for \nexample, millions of dollars to the chamber of commerce, which runs ads \nagainst Democratic Senators.\n  They are capable of defending themselves. But when Senate Republican \nSenators rush to defend the Koch brothers, they are also defending the \nKoch brothers' radical philosophy--and it is radical. How do we know it \nis radical? Because they said it is radical. They said so. I am not \nmaking those words up. One of the brothers kept harping on the fact \nthat he had a radical philosophy, and they do.\n  I ask my Republican colleagues in the Senate, is even one--is even \none--willing to stand and disavow the Koch brothers' radical agenda? It \nis radical. It is radical because they say it is radical--and it is \nradical. All we have to do is look at it.\n  Will Senate Republicans reject the Koch brothers' radical plan to \nprivatize Social Security?\n  Will they come to the floor and reject the Koch brothers' radical \nplan to end Medicare as we know it?\n  Will Senate Republicans reject the Koch brothers' radical plan to end \nthe guarantee of affordable, quality, health care and put insurance \ncompanies back in charge so tens of millions of Americans are again one \nheart attack or car accident away from bankruptcy?\n  Will Senate Republicans reject the Koch brothers' radical plan to \nallow insurance companies to deny coverage for a child with a heart \nmurmur, a survivor of breast cancer, a teen who suffers from acne or \nabsolutely anyone with a preexisting condition no matter how minor?\n  Will Senate Republicans reject the Koch brothers' radical plan to \neliminate minimum-wage laws and workplace safety standards? That is \nwhat the Koch brothers want.\n  Will Senate Republicans reject the Koch brothers' radical plan to \ndecimate America's public education system? That is what they want.\n  Will Senate Republicans reject the Koch brothers' radical plan to \nroll back environmental safeguards and give themselves the unfettered \nright to pollute our air and water? We have to look out for our \nchildren and our grandchildren having pure water to drink, good air to \nbreathe--not with the Koch brothers. That isn't what they want.\n  Will Senate Republicans reject the Koch brothers' radical plan to \ngive more tax breaks to the richest of the rich--to profitable oil \ncompanies, corporations who ship jobs overseas, and billionaires who \npay lower taxes than their secretaries?\n  Not one Republican stepped forward, so obviously they must agree with \nthe Koch brothers' radical philosophy. Republicans are willing to \ndefend the Koch brothers on the floor of this Senate, but are they \nwilling to defend the Koch brothers' radical agenda as well? I guess \nthat is what they are doing by coming to the floor.\n  If Republicans don't support the Koch brothers' ``survival of the \nrichest'' philosophy, all they have to do is say so because the truth \nis it will be terrible to allow the Koch brothers to buy Congress and \nto buy our country. And that is what they are trying to do.\n  It would be catastrophic to allow the Koch brothers' Congress to \ndevastate the American middle class with their richest-take-all policy \nagenda.\n  This discussion isn't only about fairness or the democratic way. This \ndiscussion isn't only about the inherent danger in allowing two \nmultibillionaire oil barons to buy America's political system. This is \nalso about how these two multibillionaires would use a political \nsystem, once they have bought it, and how they would abuse it in order \nto add zeros to the bottom line while hurting middle-class families.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/13/senate-section/article/S1598-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I begin this morning by extending my sympathy to \nfamilies of the victims in yesterday's explosion in Harlem. News \nreports suggest a truly tragic loss of life and a lot of injuries, so \nit is a very sad day in New York today.\n  As usual, in a catastrophe such as this, the response from firemen, \npolice, and first responders was both quick and courageous. Many \nordinary citizens who just happened to be in the area showed a lot of \nhumanity and a lot of heroism too.\n  We are grateful for them and we are all hoping and praying for a \nfully speedy recovery for those who were injured. These kinds of tragic \naccidents always take a big toll on the communities where they take \nplace.\n  A few months back there was a horrible house fire in western Kentucky \nthat took the lives of eight children and their mother. It was \ndevastating to the entire community and still is, so we are thinking of \nthem also today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/13/senate-section/article/S1598-3", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1598-S1599]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ANTI-FREE SPEECH\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I wish to take a moment to address anti-free speech \nlegislation the Obama administration has made a priority for this term. \nIt is a regulation that comes in the wake of an unprecedented IRS \nattack on Americans' civil liberties and it represents a direct assault \non the First Amendment.\n  First, let's be clear. This is not some partisan issue. Right across \nthe political spectrum the American people agree this is a terrible \nidea. That is probably why it has generated more public backlash than \nany similar regulation in our entire lifetime.\n  Americans on the left hate it. Americans on the right hate it. \nUnions, business groups, environmentalists, conservatives, the ACLU, \nall of them have expressed concern. It is very rare to see a coalition \nthat broad agree on anything in this town. Yet it is easy to see why \nAmericans would be so united in opposition to this regulation.\n  The First Amendment exists to protect political speech. That was what \nthe Founders had in mind when they wrote First Amendment political \nspeech. The government should be doing everything it can to protect \nthat right, not hurt it.\n  That is why we saw a record number of Americans register their \ncomplaints with the IRS. In fact, there were more than 140,000, \ncomments--140,000 comments--on this regulation, which I hear is the \nhighest number ever received in the agency's entire history. And let's \nnot forget the IRS has a long way to go to regain public trust these \ndays. Too many Americans look at the agency and see an instrument of \npolitical harassment rather than a bureau of tax processors. So if the \nagency wants to regain trust and return to its true mission, then it \nsimply has to get out of the speech regulation business altogether. The \nIRS needs to get out of the speech regulation business altogether, and \nthe Obama administration can do that.\n\n  Look. The administration ran this idea up the flagpole. In the midst \nof a historic crisis of public confidence at the IRS, it decided to \nupend more than half a century of practice and rewrite the rules on how \nAmericans could express themselves, how they could be heard. They asked \nfor comments, and the American people let them know what they thought \nin over 140,000 comments, almost all of them in opposition.\n  This regulation needs to go. This regulation needs to go, and it \nneeds to go now. It is in the administration's power to make that \nhappen. All it has to do is to listen to the American people who are \nspeaking out in record\n\n[[Page S1599]]\n\nnumbers--record numbers--and put an end for good to the idea that the \nlaw should be used to harm political enemies.\n  Let's protect the First Amendment and restore integrity to the IRS at \nthe same time by withdrawing this awful regulation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/13/senate-section/article/S1599-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1599]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         CAPTAIN DAVID I. LYON\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to speak about a U.S. airman \nlost in battle who has left behind a saddened but grateful country. \nCapt. David I. Lyon of Sandpoint, ID, was killed in action on December \n27, 2013, in Kabul, Afghanistan, when his convoy was intentionally and \ndeliberately attacked by the enemy with explosive devices. Captain \nLyon's mission was an advisory one for the Afghan National Army \nCommandos. He was 28 years old.\n  For his service in uniform, Captain Lyon received several medals, \nawards, and decorations, including the Bronze Star, the Purple Heart, \nthe Meritorious Service Medal, the Air Force Combat Action Medal, the \nMeritorious Unit Award, the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award, the Air \nForce Organizational Excellence Award, the Air Force Good Conduct \nMedal, the National Defense Service Medal, the Global War on Terrorism \nService Medal, the Small Arms Expert Marksmanship Ribbon, and the Air \nForce Training Ribbon.\n  As a cadet at the U.S. Air Force Academy, David was a star track and \nfield athlete. As a team captain who is still ranked third all-time in \nacademy history for indoor and outdoor shot put, his teammates gave \nDavid the nickname ``Leonidas''--after the ancient Greek warrior-king \nof Sparta--for his courage against fearful odds.\n  ``Oh captain, my captain, Leonidas, we salute you. You will never be \nforgot,'' says Scott Irving, who was David's assistant coach. David \n``knew the risk he was taking and embraced it without hesitation or \nfear,'' Scott adds. ``That's another Leonidas trait, I would say.''\n  David's wife, Capt. Dana Lyon, is an officer in the U.S. Air Force \nand an Air Force Academy graduate, where she herself was a two-time \nNCAA champion in the javelin throw. Her family hails from Lexington, \nKY, and I had the honor of speaking with them and hearing firsthand \nabout David's service and tragic sacrifice.\n  ``Dave was known as a tender warrior and a protector,'' says Rick \nPounds, Dana's father and David's father-in-law. ``He was lighthearted \nand a gentle giant. Kind and compassionate to everyone he met, Dave's \nsmile would light up a room. If my daughter would have given me the \ntask of `go find me a husband anywhere,' he is who I would have \npicked.''\n  ``Dave loved the principles upon which our country was founded, and \ndied in defense of them,'' Rick continued. ``More importantly, he was a \nfaithful follower of our Lord and savior Jesus Christ, in whom our \nliberty and freedom is derived.''\n  David attended the Air Force Academy, where he graduated in 2008. \nWhile there, he was a 3-year letter winner for the track and field \nteam. He became a Mountain West Conference champion and was named to \nthe National Strength and Conditioning Association All-American Team \nand received the Laura Piper Ironman Award. This award is named for a \n1991 Air Force Academy graduate and former track and field star who was \nkilled in action in Operation Desert Shield in Iraq. David's shot put \nthrow of 57 feet, 11 inches earned him a place in the academy's record \nbooks.\n  ``That gives you a sense of his intensity and his drive and his \ndetermination,'' said Scott Irving. ``When he was team captain, he \nwould get upset with other[s] . . . if they didn't give everything they \ncould give--it bothered him if they didn't try to take their God-given \ntalents to the highest level. That was David, day in and day out.''\n  After graduation from the academy, David excelled in his Air Force \ncareer. Lt. Col. James Lovewell, his former squadron commander, recalls \nhow much David impressed him. ``The consistency of his character showed \nacross many facets of his life,'' Lieutenant Colonel Lovewell says. \n``He was very humble and tireless in serving others. He had a superb \nwork ethic. He was a servant leader--he served people just as much as \nhe led them.''\n  Assigned to the 21st Logistics Readiness Squadron at Peterson Air \nForce Base, Colorado, David was picked over more senior officers to \nbecome the group commander's right-hand man. He worked above and beyond \nwhat was asked of him.\n  ``I joked I was going to start calling him `Boomerang,' because he \nwould come into work and I told him there's nothing more he could do, \nand invariably he would just come back,'' said Lieutenant Colonel \nLovewell. ``He was sticking around to make sure I was taken care of.''\n  David and Dana were both serving their country in Afghanistan at the \nsame time. David worked in logistics, Dana in acquisitions. ``He would \nalways talk about how proud he was of her over there, taking care of \nthe mission, as he was,'' Lieutenant Colonel Lovewell recalls.\n  Just before David's tragic death, the couple were able to have \nChristmas dinner together one final time.\n  ``Every day was always the best day of my life with him, so every day \njust got better,'' Dana said. ``The last 2 days were the best 2 days \nwe've spent together.''\n  Because they were based in Colorado Springs, David and Dana \nmaintained their ties to the Air Force Academy. They coached and \nmentored young athletes, sponsored cadets, and volunteered with the Air \nForce Wounded Warrior Program. They had members of the academy track \nand field team over for meals. David also enjoyed camping, hiking, \nlifting weights, and listening to country music with the windows down \nwith his wife.\n  Dana's brother Eric Pounds is also an Air Force captain and admired \nhis brother-in-law both as a dedicated airman and a beloved member of \nthe family. ``They both loved the Air Force,'' Eric says of his sister \nand brother-in-law. ``They both wanted to fight, and they both wanted \nto protect their country. [David] did that at home, and he did that in \nthe Air Force. He was a protector and a provider, and I'm just really \nproud of him.''\n  We are thinking of David Lyon's beloved ones today, including his \nwife Dana; his parents Bob and Jeannie Lyon; his brother Sean Lyon; his \nparents-in-law Rick and Nancy Pounds; his grandparents Ray and Imogene \nDavis; his step-grandmother Beth Davis; his brothers-in-law Eric Pounds \nand Darren Pounds; and many other beloved family members and friends.\n  It was my honor to speak with the family members of Captain Lyon, \njust as it is an honor for me to share his story with my colleagues in \nthe Senate today. I know we as a nation send our condolences to this \nbrave military family for the loss of such an incredible husband, son, \nfriend, and dedicated airman. I want them to know the Senate has paused \ntoday in memoriam to Capt. David I. Lyon to pay tribute to his life of \nservice and sacrifice half a world away. He will be remembered, and he \nwill be missed by those who knew him and loved him.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/13/senate-section/article/S1599-2", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1599]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The \nPresident will take questions about his health care law, and he is \ngoing to try one more time to convince people across the country that \nhis health care law hasn't really been a complete disaster.\n\n[[Page S1600]]\n\n  It is a little bit ironic that the President will be doing this \ninterview because under his health care law, before we know it, \nhealthcare.gov is going to be linking directly to WebMD. People are \ngoing to have to spend a lot more time on Web sites like that one \nbecause the President's health care law is going to make it tougher for \nmany of them to see a real health care provider.\n  America is facing a looming shortage of doctors, nurses, and \nphysician assistants. When President Obama and Democrats were ramming \nObamaCare through this Congress, they focused on hiring IRS agents--\nagents to force Americans to buy expensive coverage--instead of \ntraining more doctors and nurses to deliver care to patients.\n  Now, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges, we \nare looking at a shortage of 90,000 physicians by the end of this \ndecade. About half of those are family physicians, primary care \nproviders, and about half of them specialists. We see the same numbers, \nif not even higher shortages, in terms of nurses.\n  There is an old proverb: ``Physician, heal thyself.'' Well, \napparently the slogan of ObamaCare is now going to be ``Patient, heal \nthyself.''\n  The old doctor-patient relationship is going to be gone. Medicine as \nwe know it is going to continue to change. Even when you can get time \nwith your doctor, there is going to be a lot more of that time spent \nwith the doctor looking not at you but at a computer screen because of \nthe law, and that is because of the burdensome new rules and the \nrecordkeeping requirements under the law.\n  As more people try to get appointments with fewer doctors, some \nAmericans are going to start seeing actual rationing of care. Here is \nhow one economist described it in a blog post for the New York Times. \nHe talked about the health care law's limits on payments to doctors and \nother providers, and he wrote:\n\n       If patients are lucky, the demand for doctors will be low \n     enough that the limits will not matter. But if the new law \n     results in a significant net increase in physician demand, \n     the payment limits will help remind us of Soviet-era limits \n     on the price of bread, with queues and black markets to \n     follow.\n\n  We know the President's Web site back this past fall was a complete \nfailure. Four days before it was unveiled the President said: Oh, it is \ngoing to be easier to use than Amazon. The rates will be cheaper than \nyour cell phone bill. You will be able to keep your doctor.\n  But the Web site was just the tip of the iceberg. People are seeing \nhigher premiums.\n  It is interesting, Mr. President, as I was putting this together and \nthinking about what remarks I would make, I hadn't even seen this \nmorning's newspaper. Today in the Wall Street Journal--Thursday, March \n13--Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius says: \nHigher premiums likely in 2015.\n  Higher premiums. What did the President promise? He said premiums \nwould go down by $2,500 per family.\n  So the Web site is just the tip of the iceberg. People are seeing \nhigher premiums now, and now the Secretary of HHS says there will be \nhigher premiums again in 2015.\n  People have received notices of cancellation--over 5 million across \nthe country. Many people can't keep their doctor and are worried about \nfraud and identity theft which has been reported as a result of the Web \nsite and is ongoing. Then, of course, there are higher copays and \nhigher deductibles--more money out of patients' pockets.\n  There is a report which brings this additionally to the fore in terms \nof concerns the people are having from people who supported the health \ncare law originally. This report was put out last week by a major labor \nunion discussing how badly this health care law is hurting its members.\n  To put this into perspective, this is a labor union which actually \nsupported then-Senator Obama and endorsed him when he was running for \nPresident a number of years ago, and they supported the health care \nlaw. Now this union has come out with a report which says: The law's \nunintended consequences will hit the average hard-working American \nwhere it hurts--in the wallet.\n  We can go through this report called ``The Irony of ObamaCare Making \nInequality Worse.'' To read from this:\n\n       The ACA threatens the middle class with higher premiums, \n     loss of hours, and a shift to part-time work and less \n     comprehensive coverage.\n\n  It goes on with examples of various individuals who are members of \nthis labor union whose lives are being hurt by the President's health \ncare law. One, a woman from the majority leader's home State, talks \nabout her job as a housekeeper and how, if she tries to buy the Obama \nhealth care program, the Web site says she would have to pay $8,057 a \nyear more to keep the insurance she has now--which is a $3.87 per hour \npay cut for her. She said, ``We work hard for our insurance. Why should \nwe have to take a cut in pay for it?''\n  This is not what the President promised. So it is not a surprise that \neven the unions that had endorsed the President and supported the law \nare unhappy with what they see as the true results of the health care \nlaw.\n  The Democrat majority leader has said all the horror stories about \nthe health care law are untrue. Is he also saying these union leaders \nand the people who have been made reference to in the union report are \nlying? Is this what the majority leader is saying? Is that what he is \nsaying about this woman from his own State?\n  According to the media report, the union said the law ``will \ninevitably lead to the destruction of the health care plans we were \npromised we could keep.''\n  Everybody remembers the President's promises. They remember what the \nPresident said. Everybody remembers the President's statement: ``If you \nlike what you have, you can keep it.'' The press has called it ``The \nLie of the Year.''\n  More than 5 million Americans received cancellation letters from \ntheir insurance companies. It turned out to be so embarrassing that \nPresident Obama had to delay the rules which caused it. It has \ncontinued to be a big problem, so the administration is delaying the \nrule again--not just until after the 2014 election but with the \npotential of going beyond the 2016 election as well.\n  Here we go, dozens of delays. This is a calendar of 2013 and 2014. \nThere are more delays to come--another delay, another lawless ObamaCare \nrewrite.\n  The Obama administration continues to announce delays. We have seen \none change after another to major parts of the law which are now \n``politically inconvenient'' for the President.\n  Republicans warned that these were real problems and that they would \nhurt hardworking Americans all across the country. I was on the floor \nduring all of the debates, talking about the problems to come with the \nhealth care law, offering solutions, offering suggestions--every one of \nthem rejected because Democrats just didn't care.\n  They only cared the second they realized that all their grandiose \nplans were actually causing more problems than they ever anticipated \nbecause they didn't listen.\n  The President had an event last week where he said that the law is \n``working the way it should.'' This is what he said--``working the way \nit should.'' Is it working the way it should after he made all of these \nchanges? Is that what he means--``working the way it should.''\n  So if it is working the way it should, why has the President had to \nchange it so many times? Does he not know what the rest of his \nadministration is doing? Does he not know what the rest of this country \nis seeing? Is the President delusional or is he just in denial?\n  The American people want to know, and they deserve to hear from the \nPresident when he does this WebMD interview. When President Obama sits \ndown to talk with WebMD on Friday, I hope they ask him about all of \nthese delays and the changes he is making to the law. I hope they ask \nhim whether he believes it is really working the way it should, which \nis what he said last week. I hope they ask him about how his health \ncare law is going to reduce the time people get to spend with their \ndoctors--if they can even keep their doctors. I hope they ask him about \nsome of the ways the law is hurting Americans and America.\n  I hope the President answers that he is finally ready to make some of \nthese delays permanent, to start over again, to work in a bipartisan \nway, to try to help patients get the care they need\n\n[[Page S1601]]\n\nfrom a doctor they choose at a lower cost. This is what health care \nreform was supposed to be about in the first place.\n  It is so interesting. Just pick up the papers. Yesterday, March 12, \nthe Washington Post: ``Health Exchange Signups Slowed in Past Month.'' \nThe New York Times: ``Health Care Enrollment Falls Short of Goal, With \nDeadline Approaching. Signing Up for Insurance, But Well Below \nTargets.''\n  Then, so many questions are asked of the White House and the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services. The headline in Politico today: \n``W.H. Playing Dumb on ACA Enrollments, Insurers Say.''\n  I think the President needs to come clean with the American people \nand tell them about what a disaster his health care law has become, how \nit has impacted their lives, how few people have actually been able to \nsign up--or have been able to but have found the cost is too high for \nthem to sign up--and admit to the American people that when they talk \nabout some of these numbers of sign-ups, many of those are people who \ngot cancellation notices. They are not newly-insured individuals.\n  A study out last week shows that only about one in four people who \nhave actually signed up on the Web site didn't have insurance before. \nSo the people this was intended to help are not being helped. Many \npeople are being harmed.\n  It is time to work together to help patients get the care they need \nfrom the doctor they choose at lower costs.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/13/senate-section/article/S1601-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1601-S1602]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             CHILD CARE AND DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, across the country every day millions of \nAmericans are working in low-wage jobs, going back to school to \nincrease their skills in order to pay their bills and take care of \ntheir families. They do their best to balance work and family \nobligations, but too many moms and dads really struggle with the high \ncost of quality, safe childcare.\n  One out of three families with young children earns less than $25,000 \na year, and childcare can cost $4,800 to $16,000 a year. In many parts \nof the country childcare for two children now exceeds average rental \npayments.\n  According to a recent report by Child Care Aware America, in more \nthan half the States--including my own State of Illinois--it costs \nfamilies more to put an infant in childcare than to cover tuition and \nfees in a public college. In many parts of the country, childcare for \nchildren now exceeds average rental payments. Low-income families spend \nalmost half their salaries on childcare. It is a significant part of \nthe family's budget. Child care and development block grant is an \nimportant program that helps low-income working families with the cost \nof childcare and afterschool programs. This program serves more than \n1.6 million children in the United States every month. In Illinois, \nmore than 50,000 children receive support.\n\n  As we learn more about the significance of the first few years in the \nlife of a child's development, it is not enough just to improve access; \nwe have to improve the quality of childcare for young children. \nChildren in their early years are facing some of the most important \nmoments of development, and their experiences in the first few years \ncould literally shape their young lives. Early childhood education \ngives kids the solid foundation they need, not just to kindergarten but \nbeyond. Working parents who don't have good options for quality \nchildcare face an unfair dilemma.\n  Just ask Tabatha Okamoto of Chicago, IL. Tabatha has faced the \nchallenge of finding adequate childcare for her son since he was an \ninfant. On days when she cannot find a spot in a childcare center she \nhopes that maybe a family member or maybe a neighbor will be able to \ntake care of him. She worries about losing her job, and she was almost \nfired because there were so many days she was late because of childcare \nissues.\n  Even when she finds reliable childcare, she still has a tough time \nfiguring out how to pay for it. Tabatha is a good mom, but she has a \nlot of expenses and a low-income job. She pays her rent, health \ninsurance, and other bills and $800 monthly for her son to attend \nLittle Fox Day School in Lincoln Square Center. It would be too much \nfor her to handle on her own. Because of this program being debated on \nthe floor of the Senate, Tabatha's out-of-pocket costs are now between \n$250 and $375 a month for this daycare at Little Fox Day School. It is \nless than half. It is still a sacrifice to come up with $250 to $400 a \nmonth, but at least she has a fighting chance to make sure her son has \ngood daycare. More importantly, this program is giving Tabatha the \npeace of mind to know her son is in the right place when she goes to \nwork every day.\n  It has been more than 20 years since we started this block grant. We \nneed to update it. The grant program before us on the floor today, the \nchild care and development block grant, would make much-needed updates \nto the law, expanding access to toddlers and infants and lower income \nfamilies, strengthening health and safety standards and training, and \nensuring the program is meeting the needs of children with \ndisabilities, and expanding background checks for childcare providers.\n  I want to thank Senators Barbara Mikulski and Tom Harkin, who have \nbeen champions of children and working Americans, for all the work they \nput into this bill. I want to thank Senator Richard Burr on the other \nside of the aisle and Lamar Alexander as well for making this a true \nbipartisan effort.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me today when this bill comes up for a \nvote. This is the kind of bipartisan bill we all should support. \nWorking moms and dads need peace of mind knowing their kids are in a \nsafe place that would help their children develop in the right way.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I take this time to talk about the child \ncare and development block grant bill that is before us and will be \nbefore us soon. I want to congratulate my colleagues, Senator Mikulski \nfor her leadership on this bill, and Senator Harkin, Senator Alexander, \nand Senator Burr. This is truly a bipartisan effort, and we very much \nappreciate the child care and development block grant. It is critically \nimportant.\n  The last time we authorized this program was 1996. I know that very \nwell because I was serving in the House of Representatives at the time \nand had the opportunity to be the ranking member on the Human Resources \nSubcommittee in the Ways and Means Committee that was considering \nwelfare reform and childcare, and how we could reward families for \nwork, and how our welfare system could become a transitional program \nrather than a permanent program that would allow people, particularly \nmoms, to be able to get into the workforce, stay in the workforce and \nclimb up the economic ladder.\n  As part of welfare reform we recognized we had to do things about the \nmajor cost concerns of someone, a mom, giving up her welfare in order \nto go to work. One of those issues was health care. We passed \ntransitional health care for people coming off of cash assistance. We \nalso had to deal with childcare, because childcare is an extremely \ncostly part of being able to get into the workforce.\n  In 1996 we consolidated many programs that were out there. We \ncoordinated eligibility. There were different eligibility rules for \nmany of these programs. We simplified the rules so we could get maximum \ndollars of help for people who entered the workforce. The goal was \nself-sufficiency through education, training, and being able to get a \njob.\n  Today, under the CCDBG, under the Child Care and Development Block \nGrant Program, there are 1.6 million eligible children. It is not just \na safe environment for those children, because 70 percent of their \nparents are working--not just a safe environment,\n\n[[Page S1602]]\n\nit is early childhood education. These children who are in childcare \nwill do better later in life. There have been many studies that verify \nthis.\n  This is a win-win situation, providing a safe environment for \nchildren so their parents can work and educational opportunity for the \nchildren at the same time. It pays off big-time for the workforce. A \nTANF study showed that parents who had their children in childcare for \n2 years or more were more likely to remain in the employment field. So \nit provides stable employment, help for the child, and a win-win \nsituation.\n  The eligibility for the program is it cannot exceed 85 percent of the \nState median income, to give you an idea of the type of people we are \ntalking about who benefit from this program.\n  In Maryland, for a family of two the maximum income is $24,000 and \nfor a family of four the maximum income is $35,000. In my State, \nMaryland, the average cost for childcare for an infant is about $12,000 \na year. For a child over 4 years of age, it is about $9,000 a year.\n  We heard about the income levels and how a family is eligible for \nthis program. It is clear that low-wage families cannot afford \nchildcare on their own. We need to help, and that is what this program \ndoes, so that they can move up the economic ladder and not be a burden \non the cash-assistance program.\n  Today, as we did prior to 1996, we have combined discretionary and \nmandatory programs for our childcare. Today discretionary spending is \nat $2.36 billion and $2.9 billion in mandatory spending.\n  The legislation before us also makes improvements, as it should. It \nallows the States to develop 13 specific health and safety standards, \nsuch as first aid and CPR, and SIDS, sudden infant death syndrome. It \nis keeping our children safer in childcare by having safety standards \nthat are developed. It requires the States to do inspections of \nchildcare centers, comprehensive background checks for those who are \ninvolved in childcare, online information, more transparency in the \nprogram, and additional State flexibility on how they can set \npriorities within the childcare program. That is exactly what \nfederalism should be.\n  The Federal Government establishes a broad policy that we want to see \nfamilies self-sufficient, we want to make sure there is a safe \nenvironment for children, and we want to make sure we do this in a way \nthat is consistent with our national priorities. We also need to give \nflexibility to the State and local governments to be able to set their \npriorities to meet the needs of their citizens, and that is what this \nbill does.\n  I will take a moment now to give real-life examples of how this \nprogram is critically important to our community. A great example is \nthe Judy Centers of Maryland. We have 25 Judy Centers in Maryland. They \nare named after Congressman Steny Hoyer's wife Judy, who died of cancer \nin 1997. Judy was a longtime advocate for quality early childhood \neducation and comprehensive family support services. I knew Judy very \nwell, and she was an incredibly dedicated leader and advocate for our \nchildren.\n  I have a couple of specific examples from the Judy Center as to how \nthe Child Care and Development Block Grant Program is critically \nimportant to their existence. According to the testimony given before a \ncommittee, Judy Center employees discovered a dad who lost his job and \na mom who only worked part time. They could not make ends meet or look \nfor jobs or go on interviews because they had no childcare for their 2- \nand 3-year-old children. The Judy Center enrolled them in KinderCare, a \nchildcare partner, and provided tuition assistance.\n  Since they lost their health insurance when their dad became \nunemployed, they were given an application for the Maryland CHIP \nprogram, the health insurance program. The 3-year-old had a behavioral \nissue and was referred to the Judy Center behavioral specialist, who \nworked with her extensively. She also received tutoring services.\n  Dad is now employed full time. Thanks to safe childcare, dad is now \nemployed full time. After much encouragement, mom enrolled in adult \neducation classes and received her GED. She has also completed a \nmedical assistance program and is now enrolled in the College of \nSouthern Maryland to pursue an associates degree. The children are now \nin elementary school and are doing well in school.\n  I could give many more examples like this family. I could talk about \nmany other success stories that would not have been possible without \nthe Child Care and Development Block Grant Program, and that is why it \nis critically important that we reauthorize the program.\n  I see my colleague from Maryland is on the Senate floor. I \ncongratulate her for her leadership in getting this bill to the floor--\nnot just getting this bill to the floor, which is important, but doing \nit in a way that we can get it passed in the Senate and accomplish our \nobjectives so we can get women into the workforce and have early \nchildhood education to help children succeed in life. We can help \nAmerican families and strengthen America.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, before my colleague leaves the floor, I \nwant to express my appreciation for his statement today and in \nparticular when he spoke about the Judy Center, which has meant so much \nin Maryland to show the way childcare should be addressed. The Judy \nCenter is a family-oriented organization that is focused on children. \nTheir so-called wraparound services help the child not only with all \nthat is necessary in a well-run childcare facility, but they also work \nwith the family, strengthen the family, and help the family by giving \nthem information about other opportunities to improve their life, such \nas educational benefits. I think it is a national model. If I had my \nway, I would like to adopt the Judy Center model throughout America.\n  Again, I thank the Senator for speaking about the Judy Center.\n  I also thank my friend for his steadfast advocacy for children, the \nway he has worked for the children's health program, particularly \nfocusing on the dental services for that little boy Deamonte, the child \nwho died. He is a real fighter.\n  Senator Cardin is also well known for getting rid of lead paint \npoisoning in Maryland. So now he wants the lead out of bureaucracy and \nthe lead out of the Senate. Again, I thank him for his comments.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nbill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/13/senate-section/article/S1602-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1602]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of S. 1086, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1086) to improve the Child Care and Development \n     Block Grant Act of 1990, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Harkin amendment No. 2811, to include rural and remote \n     areas as underserved areas identified in the State plan.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am going to give a recap of where we \nare and then note the absence of a quorum as we sort through our \namendments.\n  This is the second day of the Senate's consideration of S. 1086, the \nchild care and development block grant reauthorization on which 1.5 \nmillion American children depend, including 20,000 children from the \nState of Maryland. We have been working on this bill for over 2 years, \nand now it is our second day of moving this legislation.\n  We have made an impressive amount of progress. Yesterday the Senate \nagreed to nine amendments--three by rollcall vote and six by voice \nvote. We had a great group of bipartisan amendments. Of the nine \namendments that were adopted, three were sponsored by Republicans, two \nwere sponsored by Democrats, and four amendments were bipartisan. The \namendments yesterday improved the underlying bill. They streamlined \nFederal early learning programs; made sure tribes get the funding they \nneed; required States to develop childcare disaster plans; and ensures \nthat CDBG, as it is known, also\n\n[[Page S1603]]\n\nserves an often much-overlooked population--foster care.\n  We also had a healthy debate on the floor in which women Senators \ncame down to show their support for this bipartisan bill. Today we hope \nto continue our due deliberation of amendments.\n  Last night we identified approximately 29 to 30 amendments that \nremain. It is the hope of the chair and ranking member that sometime \ntoday--around 11:30 a.m., before the lunch--we will move to votes. We \nexpect to have voice votes, possibly a rollcall vote, and I will give a \nfurther progress report. The timeline for all amendments is closed. We \nare now sorting through those amendments to see which we can adopt by \nagreement or adopt by a voice vote so we can move ahead.\n  I also say to my colleagues, there are many who have excellent ideas \nabout childcare issues, and some are relevant to children but not \nnecessarily relevant to this bill. As we wrap up the legislation, we \nhope to focus only on germane amendments to the bill today, and those \nother ideas, as meritorious as they are for consideration, that they \neither be withdrawn or find another vehicle for discussion and \nconsideration.\n  We thank our colleagues for the quality of the amendments that have \nbeen brought forth. It shows that the Senate--on both sides of the \naisle--has been thinking about children and has actually been listening \nto this compelling need around childcare and its availability and \naffordability, its safety and helping children get their education. Not \nall of the amendments--although they are focused on children--are \nrelevant to the block grant, which is a voucher program to help low-\nincome women qualify for childcare.\n  I will give further updates as the morning progresses and we sort \nthrough this. In the meantime, we invite Senators to come to the floor \nand talk about this very important topic facing American families.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me begin by commending my colleagues \nSenator Mikulski, Senator Harkin, Senator Alexander, and Senator Burr \nfor their hard work to reauthorize the child care development block \ngrant. This is a modest piece of legislation and I urge my colleagues \nto support it.\n  The main point I wish to briefly make this morning is that even if \nthis modest piece of legislation passes, it will not begin to address \nthe very serious problems we face in childcare in our country and, even \nmore importantly, in childhood poverty.\n  The United States is the wealthiest Nation in the history of the \nworld. Unfortunately, despite our great wealth, we have the most \nunequal distribution of wealth and income of any major country on \nEarth. We have more people today living in poverty than at any time in \nthe history of our country. Most significantly, and related to the \ndiscussion we are having about childcare today, the United States of \nAmerica has, by far, the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major \ncountry on Earth. In my opinion, we have a moral responsibility to \naddress that issue and we should put our energy and our minds to \nfocusing on how we eliminate childhood poverty in America.\n  I will be offering an amendment today which is a very simple \namendment. My amendment says the President of the United States should \nsubmit a plan to Congress which substantially reduces childhood poverty \nover the next 5 years. That is the amendment--that the President of the \nUnited States submit a plan to Congress which substantially reduces \nchildhood poverty over the next 5 years. I hope and expect we would \nhave unanimous support for this amendment.\n  As the Presiding Officer will recall, not too long ago, during the \nWinter Olympics at Sochi, Americans there were shouting out to our \ngreat athletes: ``USA, USA! We are No. 1.'' That was something I think \nmany of us in America supported. We wanted our athletes in the Winter \nOlympics to be No. 1.\n  While we want to be No. 1 in terms of our athletic prowess, while we \nwant to be No. 1 in terms of our scientific and intellectual \naccomplishments, while we want to be No. 1 in terms of economic growth \nand prosperity, we surely do not want to be No. 1 in the world in terms \nof childhood poverty. That is where we are today, with almost 22 \npercent of our kids living in poverty.\n  The reason, quite obviously, we do not want to be No. 1 in terms of \nchildhood poverty is not only the moral issue of turning our backs on \nmillions and millions of our most vulnerable people--kids who are 6 \nmonths old, kids who are 2 years old, kids who are 8 years old; human \nbeings who cannot fend for themselves--it seems to me, as a caring \npeople, we have the moral responsibility to make sure all of our \nchildren receive the basic necessities of life and not live in poverty.\n  I think there is a moral obligation to make sure we eliminate \nchildhood poverty, but there is also an economic reality as well. I \nwill get to that in a minute. But the first point to be made is that \nwhen we look at childhood poverty in America, which is 21.8 percent, we \nshould examine what is going on in other countries.\n  Is it possible to go forward and significantly reduce or eliminate \nchildhood poverty? The answer is yes. All we have to do is look around \nthe world. In Denmark, child poverty is 3.7 percent. In Finland, it is \n3.9 percent; in Norway, it is 5.1 percent; in Iceland, it is 7.1 \npercent; in Austria, 8.2 percent; Sweden, 8.2 percent; Germany, 9.1 \npercent; in South Korea, 9.4 percent; in the United Kingdom, 9.4 \npercent; France, 11 percent; New Zealand, 13 percent; Poland, 13.6 \npercent; Canada, 14 percent. But in the United States of America, the \nchildhood poverty rate is 21.8 percent.\n  As I mentioned a moment ago, this is clearly a moral issue. A \npowerful Nation which, in recent years, has seen huge increases in the \nnumber of millionaires and billionaires, we should not be a society in \nwhich almost one out of four of our kids gets their nutrition from food \nstamps. We should not be a society where a significant number of young \npeople are dropping out of high school, standing out on street corners \nand destroying their lives.\n  This is not just a moral issue; it is an economic issue. My \ncolleagues, please tell me what kind of economic future we have when we \nare competing against countries around the world which are doing a \nbetter job than we are in providing the intellectual and emotional \nsupport their kids need; that are doing a better job than we are in \neducating their young people. How do we compete against these countries \nin the very competitive international global economy? Do we say to the \nyoung children who are living in poverty: Sorry. We can't afford to \nprovide the preschool education you need; we can't afford to provide \nthe childcare your parents need for you, and we are really sorry the \nodds are that many of you may drop out of school and that some of you \nwill end up in jail.\n  We have more people in jail in the United States of America than in \nany other country on Earth. Clearly, one of the reasons for that has to \ndo with the fact that we have the highest rate of childhood poverty in \nthe industrialized world. We pay for these things one way or we pay for \nthem another way. The way we are paying for it is by spending $50,000 \nor $60,000 a year incarcerating huge numbers of people rather than \nmaking sure our kids get the nourishment--intellectual, emotional, \nnutritional--they need in order to do well in life.\n  It is important for us to look at what happens around the world, to \nsee what we can learn, and to see what is working well around the \nworld. It is important for us to learn and to understand that in \ncountries such as Denmark, Finland, and Norway, where childhood poverty \nis very low, childcare is free to all of its workers. Workers in these \ncountries get paid maternity leave. That means when a mom has a baby, \nshe has the opportunity to stay home with her baby during the most \nimportant months of a baby's life and not have to worry about going to \nwork and making a living, because those societies have said the right \nthing--that they want kids and mothers to bond and fathers to bond \nwell, for those kids to do well. In this country, if a person\n\n[[Page S1604]]\n\nis low income and working class and they have a baby, they have to get \nto work right away, because if they don't have that income, how do they \ntake care of their families? Those countries have done the right thing \nand it is important to learn from them.\n  In many countries around the world, workers get allowances from their \ngovernments to take care of their children. Their workers are \nguaranteed a 4-week paid vacation. Health care is a right and not a \nprivilege for their citizens. In France, for example, if both parents \ngo back to work after having a child, they are entitled to receive \nstrong childcare benefits. In Germany--hard for us to believe--but if \nchildren get sick, their parents get up to 25 days of paid leave to \nstay home and take care of those children. These are just a few of the \nmany benefits people in other countries--our competitors--receive. \nMaybe we can learn something from them.\n  Unfortunately, workers in our country--in this great Nation--have \nnone of those benefits. Here is what has happened as a result. More \nthan one in five children in America lives in households that lack \nconsistent access to adequate food because their parents don't make \nenough money. In other words, the number of millionaires and \nbillionaires is growing--more and more income in wealth inequality--and \nmillions and millions of families today who are raising kids are \nwondering how they are going to have enough food on the table to \nprovide basic nutrition to those kids. Should that be happening in the \nUnited States of America?\n  The number of homeless children living in America has gone up by 73 \npercent since 2006. In every State in the country, including my State \nof Vermont, there are families living with their kids in cars or in \nemergency shelters. Is that the way we give kids the opportunity they \nneed to advance in their lives?\n  The psychologists tell us over and over that the most important years \nof a human being's life in terms of intellectual and emotional growth \nare those years between 0 and 4. Yet, in this country today, less than \nhalf of 3- and 4-year-olds are enrolled in preschool. Ninety-six \npercent of infants and toddlers living in low-income families don't \nreceive the early education they need through the early Head Start \nProgram. More than 220,000 American children are currently on waiting \nlists for childcare assistance. And on and on it goes.\n  What does this mean in English? This is what it means. It means in \nVermont, in New Jersey, in Maryland--it means in States all over this \ncountry--a mom and dad wake up in the morning with a 3-year-old and \nthey are worried about the quality and affordability of the childcare \nthey can find for that kid. So they go to work and they are saying, \nwhat is happening? I have to go to work. I can't stay home with my \nchild. We need to make money. Yet, I cannot find quality, affordable \nchildcare for my child. And in this country that is exactly what we \nshould be providing.\n  According to a recent study by the Children's Defense Fund, childhood \npoverty costs this Nation at least $500 billion each and every year in \nextra education, health and criminal justice expenses, and in lost \nproductivity. In other words, rather than learning what other countries \nare doing--investing in our kids, nurturing our kids, making sure our \nkids get the great education they deserve--we turn our backs on \nmillions of kids and then we are shocked--just shocked--that they turn \nto drugs or crime or self-destructive activity, and we spend a fortune \nincarcerating them. Think about all of the intellectual and emotional \ndestruction that takes place in this country because we ignore the \nneeds of our children.\n  We hear our fellow Senators come to the floor and talk about how the \nUnited States is the greatest country on Earth, and I share that \nsentiment. But I do not believe the greatest country on Earth should \nhave, by far, the highest rate of childhood poverty in the \nindustrialized world.\n  The amendment I have offered is a very simple amendment. I hope it is \naccepted. I hope it will be supported unanimously. I hope it will allow \nus to go forward.\n\n  What the amendment says, again, is very simple. It says the President \nof the United States should submit a plan to the Congress which allows \nus to substantially reduce childhood poverty in the next 5 years. That \nis it.\n  With that, I yield the floor and hope very much this amendment is \nadopted. Thank you.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Booker). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, we are in the process of sorting out the \namendments that are pending, again, to see what we could accept by UC, \nwhat we could accept by voice vote, and those that might require a \nrollcall vote. The chairman and the ranking member of the committee, \nSenator Harkin and Senator Alexander, are discussing this, and we are \nlooking forward to some type of votes on or about 11:30 a.m.\n  But I see there are a lot of amendments out here about streamlining \nthis and duplicating this and others--very thoughtful--but I wish to \nclarify exactly what is the Child Care and Development Block Grant \nProgram. This is a program that meets a particular need to help people \nhave access to childcare, and we are strengthening the quality \nrequirements. It does not solve all of the childcare problems in the \nUnited States of America.\n  The overall need of childcare for both poor women and middle-class \nwomen or families is well known. It is one of the agonizing choices \nfamilies need to make.\n  The Child Care and Development Block Grant Program--and this is why \nwe are looking at a variety of other issues. We have on the books the \nchildcare tax credit bill, where many of us hope to expand the \ndeduction. Senator Gillibrand has others. But today we are focusing on \nthe child care and development block grant. It is the primary Federal \ngrant program to provide childcare assistance for working families.\n  It was passed originally in 1990, under George Herbert Walker Bush. \nBefore 1996, there were four childcare programs for low-income \nfamilies. All of them had different eligibility criteria and work \nrequirements--exactly what we have talked about here, the need to \nstreamline. Three were targeted to families in or at risk of being in \nthe welfare system. One was targeted to low-income families outside of \nwelfare.\n  But in 1996 under welfare reform, on a bipartisan basis, we created \none unified program to serve low-income families with one set of \neligibility criteria and work requirements. It was then streamlined. \nThe overarching purpose of the childcare bill in welfare reform was to \ngive parents aid, substantial assistance, so they could go from welfare \nto work or get the training to go to work.\n  It has been a very successful program--a very successful program. One \nand one-half million children in America benefit from it; 20,000 in \nMaryland alone--a substantial waiting list if we had more vouchers.\n  What we are doing in this bill is reauthorizing, following the spirit \nof 1996, streamlining and taking now what we know--new knowledge and \nbest practices of how to help children in childcare be able to be safe, \nhave a sense of security and stability, and then also enhance their \nability to learn. We know now--all the research shows--from infancy to \nage 5 is one of the greatest growth spurts for brain development in a \nperson's life. Vocabulary development and so many other things occur.\n  So what our bill does is help improve that, but we do not so \novermandate to the States that we do not allow for local flexibility. \nSo we are trying to streamline the bill, have a better emphasis on \nquality, without stringent new Federal mandates, and at the same time \nstreamline this legislative process by moving through our amendment \nprocess.\n  I now look forward to conferring with my colleague. Members should \nstay tuned. If they would like to speak on this or the matter of \nchildcare, we welcome them. We have had an open amendment process. We \nhave had an open dialogue. We have had an open floor. I think this has \nbeen very constructive.\n\n[[Page S1605]]\n\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. BURR addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague for \nwithholding on that quorum call.\n  We have made tremendous progress. Our joint staffs worked well into \nthe night with Members who have amendments to this bill that they think \nimprove the bill. We have worked aggressively to try to work out as \nmany of those as we possibly can, and I am here to report to our \ncolleagues we have made tremendous progress. We have processed, since \nwe started yesterday, a number of amendments and this bill has become \nbetter. We still have several on both sides that we are still working \non with our Members to try to accommodate their intent with language \nthat is acceptable and continues to improve this bill, and we will do \nthat.\n  Let me say to our colleagues who still might have amendments, if you \nhave them, we need you to come to the floor. We need you to offer those \namendments. If you have amendments that have yet to be cleared, I would \nurge you to come to the floor and work with Senator Mikulski and myself \nand our staffs to figure out how we can process those in a timely \nfashion.\n  It is our intent that in approximately 1 hour, with agreement from \nour leaders, we would move to votes--both recorded and voice votes--on \nall amendments that remain on this bill in the hopes that Members could \nthen leave to go to their caucus lunches, and after returning from \nthose lunches, hopefully, we would be in a position to have final \npassage on this legislation; again, that is with the chairman's, the \nranking member's, and the leaders' blessings, but that is certainly the \nintent of Senator Mikulski and myself.\n  We can only do that if, in fact, those Members who want to offer \namendments offer them and those who still have some to be worked out \ncome and try to work out those differences.\n  I urge my colleagues now, we have over an hour before we intend to \nmove to a period where we might process the remainder of the \namendments. We would like to be in a situation where we can give \ncertainty--at least as it relates to the disposition of this bill--to \nour Members that we would finish shortly after the lunch. I encourage \nall of our colleagues, if they have interest in this bill, come to the \nfloor. Work with us.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I want to give an update. We had originally thought we \nwould be voting around 11:30. We are going to delay that until on or \nabout 12:15--nothing fixed, nothing mandatory. People have said: Well, \nwhat are you all doing? Look at the Senate floor. Where is the action? \nThis is a compelling issue.\n  Actually, there is a lot of action going on in the sense that we are \nreviewing over 20 amendments that are still outstanding to see what \ncould be accepted by unanimous consent, what could be accepted by a \nvoice vote, and what requires a mandatory rollcall vote. So there is a \nlot of discussion going on, and Senators and their staffs are talking.\n  It is not to be debated; it is to be discussed right now. I think it \nis so healthy. This is one of the first times in a couple of years \nwhere we have had an open amendment process. In some ways we are \ngetting adjusted to how that actually works. This is terrific. So just \nbecause you do not see Senators in intense debate, there are intense \nconversations about how we help children, how to not create new \nbureaucracies, how we have the sense that all this is child focused and \nyet not creating lots of new mandates or whatever.\n  So this has been really very good. I compliment Senator Harkin, who \nis the chair of the full HELP Committee. It is under his leadership \nthat Senator Burr and I held some hearings. His advocacy for children \nis so well known. If we can move this bill today, we will have \naccomplished two major goals. We would have reauthorized the Child Care \nand Development Block Grant Program, made improvements and new reforms, \nand refreshed the program.\n  At the same time I think we have improved the process in the Senate \nto show we can govern by moving bills, by offering amendments, by \ndiscussion and by debate. But we could not have done it had Senator \nHarkin not been willing to establish such a great tone with Senator \nEnzi and Senator Alexander while Senator Burr and I did this.\n  This is the way the Senate ought to be. There were differences. But \ndifferences do not mean that you have to be filled with rancor and \nranting all the time. At the end of day, when all is said and done, \npeople want us to get more done and less said.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, a lot of work has gone into this bill. The \nperson who led that whole work for a 2-year period of time was Senator \nMikulski. I happen to be chair of the committee. But it was Senator \nMikulski and Senator Burr, working together, who really have brought \nthis to fruition. It is a good bill.\n  Senator Alexander always says that our committee probably has the \nbiggest divergence ideologically of any committee in the Senate. Yet we \nhave reported out, I think, 19 bills out of our committee, 10 of which \nhave been signed into law during this Congress. We are able to do that \nbecause people work together. We work things out.\n  That is what has happened with this bill. There are a lot of \ncrosscurrents on this bill. There are a lot of items that Senator \nMikulski would like to have had in the bill, that I would have liked to \nhave had in the bill, and I am sure I can say the same thing for the \nRepublican side.\n  But over a 2-year period of time--I know it has been at least that--\nSenator Mikulski has worked on this. We made our agreements, and we \nworked it out to the point where the bill passed our committee \nunanimously. We have, as I said, a wide divergence of ideological views \non our committee. So, here is a bill that passed unanimously. We will \nhave an open process here of debate, deliberation, and amending.\n  I think at this time we have a pretty defined universe of the \namendments, unless something else pops up that I did not know about.\n  We are working on those. The staffs are working on those now with the \nSenators. With any legislation that comes through, let's face it, as \nSenators we probably would like to change something here or there. I \nunderstand that. I have been in the Senate a long time, and I know I \nhave wanted to add an amendment to something to change it, to do \nsomething different, maybe, that I cared about.\n  But in the interests of the broader perspective of the legislation at \nhand, I didn't offer it. I would wait until some other point in time to \noffer it or perhaps to offer a different pathway. That is what I am \nasking Senators on both sides of the aisle to think about.\n  We have a great bill. It is sorely needed. It updates a law that \nhasn't been changed. I know Senator Mikulski has told us many times, \nand it bears repeating. We have not addressed this since 1996, and a \nlot has changed since 1996 in terms of childcare.\n  This bill updates, modernizes, and does some things that will move us \nahead and better this country in terms of the child care and \ndevelopment block grant program.\n  I know that different people have different ideas, saying: Well, I \nwould like to change this or modify that. I get it; I understand that.\n  But if there is a problem in terms of bringing an amendment up that \nmight jeopardize the bill, I ask Senators to consider whether their \ninterests, whatever it might be, and I am not saying it is not \nlegitimate, but if it upsets the\n\n[[Page S1606]]\n\nbalance we have worked out in this committee with this broad, \nideological spectrum, I ask them to reconsider whether they would want \nto jeopardize this bill, which we are so close to passing. I think we \ncould actually pass this bill this afternoon.\n  I ask Senators, if they have those kinds of amendments, to reconsider \nmaybe the broader implications of this legislation and whether they \nwould want to jeopardize it for their legitimate interests, as I said. \nI don't deny any Senator the right to offer an amendment and to push an \ninterest that he or she might have. Some of them I might agree with. \nBut if it really jeopardizes the bill, then I would have to say, no, I \nwouldn't support it because of the broader interests of getting the \nbill passed.\n  Senator Mikulski and her staff, Senator Alexander, Senator Burr, and \nmy staff, we are working together on this. I still hope we can bring \nthis bill to fruition sometime early this afternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I come to the floor today to thank the bipartisan \nleadership that has brought us to the place where we are considering \nreauthorizing this important child care and development block grant \nbill.\n  In my home State of Washington there is a young woman named Janelle \nwho is a single mom. She lives in southeast Seattle and was looking for \nopportunities to support her family. But before she could go back to \nschool or participate in a job-training program so she could advance \nher career, she had to find affordable childcare for two of her \nchildren.\n  Thankfully, with the assistance of this Child Care and Development \nBlock Grant Program, she was able to get some subsidies to help cover \nthe costs. She now works. She works part-time, and she is attending \nschool and becoming a surgical tech.\n  This Federal grant program expands opportunities to parents such as \nJanelle and so many families across our country by helping them with \nthe cost of childcare. That is why I support this effort to reauthorize \nthe Child Care and Development Block Grant Program.\n  We all know the cost of childcare has soared in recent decades. The \nCensus Bureau found that childcare costs have nearly doubled since the \n1980s, and that high cost hits low-income families especially hard. For \nworking families who live below the poverty line, the cost of childcare \ncan eat up more than 30 percent of their monthly income. For single \nparents, if they only have one income, it is an even bigger burden. \nWhen low-income parents don't have access to reliable and affordable \nchildcare, they can't work. They can't go back to school. They can't \nadvance their skills with job training. They are stuck.\n  That, as we know, is particularly problematic for women. Women are \nmore likely than men to cut back their hours at work or quit their jobs \nall together so they can take care of their children.\n  In the long run, that puts women on an uneven playing field with \ntheir male counterparts, both in terms of earnings and of opportunities \nto advance in the workplace.\n  We have to break down those barriers. We need to make sure that \nworking doesn't become cost prohibitive for parents, and we have to \nstrengthen access for low-income families so they can get affordable, \nquality childcare.\n  This bipartisan Child Care and Development Block Grant Act is part of \nthe solution. These grants expand opportunities for parents with low \nincome. It allows them to work, to go to school or to get job \ntraining--all with the peace of mind that their kids are taken care of \nin a safe childcare center.\n  In 1990 President George H. W. Bush signed this grant program, as we \nknow it, into law. Today it helps 1.6 million kids get childcare.\n  To participate a parent has to have a job or be enrolled in school or \nin a job training program. That has helped countless parents across our \ncountry.\n  I want to mention a woman who has contacted us. She is a single mom \nwhose name is Star. She lives in Skagit County, a rural part of my \nState. She wants to advance her skills to support her family, as so \nmany people do today.\n  With this assistance she is able to go to a community college 1 hour \naway from home, knowing that her kids are OK in a reliable childcare \nprogram. There is nothing more important to a parent than the safety \nand well-being of their child. I have said many times: You do a better \njob at work if you know your kids are safe. If you are worried about \nwhether your kids are OK, you can't do a good job at work. \nReauthorizing this program is a critical part of this, and it helps \nparents such as Star feel comfortable when they are away from their \nkids.\n  In this reauthorization bill we are looking at ways to improve these \ngrants. We know that stability is critically important for a young \nchild's development. But before kids could lose their spot in \nchildcare, if their parents didn't meet the eligibility requirements, \neven temporarily, that disruption in care is exactly what we need to \nwork to avoid.\n  I have seen this a lot in my work on behalf of foster kids, military \nstudents, and homeless children. These are highly mobile populations. \nNow with this legislation and the work that has been done, we have \nensured that these kids have a mandatory 12 months to access that care \nso they don't have that disruption of stability in their lives. That is \ncritically important.\n  This bill also reduces barriers for homeless families to access \nchildcare and will train more childcare providers in identifying and \nserving homeless kids and families so they can get the support they \nneed. I truly appreciate the inclusion of those provisions.\n  For many families it can be very difficult, as we know, to find \nquality childcare. This legislation authorizes a toll-free hotline and \na Web site so parents can get and find good-quality care in their own \ncommunity. Those provisions are why I am such a strong supporter and so \ndelighted we are at the point where we are able to pass this critical \npiece of legislation.\n  Let me end by saying in Washington State there is a young couple \nnamed Edward and Constance. They are struggling to make ends meet on a \nvery low income. They are working, and they are studying to ensure that \ntimes won't always be as tough as they are today. Because of childcare \nassistance with this grant money, Edward now works full time. When \nConstance is not working at her part-time job, she is training to \nbecome a dental assistant. Supporting parents such as this couple, \ngiving them these opportunities to make sure their kids are in a safe, \nquality childcare program is what the grants are about in this program.\n  I urge our colleagues to support this legislation, and again, I thank \nthe Senators who have participated in making this a strong bipartisan \nproposal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from Washington for her comments \nand her leadership in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee, as well. She has been a consistent spokesman for children, \nespecially for homeless children.\n  I want to make an observation about the Child Care and Development \nBlock Grant Program that the Presiding Officer from New Jersey will \nespecially find of interest because of his work with children and \nschools in New Jersey. We have heard this morning a great deal of \nsupport for the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act, which is a \nvery remarkable piece of legislation in terms of the way it is \nstructured, if we think about it.\n  It has been around for about 20 years, but it takes 5 to 6 billion \nFederal dollars each year and gives it to States--a block grant with a \nlot of flexibility. Then the money is distributed as vouchers to \nindividual parents--low-income women, mostly--who then choose among \nthousands of certified childcare centers. That, I would argue, while it \nwas done 20 years ago, fits the Internet age.\n  Newt Gingrich--and I have sometimes accused Newt of being Vesuvian in \nhis qualities because he has such a steady flow of new ideas--has done \nsome very interesting work recently. He quotes a computer programmer \nnamed Tim O'Reilly who made a suggestion for how the Internet could \ntransform government. Mr. O'Reilly said:\n\n       The best way for government to operate is to figure out \n     what kinds of things are\n\n[[Page S1607]]\n\n     enablers of society and make investments in those things. The \n     same way that Apple figured out, ``If we turn the iPhone into \n     a platform, outside developers will bring hundreds of \n     thousands of applications to the table.''\n\n  In a way, the developers of the Child Care and Development Block \nGrant Program in the early 1990s, under the first President Bush, were \nahead of their time because, rather than having a big burdensome \nprogram run from Washington with lots of rules made here, we have a \npiece of legislation that survived for more than two decades and that \nhelps 1.5 million children this year.\n  It enables people such as the mother in Memphis I talked about on the \nfloor yesterday who became eligible for a childcare voucher in \nTennessee. She was at LeMoyne-Owen College studying for her business \ndegree and was able to place her infant in a childcare center of her \nchoice. The State gave her $500 to $600 a month for a voucher--infant \ncare is more expensive. She earned her degree and is now an assistant \nmanager at Walmart. She now has a second child in the same childcare \ncenter--but she can afford to pay for it herself.\n  That is a perfect example of enabling her, using taxpayer money, to \nmove up the economic ladder, to reach the American dream and succeed. \nRather than making her do it or mandating her to do it, we enabled her \nto do it.\n  We also do this--and we have done it very successfully since World \nWar II--with college grants and loans, which also have virtually \nunanimous support in the Senate on both sides of the aisle.\n  Beginning with the GI bill for veterans in 1944, we have given \nvouchers to veterans, and those vouchers follow them to any educational \ninstitution of their choice. At the beginning, many of them went to \nhigh schools. Some of them went to colleges overseas.\n  That was the beginning of our current system of Federal Government \nsupport for grants and loans, and now half of our college students have \na Federal grant or a loan to help pay for college. All of those grants \nand loans follow them to the institution of their choice. That is a lot \nof money. It is over $100 billion in loans--new loans--every year. It \nis $33 billion in Pell grants each year.\n  We followed Tim O'Reilly's suggestion there as well. We haven't set \nup a lot of complicated Washington programs and managers. We have \nsimply said this. If you are eligible and go to an accredited \ninstitution--whether it is public, private, for-profit, nonprofit, \nYeshiva, Notre Dame or Rutgers--the money will follow you to the \ncollege of your choice. That is what we have done since World War II \nwith college students--and since the era of George Walker Bush, with \nchildren--we have given them tickets to the institutions of their \nchoice.\n  But what have we done in the middle? We have vouchers for college \nstudents and vouchers for very young children, but what about students \nwho go to elementary school? And what about students who go to high \nschool? Especially, what about students who are low-income students who \nare trapped in failing schools? Our childcare vouchers are for low-\nincome parents, mainly women. Our vouchers for college students are for \nlow-income students. We call those Pell grants. But we give our K-12 \nmoney to the schools instead of allowing it to follow students to the \nschools of their choice.\n\n  I have always wondered, if we have had such success with the GI bill \nand the Pell grant and the student loan and the childcare voucher, why \ndon't we try it with kindergarten through the 12th grade? Many \nenterprising mayors and Governors have tried that, usually facing a lot \nof resistance from people who see something un-American about vouchers. \nIt is not very un-American if it is the GI bill, not very un-American \nif it is a Pell grant, not very un-American if it is a childcare \nvoucher, but something somehow is wrong with it if you are in third \ngrade or the seventh grade or the ninth grade.\n  So I have introduced something called Scholarships for Kids, which is \nalmost like the child care development block grant for students who are \nin elementary and secondary schools. It would take 80 Federal education \nprograms that spend about $24 billion a year and say to New Jersey or \nTennessee or Iowa: You can take all that money, whatever your share of \nthat is, and create a $2,100 scholarship for every single child in your \nState below the Federal poverty level, and it can follow that child to \nwhatever school in your State the child attends.\n  If you live in a city or a State where you want the child to be able \nto go to any accredited institution, public or private, the way we do \nwith Pell grants, you may do that. If you believe that Federal dollars \nfor elementary and secondary schools should only go to public schools, \nyou may do that. You may design the program however you want to do it \nin your State. But the idea would be that we would enable low-income \nchildren, the ones who are below the Federal poverty level--and there \nare 11 million of those in our country--we would allow you to pin \n$2,100 to their shirt to follow that child to school. I think we know \nwhat would happen if we were to do that. Those children may need to be \nin school longer each day. They may need a meal. They may need to be \nthere during vacation time. They may need to be there in the summer. \nAnd if the teacher has the extra money and the freedom to use it, that \ngives that school more autonomy and that helps that child succeed.\n  Does every school succeed at the same rate? No. Not every college \nsucceeds at the same rate. Not every childcare center succeeds at the \nsame rate. But if we have 70 years of experience with colleges of \ncreating autonomy and choice and letting the money follow the students \nto the school--and people all around the world tell us we have the best \nsystem of colleges in the world--why don't we try it with our schools?\n  I see the Senator from Oklahoma, and I will wind down so he can wind \nup. I thank him for his contribution to the debate.\n  While we are in the middle of so much testimony about what a great \nthing the child care development block grant is--vouchers to little \nchildren who are poor--and while we all believe Pell grants are a great \nidea--vouchers to college students who are low income--should we not \nthink about doing exactly the same thing with elementary and secondary \nschool students as a way to help them succeed? And not as a Federal \nmandate but simply giving Governors and State legislators and educators \nthe opportunity to say: Give us that share of our $24 billion. Give \nevery one of our children who is below the Federal poverty level $2,100 \neach and let us decide how it follows them to the school they attend.\n  So I wanted to make that observation. And I am delighted to know the \nSenator from New Jersey is presiding today because of the work he has \ndone in his State in that area.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Oklahoma wish to speak?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Oh, I am sorry, I thought the Senator from Oklahoma was \ninvolved in a conversation with the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. COBURN. I was, but I would like to speak, if I might.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. No way we want to inhibit the Senator's ability to \nspeak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I was going to call up amendment No. 2829, \nbut I have chosen not to do that because of the plan of the manager of \nthe bill to table it. So I will talk about what it is and make a few \nobservations.\n  Four years ago we got the GAO to start a process on duplication, to \nlook at what we are doing in a multitude of areas across the whole \nFederal Government. That will be finished, and for the first time it \nwill have taken a complete look. We will see it at the end of this \nmonth, the first part of the fourth report.\n  One of their findings was, according to early learning and childcare \nprograms, within 8 different departments there are 45 separate \nprograms--8 different departments within the administration, 45 \nseparate programs, spending $16 billion a year. So the amendment I was \ngoing to offer would have forced us to do the metrics to look at what \nour outcomes are. It would have forced us to consolidate programs, \nother than major programs such as this one we are debating today, which \nhas been markedly improved and enhanced.\n\n[[Page S1608]]\n\n  Now, I don't want to put the Senate through a timely vote when I know \nwhat the outcome is going to be, so I won't call up that amendment. But \nI would remind my colleagues that the only way we are really ever going \nto get control of our budget is to do the hard work of eliminating \nduplication, so that when we have a program, such as the one the \nmanager of the bill has on the floor today, it is really directed, it \nis focused, it has metrics, and we know what we are getting for what we \nare spending.\n  Most people don't realize we have 45 of these programs in 8 different \ndepartments spending $16 billion a year.\n  So I hope we will consider that this is a great movement on this one \nparticular bill, and I congratulate the people who worked on it--\nSenator Harkin and his staff, Senators Burr and Alexander and their \nstaff--because I think they have done a good job. But it is not enough \nbecause we are still going to have 44 other programs and we are still \ngoing to have programs that don't have a metric on them. We are \nspending money on them, and we don't know if they are accomplishing \nwhat we want them to accomplish.\n  The whole purpose of the amendment was to force us to do that. I \nunderstand that is not going to move, and I am fine with that. I will \nwork in every other way behind the scenes to try to accomplish the same \npurpose.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COBURN. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. HARKIN. First of all, I just want to say--and I mentioned it on \nthe floor the other day--that I spent this weekend in Iowa at two early \nlearning centers, and what became clear to me was the number of \ndifferent conduits of funding and the different programs, \nqualifications, requirements, and paperwork.\n  I said at the time: I am confused.\n  The man at the center said: If you think you are confused, how do you \nthink we feel about it?\n  That is why I was very supportive of the amendment offered by Senator \nEnzi. The Enzi amendment was a mandate on HHS, I believe, to take a \nlook at all of these things and have a report back within a certain \namount of time--I think it was 1 year--on how we can better coordinate \nthese.\n  I agree with the Senator. There are way too many conduits into \nchildcare, and it is horribly confusing, and there are all these \ndifferent requirements that overlap, and this just causes confusion.\n  I wanted to ask the Senator if he had looked at the Enzi amendment, \nwhich gives us some time, and I can assure the Senator that our \ncommittee--and I am sure I can speak for Senator Burr on this on the \nRepublican side--will be riding herd on this because I think we all \nagree with the Senator from Oklahoma that it has to be fixed.\n  Mr. COBURN. To answer the Senator's question, I supported the Enzi \namendment. I don't think it went far enough because you are not going \nto look at some of the programs that are outside the purview of the \nSenator's committee. We have eight different Federal departments \nrunning these programs. They come from eight different sets of \nauthorizations.\n  So the point is that I am going to work behind the scenes with \nSenator Burr and with Senator Harkin to try to accomplish this.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2830\n\n  Now I would like to call up amendment No. 2830 and ask unanimous \nconsent to set aside the pending amendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Will the Senator yield to me before he offers his \namendment?\n  Mr. COBURN. Yes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Well, actually, I want to comment on how I want to work \ntogether with the Senator. Go ahead and offer the amendment, and then I \nwould like to comment and not engage in klutzy conversation by asking \nquestions. I think we are on the same broadband.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending amendment?\n  Hearing no objection, the clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposed an \n     amendment numbered 2830.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be considered \nas read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. The desk has a modification of that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  Hearing no objection, the amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2830), as modified, is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To establish a $1,000,000 asset limit for eligibility for \n                         child care assistance)\n\n       On page 138, line 8, insert ``, and whose family assets do \n     not exceed $1,000,000 (as certified by a member of such \n     family)'' after ``size''.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, what we are trying to accomplish with this \namendment--and I have cleared it on our side, and I think it is being \ncleared on the other side as well--is to make sure the significant \namount of money we spend in this area goes to people who really need \nit. So all this amendment does is require a self-certification when an \nindividual acquires one of these grants that they don't have real \nassets greater than $1 million. If they do, maybe they should be \nspending their money rather than taxpayers' money on their kids' \nchildcare.\n  That is all this amendment does. All we have done is to put in there, \nin the application process, a box they have to check that says: I don't \nhave real assets in excess of $1 million. This will ensure that we know \nthat at least the vast majority--and by the way, 16 percent of this \nmoney has gone to people who are very wealthy, in terms of these \nvouchers. I have that data. I don't have it with me. Actually, I may \nhave it with me, and I will pull it up and speak about that in a \nminute.\n  But the fact is we want this money to help the people who need help, \nnot to help people who don't need the help. So that is the purpose of \nthis amendment. I have agreed, if it becomes acceptable, to have a \nvoice vote.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Before the Senator from Oklahoma leaves the floor and \nwe proceed to a voice vote, et cetera, I wish to thank him for his \nsteadfast advocacy in getting more value out of the taxpayers' dollar \nfor the taxpayers' contribution to the Federal Treasury. He has been a \nwell-known advocate for the consolidation and streamlining of existing \nprograms, and I salute him for that.\n  Going back to 1996, we actually started this with streamlining \nchildcare bills. In 1996, because I was here during the welfare reform \ndebate and passage, we had four different childcare bills, with four \ndifferent eligibility requirements, with four different levels of \nbureaucracy. So the money was going into the bureaucracy's determining \neligibility rather than into childcare. In the 1996 welfare reform \nbill, we consolidated so that we have the child care and development \nblock grant. That is how we got to where we are.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma talks about how he has data that cuts \nacross eight different Federal agencies. I pledge to him, as the chair \nof the Appropriations Committee, to actually sit down and look at this \ndata, to put our heads together. And really, with money as tight as it \nis, the stringent budgets we are under, particularly when it comes to \nfunding the kinds of compelling human needs that are in health and \nhuman services and education, we want to get more value for the dollar. \nWe don't want to get more bureaucracy for the dollar.\n  So I say to the Senator from Oklahoma that we appreciate his \nwithdrawing his amendment. We know the Senator from Wyoming Mr. Enzi \nhas offered an amendment to get a report as well. But as we look at our \nappropriations for this year, I invite my colleague, with the greatest \nsincerity--and I pledge to him my word as a Senator--to sit down and \nreview these documents and see how we can put this suggestion he has \ninto action. I look forward to it, and, quite frankly, I am eager to \nsee what we can get done.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I wish to join in. One, as the Senator \nfrom Maryland said, I recognize he has been out front in trying to get \nvalue for the taxpayers' dollar; and, second, he is working in a \ncooperative way to help us get a result. Those are two\n\n[[Page S1609]]\n\ngreat characteristics in a body of 100 people which operates by \nunanimous consent. So I am grateful for that.\n  On the first point, I completely agree with him on the early \nchildhood money. We have about $18 billion from various streams of \nFederal dollars aimed at children below 5 or 6; then we have State \ndollars; then we have local dollars; then we have private dollars. We \nhave grappled with ways to try to make sure we spend that money more \neffectively. One way is to emphasize centers of excellence, like \nOklahoma City, Nashville, or Jersey City, where they try to put all \nthat money together.\n  But I am committed to work with Senator Harkin and Senator Mikulski \nto take the research which Senator Coburn has done and see if we can \nconsolidate, streamline, and get more value for early childhood.\n  Second, he has called attention to a problem which I would appreciate \nhis help in solving with his ``Millionaires' Amendment,'' which I think \nwe will be voting on in a little while. Let me give an example, if I \nmay.\n  The application form students fill out for Federal grants and loans \nto attend college is ridiculous. If I had it in my hand and held it up \nhere, it would go from up here all the way to the floor. It is 100 \nquestions. We had testimony in our committee that if we just answered \ntwo questions, in 95 percent of the cases it would be accurate. One: \nWhat was your family income 2 years ago? And, two: How many people are \nin your family? But the other 5 percent is the problem, because there \ncould be abuse of the kind the Senator is talking about here.\n  What I would like to do--and I think others here would like to do--is \nto simplify the application form for Federal grants and loans, but do \nit in such a way we make sure the money goes where it is supposed to \ngo. When there are 100 complicated questions to fill out, it \ndiscourages a lot of low-income people from going to college who we \nhope would, and it wastes time and money of administrators and \nfamilies. Many of these families are not families with college degrees \nand accountants to help them fill out these long forms.\n  So we need the Senator from Oklahoma's help when we get to that \ndiscussion, sometime, of: How do we simplify the form of application \nfor Federal grants and loans? And, with the 5 percent which remains, \nhow do we narrow that down to 4, 3, 2, 1, to make sure almost all the \nmoney we are appropriating goes where it is supposed to go?\n  I salute him for both amendments. I look forward to supporting his \namendment on the child care block grants, and hope it is a first step \nfor dealing with the misapplication of Federal dollars aimed to help \npeople move up the economic ladder.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, if I could have the attention of Senator \nAlexander and Senator Burr. I am about to propose a unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 12:15 \np.m. today, the Senate proceed to votes in relation to the following \namendments in the order listed: Coburn No. 2830, as modified; Portman \nNo. 2827; Tester No. 2834; Thune No. 2838; Warren No. 2842; Bennet No. \n2839, as modified; further, that no second-degree amendments be in \norder to any of these amendments prior to the votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. For the information of all Senators, it is our \nunderstanding we will need one roll call vote in this sequence and the \nremaining amendments can be disposed of by voice vote.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the pending \namendments be set aside and the following amendments be made pending: \nPortman No. 2827; Tester No. 2834; Thune No. 2838; Warren No. 2842; and \nBennet No. 2839, as modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I realize the Senator is trying to move through this \nvery important bill on the floor, which I fully support and thank him \nfor the amendment.\n  Does the Senator know what the action of the Senate will be once this \nbill is completed? And is the intention to do final passage of this \nbill today?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend I am hopeful we will have final \npassage today. We are working through it. We are down to just a couple \nof amendments. I haven't seen any others pop up right now. So I am \nhopeful we will have this series of votes, people will go to lunch, we \nwill come back, and hopefully we will dispose of maybe a couple more \namendments and then we will have final passage.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. So final passage could potentially be--is it the \nSenator's understanding through the Chair--about 3 or so?\n  Mr. HARKIN. If we don't have any kind of extended debate on the \nfloor, I would say probably at least by 3, I would hope we would be \nfinished. If we work out agreement on a couple amendments, we might be \ndone before that.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Without objection, the clerk will report the amendments, en bloc.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin] proposes amendments \n     numbered 2827, 2834, 2838, 2842, and 2839, as modified.\n\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 2827\n\n (Purpose: To provide for evidence-based training that promotes early \n                   language and literacy development)\n\n       On page 78, line 9, insert ``and early language and \n     literacy development'' after ``readiness''.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 2834\n\n(Purpose: To permit the Secretary of Health and Human Services to waive \n   the prohibition on the use of amounts by Indian tribes and tribal \n organizations for construction or renovation of facilities for child \n  care programs if the use will result in an increase of the level of \n                          child care services)\n\n       On page 136, strike line 16 and all that follows through \n     page 137, line 7, and insert the following:\n       (2) in subsection (c)--\n       (A) in paragraph (2), by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(D) Licensing and standards.--In lieu of any licensing \n     and regulatory requirements applicable under State or local \n     law, the Secretary, in consultation with Indian tribes and \n     tribal organizations, shall develop minimum child care \n     standards that shall be applicable to Indian tribes and \n     tribal organizations receiving assistance under this \n     subchapter.

I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2827\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I rise today to thank my colleagues for \nadopting a moment ago an important amendment to this underlying bill. \nIt is an amendment to provide for evidence-based training in efforts \nthat promote early language development and literacy development. This \nis really important for kids to get them ready for kindergarten, and, \nagain, I appreciate the fact that on a voice vote that was adopted \nearlier this afternoon.\n  Madam President, I now rise to urge the Senate to support a child \nsafety amendment I have submitted to the child development block grant \nbill. I thank Senator Alexander, Senator Burr, Senator Mikulski, and \nSenator Harkin for all their help on this amendment. I appreciate their \nworking with us.\n  I like the underlying legislation. It is a good bill because it goes \na long way to ensuring that our Federal dollars are spent in a way that \ndoes keep our children in safe learning environments and care \nfacilities. I believe my amendment makes a good bill even better.\n  Currently, this legislation prohibits individuals who have been \nconvicted of a felony from working in a childcare facility that is \nfunded through these Federal block grants. That is a good start, but by \nlimiting the prohibition only to felonies, we are leaving other people \nout. We are leaving a pool of individuals who have been convicted of \ncrimes against children eligible for employment in a setting where they \ncould prey on vulnerable kids.\n  So the amendment simply expands to ensure that we are covering those \npeople. It ensures the health and safety of children by clarifying that \nadults who are convicted of misdemeanor violent crimes against \nchildren--child abuse, child endangerment, sexual assault--or of a \nmisdemeanor involving child pornography are also identified in criminal \nbackground checks and are not permitted to work in a childcare facility \nthat receives support through these child care development block \ngrants.\n  Let me give a couple examples of crimes that under the bill as \ncurrently drafted would not prevent an individual from working in a \nchildcare facility funded by the legislation.\n  In my home State of Ohio, we just had a terrible example. An Ohio \ndaycare worker was accused of sprinkling drugs on snacks to get \nchildren to sleep. She was fined $250 and then had her charges reduced \nto a misdemeanor count of child endangerment after a plea agreement. So \nshe did not get charged with a felony in the end because she pled it \ndown to a misdemeanor. But certainly you do not want someone like this \nworking in one of these facilities.\n  There are lots of other examples.\n  A Utah women pled guilty to two class A misdemeanors recently for \nchild abuse. These charges were reduced from five second-degree \nfelonies for intentionally inflicting serious physical injury on a \nchild. She had been arrested for physically and emotionally abusing her \ndaughter. According to the police report, she hit her daughter with a \nclosed fist and choked her. But she pled, again, guilty to two \nmisdemeanors because of the plea agreement.\n  These are just a couple cases. There are many more, and these are \njust ones that have been decided in the last few months.\n  Under the legislation as currently written, these individuals would \nbe eligible to work in a childcare facility that receives Federal \nfunds.\n  This amendment is very simple. It only seeks to protect children and \nto bar individuals who would commit crimes against the most vulnerable \namong us from receiving these Federal tax dollars. I urge my colleagues \nto accept the amendment.\n  Again, I thank the authors of the underlying bill for working closely \nwith us on this amendment to improve legislation that is already a good \nand is doing a lot to protect our kids.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, as we talk today about passing new laws, \nI would like to take a few minutes to talk about enforcing the laws the \nCongress has already passed.\n  I want to talk today about something that I believe has been pushed \nto the wayside too many times by the current administration, and that \nwould be the Constitution of the United States.\n  Article II, section 3 of the U.S. Constitution declares that the \nPresident--\n\n[[Page S1612]]\n\ncoming right out of the Constitution--that the President ``shall take \ncare that the laws be faithfully executed.'' Simply put, constitutional \nrequirements are just that--they are constitutional requirements. They \nare not constitutional suggestions. This is not something the \nConstitution does not clearly define. The branches of government in the \nConstitution are the judicial, the legislative, and the executive. And \nthe job of the executive is, again, to do what? To ``take care that the \nlaws be faithfully executed.''\n  Yet time and again President Obama has refused to enforce the law and \nshown a willingness, frankly, to misuse regulations, in my view, to \nsidestep the Congress, to sidestep what the law intended to do and, \nmore importantly, to step around the Constitution. Whether it is \nissuing waivers to States from the work requirements contained in the \nbipartisan Welfare Reform Act of 1996 or announcing yet another \nchange--and we are now at over two dozen changes and delays--in the \nPresident's own health care law, the current administration has sought \nways, over and over again, to circumvent the Congress by picking and \nchoosing which laws it wants to enforce--clearly not a power given the \nPresident in the Constitution.\n  In fact, there is a reason the legislative branch is article I of the \nConstitution. Because the Founders clearly saw the legislative branch \nas the branch that would determine the direction of the country, and \nthe President's job was not to write the law, the President's job was \nto execute the law, to enforce the law.\n  People all over America are rightly concerned about government \noverreach. They are rightly concerned about government dysfunction. \nThey are rightly concerned about a Senate that has not brought the \nappropriations bills to the floor the way they should come to the floor \nfor over 7 years now, so we are not debating our priorities.\n  But it is the overreach, the dysfunction, the lack of compliance with \nthe law and the seeming belief that somehow that is the President's \njob, to decide which laws we comply with as a country and which ones we \ndo not, which laws the government enforces and which ones it does not \nenforce. That is not the President's job.\n  I introduced a bill this week to stop this overreach and to force \nPresident Obama to uphold the Constitution. The ENFORCE the Law Act, \nwhich is cosponsored by more than half of my Republican Senate \ncolleagues, and which passed the House yesterday, permits Congress to \nauthorize a lawsuit against the President if he fails to uphold the \nconstitutional obligation to uphold the law.\n  Whenever we are asked, all of us as Members of the Senate, by people \nthat we work for: How can the President decide he is not going to \nenforce the law, one of the responses we all have thoughtfully given to \nthe other question of: What are you going to do about it, is at this \npoint there is no standing of individual Members of Congress or even \nthe entire body of the Senate or the body of the House to go to court \nand say: We have standing in court to have this law enforced.\n  This bill would become law, and a law that would give the Congress \nthat standing. It effectively permits the Congress, either House of the \nCongress, to authorize a lawsuit against the President if he fails to \nuphold his constitutional obligation to faithfully execute the law.\n  If the President has a defense, this is a lawsuit. His side can go to \ncourt and defend that. But if he does not have a defense, he has sworn, \nas we have, to uphold the Constitution. This is not a partisan matter. \nThis bill is important because it gives Congress the ability to combat \nexecutive disregard for the Congress no matter what party controls the \nWhite House or no matter what party controls the Congress.\n  The courts have ruled that individual Members of Congress lack \nstanding to take the administration to court. We are not considered \nindividually so-called ``aggrieved parties.'' That is why Members, \nwhether it was the National Labor Relations Board case where the \nPresident thought he could decide whether the Senate was in session, \ninstead of the Senate deciding whether the Senate was in session--I \njoined many of my colleagues to file an amicus brief. I am not a \nlawyer, but I am able to do that as a citizen, to file an amicus brief, \na friend-of-the-court brief, saying why we thought the President was \nwrong and why we thought the people who were challenging the rules that \nthis group created, that were put in power in an unconstitutional way--\nwe could file that but we could not initiate that. We could not go to \ncourt and say: We believe the law is not being enforced.\n  The ENFORCE Act removes that procedural barrier, so that a Member of \nthe House, a Member of the Senate, can be empowered to bring a lawsuit \nin Federal court challenging the administration's refusal to enforce \nthe law, challenging the administration's belief that on their own they \ncan suspend the law, they can postpone the law, they can delay the law.\n  If the law gives the President the ability to do that, it is going to \nbe in the clear black-and-white letters of the law. It is not there \nnow. The ENFORCE Act provides an expedited process so that if this \nlawsuit is initiated this way, by one or both Houses of the Congress \nagainst the administration for not faithfully executing the law, it \ngoes immediately to a three-judge panel in the U.S. district court and \nthen goes directly to the Supreme Court if there is an appeal.\n  This is an a easy way to solve this problem. It is a way that creates \nstanding to define who is constitutionally obligated to do a job that \nthey are not doing. It is time we reestablished the proper limits on \nthe executive branch. The Founders believed in separation of powers. It \nis the responsibility of the Congress to protect the idea they came up \nwith in a document for the first time that was a governing document, \nthe idea of checks and balances. If you eliminate that idea of checks \nand balances, you eliminate the miracle of the Constitution.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me and others \nin supporting this effort to stop executive overreach and encourage the \nPresident to enforce the law. The Constitution still matters. The \nConstitution deserves to be defended. This is a way the Members of the \nCongress of the United States can give themselves the ability to launch \nthat defense.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill that \nthe House passed yesterday. All we have to do to do our part is step \nforward and pass this legislation.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n             Unanimous Consent Agreement--Executive Session\n\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that at 2:30 p.m. today, the Senate \nproceed to Executive Session to consider the following nomination: \nCalendar No. 686; that the Senate proceed to vote without intervening \naction or debate on the nomination; that the motion to reconsider be \nmade and laid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate; \nthat no further motions be in order; that any related statements be \nprinted in the Record; that the President be immediately notified of \nthe Senate's action and the Senate then resume legislative session; \nfurther, that there be 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to \neach vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I yield back all time, and ask that the vote start \nimmediately, and all Senators should be advised that we will start the \nvote.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/13/senate-section/article/S1612-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1612-S1613]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF CAROLINE DIANE KRASS TO BE GENERAL COUNSEL OF THE CENTRAL \n                          INTELLIGENCE AGENCY\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hirono).

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To require the Secretary (acting through the Assistant \n Secretary for Children and Families) to prepare an annual report that \n  contains a determination about whether States have complied with a \n priority requirement, and to require the Secretary to withhold funds \n    from States that fail to comply with such priority requirement)\n\n       On page 99, strike line 19 and insert the following:\n       ``(ii) Report by assistant secretary for children and \n     families.--\n\n       ``(I) In general.--Not later than September 30 of the first \n     full fiscal year after the date of enactment of the Child \n     Care and Development Block Grant Act of 2014, and September \n     30 of each fiscal year thereafter, the Secretary (acting \n     through the Assistant Secretary for Children and Families of \n     the Department of Health and Human Services) shall prepare a \n     report that contains a determination about whether each State \n     uses amounts provided to such State for the fiscal year \n     involved under this subchapter in accordance with the \n     priority for services described in clause (i).\n       ``(II) Penalty for noncompliance.--For any fiscal year that \n     the report of the Secretary described in subclause (I) \n     indicates that a State has failed to give priority for \n     services in accordance with clause (i), the Secretary shall--\n\n       ``(aa) inform the State that the State has until the date \n     that is 6 months after the Secretary has issued such report \n     to fully comply with clause (i);\n       ``(bb) provide the State an opportunity to modify the State \n     plan of such State, to make the plan consistent with the \n     requirements of clause (i), and resubmit such State plan to \n     the Secretary not later than the date described in item (aa); \n     and\n       ``(cc) if the State does not fully comply with clause (i) \n     and item (bb), by the date described in item (aa), withhold 5 \n     percent of the funds that would otherwise be allocated to \n     that State in accordance with this subchapter for the first \n     full fiscal year after that date.\n       ``(III) Waiver for extraordinary circumstances.--\n     Notwithstanding subclause (II) the Secretary may grant a \n     waiver to a State for one year to the penalty applied in \n     subclause (II) if the Secretary determines there are \n     extraordinary circumstances, such as a natural disaster, that \n     prevent the state from complying with clause (I).

Madam President, I will briefly summarize this amendment, \nbut I first want to thank the chairman and ranking member of the \ncommittee for working through this amendment and agreeing to what I \nthink will be a quick consideration and adoption by voice vote.\n  This amendment is very simple, straightforward, but important. \nPresent law with regard to child care and development block grants--\npresent Federal law--says that States should and must prioritize for \ntwo categories of children: low-income kids and children with special \nneeds. I think we all agree with that prioritization. The problem is, \nas recent reports have indicated, about half of all the States--23 to \nbe exact--do not do that. They just basically ignore that Federal law.\n  This simple, straightforward amendment would bring accountability to \nthe system and make sure all States follow present Federal law and give \nthat appropriate priority treatment to children with special needs as \nwell as low-income kids. It would do this by saying that there is going \nto be some accountability; that the Federal Department involved in the \nprogram already will annually make sure States follow this aspect of \npresent law and that if a State is not doing that, it gets 6 months to \ncure the problem, but if it does not cure that within 6 months, then \nthat State would feel the pinch by having 5 percent of its block grant \nfunds withheld until it corrects the situation.\n  The amendment also gives the Secretary waiver authority for \nextraordinary circumstances, such as natural disasters and other \nemergencies.\n  Again, I appreciate the chairman and ranking member working out this \nprovision. I do think it is important that all States follow Federal \nlaw, and we give these children--special needs children, low-income \nchildren--the priority treatment they deserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, the amendment has the admirable goal of \nprioritizing funds to low-income families who have children with \ndisabilities. I applaud Senator Vitter's efforts and hope this provides \nsignificant reinforcement of what has been the law since 1996--that \nStates must prioritize children from very low-income families\n\n[[Page S1614]]\n\nwho have children with disabilities. This amendment reinforces that by \nsaying the Department of Health and Human Services must meet that \npromise. There is a provision in there that gives them adequate time to \nmake sure they do that.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from Louisiana for working with us. As I \nsaid when this amendment first came up, yes, as someone who has worked \non disability issues for most of my adult life, I agreed with exactly \nwhat he wanted to do; there were just some language problems. That is \nthe way we get legislation done around here--we work things out and we \nfind the middle ground on which everybody can agree. I thank the \nSenator from Louisiana for his willingness to work this out. We support \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, I also want to thank my colleague from \nLouisiana and the chairman of the committee for working out this \namendment.\n  Madam President, I know of no further debate on this amendment, and I \nwould ask us to proceed to a vote on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2845), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                              Section 8(B)\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I want to first and foremost express \nmy thanks to the chairman, and his colleagues, for this bipartisan \nbill--a long overdue effort that clearly is the result of a \npainstaking, patient effort by the committee to reauthorize the Child \nCare and Development Block Grant.\n  I wanted to discuss very quickly one provision, section 8(b), that I \nfeel needs additional clarification.\n  Given that the overall priority of all of us to increase quality \nwhile ensuring that States can effectively navigate the federal \nstandards--while maintaining their authority to set their own \nstandards--would the Senator agree that the intent of this law is not \nto rewrite other existing Federal laws or evade requirements of other \nFederal laws that might diminish services for children?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes, I would agree. As our committee report explains, it \nis intended that ``States exercise this provision in an attempt to \nmaximize the effective administration and delivery of Federally \nsubsidized childcare, and not for purposes that have a minor effect on \nchildcare.''\n  I firmly believe, and I know my colleagues will agree, that this \nprovision is not intended, nor should it be interpreted, as one that \ncan be used to rewrite any other current laws, evade central provisions \nof other current laws, or undermine the goals and purposes of other \nlaws. Certainly, it is not our intent to allow States to change, \nundermine or threaten in any way current laws.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the chairman.\n\n\n                             HHS Rulemaking\n\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, I have a question for my friend from Iowa, \nthe chairman of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions. The Department of Health and Human Services, HHS, in May 2013 \nissued a notice of proposed rulemaking to the Child Care and \nDevelopment Fund, CCDF, that would make several health and safety, \nquality, background checks, and other related changes. That NPRM is \ncurrently in the comment period and has yet to be finalized.\n  Am I correct in my understanding that HHS has shared with you, as \nwell as with me, their interpretation that, should S. 1086, the Child \nCare Development Block Grant Reauthorization which we are considering \nin the Senate today along with any subsequent changes through the \nlegislative process, become law, the proposed rulemaking for the CCDF \nwould be overridden by S. 1086?\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator from North Carolina is correct that HHS has \nshared with me that S. 1086, and any further congressional changes made \nto S. 1086, would override the May 2013 notice of proposed rulemaking \nto the CCDF.\n  Mr. BURR. I thank the distinguished chairman for this important \nclarification and for his hard work in developing this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, with 20 kids and grandkids, I understand \nthe importance and value of quality, affordable childcare. I applaud \nthose individuals seeking to attain further education and training in \norder to improve their situations, and the Child Care and Development \nBlock Grant Program assists them in that pursuit.\n  The Child Care and Development Block Grant Program has been in place \nsince 1990, and as a part of welfare reform in 1996, three other \nchildcare initiatives were consolidated into this program, which \nprovides formula-based block grant funding to States to subsidize \nchildcare and emphasizes work, personal responsibility and parental \nchoice. In my State of Oklahoma, 17,000 families and 28,000 children \nbenefit directly from these funds.\n  This legislation not only reauthorizes the program for another 5 \nyears, but it also does not add to the deficit and makes some important \nreforms, while preserving State flexibility in how the funds are used. \nS. 1086 adds new safety and health standards, calls for annual, \nunannounced onsite monitoring of licensed providers, requires \nbackground checks of childcare staff and providers and expands \ncompliance with child abuse reporting requirements. Additionally, the \nSenate adopted 18 amendments, which I also supported, including \nAmendment 2822, which sets aside at least 2 percent of a State's CCDBG \nfunds for Indian tribes and tribal organizations--of significance for \nOklahoma. I also co-sponsored two adopted amendments: Amendment 2813, \nwhich extends a grace period to foster youth so that they can begin \nreceiving CCDBG services while families compile medical documentation; \nand Amendment 2814, which requires States to have a plan in place to \ncoordinate existing services and programs for children in foster care. \nI support S. 1086 and am encouraged by the example of regular order \nrestored to Senate business.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, Americans believe in the power of hard \nwork as the key to getting ahead, the key to prosperity, the key to a \nbetter future. We also believe in the importance of family, and in the \nresponsibility we all share for making sure that America's children are \ncared for and protected.\n  The legislation before us today furthers both these values the value \nof hard work and the value of family. It would update and modernize a \nprogram that for two decades has helped families pursue rewarding \nemployment or important education and training while obtaining \nessential care for their children. It is bipartisan legislation, \nunanimously approved in committee, with support from a broad range of \neducation and child advocacy groups.\n  For all working parents, but particularly for low-income families, \nthe demands of work and parenting are enormous challenges. Quality \nchildcare can be hard to find and expensive so expensive that, for many \nfamilies, the cost all but wipes out their paycheck. The Child Care and \nDevelopment Block Grant Program is designed to help families meet this \nchallenge. The program provides block grants to States so they can \nprovide financial assistance to families coping with childcare \nexpenses. Nationwide, more than 1.5 million children receive care \nthrough these grants. In Michigan, these grants helped more than 50,000 \nchildren receive the care they needed in Fiscal Year 2013.\n  The legislation Senators Harkin and Alexander have brought to the \nfloor reauthorizes the block grant program so this important assistance \ncan continue. The bill also makes important improvements. It requires \nStates to establish education and training requirements for childcare \nworkers, and ensures that States will inspect childcare facilities \nbefore they are granted licenses, and at least once a year thereafter. \nThese requirements will improve our ability to ensure that children are \ncared for in a safe and secure environment. The bill makes important \nchanges to improve care for children with special needs. It makes \nchanges to eligibility requirements to make assistance more stable and \ndependable for families.\n\n[[Page S1615]]\n\n  More than 30 national education, child-advocacy, parenting and \nviolence prevention advocacy groups have endorsed this legislation, \nstrongly supporting the reauthorization of the grant program and the \nchanges to make the program more modern and effective. These groups \nalso point out that in addition to authorization, programs require \nappropriations to be successful. Childcare is one of many important \ndomestic priorities that Congress could more effectively address if we \nare willing to reach a balanced deficit reduction agreement that \neliminates sequestration and provides needed funding. I remain hopeful \nwe can reach such an agreement.\n  I wish to thank Senator Harkin, chairman of the HELP Committee, and \nSenator Alexander, Ranking Member of the HELP Committee, as well as \nSenators Mikulski, Burr, Gillibrand, and Ayotte for sponsoring this \nimportant legislation. I support its passage and I encourage my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Madam President, I wish to speak today in support of the \nChild Care and Development Block Grant Act of 2014.\n  First, I applaud the hard work of my colleagues on the Senate Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee--Chairman Tom Harkin and \nRanking Member Lamar Alexander.\n  I also commend Senator Barbara Mikulski, my predecessor as chairman \nof the Subcommittee on Children and Families, and Senator Richard Burr \nfor their commitment to improving the lives of children and their \nfamilies as the sponsors of this important legislation.\n  We can all agree that supporting our children should be a priority of \nthe utmost importance, and I am proud of the bipartisan work done by my \ncolleagues toward that end.\n  The childcare and development block grant is an invaluable program \nthat provides assistance to low-income working families. In North \nCarolina 78,000 children are served every month by CCDBG funding. These \nchildren and families deserve high quality childcare so that parents, \nlike the ones I hear from in my State every day, can go to work with \nthe knowledge that their children are safe and receiving high quality \ncare.\n  Last year, I visited Elm Street Day Care Center in Greensboro, NC, \nwhere I saw the importance of childcare, and development block grant \nfunding firsthand. I saw how this program is helping working families \nin North Carolina and noted ways we could update this law to make it to \nwork better and more efficiently.\n  I am pleased this bill takes a significant step toward providing more \ninformation to parents about their children's care and encourages \nStates to follow North Carolina's lead and increase the quality of \nchildcare centers.\n  Currently, States must spend at least 4 percent of their Federal \nchildcare funds on improving the quality of childcare--including \nproviding professional development for childcare providers, licensing \nand monitoring childcare facilities, and providing consumer education, \nso that parents have the information they need to make informed \nchoices.\n  This reauthorization raises the minimum amount to be spent on quality \nimprovements to 10 percent by 2020. As a result, we can help to ensure \nthat children in all 50 States are receiving quality care by passing \nthis legislation.\n  I am also particularly pleased to support this bill because it \nincludes key provisions of the Child Care Infant Mortality Prevention \nAct, which I introduced with Senators Dianne Feinstein and Susan \nCollins in September.\n  These provisions will allow for the use of Federal funds to train \nchildcare providers in sleep practices, first aid, and CPR for infants.\n  According to the Centers for Disease Control and the American Academy \nof Pediatrics, safe sleep practices can reduce by one-half the annual \nnumber of cases of Sudden Unexpected Infant Death Syndrome--a tragedy \nthat touches approximately 100 families in North Carolina each year.\n  Roughly 20 percent of all cases of Sudden Unexpected Infant Death \nSyndrome occur in child care settings, and--with this provision--we can \nprovide child care providers with the resources they need to prevent \nthese unnecessary tragedies.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Child Care and \nDevelopment Block Grant Act.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I am pleased to support the Child Care and \nDevelopment Block Grant Act of 2014, and would like to commend the \nbipartisan work of Senators Mikulski and Burr and Chairman Harkin and \nRanking Member Alexander of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee in bringing this important legislation to the floor. There \nhave been several previous attempts to reauthorize this critical \nprogram in the past, including when I was a member of this committee. \nIt is my hope we can come together and finally carry this important \nlegislation across the finish line to the benefit of children and \nfamilies across the country.\n  Access to affordable, high quality, safe and secure childcare is \nessential for working families. Yet, such care is very hard to find. \nAccording to a 2013 Child Care Aware survey, the cost of full-time, \ncenter-based care for two children is the highest single household \nexpense in the Northeast, Midwest and South. This high cost often puts \nfully licensed programs out of reach for low-incomes families.\n  The child care and development block grant has not been reauthorized \nsince 1996. At that time, the primary focus of the program was to \nenable people to move from welfare to work. Today, knowing the critical \nimportance of early brain development and the role early education \nplays in school readiness and successful outcomes for young people, we \nmust work to achieve the dual goals of CCDBG to ensure affordable and \nquality childcare options for children and families. And we cannot \nachieve these goals without addressing the issue of payment rates, the \nlevel at which states reimburse childcare providers who care for low-\nincome children who receive a child care subsidy.\n  That is why during previous attempts to reauthorize the child care \nand development block grant during the 107th, 108th and 109th \nCongresses, I introduced the Child Care Quality Incentive Act to \nprovide incentives to States to set equitable payment rates so that \nlow-income families would have access to affordable and high quality \ncare for their children. I am pleased that the bill before us today \nincludes some of the key provisions of my legislation, such as \nrequiring States to conduct a statistically valid and reliable survey \nof market rates for childcare, report the results of the survey \npublicly, and set the rates based on the survey results, taking into \nconsideration the cost of providing higher quality care. Raising the \npayment rates for childcare is an integral component to improving \nquality.\n  The other essential element to improving quality and affordability is \nour investment in childcare and early education programs. According the \nCongressional Research Service, seven percent fewer children were \nserved in fiscal year 2012 than had been served in fiscal year 2011. \nAccording to Kids Count Rhode Island, since peaking in 2003, the number \nof childcare subsidies in the State has decreased by 45 percent. The \n$154 million increase for childcare that we included in the fiscal year \n2014 Consolidated Appropriations Act was a step in the right direction. \nClearly, we need to do more.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to advance this \nlegislation to expand our support for working families, and ensure that \nall children have the quality of education and care to reach their full \npotential.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, for the information of Senators, we are \nnow down to two voice votes on two pending amendments that have been \ncleared. We will then have a rollcall vote on final passage. I am \nhopeful that is going to happen within a very short period of time. In \nmaybe 5 minutes or 10 minutes, I hope we will be ready for a final vote \non this bill.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S1616]]\n\n                     Amendments Nos. 2847 and 2846\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, we have no further debate on the two \npending amendments--Portman No. 2847 and Sanders No. 2846--and the \nsubstitute. I know of--Madam President, I was misinformed. I thought \nthose amendments had already been called up.\n  Madam President, I would like to call up in order Portman amendment \nNo. 2847 and Sanders amendment No. 2846 and ask for their immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING CHILD \n                   POVERTY BY CALENDAR YEAR 2019.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the United States has the highest rate of childhood \n     poverty among 34 major countries in the Organisation for \n     Economic Cooperation and Development, including Denmark, \n     Finland, Norway, Iceland, Cyprus, Austria, Sweden, the Czech \n     Republic, Germany, Slovenia, Hungary, South Korea, the United \n     Kingdom, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Ireland, France, \n     Malta, Luxembourg, Slovakia, Estonia, Belgium, New Zealand, \n     Poland, Canada, Australia, Japan, Portugal, Greece, Italy, \n     Lithuania, Latvia, Spain, and Bulgaria;\n       (2) a record-breaking 46,496,000 individuals lived in \n     poverty in the United States in 2012, which is an increase of \n     14,915,000 individuals since 2000;\n       (3) 16,073,000 children in the United States lived in \n     poverty in 2012, which is an increase of 4,486,000 children \n     since 2000;\n       (4) more than 7,100,000 children in the United States, 40 \n     percent of children living in poverty in the United States, \n     live in extreme poverty (defined as living in families with \n     an income that is less than half of the poverty level);\n       (5) nearly 1,200,000 public school students in the United \n     States were homeless in the 2011-2012 school year, an \n     increase of 73 percent since the 2006-2007 school year;\n       (6) in an average month in fiscal year 2011, 1,200,000 \n     households with children in the United States did not have \n     any cash income and, for food, depended only on benefits \n     under the supplemental nutrition assistance program \n     established under the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 (7 \n     U.S.C. 2011 et seq.);\n       (7) in 2012, government assistance programs removed from \n     poverty 9,000,000 children, including 5,300,000 children \n     through the earned income tax credit under section 32 of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and the child tax credit under \n     section 24 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and \n     2,200,000 children through the supplemental nutrition \n     assistance program established under the Food and Nutrition \n     Act of 2008 (7 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.);\n       (8) in 2012, child poverty would have been 57 percent \n     higher, and extreme poverty would have been 240 percent \n     higher, without government tax credits and food, housing, and \n     energy benefits;\n       (9) in 2013, an individual working full-time at the Federal \n     minimum wage could not afford the fair market rent for a 2-\n     bedroom rental unit and have enough money for food, \n     utilities, and other necessities;\n       (10) in school years 2009-2010 and 2010-2011, less than \n     half of children ages 3 and 4 were enrolled in preschool;\n       (11) Early Head Start programs carried out under the Head \n     Start Act (42 U.S.C. 9831 et seq.) served only 4 percent of \n     the 2,900,000 eligible poor infants and toddlers each day in \n     fiscal year 2012, and Head Start programs carried out under \n     such Act served only 41 percent of the 2,000,000 eligible \n     poor children ages 3 and 4;\n       (12) more than 220,000 children are on waiting lists for \n     child care assistance; and\n       (13) child poverty costs the United States not less than \n     $500,000,000 each year in additional education, health, and \n     criminal justice costs and in lost productivity.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the President should immediately present to Congress a \n     comprehensive plan to significantly reduce child poverty in \n     the United States by calendar year 2019.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, as I said, I know of no further debate \non those amendments. We are ready to vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, if the Senator will yield, as we close \ninto the final minutes of this bill, I just want to say that today will \nbe a great victory for America's children because we will pass the \nchild care and development block grant. I think it is a great victory \nfor the Senate to show that we could govern ourselves with an open \namendment process. We could do it diligently, we could do it \ndeliberatively, and we could do it with courtesy and civility. This is \nthe way the Senate should be. Within 2 days we have arrived at a great \nbill, with cooperation and civility on both sides of the aisle. I hope \nthis becomes a model for the way the Senate will conduct itself for the \nrest of the session.\n  I have been very proud to be part of this bill. I thank Senator \nRichard Burr of North Carolina, my Republican counterpart on the \nchildren's committee, with all of the due diligence we did for a year \nand a half. I also thank Senator Lamar Alexander for his steadfast \nleadership and input, and of course I thank Tom Harkin, our leader, \nwho, as he wraps up his Senate career, will never wrap up his advocacy \nfor America's children.\n  I thank all of our staff for the great work they did in the 100 \nmeetings with stakeholders and the 200 meetings with us.\n  Madam President, I am ready for the vote and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, I would like to take this quick \nopportunity to thank my colleague Senator Mikulski for those kind words \nand, more importantly, for her passion on this issue. I thank the \nchairman and the ranking member for their help. But more importantly, I \nwould like to thank the committee staff and personal staffs who have \nbeen over here for the last several days and late last night trying to \nwork out amendments. I thank the Members who have been very \naccommodating to changes so we could get this bill up.\n  I might take a personal privilege to say that part of this bill was \ndone by a former staff member of mine, Celia Sims, and she is one proud \nwoman today because of that being included in this bill and its \npassage. I look forward to it.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I will not extend this more than 2 \nminutes, but I think it is instructive to colleagues to note what the \nSenator from Maryland, the Senator from North Carolina, and the Senator \nfrom Iowa have done. We started this bill about 24 hours ago, right \nafter lunch. More than 40 amendments were filed. More than half of them \nhave been considered and disposed of. There was no objection to a \nmotion to proceed. There was no cloture vote filed. There was no \nfilibuster. And on both sides of the aisle, anyone who showed up with \nan amendment relevant to the childcare discussion had a chance to have \nit considered without anybody picking their amendment. Finally, on this \nside and that side of the aisle, many Members showed a lot of restraint \nand courtesy in adjusting their amendments so that we could get here. \nWe will not be able to do this every time, but it is a modest step in a \nvery good direction toward the way the Senate should work.\n  I want to especially thank the Senator from Iowa, the Senator from \nMaryland, and the Senator from North Carolina for their leadership.\n  I would also like to extend my deep thanks and sincere appreciation \nto the dedicated staff that worked on this bill for the past year. \nWithout their hard work and tireless effort we wouldn't have been able \nto reach the successful conclusion on the passage of this important \nbill.\n  I would like to thank Senator Burr's staff, Christopher Toppings and \nNatasha Hickman for working so closely with my staff and working so \nwell together and with our Republican offices.\n  I would also like to thank Senator Mikulski's staff, Brent Palmer and\n\n[[Page S1617]]\n\nJessica McNiece for their hard work and steady support of getting this \nbill through the Senate.\n  The Chairman of the committee has an outstanding staff who are all \nvery capable and dedicated, especially Mario Cardona, Mildred Otero, \nand his new Staff Director, Derek Miller. I thank them for their close \nworking relationship with my staff.\n  We know that these bills don't just suddenly appear. Legislative \nCounsel staff work long hours on the bill and then on the amendments, \nso I would like to especially thank Liz King, Kristin Romero, Katie \nGrendon, Bill Baird, and Rob Silver.\n  And we always rely on our experts at the Congressional Research \nService to give us good information in a timely manner, so I extend our \nthanks to Karen Lynch.\n  Finally I would like to thank my staff. They have put in a lot of \ntime and effort to make this a process the Senate can be proud of, and \nI appreciate their efforts and late nights on this bill. So my thanks \ngo out to Diane Tran, Bill Knudsen, Marty West, Patrick Murray, Peter \nOppenheim, Michael Merrell, David Cleary, Liz Wolgemuth, and Jim \nJeffries.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendments \nen bloc.\n  The amendments (Nos. 2847 and 2846) were agreed to en bloc.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 2811 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I withdraw my pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, again, I know of no further amendments \nor debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the adoption of the \ncommittee substitute, as amended.\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended, \nwas agreed to.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I would like to join my colleagues and \nthank everyone for getting this bill done. This is a good bill. First, \nI would again say thanks to both Senator Burr and Senator Mikulski. \nThis is really their bill. They spent the better part of 2 years \nworking this out.\n  I would like to say that we have had a good day here to work this \nout, as Senator Alexander said. But a lot of that is the preliminary \nwork that goes into developing a bill such as this over a long period \nof time. So my respect--my great respect--and my thanks to both Senator \nBurr and Senator Mikulski for getting this bill to where we are now.\n  My thanks to my good friend Senator Alexander and for the great \npartnership we have working together on the committee. As he said the \nother day, no other committee has a wider divergence of ideological \nviews than our committee, but I believe, if I am not mistaken, this is \nthe 19th or 20th bill we have gotten through our committee this \nCongress.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Will my friend yield for a brief comment?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes, of course I will yield.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it would be improper if we did not \nacknowledge the work Mike Lee was involved with in this legislation. He \nshould be complimented for working to help get this passed.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The leader is right. Senator Lee was very accommodating \nin letting us move forward on this bill. I appreciate that.\n  We accomplished a lot in the floor process, as Senator Alexander \nsaid. I think we can adopt the legislation, making it an even stronger \nbill. I would not like to thank a lot of the staff. I hope I do not \nmiss anyone. David Cleary, Peter Oppenheim, Patrick Murray, Marty West, \nand Bill Knudsen of Senator Alexander's staff.\n  I would like to thank Chris Toppings and Natasha Hickman of Senator \nBurr's staff.\n  I would like to commend the work of Jessica McNiece and Brent Palmer \nof Senator Mikulski's staff.\n  Finally, I would like to thank Pam Smith, who is not here but who \nworked on this for a long time, Derek Miller, Mildred Otero, Mario \nCardona, Soncia Coleman, Michael Gamel McCormick, Leanne Hotek, Brit \nMoller, and Aissa Canchola of my staff.\n  I also wish to thank, from the staffs of Senator Murray, Sarah \nBolton; Senator Sanders, David Cohen; Senator Casey, Sara Mabry and \nChristina Baumgardner; Senator Hagan, Ashley Eden; Senator Franken, \nGohar Sedighi and Maggie Henderson; Senator Bennet, Juliana Herman and \nMolly Fishman; Senator Whitehouse, Rick Van Buren; Senator Baldwin, \nMichael Dinapolo; Senator Murphy, Yoon Hayne; Senator Warren, Julie \nMorgan; Senator Enzi, Kristin Chapman; Senator Isakson, Brett Layson; \nSenator Paul, Natalie Burkholter; Senator Hatch, Katie Neal; Senator \nRoberts, Joshua Yurek; Senator Murkowski, Karen McCarthy; Senator Kirk, \nCabe Clurman; and Senator Scott, Elizabeth Simmons.\n\n  As I said at the beginning of this bill's consideration, this bill \nrepresents a strong, positive shift for working families in America who \nbenefit from the childcare subsidy program. I hope my colleagues will \njoin all of us in voting to give this an overwhelming vote of yes on \nfinal passage.\n  I know of no further debate on the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall it pass?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Oklahoma (Mr. Inhofe) and the Senator from Kansas (Mr. \nMoran).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Markey). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 96, nays 2, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 77 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--96\n\n     Alexander\n     Ayotte\n     Baldwin\n     Barrasso\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Blumenthal\n     Blunt\n     Booker\n     Boozman\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Burr\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Chambliss\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coons\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     Cruz\n     Donnelly\n     Durbin\n     Enzi\n     Feinstein\n     Fischer\n     Flake\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Heinrich\n     Heitkamp\n     Heller\n     Hirono\n     Hoeven\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Johnson (SD)\n     Johnson (WI)\n     Kaine\n     King\n     Kirk\n     Klobuchar\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Manchin\n     Markey\n     McCain\n     McCaskill\n     McConnell\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murphy\n     Murray\n     Nelson\n     Paul\n     Portman\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Rubio\n     Sanders\n     Schatz\n     Schumer\n     Scott\n     Sessions\n     Shaheen\n     Shelby\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Thune\n     Toomey\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Vitter\n     Walsh\n     Warner\n     Warren\n     Whitehouse\n     Wicker\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--2\n\n     Coburn\n     Lee\n       \n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Inhofe\n     Moran\n       \n  The bill (S. 1086), as amended, was passed as follows:\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 3370.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3370) to delay the implementation of certain \n     provisions of the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act \n     of 2012, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there are now 45 \nminutes for debate.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, this particular bill has not been examined in \ncommittee--not in the Senate, not even in the House. It was rushed to \nthe floor of the House without amendment, and it is rushed to the floor \nhere without amendment. This is not how the legislative process is \nsupposed to work--especially not here in the Senate.\n  My opponents may say we already had our chance to impact this policy, \nbut what we have before us now is a different bill--a bill which we \nhave never seen before. This bill is not a conference report. It takes \nzero cues from the Senate bill. Not a single representative of the \nAmerican people has been given the opportunity to offer even a single \namendment to this legislation.\n  All I have been asking for is a vote on an amendment which eliminates \ncertain insurance rebates for second homes. My amendment would not \nchange homeowners' flood insurance policies or even reduce the new \ntaxpayer subsidy we are going to give them. It simply removes a \nretroactive reimbursement for second homes. Essentially we ask that \nworking families around the country, including taxpayers in my State, \nnot have to cut an additional check to the owners of coastal vacation \nhouses. I know of no one who objects to my provision on policy grounds. \nLet me repeat that. I don't know of anyone, not one person who has \nraised a policy objection to\n\n[[Page S1628]]\n\nthe amendment I have offered. It is an objective improvement to the \nunderlying policy and this is what the Senate is supposed to do. Yet \nthe supporters of the bill have been blocking any amendments that may \ngarner bipartisan support to hold together a deal that has been \nnegotiated in a backroom, written in secret by only a few Members, \nperhaps with the influence of a few people who may be interested in \nthat. These ``masters of the universe'' as my friend Senator Sessions \nhas sometimes referred to them, are shutting the American people out of \nthe process.\n\n  I asked for 10 minutes and a vote on a single unobjectionable germane \namendment to a bill the public has never before seen, but it seems this \nmay be a bridge too far for the ``masters of the universe,'' as my \nfriend from Alabama likes to call them.\n  So in an effort hopefully to change one of the more offensive \npolicies in the bill, one that provides a refund of premiums paid under \nthe law to homeowners of second vacation homes from a program that is \nalready $24 billion in the hole, I agree to a vote on my amendment as a \nstand-alone bill. I have assurances from the House majority leader that \nhe will work to get the policy considered in the House and I take him \nat his word.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my bill to protect the American \npeople from being asked to fund--to refund premiums paid under current \nlaw to owners of second homes and vacation homes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am opposed to H.R. 3370 because it \nabandons the much-needed reforms to the National Flood Insurance \nProgram, NFIP, that were instituted in the Biggert-Waters Reform Act of \n2012. That bill set the NFIP on a course to quickly remove Federal \nsubsidies from the program and make it actuarially sound. If these \npolicies had been fully implemented, it would have allowed the \ndevelopment of a private insurance marketplace for flood insurance, \nwhich does not currently exist. H.R. 3370 prevents flood insurance \npolicies from being written at an actuarially sound rate when homes are \nsold to a new buyer or when a flood insurance policy lapses. New \npurchasers of homes in areas that require flood insurance should not be \nsubsidized for making that decision. H.R. 3370 puts in doubt the hope \nthat NFIP's subsidies are eliminated.\n  Thank you, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise to urge a ``yes'' vote for final \npassage of the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act, the \nlegislation we are here to consider. I will say the Senate went through \na considerate, deliberate process where amendments were openly \nconsidered. I believe at the end of the process there was a 67-to-32 \nvote. We don't normally get two-thirds of the Senate agreeing on major \nissues, but we did at that time in a bipartisan effort.\n  My understanding is the legislation that ultimately we are \nconsidering today, which is basically foundationally what we agreed to \nhere with some changes in the House, for which there was vigorous back-\nand-forth negotiation, passed by over 300 votes of the House of \nRepresentatives. So it seems to me it has a broad bipartisan support \nand was vigorously debated in that Chamber.\n  We have an opportunity to once again, after the bill we just passed, \nshow this body can work. We had a respectable debate on good-faith \namendments that were germane to the bill, lived up to the ideals of the \nSenate when it was before us. We were able to have bipartisan \nnegotiations to improve the House-passed version of our bill so it \nwould provide the levels of relief that are necessary. As a result, we \nare now poised to pass some critical legislation with overwhelmingly \nbipartisan support which provides real relief to millions of American \nfamilies.\n  Just very briefly, because I hope to basically not use all the time \nso we can come to a vote and get our Members on their way, this new \nlegislation is first of all budget neutral. It does not add a dime to \nthe deficit, nor does it hurt the solvency of the National Flood \nInsurance Program. It prevents skyrocketing rate increases by \nimplementing the following measures: One, it creates a firewall on \nannual rate increases. It repeals the property sales trigger that was \ndepressing the values of homes. It repeals the new policy sales \ntrigger. It reinstates grandfathering. It refunds homeowners who \noverpaid. It has something that I thought was critically important, \nthat I thought was so important when we passed Biggert-Waters that I \nincluded it by amendment in the banking committee--an affordability \ngoal.\n  Let us have the ability to ensure the solvency of the National Flood \nInsurance Program, but let us have an affordability mechanism which \nFEMA was, under the law that exists today, required to report to the \nCongress so we could ultimately come up with an affordability mechanism \nthat would ensure that we have a solvent program and that we have an \naffordable program.\n  At the end of the day, insurance is about spreading risk over a wide \npool and in doing so keeping rates affordable. With rates that I heard \nfrom homeowners in New Jersey that went from $1,000 to $10,000 or \n$15,000, not only is that not affordable but you are going to \nultimately reduce the size of the risk pool in the National Flood \nInsurance Program. That means that is going to continue to drive up the \ncost, and we have a self-fulfilling cycle that ultimately does not \nprovide for solvency.\n  So we have kept some of the most important reforms under Biggert-\nWaters, but we created a window of opportunity to make sure we get to \naffordability, that we help the real estate market, at a time when it \ndesperately needs help, to be able to continue to prosper. The people's \nmost significant asset in their life was built over a lifetime to buy a \nhome, and that is where they ultimately have their greatest asset. It \nis where they leverage for their kid's education or emergency in health \ncare and a whole host of plans for retirement.\n  So for millions of people in my State and across the country who \nultimately did the right thing, followed rules, paid their premiums, \nmet the higher standards, now to be told that in addition to--in New \nJersey's case the consequences of Hurricane Sandy, and throughout the \nNortheast, flooding in Colorado or the Mississippi or a whole host of \nother places--but despite the fact they did everything right, through \nno fault of their own and having paid their fees, they are now in rate \nshock, an inability to keep flood insurance, which sometimes triggers a \ndefault on the mortgage, if they have a mortgage, or makes it \nimpossible to sell their home.\n  That is what we are rectifying. It is our collective purpose. I urge \na strong ``yes'' vote.\n  Finally, I wish to thank my colleagues who have worked with me on a \nbipartisan basis: My lead cosponsor Senator Isakson. I don't believe \nthere is anybody in the Senate who has a greater depth of knowledge in \nthe real estate industry and how this legislation affects that but also \nunderstands the consequences of individual families and is working in \nan incredibly strong way so we can get to this bipartisan moment. I \nappreciate all of his work.\n  Also, I have to say the tenaciousness and the ability to bring us to \nthis point is that of Senator Landrieu, who has become an expert out of \nnecessity from what happens in her State with Hurricane Katrina. The \npeople of Louisiana are extraordinarily fortunate to have her as one of \ntheir Senators. She has been a guiding light throughout this process, \ntremendously helpful in getting us to today.\n  Lastly, I appreciate the leadership on both sides to get us to this \nmoment so we could have this vote.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I am going to be very brief in the interest of time. I \nwish to thank Senator Menendez for his leadership, Senator Landrieu for \nher leadership. Without their work this would not happen.\n  Let me tell you what this does. This bill corrects the unintended \nconsequence of denying liquidity to coastal Americans in their housing \nand causing the unintended consequence of people not buying insurance \nand putting themselves and this country at greater risk in those areas \nthat are\n\n[[Page S1629]]\n\nprone to floods. It aggressively addresses the need we have to make \nthis system more solvent and make it work better.\n  The Senate today will be solving a greater problem for coastal \nAmerican residents and those in flood areas. They will be doing the \nright thing at the right time to correct an unintended consequence of \nan action of the Congress. I am honored to be a part of it.\n  I commend Senator Menendez and Senator Landrieu and thank them for \ntheir effort.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. First, I thank my colleague from Louisiana for letting \nme butt in a little bit.\n  I also praise the three people who are on the floor, one can say \nwithout each of whom this would not have happened. I don't think we can \nsay that about anyone else here, myself included, but you can say that \nabout these three. Senator Menendez, our lead sponsor on the bill, who \nis indomitable and smart about crafting legislation; Johnny Isakson, \nwho was able to make this a bipartisan bill and in his gentle, \nfriendly, and persuasive way brought many people on board, prevented \npeople from blocking it; and the dynamo--we would all agree--the dynamo \nof this operation, Senator Mary Landrieu, who did not quit. I would say \nMary Landrieu and I have had probably 200 phone calls in the last month \nabout flood insurance--three or four a day. Whenever there was a \nblockage, she was like a jackhammer getting through it. So I thank her.\n  I am going to be very brief as well--not quite as brief as my \ncolleague from Georgia, but brief for me and brief for the Senate.\n  This is a very important day for the people of New York. We have \nthousands of homeowners who either have had their flood insurance rise \nor are fearful of their flood insurance rising. Most of them are \nmiddle-class people in places such as Staten Island, Brooklyn, Queens, \nthe Rockaways, out to the southern shore of Long Island and up the \nHudson River. To be a homeowner is to have your little piece of the \nrock if you are a middle-class person. Basically, it is all you own. To \nhave that taken away from you by an irrational Washington force called \nBiggert-Waters made no sense. Yet, when people's flood insurance bills \nwould go up from $500 to $4,000, when they were told if they sold their \nhouse it might go up to $10,000, their piece of the rock--their home--\nwas in true jeopardy.\n  We all know there is an increase in flooding. We all know the huge \ndamage Katrina and Sandy caused. But to put it on the backs of \nhomeowners, as FEMA was doing by both increasing rates and expanding \nflood maps beyond what flood zones should be made no sense.\n  We had so many people in New York who were damaged--I know this is \ntrue of my colleague from New Jersey as well--who were damaged by \nSandy, who painstakingly rebuilt their home, getting some money from \ninsurance and some money from FEMA and some money from Sandy and going \nto relatives and friends. After their home was finally rebuilt to be \ntold, now here is your $5,000 flood insurance bill, when these people \nare in debt, it was awful, a double whammy.\n  This bill isn't perfect, but it will stop all of that. It \ngrandfathers homes in so people who sell their homes will not see the \nprice go way up, and because of the efforts we made in the Senate, the \nbill the House is sending us has an individual limit on how much flood \ninsurance can go up. Eighteen percent is still not as low an amount as \nwe would like--and we may be able to revisit that down the road--but it \ncertainly is not a 700-, 2,000- or 5,000-percent increase, which is \nwhat people were getting.\n  So this is a good day. It is a good day for the shorefront areas of \nNew York which contain close to 1 million people. It is a good day for \nthe coastal areas throughout America, the areas by rivers throughout \nAmerica. Do you know what it means? It means that the American dream of \nworking hard, buying a home, and having your little piece of the rock \nwill not be destroyed by some unknown, misunderstood, and irrational \nforce from Washington on flood insurance. Flood insurance will now be a \nfriend once again rather than a foe.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I wish to speak on this for 2 minutes now, because I \nknow people are anxious to vote on final passage of this important \nbill, and I will speak at length after the vote.\n  I just wish to say thank you to the two leaders who are on the floor, \nSenator Menendez from New Jersey, Senator Johnny Isakson from Georgia. \nThey were the team who brought the coalition together when it was very \nhard--and still is difficult--to build a coalition on any subject. This \nsubject is complicated. It is difficult. There are very strong feelings \non all sides. There are different parts of the country that look at \nthis in different ways, and there are debts that need to be paid \nattached to this program. So this was not an easy negotiation, and the \nleaders both did an extraordinary job keeping us on track.\n  No. 2, this compromise--and that is what it represents--the best of \nthe compromise was, in fact, debated at length on this Senate floor; it \nwas debated at length in the House of Representatives; and it was voted \non 67 to 32 in the Senate favorably and 306 to 91 in the House \nfavorably. The minority view--represented by the Senator from Utah, \nwhich would throw this bill into a conference committee right now--is \nnot what the American people want, and it is not what the majority of \nRepublicans or the majority of Democrats want, as demonstrated by the \nvote I just put into the Record.\n\n  We could all take this bill and rewrite sections of it that would \nwork better for our home State, but that is not what this place is \nabout. This place is not about perfection. It is about the art of the \npossible, and it is about listening to our constituents and responding \nto them when they have a great need.\n  In the State of Louisiana, I have 400,000 people who are afraid they \nwill lose their homes. For many of these families, that is the greatest \nasset they have, and they are close to losing it. They don't want us to \ngo to the conference committee and perfect this bill. They want us to \npass it today, right now, and that is what I think we are going to do.\n  I know the Senator from Utah is disappointed. He may know the masters \nof the universe, but I am still looking for them. I could use a lot \nmore wisdom and strength. If they are around here, I would like them to \npresent themselves. All we have right now is each other--human beings \ntrying to do the very best we can with a difficult circumstance. It may \nnot be a perfect bill, but the concept of this bill got 67 votes in the \nSenate and 306 votes in the House. We have passed it in record time, \ngiven the pace around here. I am very proud.\n  I see the Senator from Florida. I know he would like to say a word.\n  Mr. NELSON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes.\n  Mr. NELSON. I thank the Senator from Louisiana, who has been the \nsparkplug behind this bill. As a result of her hard work, there are a \nlot of people in Florida who will be saved unconscionable increases.\n  Again, my thanks to the Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I yield and turn the floor over to the leader, Senator \nMenendez. I believe the time will be yielded back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I understand we are going to be able to \nact on the Lee bill with a voice vote. As a result, I ask consent that \nthe order with respect to a 60-affirmative-vote threshold with respect \nto S. 2137 be vitiated with all of the provisions of the previous order \nremaining in effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, in the interest of getting this bill to \nthe President's desk and giving relief to flood victims across the \ncountry, and many other homeowners, we yield back the remainder of our \ntime and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  Without objection, all time is yielded back.\n\n[[Page S1630]]\n\n  The bill was ordered to a third reading and was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall it pass?\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs. Boxer) \nand the Senator from Missouri (Mrs. McCaskill) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. CORNYN.

Madam President, I was unable to attend the roll \ncall vote on passage of H.R. 3370, the Homeowner Flood Insurance \nAffordability Act of 2014. Had I been present for this vote, I would \nhave voted yea.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, when Hurricane Betsy roared ashore in \nGrand Isle on September 9, 1965, it wrought havoc in Louisiana and \nMississippi and became the first natural disaster to cost American \ntaxpayers more than $1 billion. It fundamentally changed the way our \nnation prepared for and responded to disasters. Private insurers fled \nthe market, making it necessary for the federal government to step in \nand help communities rebuild and recover. The National Flood Insurance \nProgram established building standards for flood prone areas to limit \ncommunities' exposure to flooding and rewarded responsible homeowners \nwith affordable flood insurance that was no longer available in the \nprivate market.\n  In response, Congress, led by Hale Boggs, passed the National Flood \nInsurance Act of 1968 with the explicit goal of making ``. . . flood \ninsurance available on reasonable terms and conditions . . .''\n  Affordability was one of the primary goals of the National Flood \nInsurance Program when it was created, and it remains an essential \npriority today. Unfortunately, affordability was virtually eliminated \nby the 2012 NFIP reform legislation known as Biggert-Waters, and we had \nto fight to get it reinstated in the compromise bill that cleared the \nHouse last Wednesday, March 5 with a strong, bipartisan vote of 306-91.\n  On January 16, Speaker Boehner flatly refused to consider \ncomprehensive flood insurance reform legislation in the House, telling \nan AP reporter bluntly: ``We're not going to do that.'' The decisive \n67-32 Senate vote to pass the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability \nAct on January 30 demonstrated the breadth and depth of our coalition \nand provided the necessary momentum for House leadership to get engaged \nand support this strategy.\n  Senior leaders of both parties worked closely with Rep. Maxine \nWaters, Rep. Cedric Richmond, Majority Leader Eric Cantor and Rep. \nMichael Grimm to reach a fair, bipartisan, bicamercal compromise that \ncan get to the President's desk, and we owe it to our constituents to \nact as soon as possible with an up or down vote.\n  The National Flood Insurance Program is one of the earliest examples \nof large scale community planning in America. It made community based \nmitigation a requirement for rebuilding. In order to be eligible for \nfederally subsidized, low-cost flood insurance, communities had to pass \nordinances restricting future development in floodplains. Taxpayers for \nCommon Sense, the National Wildlife Federation and others would have \nyou believe that NFIP encourages development in flood plains, but the \nreality is that it does the exact opposite.\n  By removing affordability from the core of the National Flood \nInsurance Program, Biggert-Waters put every policyholder on the path to \nFull Risk Rates whatever they may be. Speaking in support of the \ncompromise bill, Steve Scalise, my colleague from Louisiana and Chair \nof the conservative Republican Study Committee, explained the problem \nclearly and directly saying:\n  ``Sending somebody a $10,000 or a $20,000-a-year bill on a $200,000 \nhouse that never flooded is not an actuarially sound rate. It's a death \nsentence.''\n  Whether it takes 2 years or 20 years to get there, full risk rates of \n$20,000 or more will continue to freeze the housing market, depress \nproperty values, and prevent responsible homeowners from purchasing \nflood insurance. Program participation is already anemic with just over \nhalf--60 percent--of those required by law to have flood insurance in \ncompliance and even less market penetration in low-risk areas where we \nwant people to purchase voluntary flood insurance policies to grow and \ndiversify the risk pool. The Senate bill delayed the worst rate \nincreases until FEMA completed the affordability study and proposed an \naffordability framework to protect people from impossibly high \npremiums.\n  This indiscriminate march to Full Risk Rates is further complicated \nby a fundamentally flawed mapping process that wipes local levees off \nthe maps and excludes impacted communities from the mapping process. At \nmy request last summer, David Miller, Association Administrator for the \nFederal Insurance and Mitigation Administration--the man in charge of \nthe National Flood Insurance Program, stood on top of a $450 million \nlevee in Lafourche Parish that was completely wiped off the map when \nFEMA released their new flood map in 2008. Their map remains under \nappeal to this day.\n  The parish was one of 25 sites nationally included in the pilot \nprogram for FEMA's new Levee Analysis and Mapping Procedures, LAMP, \nthat were designed to fix this problem, but that process only began \nlast summer and has a long way to go before it is ready for prime time. \nThe Senate bill delayed rate increases based on new flood maps until \nFEMA certified that their maps were accurate and reliable.\n  Whereas the Senate sought to delay the worst parts of Biggert-Waters \nuntil maps were accurate and the affordability study was complete, the \nHouse took a different approach by repealing these provisions and \nreplacing them with other annual fees and rate increases. We had a \nhealthy discussion and debate about our two approaches and eventually \narrived at a compromise we could all live with that will protect people \nfrom the most aggressive rate hikes included in Biggert-Waters.\n  I commend Rep. Waters and Rep. Richmond for the leadership in \nreinstating affordability as an essential element of this program. \nSince Representative Cantor unveiled his bill on February 21, we \nsuccessfully amended it to include an 18 percent annual cap on \nindividual premium increases and an overall affordability target of 1 \npercent of the value of the policy.\n  While I would have preferred lower annual premium increases and \nstricter standards on overall affordability, this bill is a decent \ncompromise that will address the most pernicious pieces of Biggert-\nWaters and attract the bipartisan support necessary to get it to the \nPresident's desk. This is another important step in our ongoing efforts \nto provide affordable, accessible and sustainable flood insurance to \nmiddle class Americans, but this bill is not the\n\n[[Page S1631]]\n\nend of the battle. Nothing is perfect. Nothing is permanent.\n  After nearly 2 years of arduous work and steadfast determination by a \nbroad coalition of individuals, business groups and community leaders, \nthe most pernicious provisions and draconian rate increases of Biggert-\nWaters have successfully been stopped and affordability has been \nreturned as the centerpiece of the National Flood Insurance Program. \nThe passionate debate we had during the last 2 years--one that will \ncontinue--has shown that affordable flood insurance is about more than \njust actuarial numbers on a page. It is about protecting our unique \nculture, our treasured way of life, and preserving the historic coastal \ncommunities that built this nation and continue to drive its economy \ntoday.\n  As Chair of the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations \nCommittee, I will hold FEMA accountable for implementing this bill in a \ntimely and transparent manner that provides homeowners and housing \nmarkets with the immediate relief they need to recover from these \ndraconian rate hikes. Over the course of the past week, we were able to \nimprove the original Cantor bill by removing onerous and unnecessary \nbureaucratic provisions, but I am not confident that FEMA will execute \nthis either efficiently or effectively.\n  The great coalition of home builders, realtors, bankers, insurance \nagents, mayors, local governments and individual homeowners that fought \nto make flood insurance reform a national priority must remain vigilant \nand engaged. The National Flood Insurance Program expires in 2017, and \nwe will need to include strict affordability language to protect \nresponsible homeowners from impossible premiums.\n  The compromise bill that passed the House last week with a vote of \n306-91 has the support of the coalition that helped secure the strong \n67-32 vote in the Senate earlier this year. Some of the key industry \ngroups behind the bill are:\n\n       Greater New Orleans Inc--GNO Inc,\n       National Association of Realtors,\n       National Home Builders Association,\n       National Association of Counties--NACo,\n       National League of Cities,\n       American Bankers Association,\n       Independent Community Bankers of America, and the\n       Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers of America--Big \n     ``I''.\n\n  Biggert-Waters was built backwards and upside down. It authorized \nimmediate rate increases on responsible homeowners without any \nunderstanding of how they would impact individual policyholders or the \nprogram at large and before FEMA was able to certify that their maps \nare accurate and reliable.\n\n  Lafourche Parish has been appealing their new map since 2008 because \nFEMA cannot figure out how to give them credit for local levees, \nincluding an 8-16 foot, 40 mile ring levee that was authorized by \nCongress in 1965--the Larose to Golden Meadow Hurricane Protection \nProject. To date, $450 million has been invested in this project, \nincluding $200 million from the Federal government. This past summer, \nFEMA began a pilot program that is supposed to solve the problem, but \nit will be another 2-3 years before that process is complete. FEMA \nneeds to get their flood maps right the first time.\n  Currently, only 60 percent of the homeowners and businesses that are \nREQUIRED to have flood insurance actually do, and the aggressive rate \nincreases authorized under Biggert-Waters threaten to make that problem \na whole lot worse. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that every \n10 percent increase in premiums leads to a 3 percent drop in overall \nprogram participation.\n  Katherine in Houma, LA cannot sell her home because a pernicious \nprovision in Biggert-Waters that immediately increases premiums \nhundreds or thousands of dollars when you sell your house. When the \nyoung couple that was trying to buy her house went to closing, they \nlearned that the flood insurance would go from $1,400 to $8,000 and \ncould no longer afford the house. Katherine is stuck with a house she \ncannot sell and insurance she cannot afford.\n  Biggert-Waters threatens the very foundation of home ownership, the \ncornerstone of the American Dream. Fixing this flawed legislation is \nabout protecting people's homes and equity and preserving the American \ndream that if you work hard and play by the rules you can have a secure \nfuture.\n  Our bill structures NFIP in an affordable, comprehensive and \nsustainable way. For decades, the program was sustainable until the \n2005 storm season resulted in an unprecedented $17 billion in claims. \nPrior to that, it had an annual average deficit of just $19 million per \nyear.\n  This is not just a Louisiana or coastal issue. Fifty-five percent of \nour nation's population lives within 50 miles of the coast--and that \ndoesn't include those living along inland waterways. Ten percent of the \nhomes in the United States have a one-in-four chance of flooding in the \nlifetime of their mortgage.\n  In 2010, the 15 percent of U.S. counties that are located directly on \nopen ocean, the Great Lakes, major estuaries or coastal flood plains \ncontributed $8.3 trillion--55 percent--to the Nation's Gross Domestic \nProduct, and these communities proved more resilient during the 2007 \nrecession, actually growing employment by 1.4 percent while the \nnational employment rate fell by 2.3 percent.\n  This is not about millionaires in mansions on the beach. This is \nabout middle class Americans who need affordable flood insurance so \nthey can live where they need to work to harvest fresh seafood, produce \ndomestic energy, and manufacture and transport the goods we need to \nmaintain America's competitive advantage in the 21st century.\n  In response to all the concern I have heard from my constituents, I \nlaunched ``My Home, My Story'' to show you, literally, show some of the \npeople and properties facing these rate increases that we are aiming to \nhelp. These aren't mansions, these aren't millionaires. These are \nmiddle class, working people living in normal, middle class houses \ndoing their best to raise their kids, contribute to their communities \nand make a living.\n  I received over a hundred pictures and stories from my constituents.\n  Cody put his home on the market for less than its value and still \ncouldn't sell it because of the high premium on his flood insurance.\n  Rachel lives in a 1,000 square foot elevated home with no central air \nor heat, one small bathroom, a quaint front porch and a beautiful \nsycamore tree. Three months after moving in, her flood insurance \nincreased by $750 per year, and she's is struggling to make payments.\n  Maggie is a 66-year-old woman who has lived in the same house since \n1974 and plans to stay there for the remainder of her life. She lives \non a very strict budget and just received her first Social Security \npayment. If the law is not changed, it will be impossible for her to \nstay in her home or sell her home.\n  It provides basic consumer protections to responsible homeowners who \nbuilt to code and played by the rules are struggling to stay in the \nNFIP.\n  It protects home equity. In St. Charles Parish, LA, the Assessor is \nreducing home values up to 30 percent because of the dramatic rate \nhikes that take effect overnight when a person goes to sell their home.\n  Based on the average mortgage, every $1,000 increase in annual flood \ninsurance premiums reduces an individual's purchasing power by $20,000.\n  This provision affects 20 percent of all NFIP policyholders--1.1 \nmillion properties nationwide.\n  It ensures FEMA Flood Maps are Accurate. In 2011, FEMA acknowledged \nthe failings of its ``without levees'' policy that resulted in local \nlevees being literally wiped off the map, but it took them over two \nyears to develop a new policy--the Levee Analysis and Mapping \nProcedures, LAMP. A pilot program for 25 sites nationwide--including 5 \nin Louisiana--Lafourche, Terrebonne, St. Charles, Plaquemines and St. \nTammany--began in July, but it will be another 2-3 years before that \nprocess will be complete.\n  It allows FEMA to Complete the Affordability Study. FEMA must \ncomplete the affordability study mandated by Biggert-Waters and propose \nsolutions for Congressional review. Our bill creates an expedited \nprocess for Congress to take action on these recommendations while \nmaintaining critical checks and balances on FEMA's authority.\n\n[[Page S1632]]\n\n  Provides Fair Credit for Local Levees--Removes the penalty on \nlocally-financed flood protection projects and ensures that local and \nstate investments in mitigation are accurately factored into the flood \nmapping process.\n  I thank the following Senate cosponsors for all their hard work \nthroughout this process:\n  Robert Menendez, Johnny Isakson, Mary L. Landrieu, Thad Cochran, Jeff \nMerkley, David Vitter, John Hoeven, Tim Scott, Roger Wicker, Heidi \nHeitkamp, Chuck Schumer, Kirsten Gillibrand, Ed Markey, Bill Nelson, \nMark Begich, Elizabeth Warren, Al Franken, Joe Manchin, Robert Casey, \nAmy Klobuchar, Cory Booker, Kay Hagan, Lindsey Graham, Brian Schatz, \nRichard Blumenthal, Jack Reed, Sheldon Whitehouse, Lisa Murkowski, Ron \nWyden, Susan Collins and Debbie Stabenow.\n  This bill does not incentivize unsustainable development--In order to \nparticipate in the National Flood Insurance Program, communities have \nto adopt national building codes governing new development in flood \nprone areas. Our bill provides basic consumer protections to homeowners \nthat build to code and played by the rules. It does not alter or amend \nany rules governing new construction. The National Flood Insurance \nProgram is one of the earliest examples of federal land use planning.\n  It does not put American Taxpayers on the hook for a small sub-set of \nNFIP policyholders. Prior to Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy, NFIP was \nbasically self-sustaining with an average annual deficit under $20 \nmillion over that 26-year span. The $24 billion debt incurred as a \nresult of 2005 and 2008 storm seasons was the driving force behind the \nrate reforms in Biggert-Waters which required NFIP policyholders, not \nAmerican taxpayers, to pay down that debt and establish a reserve fund \nfor future catastrophic events. Our bill does not change that, it \nmerely gives responsible policyholders a little more time to adjust to \nthe higher premiums they have to pay as a result of Biggert-Waters.\n  FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate estimates that the NFIP saves \ntaxpayers $1.6 billion every year in avoided flood losses and disaster \nresponse costs due to the national building codes each participating \ncommunity and policyholder were required to adopt and adhere to.\n  I would also like to thank the following staff members for their hard \nwork throughout this process: Jason Tuber, Kirby Mayo, Karissa Willhite \nand Tim Del Monico in Senator Menendez' office; Zack Rosenblum and \nMeghan Tiara in Senator Schumer's office; Joan Kirchner in Senator \nIsakson's office; Adam Telle in Senator Cochran's office; Travis \nJohnson in Senator Vitter's office; Claire O'Rourke, Liz Craddock, Matt \nLehner and Wes Kungel in my office; Lisa Lederberger in Maxine Waters' \noffice; Zach Butterworth in Cedric Richmond's office; Dill Dauster and \nAlex McDunah in Senator Reid's office and all of the exceptional floor \nstaff. On behalf of myself, the Senate cosponsors, and the entire flood \ninsurance reform coalition, thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/13/senate-section/article/S1632-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1632]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM PREMIUM REFUNDS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I will try to make my remarks short. I know several of my \ncolleagues have places they need to be and have a time schedule they \nare on. I was involved in a committee hearing this afternoon and could \nnot contribute to the debate on the floor on the Flood Insurance \nProgram.\n  I have about 8 months left in the Senate. I just want to remind us of \nwhat we have just done. We have solved a very short-term problem and \nmade a long-term problem significantly worse. We did not really do our \nwork because we were in such a hurry to take the political pressure off \nof the increases in the flood insurance rate.\n  Addressing that issue was important, and I agree that we needed to \nmake some adjustments. But what we did is we chose politicians to win \nand the future to lose when it comes to flood risk mitigation and flood \nrisk cost for the American public. Are there some positive things in \nthe bill? Yes. But what we did once again is we put our political \npositions ahead of the best interests of this country.\n  The Biggert-Waters bill was a great reform bill. What happened is \nwhen we passed it, we did not recognize the tremendous rate increases \nmany people would have. In the last 5 years in this country, we spent \n$1.6 billion at FEMA reevaluating all of the flood plains in this \ncountry. The whole purpose behind that was to really put a risk of what \nis out there based on what we have and slowly get to a point where we \nare actually measuring the risk.\n  What have we actually done when we just passed this bill and sent it \nto the President? What you did is you asked everybody in the future to \ncontinue to pay an exorbitant amount of money for their insurance so \npeople who are at risk will not have to pay ultimately what is due \nthem. The only time we are going to see that actually happens now is \nwhen a property sells. That is when we are going to see it. Vacation \nhomes are excepted. I understand that. We are not going to give rebates \nto people. I understand that. But the big problem is we undermined the \nincentive to mitigate for risk. We undermined it.\n  So we now have a new flood insurance program. We have $18 billion \nworth of problems. We are getting ready to go to $26, $28 billion worth \nof problems, and that is on the heads of our kids. So we once again \nchose a position that put our kids at risk so we politically can be \nbetter off because we are going to alleviate the parochial scream. \nRather than actually fix the scream, we are going to alleviate it, and \nwe have eliminated all of that.\n  So my disappointment is not that we responded to parochial requests; \nit is that we did not do the hard work of actually fixing the problem \nand addressing some of the parochial problems and anecdotal notes of \nmassive increases in flood insurance. We could have done both, but we \nchose not to.\n  It is so heartbreaking to me and to this country that we continually \nchoose the politically expedient path that will bury our kids when we \ndo not have to. That is a function of a lack of real leadership, of \nsolving the real problems rather than treating the symptoms of the \nproblems, which is what we did. We have wasted $1.6 billion now, \nessentially. We might recover it 30 years from now. But the Flood \nInsurance Program is now not in any better shape and will not be in any \nbetter shape 20 years from now than it is today.\n  So I hope we are happy that we have solved the parochial problems, \nbut when you go to sleep tonight think about who is going to pay that \nbill. It is not the people who are getting the benefit from the very \nlarge subsidized flood insurance. It is the kids of this country and \nwhat is not going to be provided for them. It is those on the really \nlow rung of the ladder economically. We are not going to have the \nfinances to actually care for those who need the care from us the most. \nReally, it is the well-healed or the more well-healed and the more \nwell-connected. They won again. The builders and the developers won. \nThe real estate firms won. Less than two-tenths of 1 percent of this \nwhole thing, without even modifying Biggert-Waters, applied to people \nin the lower 40 percent of income in this country. Less than two-tenths \nof 1 percent. Seventy percent applied to the top 20 percent of the \npeople. So we gave a break to the most well off people. Those are the \nnumbers. You cannot dispute those numbers. So because they screamed and \ndo not want to pay their fair share, we have now damaged the future \npotential for our children.\n  I would say congratulations. We continue to do the same thing. No \nwonder the American people say: What is up with Congress? They do not \nhave the courage to make a difficult, tough decision. What they do is \nthey always make the politically expedient one.\n  That is exactly what we did today. That is what the House did today. \nTo me, it is sickening.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, what now is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to proceed to S. 2124 is the \npending business.\n  Mr. REID. What is the subject matter of that bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Ukraine bill.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be determined by \nme, after consultation with Senator McConnell, the motion to proceed be \nagreed to; that there be 1 hour of debate equally divided between the \ntwo leaders or their designees; that upon the use or yielding back of \nthat time, the bill be read a third time and passed, with all of the \nabove occurring with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object--I will not object--Madam \nPresident, the majority leader has asked that we move and pass this \nlegislation which was considered in the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee. It was open for amendment. Several amendments were adopted. \nSeveral were rejected. By a vote of 14 to 3, the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee reported out this bill.\n  Why should we care about this legislation? I will try to be as brief \nas possible, but I urge my colleagues' attention to the latest New York \nTimes report today: ``Russia Massing Military Forces Near Border With \nUkraine.'' Russian forces are massing near the border with Ukraine. \nAirborne; ground capabilities; the parachute drop was on a scale not \nseen since the collapse of the Soviet Union; the units involved \nartillery batteries, assault helicopters, and at least 10,000 soldiers.\n  In other words, right now as we speak, Vladimir Putin is either \nplanning on or contemplating an invasion of eastern Ukraine. We have \nseen the movie before: provocateurs, people having to come and restore \norder, and there is no order, so then we see military intervention, and \nthen there is going to be another referendum such as is supposed to \ntake place on Sunday in the Crimea, which I predict 80 percent of the \nvote will do so when that is clearly not what the will of the people of \nCrimea is.\n  So, incredibly, incredibly, there will be an objection from this side \nto this legislation when the people of the Ukraine are crying out for \nour help and our assistance.\n  My friend Senator Barrasso will now be proposing the House bill that \nhas not one single sanction in it--not one sanction. I am surprised \nthat the Senator would want to propose a bill that does not have any \npunishment for the Russians for what they are doing right now.\n  Then another one of my colleagues will probably come out and object \nto us taking up and passing the bill that was put through the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee--open to amendments--in a process that \ncould not be criticized by anyone.\n  So what is the message we are sending to the Ukrainian people? What \nis the message we are sending them? That we have a problem with a fix \nfor the IMF.\n  Then also there are some who are demanding changes in the regulation \nby\n\n[[Page S1634]]\n\nthe Treasury Department concerning campaign contributions. What has \nhappened? Where are our priorities? Is the IMF--no matter whether it is \nfixed or not fixed with this legislation--more important than the lives \nof thousands of people? Is that what we are talking about?\n  You know, I will say to my friends who are objecting to this--and \nthere are a number of them on my side--you can call yourself \nRepublicans--that is fine--because that is on your voter registration. \nDo not call yourself Reagan Republicans. Ronald Reagan would never--\nwould never--let this kind of aggression go unresponded to by the \nAmerican people.\n  We are not talking about troops on the ground. We are talking about \nresponses that impose sanctions and punishment for Vladimir Putin, who \nclearly has said that his goal--the greatest disaster of the 20th \ncentury was the dissolution, the collapse of the then-Soviet Union. We \nknow what Vladimir Putin is all about. We know what he understands.\n  So now because of an IMF fix or a campaign finance fix, we are now \ngoing to reject a piece of legislation that was done on a bipartisan \nbasis with the leadership of the chairman, whom I see on the floor, of \nwhich I am proud, and with the ranking member, Senator Corker of \nTennessee. We are going to say no.\n  Do you know what the most ridiculous thing about all of this is? That \nthe majority leader has filed cloture. We have well over 60 votes. So \nwe are going to be back in about 11 or 12 days, whatever it is, and \ncloture will have expired. We have well over 60 votes. We will pass \nthis.\n  Instead, our signal to the people of Ukraine today, as Russian \nmilitary forces are massing on their border: Wait a minute. It is more \nimportant that we get our campaign finance regulations fixed. It is \nmore important that we have the IMF fix as a higher priority than the \nlives of the men and women in the Ukraine.\n  I have been embarrassed before on the floor of the Senate, I will \ntell the Presiding Officer, but I have not been embarrassed this way \nabout Members of my own party. One of the proudest aspects I have \nalways felt of our Republican Party and the leadership of Ronald Reagan \nis we stood up for people. We stood up for people when the Iron Curtain \nwas there. We stood up for Natan Sharansky. We said, ``Tear down this \nwall.'' Now we have a guy who is trying to reinstate the old Russian \nEmpire, which he has said himself, and what are we saying? No. A \nshameful day. I will not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, reserving the right to object--and it \nis not my ultimate intention to object but hopefully to persuade my \ncolleagues not to object.\n  I have been watching my colleagues on television, in committee, and \non the Senate floor rail about what is happening in Ukraine and about \nthe lack of action from their perspective. We are at a moment--that \nafter a very considered process in the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee, which I am privileged to chair, working alongside the \nranking member Senator Corker and with Senator McCain, another \ndistinguished member of the committee--with a very strong bipartisan \nvote on a major piece of legislation, that, in fact, when it comes time \nto act, we have those who say no, even though they go on TV and bemoan \nthe lack of action.\n  I find it incredibly difficult to suggest that what the House passed \ncan be the only response to what is happening in Ukraine. Yes, it is a \nloan guarantee which we include in our legislation, but everything we \ndo we pay for. So for those who are fiscally conservative and are \nconcerned about it, we have paid for what we seek to do. That cannot be \nsaid about the House.\n  Secondly, we go beyond a loan guarantee. As important as that loan \nguarantee is to making an expression to the Ukrainian Government, to \nthe Ukrainian people, to our partners in Europe and in NATO, we say \nthere has to be responsibility taken for those who corrupted the \nUkrainian Government, for those who undermined its sovereignty, for \nthose who undermined its security.\n  We have provisions, both permissive and mandatory, to sanction \nindividuals who have been found to have, in fact, corrupted the \ncircumstances and/or affected the territorial integrity or sovereignty \nof Ukraine. One of them was sponsored by Senator McCain, which was \nadopted unanimously, a mandatory provision.\n  If we want to be doing something about Russia, we can't do it with \nthe House bill, we can only do it with the Senate bill. Then, yes, the \nIMF. I respect people who for some reason have an ideological \ndifference about international monetary institutions, but if we want to \ntalk about security, we will not have security in Ukraine if we cannot \nstabilize it economically, and a $1 billion loan guarantee isn't enough \nto make that happen.\n  It is the IMF that is going to be the singular force to create the \nopportunity for economic stability inside of Ukraine, which is \nfundamental to meeting our security challenge as well.\n  To hold IMF reform hostage to the question of whether unlimited \ncampaign money can go into our elections without deciding whether that \nis being done appropriately under the law as it exists is outrageous.\n  There is a reason we care about Ukraine. It is not simply because we \nwant to do the right thing by a country that has been invaded in the \nCrimea and for which thousands of Russian troops and equipment are \namassing along its border in Eastern Ukraine, it is because this has a \nglobal consequence.\n  If the West doesn't act what will China say when it is looking at its \nterritorial desires in the South China Sea? What will Iran say as we \nare negotiating with them about nuclear weapons?\n  What will others in the world, in North Korea--whose march to nuclear \nweapons on a greater scale is in play--all of them will be looking at \nwhat we and the West do as it relates to Ukraine and making a decision: \nHow far can I go? What can I get away with?\n  To be able to stabilize Ukraine, we need to ultimately have the \nInternational Monetary Fund. To hold that hostage because of \ninvestigations going on--wherever they may lead and however they may \nlead to the question of campaign finance moneys may be inappropriately, \nultimately, being used in violation of law--is outrageous.\n  What is at play is our national interests, our national security, the \nsovereignty of the people of the Ukraine, the message that we will send \nacross the world about what we stand ready to do. That should not be \nhostage to political interests that have nothing to do with those \nissues.\n  For all those who have been standing and making speeches, for all \nthose who have been going on TV with plenty of criticism, this is your \nopportunity to act and act now. There is no reason we cannot do that at \nthis moment.\n  I withdraw my reservation and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. I will be brief. I wish to say first to the leader, we \ncertainly have had some discussions regarding operations on the Senate \nfloor and the speed with which we deal with things and the amount of \ndebate, but I thank him for trying to bring this issue to a vote today.\n  I thank him for what he is going to do in a moment; that is, to file \ncloture on this piece of legislation that passed out of our committee \nwith strong bipartisan support, so that immediately when we get back we \nwill take up the bill.\n  I wish we could do it tonight. We have a group of seven or eight \nSenators on their way to Ukraine. Nothing would be better than for them \nto know we passed this strong piece of legislation this week, while \nthere is going to be a referendum that is going to take place early \nnext week in Crimea, while we have Russian troops on the border, while \nwe have a Prime Minister who was here last night showing extreme \ncourage, as a 39-year-old young man, in dealing with the issues he is \nfacing today.\n  I lament the fact that we are not going to have the opportunity as a \nbody--the most deliberative body in the world, some say--to take action \non this issue.\n  I do wish to say that whenever we bring up the bill--it appears it \nwill not be tonight; hopefully it will be as soon as we get back--this \nis a strong piece of legislation. It deals both with giving Ukraine a \nbridge to the future while\n\n[[Page S1635]]\n\nthey are dealing with economic issues internally; it deals with \nsanctions to isolate Russia, which is what we all know needs to happen \nto keep them from continuing this activity; and it puts in place \nreforms our country has already agreed to that Congress has not taken \naction on--and that makes the IMF more fully able to deal with this \nissue, which is a poster child for why we would want the IMF to operate \nin a responsible and strong manner.\n  I strongly support this legislation. I thank the chairman for working \nwith us the way he did. I thank Senator McCain for his leadership on \nthese issues.\n  Again, I thank the majority leader for placing this in an urgent \nmanner before the Senate today. I lament the fact that we will not vote \non it today, but hopefully we will pass it broadly when we return.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object, I am going to be brief, \nbut I wish to make this point, that it is rare we take an action in the \nSenate that is watched around the world, and that is happening tonight. \nThat is happening tonight because the crisis in Ukraine and in the \nCrimea has focused the attention of the world on Russian aggression, \naggression by a country which hosted the Sochi Olympics--a charm \noffensive so we could see the new Russia--and then the final day of the \nceremonies they sent their troops into Crimea.\n  That isn't the new Russia. That is the old Russia. It is a Russia \nmany of us are familiar with, a Russia for those of us who have \nLithuanian blood. My mother was born there and remembered full well \nwhat the Soviets did in the Baltics and what it meant to those poor \npeople for such a long time.\n  We remember and we know that the ambitions of Vladimir will only be \nstopped with the resolve of the West. The resolve of the West starts in \nthis Chamber tonight. It is an opportunity for Members on both sides of \nthe aisle to stand and approve the measure which passed the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee yesterday 14 to 4, with the great \nleadership of Senator Menendez of New Jersey and Senator Corker of \nTennessee.\n  It was a bipartisan effort to say that what the Russians have done is \nwrong; that if they continue this course we will initiate political and \neconomic sanctions; and that we will join the international community \nin strengthening the Ukrainian economy so it can prosper, embrace \ndemocracy, and the Western values which we treasure. That is what is at \nstake with this request this evening.\n  To hear people say let's not do it because we should debate the \nfuture of the IMF--for goodness' sake. Can't we save that for another \nday.\n  For the people in Ukraine, for those in America of Ukrainian descent \nwho have family in Ukraine, can't we say we will save the debate on the \nIMF for another day.\n  Others have suggested there is another course of action. They say if \nwe want to help Ukraine, we have to say the U.S. Department of Treasury \ncannot investigate violations of 501(c)(4) organizations.\n  What does that have to do with Ukraine? Nothing.\n  This is what it boils down to. Those who are making that demand are \nsaying we cannot protect Ukraine unless we are prepared to protect the \nKoch brothers from the possibility of investigation and prosecution for \nwrongdoing. That is what it comes down to. That is an outrage. If we \nsubmitted that as a plot line to ``House of Cards,'' they would reject \nit and say nothing could be so outlandish. We have heard it not once \nbut many times.\n  Let's stand tonight in the Senate and send a message to Russia and to \nUkraine that we stand behind those people whose lives are at stake as \nthey try to move forward toward democracy and as they move forward \ntoward a free election. Let's stand behind them tonight and not hide \nbehind some procedural effort.\n  I object to this measure and I hope the unanimous consent request is \nagreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, reserving the right to object, today \nRussia's Defense Ministry announced new military operations in regions \nalong the Ukrainian border, a disturbing development that comes 1 day \nafter Ukraine's interim Prime Minister visited President Obama and met \nwith Members of this body.\n  We are now faced with the inescapable reality that the Senate is \nabout to enter a recess week, having taken no meaningful action to aid \nthe interim government in Kiev. We are left with one option, taking up \nand passing the House-passed bill, which authorizes $1 billion in loan \nguarantees. We can pass that measure now by unanimous consent and \nassure our friends in Ukraine that they are not forgotten.\n  The Senate Foreign Relations Committee bill contains provisions \nrelated to the International Monetary Fund that are unrelated to the \ncrisis in Ukraine and not needed immediately and must be debated by \nthis body.\n  The bill also contains sanctions, cuts to the Department of Defense, \nand other appropriations provisions.\n  The Foreign Relations Committee bill touches the jurisdiction of \nseveral committees and is certain to be met with opposition and perhaps \na protracted conference with the House where, were we to take it up \ntoday, in the face of Russian armored vehicles, we are offering \nrhetoric, despite the fact that the committee bill addresses \njurisdiction within the Armed Services Committee, the Appropriations \nCommittee, and cuts Defense Department spending.\n  The chairman of the committee refused yesterday to allow me to offer \namendments concerning the export of natural gas to markets in Europe. \nThe Senate should debate whether helping Ukrainians through the export \nof natural gas is in our interest, as dozens of newspapers around the \ncountry talk about Moscow tightening the squeeze on Ukraine over \nenergy.\n  The Washington Post says: ``Europe needs an alternative to Russian \nnatural gas.''\n  The Wall Street Journal: ``West Tries to Loosen Russia's Gas Grip.''\n  The New York Times: ``U.S. Hopes Boom in Natural Gas Can Curb \nPutin.''\n  The Senate should debate whether helping the Ukrainians through the \nexport of natural gas is in our interest. It should have that debate \nand pass sanctions, but none of those matters can be addressed today--\nnone of them.\n  The only bill that can get to the President quickly is the House-\npassed bill, and we should pass it now.\n  I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 4152\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of Calendar No. 328, H.R. 4152.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read a third time and passed \nand the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I was talking to my friend, the senior Senator from \nArizona, a little while ago. He and I came to the Senate together many \nyears ago from the House of Representatives.\n  We came to the Senate together. We were separated because Arizona has \nmore people and Nevada seniority. During those many years that we have \nbeen together, we have had some experiences in the Senate that are \nmemorable. I don't know as much--and that is an understatement--about \nmilitary preparedness and the military as John McCain does. That is a \ngross understatement. He is somebody we should listen to when it comes \nto things dealing with aggression and military operations.\n\n  Ukraine is kind of personal to me. A baby was born. His parents named \nhim Israel Goldfarb. He, with his parents, came to the United States. \nHis name was changed. That man is my wife's dad, my father-in-law. He \nwas born in Ukraine. My wife Landra and I have been to Ukraine. But \nthis is dealing with more than someone's father-in-law, may he rest in \npeace; it deals with 45 million freedom-loving people who are being \nthreatened by the big bear wanting to return to the days of the Soviet \nUnion.\n\n[[Page S1636]]\n\n  So for my friend, the Senator from Wyoming, to come here and say \nthere is nothing we can do about this today, that is absolutely wrong. \nThere is plenty we can do about it today. But we are not going to do \nthat. Why? Well, my friend says there are committees who are concerned \nabout jurisdiction.\n  How do the people in Ukraine feel about that one? How do they feel \nabout that--that the bipartisan heavy vote we got out of the markup in \nthe Foreign Relations Committee may have stepped on someone's toes \ndealing with the jurisdiction of a committee? This is much more \nimportant than that.\n  The International Monetary Fund is very much related to Ukraine, and \nmy friend from Wyoming knows that. He is on the committee. He knows \nabout the importance of the IMF.\n  But 45 million people are desperate for help. They are afraid. They \nare afraid. Russia has deployed paratroopers to the border with \nUkraine. They didn't drive in; they were dropped from the air. These \nare Russian Cold War tactics.\n  I want to make a suggestion to President Putin, and that is this. He \nis going to have this plebiscite on Sunday in Crimea. Why doesn't he \nhave one in Chechnya? What would happen there? Would they support \nRussia? No. They are an oppressed people because of Vladimir Putin. If \nhe wants to have a vote on what the people of the Russian Federation \nwant to do, let him have a vote in Chechnya and see how that vote would \nturn out. This is so transparent what he is doing--illegally.\n  These are Cold War tactics to try to intimidate the 45 million people \nin Ukraine. That is just what it is--intimidation. The entire world \ncondemns what he has done with rare exception, and they are going to \ncondemn it even more if he goes further because action will have to be \ntaken to isolate Russia and its economy. This robust bill which was \npassed by the Foreign Relations Committee and sent to the floor is \nimportant.\n  I don't throw around a lot of accolades, especially for my Republican \ncolleagues. I should do more, but I don't, and I have to get better at \nthat. But I have told him personally, and I tell the people of \nTennessee and the people of this country and the people around the \nworld that the speech that was given yesterday by the ranking member of \nthat committee, the junior Senator from Tennessee, was historic. It was \na wonderful speech that set aside all partisanship and directed its \nattention to what is going on in a part of the world that must concern \nus.\n  This measure that comes from the House of Representatives, I can't do \nbetter than what the senior Senator from Arizona said. How could we \nsend eight of our Senators to Ukraine and say: Yes, we decided to do \nsomething, but we are not going to do anything to suggest in any way \nthat what Russia has done is wrong. There is not a sanction that would \ncause anything to happen with what the House has done. I can't \nimagine--I can't imagine--how anyone in good conscience, after what has \ngone on in the last few days--how anyone could agree that our great \ncountry should go to Ukraine and tell them that we have passed \nsomething that helps you, although we don't condemn Russia in any \nfashion in the resolution. We are being asked to agree to that? I don't \nthink so.\n  The role of the IMF in stabilizing Ukraine's economy and keeping \nUkraine free is important. But it is important not only for the \nUkrainians; it is important for this country. It is a part of our \nnational security interests.\n  So we know people are upset about committee jurisdiction, and we know \nbecause it is out in public. I have kept this to myself for quite some \ntime because it was done when we were doing other things, such as the \nomnibus. Efforts were made at that time to give up on the \ninvestigations of the Koch brothers and all the others. Remember, \nTreasury is not investigating only Republican super PACs. They are \ninvestigating super PACs, as they should--Republican super PACs, tea \nparty super PACs, libertarian super PACs--all of them. If that isn't \nsomething that should be investigated, I don't know what is.\n  I have talked about Senator McCain's efforts in recognizing and \nidentifying for us, and we listen because of his experience in the \nmilitary. But we should also listen to what he says about campaign \nspending. I am sorry to take so long. I know people are wanting to \nleave, but I want to say this. I have been a part of raising money here \nin Washington for a long time--more than three decades. When I first \ncame here, for the only money you could get you listed where they \nworked, their address, and everything about them. Then we all will \nremember both parties found a way to sneak stuff through. We did it \nthrough corporations. We funneled the money through State parties, and \nI remember that. I felt so unclean, for lack of a better description. \nPeople would give you these big checks to give to the State party. Then \nMcCain-Feingold passed. For the next election it was as if I had taken \na bath--a bath after having run a marathon.\n  John McCain understands why we need to investigate all this soft \nmoney--the super PAC money. When he says it, we should listen. Maybe \nour colleagues don't want to listen to me, but they should listen to \nJohn McCain because he has a record of substantiating his efforts in \nthat regard.\n  So this thing is being objected to--what we are trying to do here to \nprotect the 45 million in Ukraine--because of this investigation of the \nKoch brothers and others. I am not going to get into the details about \nsocial welfare organizations and all that, but we all know they are \npolitical front groups that spend millions of dollars in misleading \nads, and it is unfortunate.\n  So it is too bad we have this. It is hard to believe that some are so \nwedded to the Koch brothers and others that they would torpedo a bill \nthat is vital to the national security of this country and the freedom \nof tens of millions of Ukrainians and the birthplace of my wife's dad. \nThis is wrong, and I am very disappointed in my friend from Wyoming \nthat he would come forward and do this. I have to tell you it takes a \nlot of courage because there isn't a lot of academic integrity in that. \nStrike the word integrity. There isn't a lot of foundation for what he \nhas done. It is unreasonable. It is unfair and it is without \nsubstantiation, and I object.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I know the Senator from Alabama wants to speak, and I \nassure him I will not remain on the floor to hear it because I know \nwhat the Senator from Alabama is going to say that has something to do \nwith paying for it out of defense spending. I will match my record with \nthe Senator from Alabama on defense spending anytime, day or night.\n  The fact is, this money is taken out of programs that were already \ncanceled and were going to be returned to the Treasury. If they had \nbeen used for defense, then it would have busted the budget agreement \nthe Senator from Alabama has so stoutly defended time after time. So in \na bit of preemption of the Senator from Alabama, his argument is wrong \nthat this is taking money out of defense. He is dead wrong.\n  So all I would say to my colleagues is that the Senator from Wyoming \ncame down and wants us to take up and pass a bill passed by the House \nof Representatives which has not a single binding sanction in it--not \none. Not one binding sanction in it. Not one strong message to the \npeople of Ukraine that we are supporting them.\n  Russia's defense ministry announced: New military operations in \nseveral regions near the Ukrainian border on Thursday. Even as \nChancellor Angela Merkel warned the operations came as Ukraine's Acting \nPresident Oleksandr V. Turchynov--the Acting President of the Ukraine \nwas quoted by Ukrainian news media as saying Russian forces amassed \nnear the border were ready to invade.\n  So we now have Russian forces ready to invade a sovereign nation, and \nwhat are we talking about? An IMF fix. Suppose the Senator from Alabama \nwas right and this sum of money is being taken out of national defense. \nHow much money are we going to have to spend on national defense if \nVladimir Putin goes unchecked throughout Europe?\n  The next target, by the way, will be the Baltic countries because \nthey have Russian speaking populations as well, and we may have to have \nprovocations\n\n[[Page S1637]]\n\nthere; Moldova, where Russia occupies Transnistria; Georgia, where \nRussia occupies Abkhazia and South Ossetia. But what are we arguing \nabout? Whether the IMF fix is appropriate or not. What are we arguing \nabout? Whether it is in dispute as to whether this is actually some \nreduction in defense spending. Where in the world are our priorities? \nWhere in the world is our sympathy and our concern and our need to \nsupport the people of Ukraine in this hour of need?\n  I don't want to go on too long, but the issue of natural gas, we all \nknow that is the way out of it long term. Does anybody think including \na provision on natural gas is going to have any effect whatsoever on \nevents that are now happening and will happen in the next few days? Of \ncourse not. I am a strong supporter of getting natural gas to these \ncountries, but it is not going to happen in the next days, weeks, \nmonths or maybe even years. So to use that is an excuse, of course, \nagain.\n  I have watched in the last few months two fool's errands. One was \nwhen we shut down the government. We were all so proud we shut down the \ngovernment, turned away 600,000 people from our national parks, took \n$27 million out of the economy of my State on a fool's errand that was \nnot going to succeed. Now we see another fool's errand because the \nmajority leader will file cloture and there will be well over 60 votes, \nand 10 or 11 or however many days from now we will pass it and these \nsanctions will be enacted.\n  In the meantime--in the meantime--the first message to the people of \nUkraine, who have Russians--in the view of the Ukrainian President--\nready to invade, is that we are telling them no, because we don't agree \nwith an IMF fix or we think the money may be or may not be coming out \nof defense.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Will the Senator yield for a brief question?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will be glad to.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank the Senator.\n  Senator McCain and I were in Ukraine at the end of last year. We had \nthe privilege to speak on the Maidan in front of about half a million \npeople, maybe even a million people who were there protesting the \ncurrent government, the corruption that had reined free, their decision \nto move away from an orientation towards Europe. After Senator McCain's \nremarks, the crowd rose up with the chant of ``Thank you, USA. Thank \nyou, USA.''\n  Wherever we went during that trip, as we heard also from the new \nprime minister yesterday, they were desperate for the help of the \nUnited States. They are grateful for the fact that both the House and \nthe Senate are moving forward on the issue of providing loan \nguarantees--loan guarantees that aren't nearly enough. That is why we \nneed to have the IMF reforms, so they can deliver the bulk of the \nassistance. But they feel as though they are standing virtually alone \nas Russia marches across their borders, and desperately want the United \nStates to lead an international consensus to make it clear to the \nRussians there is a price to be paid.\n\n  The Russians marched into Crimea in large part because they didn't \nbelieve the United States and Europe would enact the crippling \nsanctions which would have otherwise caused them to make a different \ndecision. What this moment could be about, right now on the floor of \nthe Senate, as we head back over to Ukraine to again express our \nsupport, is there is bipartisan consensus in the Senate and the House \nthat we are not only going to stand with them on the question of \neconomic support, but we are going to enact a set of sanctions which \nwill make Russia consider a different decision.\n  My question to Senator McCain is: As important as economic support \nis, that is not what they are asking for here. They are not asking for \npassage of the House bill. They are asking for the United States, as we \nhave time and time again, to lead an international consensus to send a \nstrong message to Russia. We are going to go over there and I believe \nhave a good series of meetings this weekend, but we could have had a \nmuch stronger message brought to them if we had answered their call \nultimately to provide them economic support and stand with our partners \nin Europe, sending a strong message to the Russians.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend from Connecticut. I say if we take up \nand pass the House bill, it does one thing: It gives them loan \nguarantees for $1 billion. There is not one other single binding \nprovision in the House bill which my colleague from Wyoming wanted to \ntake up and pass, instead of this bill, which went through the \ncommittee--with the input, by the way, of the administration. There is \nbipartisan and administration cooperation on it.\n  I urge my colleagues to read the provisions of this bill. They are \ntough. They are tough, enforceable provisions which will make Vladimir \nPutin and his kleptocratic oligarchy uncomfortable.\n  And, by the way, one of the reasons why Vladimir Putin is doing what \nhe is doing is he is afraid a free, independent, and noncorrupt Ukraine \non his border might send a message to the Russian people who are sick \nand tired of him anyway.\n  Sanctions on persons in the Russian Federation, complicit in or \nresponsible for significant corruption, are a major provision of this \nbill; Sanctions on persons responsible for violence or undermining the \npeace, security, stability, sovereignty, or territorial integrity of \nUkraine. There are many other provisions in this bill which are binding \nwhich will make life very uncomfortable.\n  Instead, my dear friend--and he is my dear friend--from Wyoming wants \nto take up and pass a bill which has one thing, and one thing only, and \nthat is a $1 billion loan guarantee. By the way, the EU has just given \nthem $15 billion.\n  So all I can say is we will pass this legislation, and we will go and \nwe will assure our Ukrainian friends that this bill will be passed and \nwe will act.\n  I hope people at home who know Ukraine and know the people of Ukraine \nand know the friends and relatives and others will make it known to \ntheir elected representatives that for us to sit by and not help these \npeople would be writing a disgraceful chapter in American history.\n  I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, if I could add to the comments of \nSenator McCain.\n  Last night we all met with the Prime Minister. They don't even need \nthis economic aid today. They have to sign an IMF agreement first. It \nis weeks before they even need what the Senator from Wyoming wished to \npass.\n  On the other hand, what we are trying to do is push Russia back. As \nthe leader mentioned, this bill has tough sanctions. And, by the way, \nEurope is meeting on Monday to begin looking at the sanctions they want \nto put in place. So if we were to pass the sanctions which we have in \nthis bill--which are tough sanctions, sanctions which we have never \nimposed before, sanctions on economic extortion, sanctions on \ncorruption--what that would do is help boost the European community \nalong to do the same thing, and our goal here is to isolate Russia to \nkeep them from continuing to put pressure on Ukraine.\n  So I couldn't agree more. Why would we pass a bill which does no good \nas it relates to trying to push Russia back and isolate them, when we \nhave an opportunity right now to pass a bill which shows we are willing \nto isolate Russia and actually give strength to what the European \ncommunity is getting ready to do hopefully this next week.\n  So I agree. I wish we were taking up the bill which we all worked on \ntogether and passed by a huge bipartisan majority, and I wish we could \nsend you all with the sanctions in hand, passed out of the Senate, to \nshow the people of Ukraine that while militarily there may not be \ninvolvement, we stand together with them to do everything we can to \nisolate Russia, to isolate Putin, and to make sure economically they \npay a huge price if they try to take any other actions in this area. So \nI agree with the Senator.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand). The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, there has been an objection. I think \nunfairly, there has been an objection. Everyone should understand, the \nfirst legislative matter we will take up when we get back here is going \nto be this. There is nothing I know of at this time that is more \nimportant.\n\n[[Page S1638]]\n\n  So Senators should be aware, this is nothing we are going to run \nfrom. We are going to act on it as soon as we get back. It is really \ntoo bad we haven't been able to move forward. We should have. We could \nhave. We are not going to. But we are going to move to it as soon as we \nget back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, what has happened in Ukraine is a real \ndisaster. It should never have happened. It is so bad, and it reflects \na weakness in American foreign policy which goes deep. The American \npeople understand that. I think the whole world is baffled at the lack \nof clarity in American foreign policy. I would say, if John McCain had \nbeen elected President and were President today, we would have never \nhad this invasion by the Soviet Russians into Ukraine and Crimea.\n  This is a big problem. It is not going away. It is a very deep and \nserious problem.\n  The fundamental thing we can do today--and we should do today--is \nmove forward with what the United States can contribute to this \nsituation, which is to pass the $1 billion loan fund. The European \nUnion is doing their $15 billion through the IMF. Why don't we do that? \nWhy don't we do that?\n  The reason is, this leadership is determined to push forward a policy \nchange in the International Monetary Fund which has been up here before \nthe Congress since 2010 and has not been passed and does not have to be \npassed today. They have insisted on that.\n  They have placed Ukraine in second place through their reforms which \nthey have been pushing for with the IMF, and there are serious problems \nwith that. It gives Russia more clout, among other things; not a lot, \nbut it gives them more clout in the International Monetary Fund. And it \ncosts money and violates the budget.\n  I am the ranking member on the Budget Committee. It is subject to a \nbudget point of order. There is no doubt about that. Anybody can \nsuggest otherwise if they want to, but it violates the budget, and we \nought not to be doing this in violation of the budget. We don't have \nto.\n  But this administration negotiated with Senator McCain and Senator \nCorker and the Democratic leadership in the Senate and they agreed this \nwould be the policy. Not what the House passed. But they would add more \nto it, they would reform the IMF, and then we are all just supposed to \naccept it.\n  I told the Senator from Tennessee--a very fine Senator--I am ranking \nmember on the Budget Committee. He knows that. We have worked together \nto try to adhere to the spending limits Congress has imposed on \nourselves. We just voted on this. Ten weeks ago the President signed \nthis reform which raised the spending but limited it, and they want to \nspend more in a way which is not legitimate. So I am baffled.\n  Why in the world would we not take advantage of the--yes, what the \nHouse has sent to us, pass this legislation, and allow us to make our \nindividual contribution of $1 billion? And, by the way, we are scoring \nit at about $350 million because it is unlikely we will be fully paid \nback.\n  So why don't we do that? Is it pride? Is it pique? Is it politics? I \ncan't imagine. So you don't get everything you want, colleagues. Take \nwhat you can get. It is really the only thing which amounts to anything \nnow. The IMF has put up $15 billion. They don't need this reform to do \ntheir loan, their aid to Ukraine. They don't need this legislation for \nthat. Why is it so important?\n  Senator Durbin said: Well, why can't we debate this another day. \nRight. Why can't we debate the IMF another day? But if his bill were to \npass, the debate is over; the law the President wants to pass would \npass, without congressional involvement in it.\n  Members of Congress have been dealing with these issues for a long \ntime. It is a serious question. It does not need to be here today on \nthis legislation. It just does not.\n  I have warned our colleagues that we do not need to be passing \nlegislation which is not paid for in this fashion, and I would object \nto it. They had time here to fix it, but no attempt was made to fix it.\n  It is a little disturbing to me to see our colleagues, who have \nthemselves decided what the best solution is, come to the floor and \nattack those of us who have a good-faith objection to it, when we are \nperfectly prepared to support the fundamental thing which needs to be \ndone--and that is the $1 billion loan package the United States has \nagreed to fund, the House has agreed to support, I support, virtually \nevery Member of Congress supports. But not this big reform package of \nIMF which is not justified.\n  I feel deeply this is a big mistake. Why in the world we wouldn't act \ntoday and take yes for an answer, I can't imagine. It goes beyond what \nI think is realistic.\n  I would conclude by saying again, something is very wrong with the \nforeign policy of the United States of America. Whether we reform the \nIMF is not going to send a message to Russia. The idea that somehow we \nare going to affect them by exactly what has passed here today I \nbelieve is incorrect. I believe fundamentally this package is what we \ncan do, what we should do, and we should do it today. Then we should \ncome back and be prepared to impose serious sanctions or whatever the \nPresident asks for.\n  Finally, I am disappointed the President of the United States is not \nmore consultative with Congress in order to determine what legislation \nwe need to pass and would continue to insist on passing reform \nlegislation of the International Monetary Fund, which, in all \nlikelihood, will be rejected by the House.\n  I feel as though we are through the looking glass here. I hate that \ntensions are so high. But if we would take yes for an answer, pass this \nHouse bill, come back and have a full evaluation of reform of IMF, and \npass sanctions as we go forward, that would be the right thing for us \nto do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I commend the Senator from Alabama and the \nSenator from Wyoming for their leadership on this important issue.\n  The crisis in Ukraine has riveted our attention for the last 4 months \nas we have seen brave men and women standing in freezing cold, standing \nfor freedom, standing for their desire to stand with the West, to stand \nwith Europe, to stand with America, and to be free from the domination \nof Putin's Russia.\n  We all strongly support the efforts of the Ukrainian people to choose \na different path from subjugation to Russia, to choose a path toward \neconomic and political liberty and toward a close friendship with the \nWest.\n  Madam President, all of us on both sides of the Chamber are united in \ndecrying the military aggression of Russian strongman Vladmir Putin, as \nhe has invaded a sovereign nation with military force, committing an \nact of war. No one should be confused as to what Mr. Putin is \nattempting to do. Indeed, acting Ukraine Prime Minister Yatsenyuk said \nvery clearly that Putin is trying to reestablish the borders of the old \nSoviet Union. He is expanding, sadly, into a vacuum of leadership the \nUnited States has not been filling. Russia is filling that vacuum, and \nthe seizure of Crimea is only the beginning of Putin's aggressiveness. \nHe will continue, I would predict, to be aggressive unless and until he \nmeets significant resistance.\n  We are also united in believing there is an important role for the \nUnited States to play in responding to this crisis. I believe we should \ntake concrete actions to respond to Russia's invasion of Crimea.\n  No. 1, we should press to expel Russia from the G8.\n  No. 2, the administration should immediately begin enforcing the \nMagnitsky Act--which he has failed to do up to this point--designed to \npunish human rights atrocities by Russian Government officials. Indeed, \nwe should expand it to include Ukranian human rights abusers.\n  No. 3, we should immediately install the ballistic missile batteries \nin Eastern Ukraine that were scheduled to go in that President Obama \nmistakenly canceled in an effort to appease Mr. Putin. That effort did \nnot succeed, and we should go forward with allowing eastern Europe to \ndefend itself.\n  Additionally, there is a great deal we can do to aid the people of \nUkraine.\n\n[[Page S1639]]\n\nThe President should immediately offer the Government of Ukraine a \nfree-trade agreement indicating that their goods are welcome in the \nUnited States and our goods in their country.\n  We should explore other options to assist them in economic recovery \nconsistent with free market principles, including moving as \nexpeditiously as possible to allow them access to U.S. energy exports \nand in particular liquidified natural gas. Russia uses natural gas and \nenergy as a tool of economic blackmail. It is critical to the source of \nRussia's power not just over Ukraine but over much of Europe. The \nUnited States is blessed with abundant supplies of natural gas. It is \nonly foolhardy government policy that stands in the way of our \nexporting that natural gas, meeting the need and helping Ukraine be \nfree of the economic blackmail. We should move immediately in that \nregard not just because it would help Ukraine, not just because it \nwould represent a serious blow to Russia when Russia relies on the \nrevenue from those energy exports--if the United States steps up and \nprovides it to them instead, that would be a serious economic blow to \nRussia--not just that but because it makes perfect sense from the \nperspective of the United States of America, our economic interests at \na time when we have the lowest labor rate participation since 1978. \nWhen millions of people are out of work and hurting, we should be \ndeveloping and expanding our resources, and energy provides an \nopportunity to transform the geopolitical playing field, to use our \nabundant resources in a free market manner to respond and help liberate \nthe people of Ukraine.\n  There is also a financial component of the assistance for--Ukraine \nthat it makes a world of sense should come from the International \nMonetary Fund, to which the United States is a contributor. That is \nwhat the IMF was created to do, and the IMF today stands fully capable \nof meeting that need.\n  My friend from Arizona has an admirable passion on this issue for the \npeople of Ukraine and for standing up to Mr. Putin, and I commend my \nfriend from Arizona for his passion in this regard. However, the reason \nthis bill has not passed today is because the majority of this \nChamber--the majority leader made a decision, the chairman of the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee made a decision to inject into the \naid and sanctions plan for Ukraine an extraneous issue, an issue of the \nIMF that has nothing to do with the underlying issue. That was a \nmistake. That was a mistake.\n  I would suggest that the so-called IMF reforms are misguided policy. \nThey don't make sense for four separate reasons.\n  No. 1, they are unnecessary. There is no need whatsoever for these \nreforms. Indeed, the IMF is perfectly capable of managing the task on \nhand, and estimates have shown that Ukraine aid would cost no more than \n5 percent of its current resources. So the IMF portions are \nunnecessary, extrinsic. I agree with the Speaker of the House, John \nBoehner, who says these so-called IMF reforms are unnecessary and \nextrinsic to this bill.\n  No. 2, these IMF provisions, if passed into law, would dramatically \nexpand the financial exposure of the United States of America, \neffectively doubling our contribution, expanding our exposure. If that \nis good policy, that should be debated on its merits. We should not be \nopening the U.S. taxpayers to billions in additional financial \nliability without a debate on the merits. It shouldn't be just tied to \nUkranian aid and forced through the Senate. That is the wrong approach.\n  No. 3, most inexplicably, these so-called reforms, if passed, would \ndiminish U.S. influence on the IMF; would reduce our ability to control \nthe decisions of the IMF; indeed, would move the funds from a fund in \nwhich we have veto authority into one in which we no longer have veto \nauthority. We would have a smaller portion of influence over the IMF.\n  Astonishingly, No. 4, this bill would expand Russia's influence and \ncontrol over the IMF. Let me repeat that. A bill that is being \nostensibly introduced to punish Russia for their acts of war and \naggression would expand Russia's influence over the IMF and decrease \nthe influence of the United States of America.\n\n  I agree with my friend from Alabama who suggested moments ago that \nthis is ``Through the Looking Glass.'' This makes no sense. I would \nchallenge any of my friends here to stand here and explain why a \nsensible response to what Russia has done is to expand Russia's \ninfluence in the IMF and to diminish America's influence. That makes no \nsense whatsoever.\n  Madam President, I wish to close with two points. No. 1, we could \npass aid for the people of Ukraine right now--today. The Senator from \nWyoming rose and asked for unanimous consent to pass the bill that has \nalready passed the House. Had the majority leader not stood up and \nobjected on behalf of Senate Democrats, that bill would have passed \ninto law. It would be already headed to the President's desk for \nsignature. It is only because the majority leader objected that we are \nnot sitting here today having already passed aid for the people of \nUkraine.\n  I would note, by the way, that the majority leader had extended \ncommentary about two businessmen, the Koch brothers, who I am beginning \nto think are characters almost out of ``Dr. Seuss'' in the majority \nleader's mind. They are the grinch who stole Christmas in his telling. \nI would note that the majority leader focuses on the IRS rules--not \nfocusing on the abuse of power by the IRS, the Treasury inspector \ngeneral chronicles, but instead on the need for a vote to regulate the \nIRS's abuse of power.\n  Let me say very simply that the House bill on Ukraine doesn't mention \nthe IRS at all, doesn't mention P4s at all. So when the majority leader \nstood on the floor, this is all because of the nefarious Koch brothers. \nSet aside the impropriety of the majority leader of the U.S. Senate \npicking two private citizens--individuals engaged in political speech, \nstanding up for what they believe, and the majority leader using his \nposition of political power to lambaste them, to target them.\n  Interestingly enough, the majority leader does not seem to have a \nproblem with the California billionaire who has publicly pledged to put \n$100 million behind Democrats to press them to pass climate change \nlegislation that would cost millions of jobs across this country from \nblue-collar workers, from hard-working Americans. That billionaire, in \nthe majority leader's view, is perfectly free to spend $100 million in \nthe election, but the Koch brothers, because the two of them have stood \nand expressed their views, are subjected to vilification and personal \nattack from the majority leader.\n  The Senate rules allow a Member of this body, if his or her integrity \nis impugned, to raise an objection. Let me ask you something, Madam \nPresident. What Senate rule allows a private citizen to raise an \nobjection when his integrity is impugned by the majority leader?\n  Those two brothers are not Members of this body, so they can have \ntheir reputation dragged through the mud. Yet they are denied a point \nof personal privilege to come and defend themselves. That is not the \njob of the U.S. Senate, to vilify private citizens.\n  I would note that the provision he is talking about is not in the \nHouse bill, which means when the Senator from Wyoming stood and asked \nfor consent to pass the House bill, if the majority leader had simply \nrefrained from objecting, we would have passed aid to Ukraine tonight. \nIt has nothing to do with the Koch brothers, nothing to do with the \nIRS. That is not in the House bill. The reason the majority leader \nobjected is that he wants to hold aid to Ukraine hostage to force \nthrough these misguided IMF reforms. That is the wrong decision.\n  One final point I wish to make. The world should understand, Russia \nshould understand, the people of Ukraine should understand, and Mr. \nPutin should understand that all of us are united in standing with the \npeople of Ukraine, that the United States will act. I am convinced it \nwill act decisively to impose sanctions and serious consequences on \nRussia for this unprovoked act of war. We will act decisively to stand \nwith the people of Ukraine. There should be no doubt in any observer's \nmind that this will unify both parties. We will stand together. We \nwould have done so tonight had the majority leader not made the cynical \ndecision to hold aid for Ukraine hostage to force a partisan bill that \ndoes not enjoy sufficient support in this body to pass otherwise. \nPolitics\n\n[[Page S1640]]\n\nshould end at the water's edge, and I think it is unfortunate to see \nthe majority leader trying to use the crisis in Ukraine for political \nadvantage. That is a mistake.\n  But there should be no ambiguity. We will impose sanctions. We will \nstand with Ukraine. And the people of America understand that Mr. \nPutin's aggression is reliving the days when the Soviet Union was an \nevil empire. It is reliving those days Mr. Putin called the collapse of \nthe Soviet Union ``the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of modern \ntimes.'' Well, all of us surely hope he does not succeed in his \nintentions of restoring the Soviet Union, restoring that evil empire, \nrestoring the cloud of oppression across Europe and across the world, \nand we stand united with the people of Ukraine and with the people \nsurrounding Russia in support of freedom and against his unconscionable \nact of war.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator from Texas for his comments and for \nhis eloquence. I believe he has touched on the right issues.\n  I would just add one thing. I was in Ukraine about 3 years ago; a \ndelegation was there. We met with State Department people. We met with \nTymoshenko, the fabulous leader of the Orange Revolution. She had those \nbeautiful braids in her hair like peasants in the Ukraine wear, and she \nwas concerned that she would be put in jail. I just couldn't believe \nit. The Ambassador told us she hadn't committed any crime, but she was \nplaced in jail and served 2\\1/2\\ years. They have released her now. She \nwas in a wheelchair, and you could tell she suffered from that.\n  I truly believe the people of Ukraine did a fabulous, wonderful thing \nwhen they stood for their country, for democracy. We need to stand with \nthem. I stand with them just as I stood with and defended the people of \nGeorgia when the Russians invaded Abkhazia and Ossetia.\n  I want to say unequivocally, bipartisanly, that this Congress--House \nand Senate--stands firmly with the people of the Ukraine. We want to \nhelp them. The one thing substantively we can do today that would make \na difference for the people of Ukraine is to pass this bill that \nprovides $1 billion in help to them. I truly believe we should do that. \nI am deeply disappointed that the majority insists that unless they get \ntheir reform of the International Monetary Fund that they want to see \nhappen, which is unrelated directly to the needs of Ukraine, that they \nwon't accept the legislation the House has already passed. I think that \nwould be a mistake.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                                Ukraine\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I return to the floor because I can't \nlet some of what has been said go unchallenged.\n  First of all, as it relates to the majority leader, the issue of the \nconnection that has been made between IMF reform and the C-4 \ninvestigation--the unlimited, undefined, not-known secret money that \ngoes into these entities in elections--was not first raised by the \nmajority leader. It was first raised by Senator Corker in an article. \nIt was subsequently raised today on the floor by Senator McCain. So \ncasting aspersions upon the majority leader and suggesting he is \nultimately impugning the reputation of anyone is pretty outrageous when \nthe Members of his own side of the aisle recognize that it was simply \nwrong to connect IMF reform and the ability to help Ukraine in the most \npowerful way now with some C-4 investigation.\n  Secondly, only in Washington could someone have you believe that IMF \nreforms we are promoting means more power for Russia. Yes, we are \nrushing in this Chamber--John McCain and Bob Corker are rushing into \nthis Chamber to give more power to Russia. Only in Washington could \nanybody believe that.\n  Only in Washington could someone have you believe that our other \ncolleagues on the committee who voted for the legislation to have IMF \nreform were actually voting--our Republican colleagues were voting--to \ngive Russia more power so they could continue to oppress people. It \nstretches the incredulous nature of that argument.\n  On the contrary, why are we in the mess we are in? Because when \nUkraine was having serious economic challenges, it was Putin and Russia \nthat were coming with their money, not the IMF which--in a way--might \nhave ultimately been important because the IMF needs the resources and \nthe leveraging we create by virtue of this legislation.\n  You can't divorce it. If you really want to help Ukraine, you need to \nhave the resources of the IMF that ultimately guarantees the full \nability to bring Ukraine back into economic order, and from that, build \non all the other elements of security as well.\n  Thirdly, the budget point of order: The ranking member on our \ncommittee made it very clear when he said, I want to be supportive, but \nwe have to have this paid for, and we did. People can disagree with the \npay-for, but it is paid for, which is something the House of \nRepresentatives didn't do. Let me tell you what else the House of \nRepresentatives didn't do. They didn't do anything about sanctions--\nnothing, zero, nada.\n  The bottom line is, we would send a message that, yes, we want to \npartially help Ukraine, but not in the most significant way we can, \nwhich is with IMF reform and the leveraging of the resources and our \nvoice that we would bring to them in determining their future and the \nnext crisis in the world, which is unfortunately around the corner.\n  So for those who claim they are all for helping Ukraine and national \nsecurity, they should have allowed us to have this vote tonight.\n  Lastly, with reference to my dear friend and colleague, for whom I \nhave a great deal of respect, Senator Barrasso, who said I didn't \npermit his amendment on LNG to move forward, his amendment was ruled \nout of order because it was not within the jurisdiction of the \ncommittee. The reality is on the merits of it, it is not about helping \nUkraine right now. Ukraine doesn't have the infrastructure for LNG. \nThey obviously don't have the resources to build the infrastructure for \nLNG.\n  Turkey, which controls the Bosphorus Strait, has said they are not \ngoing to let the LNG go through because of their concerns for security. \nSo the bottom line is that is not about helping Ukraine today. If all \nof that can be accomplished--infrastructure, the resources to build it, \nand getting Turkey on board--then maybe in the future that is part of a \nfurther, longer term solution, but it is not about right now.\n  What it is about right now is the loan guarantees. It is about the \nsanctions to make sure the Russians and those in Ukraine understand \nthey are going to be subject to real consequences by virtue of \ncorrupting Ukraine and undermining its territorial integrity. Lastly, \nhaving the long-term ability through the IMF to achieve the goals of \nstabilizing Ukraine economically and also preparing for the next \nemergency, that is what was at stake tonight.\n  We will get there, but when you see movements of Russian troops and \nthe circumstances that are unfolding, and I hear colleagues say, ``We \nare not doing enough,'' and then just want to do a fraction of what is \nnecessary to help the Ukraine, I begin to seriously wonder.\n  I hope the majority leader will have this as the first order of \nbusiness when we return. I think there is bipartisan support for the \npackage the way it is now. It is unfortunate that as our colleagues \ntravel to Ukraine, they can't go with the final message that this was \npassed today, but it will pass.\n  As I said to the Prime Minister of Ukraine yesterday--an \nextraordinary individual who met with members of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee--in the long history of the world, only a few are \ncalled upon to answer the call of freedom in some of its most dangerous \nmoments in history. He has been called upon to do that on behalf of his \ncountry at this time. We are called upon to stand against the \naggression and to help a country be able to do so.\n  I hope we will be able to get past this issue of linking IMF reform \nwith the whole question of campaign finance issues so we can achieve \nthat goal.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                             Defense Budget\n\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, I very much appreciate the importance \nof the discussion going on, but I would like to talk about another very \nimportant issue that is facing us. One of the\n\n[[Page S1641]]\n\nbiggest problems our country faces at the current time is one \nWashington has created--the out-of-control spending and our lack of \nfiscal discipline to put our country back on a path to fiscal \nresponsibly.\n  Last week President Obama released his budget proposal for fiscal \nyear 2015. That proposal continues Washington's reckless spending. It \noffers little in the way of real help to the millions of Americans \nstruggling to get by in this very stagnant economy, which has not been \nhelped by the President's policies.\n  What is worse is that the President finds a way to support the \nprojects and priorities of his base but can't continue our country's \ncommitment to our men and women who served and are serving our Nation \nin uniform.\n  The defense budget proposes to slash even more benefits our military \nfamilies need. The Military Officers Association of America is \nrightfully highlighting these proposed cuts to military compensation \nand health care benefits.\n  The Washington Times published a story on this topic yesterday, \nsaying retired servicemembers weighed in with frustration and anger, \nand rightfully so.\n  The proposal again caps the military pay raise at 1 percent, although \nthe private sector wage growth is 1.8 percent. MOAA, the Military \nOfficers Association, calculated what these cuts would mean to the \nbottom line of our active-duty military. An Army sergeant stands to \nlose nearly $5,000 in benefits annually and an Army captain will lose \nnearly $6,000 in benefits annually. This is certainly the wrong message \nto send to our men and women who put their lives on the line for this \ncountry.\n  When the President was elected, he promised to go through the budget \nwith a scalpel; however, the only thing he seems capable of dissecting \nis military pay and benefits.\n  I am here today to say that these cuts on our military families are \nunacceptable. I will fight to preserve the benefits our military \nfamilies were promised. Fortunately, as has been the case with the \nPresident's budgets from the past few years, this proposal will likely \nnever see the light of day. Even the majority in the Senate doesn't \nhave the desire to bring that proposal up for a vote. But this does not \nexcuse those who continue to propose savings that come at the expense \nof our men and women in uniform or those who have served us in the \npast.\n  Our military members, their families, and our veterans should not \nhave to bear the burden for Washington's irresponsible spending. Taking \naway benefits from our servicemembers has become a recurring problem. \nThis is very troubling.\n  I stood here less than 2 months ago talking about our need to restore \nmilitary retiree cuts that were unjustly taken away to help rein in \nspending. I opposed the budget agreement that cut the retirement \nbenefit of our veterans and reducing the cost-of-living adjustment \nbecause it unfairly aimed to balance the budget on the backs of our \nretired military. Now the President seems determined to continue down \nthat path.\n  We were able to restore most of those misguided military retirement \ncuts, but these benefits should have never been a target. Now the \nPresident wants to target servicemembers again. It is unconscionable \nconsidering he is intent on interjecting the Federal Government into \nprivate sector labor issues. He wants to force private entities to \nraise wages and increase benefits in a poor economy that his policies \nhave created. When it comes to our men and women in uniform, he is all \nfor stripping away their hard-earned benefits so he can continue to \nredistribute wealth, raise taxes, and increase Federal spending another \n$1 trillion.\n  We need to keep the promise we made to our servicemembers and \nmaintain these benefits. Washington needs to find savings somewhere \nelse. It can and must be done.\n  With that, I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Madam President, I come to the Senate floor today to \ndiscuss an issue of enormous importance to my State, our country, and \nfuture generations.\n  I thank my colleagues for bringing attention to the critical issue of \nclimate change earlier this week. This is a pressing problem that needs \nto be addressed and too often gets pushed to the back burner.\n  As a Senator from North Carolina, I represent a State that is home to \nsome of our country's most treasured landmarks and most precious \nnatural resources--from the Great Smoky Mountains in the west to the \nUwharrie National Forest in the Piedmont to Cape Hatteras National \nSeashore in the east.\n  Like so many North Carolinians, my family and I love spending time \ntogether outdoors whether it is hiking, fishing, biking, or just \nenjoying the views and being outside.\n  Visitors from across the country travel to North Carolina to \nexperience the Blue Ridge Parkway in the fall or to take a vacation on \nthe Outer Banks in the summer. Tourism is an important part of our \nState's economy--generating $25 billion in economic activity and \nsupporting over 390,000 jobs in my State. However, rising temperatures \nand extreme weather are putting those landmarks and resources at risk.\n  In 2012, North Carolina experienced a total of 40 broken heat \nrecords, 4 broken snow records, 13 broken precipitation records, and 19 \nlarge wildlifes.\n  Since 2000, North Carolina has issued 14 disaster declarations from \nsevere storms and flooding. This extreme weather doesn't just \njeopardize the beauty of our coastline or put our forest at risk for \nwildfires, it also affects our economy and impacts people's everyday \ndaily lives.\n  In 2011 Hurricane Irene ravaged our coast and affected approximately \n1.3 million North Carolinians. Roads and highways were destroyed, homes \nand businesses were left inaccessible. The damage left some families \nwith no other option but to live in tents.\n  The storm decimated tourism for the eastern part of our State at the \nheight of the tourist season. The region got back on its feet only to \nbe hit again a year later by Hurricane Sandy, which totally sliced \nthrough Highway 12, which is the lifeline of the Outer Banks. It cut it \nright down the middle.\n  This changing weather impacts another key part of North Carolina's \neconomy, agriculture, which is our State's biggest industry. \nAgriculture generates $77 billion in economic activity and employs \nnearly one-fifth of our workforce.\n  Last year record rainfall flooded several counties in North Carolina, \nand our farmers lost tens of millions of dollars' worth of food crops. \nTomatoes were wrought with disease. In some fields half of all of the \nsweet corn had been destroyed. Experts predicted losses could double \nfor producers, some of whom are thinking twice before they plant a crop \nnext year.\n  We are seeing the very real impact climate change is having on my \nState and its economy today. In the absence of action, this extreme \nweather is here to stay. Recent reports have shown that by 2099 climate \nchange could increase temperatures by as much as 10.5 degrees \nFahrenheit and cause over 1,000 more heat-related deaths just in my \nhometown of Greensboro. By midcentury, Greensboro is expected to \nincrease from a historical average of 8 heat-excessive days in the \nsummer to 59 and to reach a total of 70 days by the end of the century. \nThis current path is unsustainable, and we must take steps now to slow \nand stop the effects of climate change.\n  This is a challenge that will need to be addressed from many \ndifferent directions, but I am proud of the steps we took in North \nCarolina when I was in the State senate to invest in energy innovation. \nA bill I worked on in 2007 made North Carolina the only Southeastern \nState with a mandatory renewable energy standard, requiring electrical \nutilities to meet up to 12.5 percent of their energy needs through \nrenewable sources by 2021. We also enacted the Clean Smokestacks Act in \n2012, which made significant emission reductions from coal-fired \npowerplants in North Carolina and Tennessee.\n  I am proud of those accomplishments, but we must do more. I believe \nNorth Carolina and the United States are well positioned to lead and to \ntake advantage of opportunities in the 21st-century energy economy.\n  I look at North Carolina's Research Triangle Park, which has become \nan international model for bringing together industry, research \ninstitutions,\n\n[[Page S1642]]\n\nand government to help develop clean energy technologies that reduce \ncarbon emissions and make our country less dependent on fossil fuels. \nCompanies and institutions across North Carolina are developing ways to \nreduce energy more efficiently, harnessing smart grid technologies and \nusing renewables to provide new, power-intensive data centers in my \nState.\n  While addressing carbon emissions presents new economic \nopportunities, we must also be sure to minimize any economic burdens on \nthe least fortunate and make efforts to ensure that we do not harm our \nglobal economic competitiveness.\n  The challenge before us is great, but if we come together, Democrats \nand Republicans, we can move forward with commonsense measures that \nreduce emissions, increase our energy independence, and put the United \nStates back on a sustainable path, all while getting the people of this \ngreat country back to work.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, as we wrestle with the Ukraine \nsituation, I hope we can--I wish we could have gotten together to be \nable to pass the core responsibility of this Congress, which would be \nto allow the loan program to go through--a $1 billion loan program that \nI think everybody in the House and the Senate agrees on, Republicans \nand Democrats. It was, in fact, complicated and made impossible tonight \nbecause the majority insisted that IMF reform, which is opposed and is \nunrelated to the Ukraine, be a part of this legislation. The House has \nnot passed it. I don't think the House will pass it. So why were they \ninsisting on that and refusing to take the money we were able to give \ntonight? It is just baffling to me.\n  I appreciate Senator Menendez. He has shown real leadership and \ninsight into international relations. He chairs the Foreign Relations \nCommittee. I don't mean to attack his integrity or anything of that \nnature, but he is incorrect in saying this bill is paid for or doesn't \nviolate the budget. It absolutely violates the budget. The \nCongressional Budget Office has analyzed the numbers, and they have \nconcluded just what my Budget Committee staff has concluded, which is \nthat it violates the budget. The numbers are plain.\n  Look, a lot of things around here are not perfect, but the idea that \nwe would insist on passing International Monetary Fund reform that does \nnot have to be a part of this bill and is not related to this \nsituation, is going to cost $315 million to fund that program, that \nreform, which is very controversial, and half of the money explicitly \ncomes from the Defense Department--Air Force missiles and Army \nprocurement and aviation--at a time when the Russian army is occupying \nthe Crimea in the Ukraine, we want to now cut the Defense Department \nand the Army of the United States even more.\n  The Budget Control Act has really tightened the military's defense \nbudget. They are doing all they can do to meet that budget. I have \ntried to support the budget. I believe all of us need to tighten our \nbelts. But I will just say this: We don't need to take more money out \nof the Defense Department budget at a time when we are already asking \nthem to take unprecedented reductions. I feel strongly about that. It \nis disturbing to me that we have not reached that agreement.\n  In fact, what has happened is the Defense Department was forced to \nmake some tough decisions, so they rescinded some of the money they \nhad, and they intended to use it on other priorities, things they need \nto spend the money on. They made tough choices. What has Congress come \nin here now to do? Reach in there and take the money the Defense \nDepartment was trying to save so they can move it to something of high \npriority and spend it on this program. There is $4 trillion in U.S. \nGovernment spending. We can't find some other place to find this money? \nAren't there legitimate offsets that don't violate the budget?\n  For the most part, all of these offsets for both programs are not \nlegitimate. They are basically gimmes. We need to get away from that. \nWe need honesty in budgeting. We really do need it. When we have a \npriority we want to act on, such as this Ukraine situation, there are \nplenty of opportunities for us to identify lesser priority spending and \ntake that money and spend it. That is what the Defense Department was \ndoing when they executed rescissions. They were making choices, setting \npriorities.\n  We should not do this. It is not a little bitty matter. Frankly, the \nHouse needs to be more careful about how they do their business. The \nbill they sent over here has problems with it. But to take another \nwhack at a controversial program--$315 million--and take half the money \nfrom the military is really unacceptable.\n  I warned people about this in advance, but they persisted. They \nthought they could get to the last minute and they would stand here on \nthe floor and emotionally argue that our objection had something to do \nwith not caring about or being supportive of the people of the Ukraine, \nthat we would just fold and give it to them. Well, that day is becoming \na day of the past.\n  Somebody needs to stand here and say we are going to do these things \nright or we are going to have real problems on the floor of the Senate. \nIf I have to do it, I will do it.\n  I am proud of the Senator from Wyoming, who sought to pass the House \nbill. We just have to accept it. That is something we could do and get \nit done tonight, and I would be willing to support that. I certainly \nwant to help the Ukraine, and we can do it and do it in the right way.\n  I thank the Chair for the opportunity to speak tonight. I know we all \nlove the country, and we are going to have to wrestle now with serious \nquestions about Russia--what their agenda is, what kind of actions they \nmay be taking. There needs to be no doubt that this Senator has no \nintention of standing idly by while Russia attempts to take over \nindependent, sovereign nations on its border. It is absolutely \nunacceptable. We cannot accept it. It should not have happened. I \nbelieve if this President had been more firm and clear in his policies, \nit likely would not have happened, but it has.\n  The whole world now has to confront this crisis and deal with it. It \nis not going to be easy. I think all of us need to work hard to put our \npolitics aside on this question and try to do what is in the national \ninterests.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Last December I spoke about a news article that revealed \nanother disturbing scam perpetuated by the for-profit college industry. \nThe article reported that Corinthian Colleges, Incorporated, a \npublicly-traded corporation, that owns for-profit schools in the United \nStates and Canada, has engaged in deceptive job placement practices in \norder to artificially boost job placement rates and avoid scrutiny by \nits creditors.\n  It turns out Corinthian schools were paying employers what they \ncalled an onboarding fee of $2,000 per student so the companies would \nhire their graduates temporarily so that could be counted as an \nofficial permanent job placement.\n  Corinthian college subsidiary schools have been criticized in the \npast for having high dropout rates, high tuition, and some of the \nhighest loan default rates in the Nation. Nearly 40 percent of \nCorinthian college students who should have begun to pay their Federal \nstudent loans in 2008 were defaulting on their student loans. This is \nthe highest rate of any publicly-traded company in that sector. Yet, \nover the last 10 years Corinthian Colleges has been rewarded for its \npoor performance with $10 billion in Federal student aid. On an annual \nbasis American taxpayers fund more than 80 percent of Corinthian \nColleges' total revenue. This includes the salary of Corinthian's CEO, \nJack Massimino, who received compensation of $3.1 million in 2012, \nthanks to the taxpayers. This was seven times the average compensation \nfor presidents of public universities, which is about $440,000.\n  Corinthian also spent $400 million on marketing and admissions in \n2013, about $3,700 for each newly admitted student. How could they \nafford it? Because the taxpayers are subsidizing this for-profit \ncollege. Corinthian's marketing strategy has come under scrutiny \nrecently because it targets low-income people. Why? If you are a low-\nincome new student at Corinthian you automatically qualify for a Pell \ngrant and a college student loan. They can't wait for you to come \nthrough the door, sign the papers, and then watch what happens next. \nMost of these students falter, fail, drop out, or if they were, I \nguess, lucky--and I use that word advisedly--they end up with a \nworthless diploma. These students attracted by the prospect of a better \nlife and the dream of a college education end up far worse off, deeply \nin debt with nothing to show for it.\n  Eric Parms, an Everest college grad, completed a 9-month heating, \nventilation, and air conditioning repair program. What he ended up with \nat the end of it was a $17,000 student loan for a 9-month program on \nHVAC and no job. After he graduated he had to beg the career counselors \nat Everest to set up some interviews. Frankly, Eric wasn't worth that \nmuch to them after he graduated. They wanted him to sign up for the \nloans. He did it and they lost interest in him.\n  Finally, he was set up by career services to work in a contract \nposition laying electric wires. However, after less than 2 months on \nthe job he was laid off and cut off from any career service counseling \nat Everest College, part of the Corinthian operation.\n  The school had effectively placed Eric in a short-term internship \nprogram, and once it was over, there was no incentive for that company \nto hire him when they could vacate a space for another graduate who \nwould get a $2,000 Corinthian subsidy, so their numbers would look \nbetter to the public and to the Federal Government. Then Everest could \nshuttle in another graduate for a part-time position leading nowhere.\n  Eric lost out on the deal with a $17,000 student loan for a worthless \neducation at Everest College, part of the Corinthian family of schools. \nTo get a Georgia HVAC contractor license he needed to have significant \nwork experience and references. No one would hire him with a degree \nfrom Everest. Everest College, part of Corinthian, gave him a worthless \ndegree.\n  After reading the December article and stories like Eric's, I sent \nfour letters. One letter was to the CEO of Corinthian, asking him to \nexplain these practices and to outline steps the company is going to \ntake to put an end to it. His response to me was not surprising but \ndisappointing. Corinthian's CEO Jack Massimino, the multimillion dollar \nCEO defended the school's policies and practices. He did admit that at \none time three Everest campuses provided incentives to employees.\n  This is a scandal that has to come to an end. I tell folks \nrepeatedly, if you want to know about for-profit schools and \nuniversities in America, remember three numbers: 10 percent of high \nschool grads end up in for-profit colleges; 20 percent of all the \nFederal aid to education goes to these colleges; 46 percent of all the \nstudent loan defaults come out of these colleges. These are worthless, \nby and large. There are some exemptions, but most of them are \nworthless, and we as taxpayers are being taken to the cleaners by this \nindustry.\n  When we don't have enough money to do the important things in America \nsuch as medical research and assistance for education at good, \nworthwhile schools, we ought to say shame on ourselves for not taking a \nlook at this for-profit college industry which is fleecing the American \ntaxpayers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. First let me thank Senator Durbin for his commitment on \nthis issue. We know education is a great equalizer in America. We know \nthere are major concerns on access to higher education because of \ncosts, and that we have to do a better job to make college education \naffordable. We also have to have accountability in higher education, to \nmake sure those institutions are providing quality products to their \nstudents and are doing it in a cost-effective way, particularly when \ntaxpayers are providing a lot of the aid.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I could ask the Senator from Maryland to yield for a \nmoment.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I would be glad to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I just had a meeting with people from the Pentagon and we \ntalked about military education, members of the military who are \nseeking education while in the military through the GI bill and such. \nWe talked about some of the worst examples of for-profit schools. The \nbest example I could come up with of a worthy education through the \nmilitary is the University of Maryland. They have been doing it for \ndecades. I steer all my friends in the military and their families to \nthe flagship university in the Senator's State of Maryland. Maryland \ndoes a good job.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I am glad I yielded to my colleague. We are very proud of \nthe University of Maryland and the programs for the Department of \nDefense. We believe it is a cost-effective way and a quality education, \nexactly what the Senator from Illinois is talking about; and that is we \nhave to get value for our dollars and we have to get accountability. I \nappreciate the Senator bringing that to our attention.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/13/senate-section/article/S1644-3", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1644-S1645]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             FILING CLOTURE\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, the majority leader, the Senator from \nNevada, came to the floor last night to take exception to my criticisms \nof how the Senate operates these days.\n  I have criticized the actions of the current majority leadership, of \nwhich he is the head.\n  However, I would like to point out that I have tried to avoid \nsingling him out personally because it is not my intention to engage in \npersonal attacks or name calling.\n  Still, the fact that he takes my criticisms of the Senate's \ndysfunction so personally should tell us something.\n  Yesterday, I criticized the abuse of same-day cloture motions.\n  In response, Senator Reid said, ``He claims that I file too many \ncloture motions.''\n  Well, it often is the majority leader who files the cloture motions, \nbut sometimes it is other members of the majority leadership, and on \nrare occasions, other Senators.\n\n[[Page S1645]]\n\n  The fact is, this majority leader has instigated more of the cloture \nmotions than any leader in recent times.\n  Senator Frist filed about 72 percent of all cloture motions when he \nwas Majority Leader, Senator Daschle filed about 32 percent during his \nleadership, Senator Lott about 69 percent, and Senator Dole about 50 \npercent.\n  Senator Reid has personally filed 94 percent of all the cloture \nmotions since he became majority leader.\n  And, that is 94 percent of a much bigger number since cloture filings \nhave more than doubled under this majority leadership.\n  So if the Senator from Nevada takes my criticism of cloture abuse \npersonally, perhaps there is a reason he does.\n  He also blames Republicans for the fact that he has abused the \ncloture process, just as I predicted in my speech, which struck such a \nnerve.\n  However, I want to be absolutely clear that my criticisms were \nfocused on same-day cloture filings related to legislative business.\n  In other words, I was specifically criticizing the practice of moving \nto end consideration of a legislative matter that is subject to \namendment before there has been an opportunity for any debate or \namendments.\n  The majority leader went off on a tangent complaining about how many \nnominees are waiting for confirmation. I don't need to remind anybody \nthat the ability of the minority party to block nominees was eliminated \nusing the nuclear option. Besides, the focus of my speech was on the \nlegislative process.\n  We can argue about how much debate is too much and how many \namendments are too many. But no one can claim that same-day cloture \nmotions were in response to Republican obstruction when there hasn't \nbeen any deliberation whatsoever before they are filed.\n  The majority leader can criticize me and stoop to petty name-calling, \nbut the data I cited was from the non-partisan Congressional Research \nService.\n  This data on same-day cloture speaks for itself. His excuse, ``The \nRepublicans made me do it'' won't fly. In fact, Senator Reid has been \ncaught before trying to blame Republicans for his cloture motions.\n  The Washington Post Fact Checker gave him two Pinocchios for his \nclaim that Republicans were to blame for a record number of cloture \nmotions.\n  He tried to claim that every cloture motion represented a Republican \nfilibuster. However, the source he cited was a report by the \nCongressional Research Service containing a long section under the \nheading ``Cloture Motions Do Not Correspond With Filibusters.''\n  That heading pretty much says it all, but it contains about a page \nand a half of explanation as to why it is erroneous to claim that all \ncloture motions are in response to filibusters.\n  Certainly, cloture motions which are filed before there has been one \nword of debate cannot possibly be in response to a filibuster. Those \nare the cloture motions my criticism was directed at yesterday.\n  This is also the problem addressed by the Stop Cloture Abuse \nResolution which I introduced yesterday with 25 of my colleagues.\n  The majority leader did not even attempt to defend the practice of \nsame-day cloture, and understandably so. There is no justification for \nit.\n  The majority leader's refusal to acknowledge such a blatant problem, \nmuch less put a stop to it, just confirms the need for the Stop Cloture \nAbuse Resolution.\n  I should add that the deliberative process can work if it is allowed \nto, and the bill we have been debating yesterday and today is evidence \nof that.\n  It isn't just Republicans who would prefer to go back to the way we \ndid things when the Senate functioned as a deliberative body as it was \ndesigned to.\n  The manager of S. 1086, Senator Mikulski, said earlier today, ``This \nis one of the first times in a couple of years where we have had an \nopen amendment process, and in some ways we're getting adjusted to how \nthat actually works. This is terrific.''\n  So even prominent Members of the majority party acknowledge an open \namendment process is the way things should work. I have offered a \nconstructive idea along with 25 colleagues to make that the norm again.\n  Instead of criticizing me, the majority leader should join me and \nbecome part of the solution instead of part of the problem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/13/senate-section/article/S1645-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1645]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, the issue of climate change is a \npressing issue and so I wish to commend the work of my colleagues, and \nto reiterate my concerns.\n  Climate change is real. Unfortunately, while so many of my colleagues \nacross the aisle talk about the need to address our debt to avoid \nburdening future generations, too many of these same Senators refuse to \ntake action to address the climate debt we are passing on. Most \nfrustrating of all, we know what can be done to fix this problem.\n  We know the solutions to reduce pollution and emissions that cause \nclimate change create good-paying jobs. Jobs that put money back in \nfamilies' pockets through low-cost energy sources and increased \nefficiencies in homes. These solutions make our Nation more energy \nindependent, and our businesses more globally competitive. They give us \ncleaner air and water, and protect the health of our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  I know that we can take these steps because I have seen it in my home \nState of Washington. In Washington, our biodiesel producers are \nreplacing imported oil with clean, renewable, home-grown fuels. \nCompanies like McKinstry, who have made a home in the Northwest, are \nleaders in helping cities, hospitals, and others create energy \nefficient, sustainable buildings.\n  In the past, the United States has led the world in innovative ways \nto create energy, but recently we have ceded our clean energy \nleadership to countries like China and Germany because too many have \nstood in the way of making necessary investments. When we passed the \nBipartisan Budget Act this past December, we proved that Democrats and \nRepublicans can put ideology aside and work together to make progress \non our Nation's challenges.\n  Climate change is no less a challenge than any of the other issues we \nface, and we have a moral obligation to address it. As I have said, \naddressing this challenge will create good-paying jobs here at home in \nfields like pollution management, energy efficiency, and renewable \nenergy goods. And best of all, we can pass a healthier planet on to our \nchildren.\n  I'm hopeful that Republicans and Democrats can find common ground and \ncome together to move us forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/13/senate-section/article/S1645-2", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1645-S1646]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JOAN BARRON\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, at a small desk on the third floor of \nthe Wyoming State Capitol sits Joan Barron. For 48 years, Joan has \nserved as a reporter for the Casper Star Tribune, sharing Wyoming's \ngovernment with Wyoming's people. On March 21, 2014, Joan is retiring.\n  Joan started her career in Rock Springs, WY. She was a nurse, but \nanswered an ad to freelance for the Casper Star Tribune in 1966. The \neditors were impressed with Joan's work, and asked her to move to \nCheyenne. Armed with a notebook and a typewriter, she became the \ncapitol bureau reporter in 1969--a position she has held to this day.\n  Historians will undoubtedly use Joan's work to understand the State \nof Wyoming. She covered seven governors, 50 legislative sessions, three \nboom and bust cycles. She knows the issues, she knows the players, she \ndoes her homework. Throughout her career, Joan has been a trusted \nsource, delivering the news of the day to the people of Wyoming. When \nan article has the byline, Joan Barron, Star-Tribune capitol bureau, a \nreader can be assured of fact-based, comprehensive reporting.\n  While Joan says she never wanted to be the story, she has had a \ntremendous impact on how those in Wyoming government conduct business. \nShe was integral to the creation of the Wyoming Open Meetings Law in \n1973. Due in part to Joan's observations, questions and perseverance, \nthe Wyoming legislature passed ethics legislation. She held people \naccountable--and our State is better for it.\n  Just last week, Joan quietly announced her retirement--not wanting \nany fanfare. That is typical of her. She is always the observer, never \nthe center of attention.\n\n[[Page S1646]]\n\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Joan Barron for 48 years \nof reporting. She has recorded over one-third of Wyoming's history--and \nher perspective will be missed. Wyoming owes her a great debt of \ngratitude.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/13/senate-section/article/S1646-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1646]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 WOMEN'S ACCESS TO PREVENTIVE SERVICES\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, the U.S. Supreme Court will soon hear \narguments on the Tenth Circuit's overly expansive decision to allow a \nsecular, for-profit corporation's owners or shareholders to impose \ntheir religious beliefs on employees by denying female employees access \nto preventive health care, including insurance coverage for \ncontraception.\n  As detailed in the amicus brief filed by myself and 18 fellow \nSenators in January, Congress never intended such a broad and \nunprecedented expansion of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, RFRA, \nto deny women access to health care benefits. We urged the Court to \nclarify that RFRA does not allow for-profit companies to deny health \ncoverage to employees based on the religious objections of the \ncompany's owners.\n  It should be clear that the Tenth Circuit's decision runs counter to \na plain-text reading of RFRA and the law's extensive and informative \nlegislative history. Congress passed RFRA to advance a single, limited \npurpose: to restore the compelling-interest test to government actions \nthat burden the free exercise of religion. But the test only extended \nfree-exercise rights only to individuals and religious, non-profit \norganizations. No Supreme Court precedent had extended free-exercise \nrights to secular, for-profit corporations.\n  Congress enacted the Affordable Care Act with full understanding of \nRFRA--and of its limited purpose. Congress also recognized the need to \nbalance the government's compelling interest in extending women's \naccess to preventive health care with respect for the traditional free-\nexercise rights of individuals and religious organizations, which is \nwhy Congress included the Affordable Care Act's religious exemptions \nfor individuals and religious organizations. These exemptions strike \nsuch a balance precisely and accurately, and appropriately recognize \nthe free-exercise rights Congress intended for RFRA to protect.\n  It's unacceptable and inappropriate for bosses at for-profit \ncorporations to pick and choose which health care services their \nemployees can receive. So far, 360,000 Oregon women have benefited from \nexpanded access to preventive services, including contraceptives. \nWomen's health choices should be made between them and their doctors--\nnot their bosses.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/13/senate-section/article/S1646-2", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1646]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TAIWAN RELATIONS ACT\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Madam President, I wish to speak about \nU.S.-Taiwan relations. In just a few weeks, on April 10, 2014, we will \nrecognize the 35th anniversary of the enactment of the Taiwan Relations \nAct, TRA. This important legislation has served as the legal basis for \nour relations with Taiwan and has been critical in defining our \ndiplomatic, economic, and strategic relationship.\n  Although I was not yet a Member of Congress in 1979 when this \nlegislation was passed, I have had the pleasure over the past 28 years \nto be active in U.S.-Taiwan matters and have seen the benefits of the \nTRA.\n  Over the past several decades we have seen our relationship with \nTaiwan grow. Taiwan's innovative and expanding economy has led to \nsignificant trade opportunities for both of our countries. Particularly \nin the area of agriculture--which is South Dakota's No. 1 industry--\nTaiwan has grown to be a key trading partner, representing one of the \nmost significant consumers of South Dakota corn, soybeans, and wheat. \nOur trade relationship has only strengthened over the years, and I am \nhopeful that market opportunities will continue to expand.\n  While we mark this important milestone in U.S.-Taiwan relations, I \nwould also like to say farewell to Representative King Pu-tsung, \nTaiwan's chief envoy to the United States. Ambassador King was recently \nappointed to be the Secretary-General of the Republic of China \n(Taiwan)'s National Security Council, a position equivalent to our \nNational Security Advisor to the President.

Madam President, I would like to take a moment to express \nsincere gratitude to the students, faculty and staff of Hugh Mercer \nElementary School and the entire Fredericksburg, VA region--for the way \nthe community has rallied together to support one of their own: seven-\nyear-old Josh Hardy.\n  Josh is at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis \nrecovering from a life-threatening virus following a bone marrow \ntransplant in January. This week, I am pleased our office had an \nopportunity to work with Josh's family and Josh's friends and fans in \nFredericksburg to get this young fighter access to an experimental \nmedication that could save his life.\n  Since Josh was an infant, he has battled cancer--successfully. While \nhe was undergoing chemotherapy--in kindergarten, mind you--Josh and his \ntwo brothers worked to raise almost $5,000 to help other sick children \nwho were being treated at St. Jude Children's Hospital.\n  Doctors at St. Jude Children's Hospital believe the only drug that \ncan help Josh is still in the testing phase by its manufacturer, \nChimerix. And unfortunately, it appeared that policies of the FDA and \nChimerix would prevent Josh from receiving the drug.\n  Upon hearing that news, family, friends, Mercer teachers and \nclassmates, local businesses, and nonprofit groups across the \nFredericksburg region rallied together to make sure that Josh's voice \nwas heard, here on Capitol Hill and across the country.\n  They used social media to enlist the support of tens of thousands of \npeople from across the country and around the world. Josh's family and \nfriends contacted our office to see if we might be able to help.\n  That is when we reached out both to the FDA and the drug manufacturer \nto try to expedite the process to allow Josh to get access to this \npotentially life-saving medication. We got the good news Tuesday night, \ndirectly from the CEO of Chimerix. By the following morning, Josh was \nundergoing treatment with this new drug. It is still too soon to know \nif this experimental medication will help, but we are all pulling for \nthis remarkable boy.\n  Today I want to salute Josh's teachers and classmates at High Mercer \nElementary School for all that they have done to rally around this \nfamily. The commitment of Josh's teachers to advocate on behalf of the \nHardy family is a testament to their dedication to public service and \nto creating stronger communities and a better Virginia.\n  And I am grateful and proud of the Fredericksburg community, where \nfolks truly came together in a good cause on behalf of Josh and his \nfamily. Their persistence and dedication exemplifies what we call ``the \nVirginia spirit.''\n  I also want to publicly thank the executives and employees of \nChimerix, and officials at the Food and Drug Administration, for moving \nso quickly to look for a way to be helpful to the Hardy family. My \nstaff is already in conversation with the FDA about ways we might \nstreamline the process to allow families in the Hardy's situation to \nhave easier access to potentially life-saving drugs even as these drugs \nare being evaluated by the FDA.\n  We are all pulling for Josh Hardy. We are praying for his family and \nhis medical team, and we are so grateful for the tremendous support \nJosh Hardy is receiving from his Hugh Mercer teachers and classmates \nand the entire Fredericksburg community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/13/senate-section/article/S1646-4", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1646-S1648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           OUR ENERGY FUTURE\n\n Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask that a copy of my \nremarks to the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners \nbe printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S1647]]\n\n  The remarks follow.\n\n        National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners\n\n       Five years ago, all the talk in the United States was about \n     a cap-and-trade program and deliberately raising the price of \n     energy as a way of achieving clean energy independence. Two \n     years ago, I visited Germany--a country that has adopted such \n     a policy--and what I found was an energy mess.\n       The Germans are subsidizing wind and solar, and closing \n     their nuclear plants--but because they are a big \n     manufacturing country they still need nuclear, coal and \n     natural gas for reliable electricity. So to meet those needs, \n     the Germans are buying nuclear power from France, and gas \n     from an unreliable partner, Russia. They're even building \n     their own new coal plants in order to have enough reliable \n     electricity.\n       The end result of this bizarre policy is that Germany has \n     among the highest household electricity prices in the \n     European Union. When I asked an economic minister what he \n     would say to a manufacturer concerned about energy costs in \n     Germany, he said, ``I would suggest he go somewhere else.''\n       This concern in Germany is spreading across Europe. A \n     recent headline in the New York Times reads ``Europe, Facing \n     Economic Pain, May Ease Climate Rules.'' The accompanying \n     article stated that ``the European Union proposed an end to \n     binding national targets for renewable energy production \n     after 2020.''\n       Europeans may end some of their climate targets to avoid \n     throwing a big, wet regulatory blanket over their economies. \n     The point is: in a competitive world, energy policies have a \n     lot to do with a country's economic well-being.\n       When you compare our country's energy needs with the \n     example of Germany, you can see that we are at a fork in the \n     road on our national energy policy. Which path we take will \n     help determine how well the United States competes in a 21st-\n     century economy.\n       The surest path toward cheap, clean, reliable energy is to \n     end Washington's obsession with wasteful energy subsidies and \n     to instead rely on free enterprise and government-sponsored \n     research.\n       Or, we can take the path of Germany, which is where we are \n     headed if we continue to waste tax dollars on subsidies that \n     prop up one type of energy over another.\n       In the United States today, production of electricity from \n     natural gas has grown to 28 percent of total production. This \n     is at the expense of coal, which is down to 39 percent. \n     Nuclear power holds relatively steady at 19 percent. Hydro is \n     7 percent. Wind, solar, biomass and geothermal make up only 6 \n     percent, of which 4 percent is wind.\n       In Washington and in state capitols, there are debates \n     about whether to push this 6 percent of electricity by \n     renewables to a much higher number by forcing a so-called \n     national renewable energy standard, or by further subsidizing \n     an energy source because it's deemed ``clean,'' or by \n     implementing carbon regulations even though Congress has \n     never approved carbon regulations. To avoid the path of \n     Germany and maintain our competiveness, I suggest four grand \n     principles for the United States' energy future: 1) cheaper, \n     not more expensive, energy; 2) clean, not just renewable, \n     energy; 3) research and development, not government mandates; \n     and 4) free market, not government picking ``winners and \n     losers.''\n       The first step on the right path to our energy future--and \n     a prime example of how to apply these principles--is to not \n     extend the massive wind production tax credit that expired on \n     January 1. I believe energy companies basically should enjoy \n     the same tax benefits non-energy companies receive, which is \n     largely the case today with traditional forms of energy.\n       I believe that through tax reform we should simplify the \n     tax code and eliminate most preferences for specific types of \n     energy production. This would save a lot of money, which \n     could be better spent on doubling energy research and \n     reducing the federal debt.\n       The worst culprit for wasteful energy subsidies is Big \n     Wind. Under current law, the wind production tax credit will \n     have provided an estimated $22 billion to wind producers \n     between 1992 and 2022, according to the Congressional \n     Research Service. And that doesn't include the $12.9 billion \n     that wind received from President Obama's federal stimulus \n     bill.\n       I've been fighting against this subsidy for years because I \n     think it is a bad deal for American taxpayers, a bad deal for \n     rate payers, and a bad deal for U.S. competitiveness. And if \n     we want to see what the result of those policies would be \n     let's look again at Germany, and other parts of Europe.\n       Just last week energy expert Daniel Yergin wrote that one \n     of the biggest themes at this year's World Economic Forum in \n     Davos was ``competitiveness.'' ``This particular rivalry \n     [competitiveness] pits the United States head-on against \n     Europe,'' he said.\n       Yergin says that energy is one way to measure \n     competitiveness, and that was the focus at Davos. He went on \n     to say, ``European industrial electricity prices are twice as \n     high as those in some countries and are much higher than \n     those in the United States. To a significant degree, this is \n     the result of a pell-mell push toward high-cost renewable \n     electricity (wind and solar), which is imposing heavy costs \n     on consumers and generating large fiscal burdens for \n     governments.'' A January 2014 New York Times article entitled \n     ``German Energy Official Sounds a Warning'' reports that, \n     ``The minister, Sigmar Gabriel, in his first major policy \n     speech, said at an annual energy conference organized by the \n     publication Handelsblatt in Berlin that annual consumer costs \n     for renewables of about 24 billion euros, or about $32.5 \n     billion, were already pushing the limits of what the German \n     economy, Europe's most powerful, could handle.'' In a BBC \n     News article, ``Can Germany afford its energy bender' shift \n     to green power?'' a minister for economics in Germany says \n     that Germany's ``law on renewable energy will not only lead \n     to increased electricity prices, but it is also a non-market, \n     planned system that endangers the industrial base of'' the \n     German economy.\n       This doesn't sound like the path down which America should \n     go to build a 21st-century economy. And yet, forces in \n     Congress are preparing to renew the expired wind subsidy and \n     continue to take us down the path that's currently causing \n     problems in Germany. The problem here is not being ``for or \n     against renewable'' energy or just wasting taxpayers' tax \n     dollars. The problem is that these huge subsidies are \n     propping up renewable energy at the expense of reliable \n     energy. In the case of wind, this increases the occurrence of \n     negative pricing.'\n       Government subsidies are so generous that in some markets \n     wind developers can give away electricity and still make a \n     profit. Such negative pricing' rewards expensive, unreliable \n     power like wind and undercuts and punishes cheap, reliable \n     power from nuclear and coal plants. This is a growing problem \n     in the U.S. The more wind we subsidize and the more we build, \n     the bigger the problem becomes. For a snapshot of where we \n     are going, let's take another look at Europe.\n       A Wall Street Journal opinion piece by Rupert Darwall \n     entitled ``Europe's Stark Renewables Lesson'' reports that \n     ``the European Commission acknowledges that, because member \n     states over-incentivized investment in renewables, they \n     compounded the challenges'' posed by non-dispatchable \n     electricity generation like wind.\n       The same threat applies to some markets here in the U.S., \n     according to the Center for Strategic and International \n     Studies. Negative pricing' caused by wind power tied to \n     energy subsidies undercuts the operation of nuclear plants \n     and could contribute to closing as many as 25 percent of our \n     nuclear plants by 2020.\n       So, these subsidies are putting at risk our largest source \n     of clean, cheap, reliable electricity--nuclear--and more \n     importantly, putting at risk energy diversity.\n       This audience understands more than most the importance of \n     energy diversity to help reduce price spikes and have a more \n     reliable grid.\n       The recent polar vortex cold wave reminded us of the \n     importance of diversity. When natural gas prices spiked, and \n     demand was unusually high, nuclear and coal generations saved \n     the day. You can't put a price on diversity, but when you \n     need the lights to come on and the heater to kick in, \n     diversity can be lifesaving, and wind subsidies are \n     threatening that.\n       We need to go down a path to cheap, clean, reliable \n     electricity.\n       That path would provide a pro-growth, pro-jobs energy \n     policy that puts us more firmly on the path toward a \n     competitive future and protects households and business \n     across the country, especially during extreme conditions.\n       To start, the best way to achieve cheap, clean, reliable \n     energy is through market-driven solutions. Some will say, \n     well what about oil and gas, what about nuclear subsidies? \n     The president in his State of the Union address called for an \n     end to tax policy that gives ``$4 billion a year to fossil \n     fuel industries.'' To begin with, fossil fuels contribute 67 \n     percent of our electricity. ``Big Wind'' received $1.4 \n     billion through the wind production tax credit last year but \n     only produces 4 percent of America's electricity.\n       The president often likes to cite the billions of dollars \n     in subsidies for the oil and gas industry. But here's the \n     catch: many of these ``Big Oil'' subsidies the president \n     likes to highlight are the same or similar to tax provisions \n     that benefit other industries.\n       For example, Xerox, Microsoft and Caterpillar all benefit \n     from tax provisions like the manufacturing tax credit, \n     amortization, or depreciation of used equipment that the \n     president is counting as ``Big Oil'' subsidies. And, of \n     course, wind energy companies also benefit from many similar \n     tax provisions--but the production tax credit for wind is in \n     addition to regular tax code provisions that benefit many \n     companies.\n       We should end wasteful, long-term special tax breaks, both \n     for ``Big Oil'' and ``Big Wind.'' We should use the money we \n     save from ending wasteful subsidies to reduce the federal \n     debt and double energy research. Then we can let the free \n     market determine the course forward, rather than the \n     government picking ``winners and losers.''\n       In addition to supporting research, I believe it is \n     appropriate for the government to jumpstart new technologies \n     to allow time for the free enterprise system to take the \n     reins, but these should be narrowly defined and temporary.\n       For example: Unconventional gas benefited from government \n     research and a temporary tax credit--that expired in 1992. \n     The full tax credit for plug-in electric cars was capped at \n     200,000 vehicles per manufacturer. The government provided \n     research and licensing support for small modular reactors--\n     but that ends after five years. There is a production\n\n[[Page S1648]]\n\n     tax credit for nuclear power plants but it's limited to 6,000 \n     megawatts.\n       On the other hand, we have the temporary wind production \n     tax credit that was enacted in 1992 to jumpstart an industry, \n     and according to the Congressional Research Service will cost \n     taxpayers a total of $22 billion from 1992 through 2022. The \n     most recent one-year extension--which gives wind developers \n     10 years of subsidies--would cost $12 billion over 10 years, \n     according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. This is for \n     what President Obama's former energy secretary called a \n     ``mature technology'' that produces only 4 percent of our \n     electricity and only works when the wind blows.\n       President Reagan used to say ``the nearest thing to eternal \n     life we'll ever see on this Earth is a government program'' \n     and that's too often the case with energy subsidies. The most \n     glaring example is the more than 20-year-old subsidy for wind \n     power, a technology that has matured. The United States uses \n     20 percent of all the electricity produced in the world for \n     our computers, our businesses, our homes and our national \n     defense. To rely on unreliable wind power when nuclear, coal \n     and natural gas are available is the energy equivalent of \n     going to war in sailboats. Those who oppose the path I am \n     suggesting like to say that nuclear and coal aren't clean \n     forms of electricity.\n       While this path isn't without its challenges, I'll take \n     that argument on. Nuclear power is our largest source of air-\n     pollution-free electricity, 60 percent. Then people opposing \n     nuclear power will say, ``what about the waste?'' This is an \n     issue of great concern to many of you. To address this \n     challenge, I have cosponsored legislation with Senators \n     Wyden, Murkowski and Feinstein that would implement the \n     recommendations of the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's \n     Nuclear Future.\n       The bill would create a new federal agency to oversee the \n     nuclear waste program, and ensure that progress on \n     consolidated storage sites and repositories moves along \n     parallel tracks. The federal government should not be \n     collecting fees without keeping its promise to dispose of the \n     nuclear waste now sitting in your states. The D.C. Court of \n     Appeals opinion in your case has made this point clear.\n       The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee has held \n     two hearings on the legislation, and we are working toward \n     having the committee hold a markup and favorably report the \n     bill so it can move to the Senate floor.\n       We know how to control mercury, smog and soot, and many \n     utilities are leading the way in installing these \n     technologies, including the Tennessee Valley Authority.\n       So in order to burn coal in a clean way, the only remaining \n     obstacle is carbon emissions from coal plants. The best way \n     to solve that problem is not through a cap-and-trade system, \n     which would raise prices, but instead through research and \n     development, which could lower them. Finding a way to capture \n     carbon from coal plants and turn it into a product that can \n     be sold is the Holy Grail of energy research--and we are \n     working on solutions that will do just that.\n       ARPA-E, a small energy research agency, is working with \n     private companies to take the carbon from coal plants and \n     feed it to microbes that with electricity can produce liquid \n     transportation fuels. Such a solution might even make coal \n     cheaper than it is today.\n       When you think about it that way, this crossroads I'm \n     talking about--this fork in the road between clean, cheap, \n     reliable energy and the mess of Germany and other European \n     countries--is not just a challenge, but an opportunity.\n       It's true that our energy needs are great, and that there \n     are obstacles to meeting them. But we also have an \n     opportunity to get Washington out of the way and to liberate \n     our free enterprise system. If we do, the path toward cheap, \n     clean, reliable energy is full of possibility.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/13/senate-section/article/S1648-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO MITCH FOX\n\n Mr. HELLER.

Working 35 years with the Las Vegas \nReview-Journal, Ed has covered the gamut of news stories as the RJ's \nCapital Bureau Chief.\n  My fondest memories of Ed go as far back as when I served as \nsecretary of state. It was with great pleasure that Ed and I operated \nwith an open-door policy. Whenever he walked into my office, I knew I \nshould settle in for an interesting story or an entertaining\n\n[[Page S1649]]\n\nanecdote. I look back on those conversations fondly. Ed is a true \ncharacter, and one that will be greatly missed in the halls of our \nNation's Capitol.\n  Well-known throughout Nevada for his endless curiosity, Ed was \nintroduced to the Nevada Newspaper Hall of Fame in 2012. His experience \nspans the better part of four decades, beginning back in 1971, he \nserves as an example within his profession. Committed to the story, \ntruth above all, his words' worth today is immeasurable.\n  As Ed announces his retirement, I reflect fondly upon our interviews \ntogether and wish him the best of luck in his new era of life.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing this upstanding Nevada \njournalist.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/13/senate-section/article/S1649-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1649]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO LAWRENCE SELLERS\n\n Mr. KIRK. Madam President, on the afternoon of January 29, \n2013, Lawrence D. Sellers, Jr. and his friends were relaxing in \nChicago's Vivian Gordon Harsh Park after finishing their high school \nfinal exams. Shots rang out. Lawrence pushed his girlfriend out of \nharm's way. A bullet struck his left leg below the calf. And as the \ngroup tried to run away, Lawrence heard a scream and turned around to \nsee his friend, Hadiya Pendleton, falling to the ground.\n  Hadiya's murder has become a rallying cry in Chicago to give law \nenforcement the tools they need to reduce gang and gun violence. I \nremain committed to passing legislation that bears her name to stop the \nstraw purchasing and trafficking of guns that can end up in the hands \nof dangerous gangs like the Gangster Disciples. I will continue working \nwith Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Chicago Police Superintendent Garry \nMcCarthy to ensure additional Federal resources are promptly delivered \nto implement a holistic, all-of-government strategy to make our \ncommunities safer.\n  But today I wish to recognize Lawrence for his bravery and heroism--\nbecause inside this tragedy, we can find a spark of hope to restore our \nfaith in what is possible when good people are not afraid to do the \nright thing. Lawrence is that spark.\n  A senior at King College Prep in North Kenwood with aspirations of \nbecoming a math teacher, Lawrence is an Eagle Scout, and, just last \nmonth, he received the Honor Medal from the Boy Scouts of America.\n  ``Doing the right thing, you shouldn't get an award for it,'' \nLawrence said with great humility. ``But I am honored to receive it, of \ncourse; I just feel like it's just the right thing.''\n  In a community torn apart by gang violence, it is not always easy to \ndo the right thing--or to always know what the right thing is in the \nfirst place. That is what makes groups like the Boy Scouts and other \ncommunity youth groups so important in a holistic antigang violence \nstrategy.\n  I am proud to join the Boy Scouts of America in honoring Lawrence \nSellers. Lawrence is a role model to his peers and a reminder that \nsupporting civic-minded youth organizations like the Boy Scouts must be \na part of our antiviolence, antigang strategy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/13/senate-section/article/S1649-2", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1649]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO PATRICK SULLIVAN\n\n Mr. KIRK. Madam President, I wish to recognize and thank Mr. \nPatrick Sullivan, the retiring director of the Captain James A. Lovell \nFederal Health Care Center--FHCC--in North Chicago, IL. Lovell Hospital \nis a first-of-its-kind partnership between the U.S. Department of \nVeterans Affairs and the Department of Defense--DoD,--integrating all \nmedical care into the Nation's first truly joint Federal health care \nfacility with a single combined VA and Navy mission. The men and women \nof Lovell Hospital serve approximately 67,000 servicemembers, veterans, \nand their families through a network of eight facilities in Illinois \nand Wisconsin.\n  Mr. Sullivan served as the facility's first director when it was \nformally established in October 2010. As director, he took on the \ndaunting task of integrating the North Chicago VA Medical Center and \nNaval Health Clinic Great Lakes and combining the missions of caring \nfor active duty military members, their families, military retirees and \nveterans.\n  Mr. Sullivan has skillfully led a VA/DoD team of over 3,000 as they \nhave developed a national model for integrated Federal health care.\n  Mr. Sullivan had a long and successful career caring for our Nation's \nheroes. He served as the director of the North Chicago VA Medical \nCenter before its integration into the Lovell FHCC. He has worked at VA \nMedical Centers across the country, including centers in Prescott, AZ, \nPortland; OR, Martinez, CA and Poplar Bluff, MO. Mr. Sullivan also \nextends his leadership skills to his community, serving on the board of \nseveral community organizations in Lake County, Ill.\n  I wish to personally thank Pat Sullivan for his service to our \ncountry and its veterans. His tireless efforts to make the Lovell \nHospital vision a reality will not be forgotten. His work was ahead of \nits time and stands as a model for the future.\n Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I rise today to honor GEN \nRobert Cone, commanding general of the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine \nCommand. After 35 years of service, General Cone has announced he will \nretire from the Army on March 17, 2014, and it is my pleasure to \ncelebrate General Cone's career and express the pride that all New \nHampshire citizens feel in recognizing his accomplishments. As one of \nonly 10 4-star generals in the U.S. Armed Forces, General Cone has \nreached the pinnacle of success for a professional soldier. Perhaps \nmore importantly, he has left an indelible mark on the character of the \nU.S. Army and the young men and women who comprise the heart and soul \nof it.\n  Born and raised in Manchester, NH, General Cone is a graduate of \nMemorial High School, where as a member of the football team he was \ninspired by his coach to pursue an appointment to the U.S. Military \nAcademy at West Point. After successfully completing his studies at \nWest Point, General Cone was commissioned as an armor officer and began \na career that would take him around the United States and the world in \na range of leadership roles, including Afghanistan as the commander of \nthe Combined Security Transition Command and Iraq as commander of the \nIII Corps.\n  In addition to his role as an Army officer, General Cone embraced the \nrole of scholar, earning a master's degree in sociology from the \nUniversity of Texas, Austin, which he leveraged as an instructor and \nassistant professor at West Point in the Department of Behavioral \nSciences and Leadership. General Cone also earned advanced degrees from \nthe Command and General Staff College and the Naval War College. Fully \nengaged in the Army's efforts to improve training and leadership \ndevelopment, General Cone was appointed military director of the Joint \nAdvanced Warfighting Program at the Institute of Defense Analysis, and \nalso led the Joint Forces Command's Lessons Learned Team in Iraq. \nDuring his command of the Army's National Training Center at Fort \nIrvin, General Cone oversaw a shift in training towards \ncounterinsurgency operations at a crucial time in the War on Terror.\n  In 2011 General Cone assumed command of U.S. Army Training and \nDoctrine Command, TRADOC, placing him at the forefront of planning for \nthe future of the Army. He has approached each challenge with the \nfundamental understanding that war is a human endeavor dependent on a \nperson's will just as much as equipment and machinery. Just one of many \nexamples of the leadership and foresight exhibited by General Cone, he \nhas served as an articulate proponent of ``Soldier 2020'', a service-\nwide effort to maximize combat effectiveness by casting aside gender \nconstructs. General Cone leaves behind a well-established legacy as \ncommander of TRADOC.\n  The U.S. Army will no doubt continue to benefit from General Cone's \nleadership and vision for years to come. I ask my colleagues and all \nAmericans to join me in thanking GEN Robert Cone for his service to our \ncountry and wish him the best in his retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/13/senate-section/article/S1649-3", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1649-S1650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n[[Page S1650]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/13/senate-section/article/S1650-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/13/senate-section/article/S1650-2", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:31 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 4138.

A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to ensure the \nintegrity of voice communications and to prevent unjust or unreasonable \ndiscrimination among areas of the United States in the delivery of such \ncommunications; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a \nwidespread problem affecting rural communities in South Dakota and \nacross our country. This issue represents both a public safety and \neconomic issue for rural America.\n  For far too long, rural communities have experienced problems with \nlong-distance or wireless telephone calls that are not being properly \nconnected. The call completion problem extends beyond South Dakota and \nhas affected telephone customers in dozens of states. These call \nfailures create frustration and concern for family members trying to \nconnect with friends and family, as well as small businesses losing \nbusiness because they miss calls from customers. The problem also poses \na serious public safety threat, such as when a police dispatcher cannot \nreach law enforcement or when a doctor cannot call a patient regarding \nfollow-up care. Rural telephone customers affected by this problem are \nrightfully frustrated and demand a solution.\n  I first learned about this issue from the manager of a rural health \nclinic in Canistota, SD. The clinic has experienced a decline in \nbusiness as a result of the call completion problems. Incoming calls \nregularly do not reach the clinic and therefore go unanswered. \nAdditionally, some patients have heard misleading messages about the \nclinic's number being disconnected, which leads them to believe the \nclinic has closed. This is just one example of the negative impact this \nproblem is having on communities and Main Street businesses across \nrural America.\n  To be honest, I could barely believe it when I first learned about \nthis issue. Today, we should be worried about narrowing the digital \ndivide not worrying whether rural communities have access to basic \ntelephone service. While many factors could be at play, the Federal \nCommunications Commission believes the use of third-party ``least cost \nrouters'' to connect calls is a leading cause of the problem. It \nappears that some of these intermediate providers are failing to \nproperly complete calls to avoid the higher access charges associated \nwith rural telephone networks. It is particularly challenging to \nresolve the problem because calls are often dropped before they reach \nthe rural telephone network, making it difficult for rural providers to \npinpoint when and where problems occur.\n  Over the past few years, I have worked with many of my Senate \ncolleagues, the FCC, telephone providers, and consumers to fix this \nproblem and hold those causing this problem accountable. I would like \nto say a special thank you to Senators Amy Klobuchar and Deb Fischer \nfor joining me in introducing a Sense of the Senate resolution last May \nthat directed the FCC to take action to end these discriminatory \npractices. Since our resolution\n\n[[Page S1656]]\n\nwas introduced, the commission unanimously approved rules to strengthen \nits ability to monitor and enforce the delivery of calls to rural \nareas. Although the commission's rulemaking and ongoing investigation \nrepresent a step in the right direction, a more immediate resolution is \nneeded.\n  Today, I introduced the Public Safety and Economic Security \nCommunications Act. This legislation takes immediate action to stop the \nbad actors that are failing to complete calls to rural areas. The bill \nincludes common sense reforms that will help end the discriminatory \ndelivery of calls by requiring voice providers to register with the FCC \nand comply with basic service quality standards. The legislation will \nhelp ensure that small businesses, families, and emergency responders \nin every corner of South Dakota and across our country can once again \nrely upon connection of their incoming telephone calls.\n  I invite my colleagues to join me in stopping this problem by \ncosponsoring the Public Safety and Economic Security Communications \nAct.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORNYN (for himself and Mr. Cruz):\n  S. 2128. A bill to name the Department of Veterans Affairs medical \ncenter in Waco, Texas, as the ``Doris Miller Department of Veterans \nAffairs Medical Center''; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2128\n\n         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives \n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n         Congress makes the following findings:\n         (1) On October 12, 1919, Doris Miller was born in Waco, \n     Texas.\n         (2) On September 16, 1939, Miller enlisted in United \n     States Navy as mess attendant, third class at Naval \n     Recruiting Station, Dallas, Texas to serve for a period of \n     six years.\n         (3) On February 16, 1941, Miller received a change of \n     rating to mess attendant, second class.\n         (4) On June 1, 1942, Miller received a change of rating \n     to mess attendant, first class.\n         (5) On June 1, 1943, Miller received a change of rating, \n     to cook, third class.\n         (6) On November 25, 1944, Miller was presumed dead by the \n     Secretary of the Navy a year and a day after being carried as \n     missing in action since November 24, 1943 while serving \n     aboard U.S.S. Liscome Bay when that vessel was torpedoed and \n     sunk in the Pacific Ocean.\n         (7) Miller was awarded the Navy Cross Medal, Purple Heart \n     Medal, American Defense Service Medal, Asiatic-Pacific \n     Campaign Medal, and World War II Victory Medal.\n         (8) Miller's citation for the Navy Cross said ``for \n     distinguished devotion to duty, extraordinary courage and \n     disregard for his own personal safety during the attack on \n     the Fleet in Pearl Harbor, Territory of Hawaii, by Japanese \n     forces on December 7, 1941. While at the side of his Captain \n     on the bridge, Miller, despite enemy strafing and bombing and \n     in the face of a serious fire, assisted in moving his \n     Captain, who had been mortally wounded, to a place of greater \n     safety, and later manned and operated a machine gun directed \n     at enemy Japanese attacking aircraft until ordered to leave \n     the bridge.''.\n         (9) On June 20, 1973, the U.S.S. Miller (FF-1091), a \n     Knox-class frigate, was named in honor of Doris Miller.\n\n     SEC. 2. NAME OF DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS MEDICAL \n                   CENTER, WACO, TEXAS.\n\n         The Department of Veterans Affairs medical center in \n     Waco, Texas, shall after the date of the enactment of this \n     Act be known and designated as the ``Doris Miller Department \n     of Veterans Affairs Medical Center''. Any reference to such \n     medical center in any law, regulation, map, document, record, \n     or other paper of the United States shall be considered to be \n     a reference to the Doris Miller Department of Veterans \n     Affairs Medical Center.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. UDALL of New Mexico:\n  S. 2129. A bill to amend the Department of Energy Organization Act to \nimprove technology transfer at the Department of Energy by reducing \nbureaucratic barriers to industry, entrepreneurs, and small businesses, \nas well as ensure that public investments in research and development \ngenerate the greatest return on investment for taxpayers, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, New Mexico is blessed with some \nof the world's finest scientists. Each day, brilliant researchers at \nour universities and national labs go to work, and the results are \namazing. At the same time, entrepreneurs in New Mexico and across the \ncountry are looking for opportunities to leverage innovation and to \ncreate new high-tech products and applications.\n  I rise to introduce the Accelerating Technology Transfer to Advance \nInnovation for the Nation--what we are calling the ATTAIN Act. That is \na long title and an important goal: to improve the Department of \nEnergy's technology transfer mission and to move innovation from the \nlab to the market. This grows our economy and creates a greater impact \nfrom our research and development dollars.\n  But before I talk to my colleagues about what the bill does, I wish \nto explain why it is so important. Tech transfer may seem to be just \nsome technical issue, affecting bureaucratic rules or regulations, but \nit is more. It is how innovation in the lab today helps create jobs \ntomorrow.\n  In the 21st century, our national labs are the birthplace of \ninnovation that creates new products and businesses and entire \nindustries. Scientists are developing cutting-edge ways to power \ncomputers, to transmit new information, to heal the body. These \ninnovations have great market potential in aviation, the military, \nmedicine. They can be spun into high-tech businesses, changing the \nworld, putting people to work.\n\n  In New Mexico, many companies have been formed as a result of \ndiscoveries at Los Alamos and Sandia National Labs. For example, \nMustomo, Inc., a startup using technology developed at LANL, provides \n3D ultrasound tomography for the detection of breast cancer, and \ntechnology from Sandia, used by TEAM Technologies, has created a device \nthat can disable improvised explosive devices. Since 2010 over 4,000 \nunits have been deployed and are saving lives in war zones right now.\n  But despite these amazing successes, we are operating at just a \nfraction of the potential. My home State could do so much more. New \nMexico has all the ingredients to become a high-tech powerhouse. There \nare great minds at our national labs and military bases. We have \nfantastic universities and a booming energy industry. We need to create \nan environment to allow it to reach that potential. This is a major \ninitiative of mine to help create the right formula to help industry \ntake off in New Mexico. That is the purpose of my bill.\n  Almost a decade ago Congress created a Department of Energy \nTechnology Transfer Coordinator to move innovation from the lab bench \nto the marketplace, to spur businesses and cutting-edge product \ndevelopment in New Mexico and across the Nation, to help entrepreneurs \noutside of the big-city powerhouses on the coasts get access to \ncapital, to help them find partners in industry. But the Department has \nnot come close to meeting its potential. A recent inspector general's \nreport tells the story. It cited numerous deficiencies at DOE. The \nDepartment is over 7 years delinquent in finalizing its Technology \nTransfer Execution Plan, nor has DOE implemented a forward-looking \nprocess for its commercialization fund--over 2 years after being \ndirected to do so by the former Secretary. In addition, the Technology \nTransfer Coordinator post at the Department has been vacant since April \n2013. That is nearly 1 year after the previous Coordinator's departure. \nThis position should be filled as quickly as possible with a qualified \nand motivated candidate.\n  Technology transfer is important in New Mexico and to the Nation, and \nthe Department's failure to perform is unacceptable. My bill addresses \nthese shortfalls. We can do better, and we have to. The first step is \nto make tech transfer a priority. Our goals are clear: consolidate \nbureaucracy, streamline contracting, and use models that have proven \nsuccessful.\n  There are three key elements to my legislation.\n  First, it permanently authorizes new tools for the Secretary of \nEnergy's new Department-wide technology transfer office to enable DOE \nand DOE's new Tech Transfer Coordinator to meet their responsibilities \nand to measure and report their progress. Better coordination is \nabsolutely crucial so we can reduce barriers and efficiently use\n\n[[Page S1657]]\n\nthe limited resources available. My bill requires that this office be \naccountable and responsible, that it work with the national labs and \nwith industry in the right way at the Department and fully implement \nthe EPACT Energy Technology Commercialization Fund--something DOE has \nyet to do according to Congress's original intent.\n  Second, the bill authorizes a new tech transfer corps, modeled on the \nNational Science Foundation's Innovation Corps, to support investments \nin entrepreneurs, mentors, scientists, and engineers. It authorizes \ntechnology commercialization challenges that push--getting innovative \ntechnologies into the market--and also pull--enabling partnerships with \nindustry to identify and focus on common challenges. It will also \nimprove coordination of technology transfer and entrepreneurship \npriorities with universities, foundations, and nonprofits, both \nregionally and nationally.\n  Third, we adapt an existing public-private partnership model used by \nthe Small Business Administration and apply it to technology transfer \nto increase access to capital for promising startup companies.\n  We are not asking for more money. We need to do more with what we \nhave. We are not asking--and I want to emphasize that--we are not \nasking for more money. We need to do more with what we have. The bill \nrequires DOE and SBA to work together, to use the strengths of each \nagency--DOE's innovative technology and SBA's financial acumen--and it \nincreases investment in new technologies via the SBIC Impact and Early \nStage Initiatives. The Impact Initiative includes SBA matching funds of \nup to $1 billion, and the Early Stage Initiative includes $1 billion \nmore.\n  This collaboration addresses an important concern. Since 2008 less \nthan 6 percent of these venture capital funds have been invested in \nseed funds and tech maturation, and 70 percent of that went into just \nthree States--California, New York, and Massachusetts. There are great \nopportunities outside these three States. This bill will help those \nfunds find them. States such as New Mexico have a surplus of innovative \nideas and a lack of investment dollars. With this bill we can balance \nthat equation.\n  The benefits are clear: new technology, new partnerships, and new \nopportunities. Cutting-edge research today means high-paying jobs \ntomorrow. American inventions and intellectual property fuel our \neconomy. Mr. President, 75 U.S. industries are classified as \nintellectual property intensive. They added $5.8 trillion to U.S. \noutput last year. They are 38 percent of our GDP. They directly or \nindirectly supply over 55 million jobs--jobs that on average pay 30 \npercent higher wages. These IP companies account for 74 percent of our \nexports.\n  We need to do all we can to support innovation and to improve \ntechnology transfer--the bridge between new discovery and new \nopportunity--to grow our economy, to create high-paying jobs. I believe \nthis is something we can all support.\n  Last August I cohosted a tech transfer conference in Santa Fe. I met \nwith nearly 200 of New Mexico's most successful entrepreneurs, \ninnovators, and investors. We talked about the challenges and \nopportunities of technology transfer and how important it is to the \nfuture.\n  We have always succeeded by being one step ahead of the competition. \nAmerican innovation has led the world in industry, in health care and \ntransportation, in science and technology. The ATTAIN Act will help \nmove that innovation from the lab to the marketplace, helping \nbusinesses grow, creating jobs, and keeping us competitive in a global \nmarketplace.\n  For a student with a bright idea, for an entrepreneur with the drive \nto chase their dream, it can be a long road. Fortunately, they do not \ngive up easily. They are as tough as they come. They are already giving \nso much with hard work, with taking risks. They do their part. DOE \nneeds to do its part as well.\n  We all want to move innovation forward and to better coordinate the \nhandoffs. I am committed to working with the Department of Energy to \nmake this a reality. This is an important goal, and it should be an \nequally important priority. That is why I am introducing this bill \ntoday.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BARRASSO (for himself, Mr. Hoeven, Mr. McCain, Mr. Thune, \n        and Mr. Enzi):\n  S. 2132. A bill to amend the Indian Tribal Energy Development and \nSelf-Determination Act of 2005, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce S. 2132, the \nIndian Tribal Energy Development and Self-Determination Act Amendments \nof 2014.\n  In recent years, the Committee on Indian Affairs has received \nconcerns from Indian tribes and the energy industry that the Federal \nlaws governing the development of tribal energy resources are complex \nand often lead to significant costs, delays, and uncertainty for all \nparties. These costs, delays, and uncertainties discourage development \nof tribal energy resources and drive investments away from tribal \nlands.\n  According to the National Congress of American Indians, Indian tribes \nhold nearly a quarter of American onshore oil and gas reserves. Yet, \nexisting tribal energy production represents less than 5 percent of the \ncurrent national production. If we can remove the costs and delays of \ndeveloping energy on Indian lands, we could potentially see the \ncountry's energy production, and thus energy independence, increase \nsignificantly.\n  Over 8 years ago, Congress passed the Indian Tribal Energy \nDevelopment and Self-Determination Act. This act created a new, \nalternative process for Indian tribes to take control of developing \ntheir energy resources on their own lands without the burdens of \nadministrative review, approval, and oversight. This approach gives \nIndian tribes the option to enter into tribal energy resource \nagreements with the Secretary of the Interior. Once an Indian tribe \nenters into this agreement, it has the authority to enter into \nsubsequent leases, business agreements, and rights-of-way affecting \nenergy development, without further review and approval by the \nSecretary--a significant departure from the standard laws, and \nconsequent bureaucracy, applicable to tribal contracts. That approach \nwas a step in the right direction.\n  However, the agreements and process authorized under the Indian \nTribal Energy Development and Self-Determination Act have not been \nutilized to the extent that they could be, primarily because the \nimplementation of the act has been made more complex than it should be. \nIt is time we make key improvements to the law so that Indian tribes \ncan take advantage of these agreements and significantly reduce \nbureaucratic burdens to energy development. Years of consultation and \noutreach to Indian tribes have produced targeted solutions to address \nthe concerns about the process for entering these agreements.\n  The bill that I am introducing today, S. 2132, would streamline the \nprocess for approving the tribal energy resource agreements and make it \nmore predictable for Indian tribes.\n  I would like to highlight some of the key provisions in this bill. \nThis bill includes a number of amendments to improve the review and \napproval process for the tribal energy resource agreements. For \nexample, the bill provides clarity regarding the specific information \nrequired for tribal applications for these agreements. In addition, the \nbill sets forth specific timeframes for Secretarial determinations on \nthe agreement applications. Moreover, if an application is disapproved, \nthis bill would require the Secretary of the Interior to provide \ndetailed explanations to the Indian tribe and steps for addressing the \nreasons for disapproval.\n  This bill also has various provisions that would improve technical \nassistance and consultation with Indian tribes during their energy \nplanning and development stages. The bill also includes an amendment to \nthe Federal Power Act that would put Indian tribes on a similar footing \nwith States and municipalities for preferences when preliminary permits \nor original licenses for hydroelectric projects are issued.\n  Additionally, S. 2132 would allow Indian tribes and third parties to \nperform appraisals to help expedite the Secretary's approval process \nfor tribal agreements for mineral resource development. This bill does \nnot focus on only traditional resource development,\n\n[[Page S1658]]\n\nbut includes renewal resource development components as well. For \nexample, the bill would create tribal biomass demonstration projects to \nprovide Indian tribes with more reliable and potentially longterm \nsupplies of woody biomass materials.\n  My bill is intended to provide Indian tribes with the tools to \ndevelop and use energy more efficiently. In passing this bill, Congress \nwill enhance the ability of Indian tribes to exercise self-\ndetermination over the development of energy resources located on \ntribal lands, thereby improving the lives and economic well-being of \nNative Americans.\n  Before I conclude, I would like to thank Senators Enzi, Thune, \nHoeven, and McCain for joining me in cosponsoring the Indian Tribal \nEnergy Development and Self-Determination Act Amendments of 2014. I \nurge my colleagues to join me in advancing S. 2132 expeditiously.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Reid, and Mr. \n        Durbin):\n  S. 2145. A bill to require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to \npermit facilities of the Department of Veterans Affairs to be \ndesignated as voter registration agencies, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to reintroduce the Veteran \nVoting Support Act, which is cosponsored by Senators Leahy, Durbin, and \nReid.\n  Almost 7 years ago, during the previous administration, I learned \nthat a Department of Veterans Affairs facility in California had barred \nvoter registration groups from accessing veterans in the facility. \nSimilar reports emerged in other parts of the country.\n  This was unacceptable. Therefore, then-Senator Kerry and I worked \nwith the VA to establish a fair, nonpartisan policy to facilitate voter \nregistration and voting for veterans who receive services at VA \nfacilities.\n  We held a hearing in the Rules Committee on a previous version of \nthis bill on September 15, 2008, when I was Chairman of that committee.\n  One week before that hearing, the VA issued a directive that created \na new and substantially improved policy to permit state and local \nelection officials, as well as nonpartisan groups, to access VA \nfacilities.\n  Yet many expressed concerns that it did not go far enough. For \nexample, the Brennan Center for Justice, American Association for \nPeople with Disabilities, Common Cause, Demos, and the League of Women \nVoters sent me a letter stating that the directive was ``an important \nstep in the right direction'' but stressed ``that the VA's recent \ndirective will not be sufficient to protect the voting rights of the \nmen and women served by the VA.''\n  Paul Sullivan, then Executive Director of Veterans for Common Sense, \nsaid: ``There is a veteran voting rights crisis. As many as 100,000 of \nour veterans living in VA facilities may not be able to vote in our \nNovember 4 election.''\n  Mr. Sullivan also explained a key problem facing veterans who live at \na VA facility: ``When a veteran moves into a VA facility, the veteran's \nold registration becomes invalid. The veteran must re-register before \nhe or she can vote again.''\n  In short, while many believed the VA's directive was not perfect, \nthey also acknowledged it was an improvement.\n  I am sad to report that the 2008 voting assistance directive expired \nat the end of September 2013. That means no voting assistance directive \nis in place at the VA, with the mid-term elections only a few months \naway.\n  This is unacceptable. There is no justification for it. Veterans' \nvoting rights, like the voting rights of others, do not have an \nexpiration date.\n  There is no question about the continuing need for VA action in this \narea.\n  While the VA's directive was in place, from 2008 to 2012, veteran \nvoter registration ticked up only slightly, from 77 to 78 percent, \naccording to the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey.\n  But during the same period, actual voting by veterans dropped as a \npercentage of the veteran population--from 70.9 percent to 70.3 \npercent.\n  In raw numbers, there remain over 4.6 million veterans who either are \nunregistered or for whom the Census Bureau's data reports no response.\n  In the 2012 election, there were over 6.2 million veterans who either \ndid not vote or for whom the Census data reports no response.\n  Thus, there is much more to do to help our veterans register and cast \ntheir ballots.\n  The VA is the agency best suited to do the job because it comes into \ncontact with several million veterans each year.\n  In fact, in 2013, according to the VA's latest statistics, there were \nover 6.41 million unique patients in the VA health care system, up from \n5.65 million in 2008, a 15 percent increase.\n  Today, I am reintroducing the Veteran Voting Support Act, which, \nunlike a VA directive, cannot be rescinded by the VA and would not \nexpire.\n  This bill would take important steps to improve veterans' ability to \nregister and vote.\n  First, the bill would require the VA to provide a veteran seeking to \nenroll in the VA health care system with a mail-in voter registration \nform. Such a form would also have to be provided to currently enrolled \nveterans upon a change of address or enrollment status.\n  The VA would be required to send such forms to the appropriate state \nelection official within 10 days, or within five days if the form is \nreceived within five days before a registration deadline.\n  Second, the VA would be required to provide assistance to veterans \nseeking to register to vote using the mail-in form. Such assistance \nwould be non-partisan.\n  Third, the bill would require the director of a VA community living \ncenter, domiciliary, or medical center to provide assistance to \nveterans with respect to voting by absentee ballot, consistent with \nstate and local laws. This section is limited to residents of a \ncommunity living center or domiciliary and inpatients of a medical \ncenter.\n  Fourth, the bill would ensure that the VA provides access for \nnonpartisan organizations to provide voter registration and assistance \nat VA facilities.\n  This is subject to reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions, \nincluding limiting activities to regular business hours and requiring \nadvance notice to the facility.\n  Fifth, the bill would prevent the VA from prohibiting access to VA \nfacilities by election administration officials at the state and local \nlevels, as long as the officials provide only nonpartisan information \nabout voting, such as voter registration, voting systems, absentee \nballoting, and polling locations. This is also subject to reasonable, \ntime, place, and manner restrictions.\n  Finally, the bill would require the VA to report annually on the \nnumber of veterans helped by this bill.\n  We owe our veterans a great debt. That debt includes a promise we \nwill not deny them the right to vote and will commit to involving them \nin the process of choosing leaders who may send Americans into harm's \nway. This bill would help veterans register to vote, and it would help \nveterans living in VA facilities cast their ballots.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Veteran Voting \nSupport Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Coburn, Ms. Klobuchar, and \n        Mr. Flake):\n  S. 2146. A bill to establish a United States Patent and Trademark \nOffice Innovation Promotion Fund, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to protect and secure the \nuser fees paid by America's inventors and businesses to the Patent and \nTrademark Office, and to stabilize that Office's funding, by \nintroducing the Patent Fee Integrity Act. I want to thank my co-\nsponsors on this bill, Senators Coburn, Klobuchar, and Flake.\n  Throughout most of its history, taxpayers supported the operations of \nthe Patent and Trademark Office, or PTO, through appropriations from \ngeneral funds. However, in 1990, Congress established a 69 percent user \nfee ``surcharge,'' so that the PTO became funded entirely through fees \npaid by its users, the American inventors who make our country the \nworld's technological leader.\n  Unfortunately, almost immediately, Congress began using the funds \nthat inventors paid to protect their inventions for other purposes. In \n1992, $8.1\n\n[[Page S1659]]\n\nmillion in user fees were diverted. In 1993, $12.3 million was \ndiverted. In 1994, $14.7 million. So it continued, growing each year, \nuntil what started as a trickle became a flood in 1998, with $199 \nmillion in PTO user fees diverted.\n  PTO user fees continued to be diverted in most of the following \nyears, at varying levels. In fiscal year 2011, as Congress was \nfinishing its work on major patent reform, a new fee diversion record \nwas set, a staggering $209 million in user fees diverted from the PTO \nthat year.\n  Meanwhile, at the same time that these fees were being taken away, \nthe length of time that it took to get a patent out of the Patent \nOffice steadily increased. In fiscal year 1991, average patent pendency \nwas 18.2 months. By fiscal year 1999, it had increased to 25 months. By \nfiscal year 2010, average patent pendency had increased all the way to \n35.3 months.\n  These are not just numbers. This is innovation being stifled from \nbeing brought to market. The longer it takes to get a patent approved, \nthe longer a new invention, a potential technological breakthrough, \nsits on the shelf, gathering dust instead of spurring job growth and \nscientific and economic progress.\n  Ultimately, this dulls our country's competitive edge in the global \neconomy. America's record of innovation is the envy of the world; it \nhas provided us a marked competitive edge over the decades and even \ncenturies. When we stifle the progress of our innovation within the \nPTO, we lose some of this competitive advantage, and the jobs and other \neconomic benefits that accompany it.\n  Obviously, there is a direct relationship between fee diversion and \npatent pendency. The more fees that are diverted away from the PTO, the \nfewer patent examiners they can hire, the more patents each examiner \nhas to process, and the longer it takes them to get to any individual \npatent--a longer patent pendency.\n  But it is not just the time that it takes to get a patent that is \nhurt by diversion of resources. The quality of the patents issued is \nharmed as well.\n  As members of this body know, the Senate Judiciary Committee is \nactively considering legislation to address abuses of the patent \nsystem, and the House of Representatives passed its own legislation on \nthe subject by a strong bipartisan vote of 325-91.\n  A variety of businesses all over the country are being sued and \nsubjected to letters demanding payment, often based on very \nquestionable patents that should never have been issued by the Patent \nOffice in the first place.\n  Businesses and lawyers have asserted patents for, by way of example: \nScanning and e-mailing a document; completing a purchase on a website \nwith one click, as opposed to multiple clicks; and e-mailing a press \nrelease, something that I think it's safe to say that every member of \nthis body does many times each month.\n  When there aren't enough patent examiners to give patent applications \nsufficient attention, bad patents get issued.\n  As the President and CEO of the Internet Association, which \nrepresents leading Internet companies like Amazon, eBay, Expedia, \nFacebook, Hotels.com, Netflix, Twitter, and Yahoo!, puts it: ``the \nPatent Fee Integrity Act . . . would provide the Patent and Trademark \nOffice with adequate funding and resources to improve overall patent \nquality. Improving patent quality is an essential step in improving the \nentire patent ecosystem by shutting off the supply of low-quality \npatents that fuel litigation by patent trolls.'' The Coalition for \nPatent Fairness, which includes such major companies as Blackberry, \nCisco, Dell, Google, Oracle, and Verizon, notes that ``When patent \nquality suffers, innovation throughout America's economy is stymied, \nand patent trolls are able to prosper.''\n  To make sure the Patent and Trademark Office has the resources it \nneeds to issue patents in a timely manner and to improve patent \nquality, in 2011, in the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, we gave the \nPTO the authority to increase its user fees.\n  Some of us fought at that time to end the practice of fee diversion, \nled by my co-sponsor Senator Coburn, to make sure that the users got \nthe full benefit of their increased fees. Unfortunately, our colleagues \non the other side of the Capitol watered down the language that the \nSenate passed to accomplish this purpose.\n  One of the sponsors defended that language when it came back to the \nSenate, arguing that the bill ``creates a PTO reserve fund for any fees \ncollected above the appropriated amounts in a given year--so that only \nthe PTO will have access to these fees.''\n  I warned then that the House's changes provided no assurance that \nthat is what would actually happen.\n  So what happened? Well, the PTO went ahead and raised its fees, as \nexpected.\n  Did it get to keep all those new fees?\n  Unfortunately, the government wasted little time in diverting the new \nfees. In fiscal year 2013, $121 million in PTO user fees were diverted, \ndue to sequestration. This pushed the total of PTO user fees diverted \nsince PTO was made self-sufficient in 1990 to over $1 billion, $171 \nmillion, to be exact.\n  Requiring the payment of higher patent fees which are then used for \ngeneral government purposes really amounts to a tax on innovation which \nis the last thing we should be burdening in today's technology-driven \neconomy.\n  The fact that this latest round of fee diversion occurred through \nsequestration provides another reason why the legislation we are \nintroducing today is needed. PTO never should have been subject to \nsequestration in the first place. As I have described, it is not \nsupported at all by taxpayer funds--it is completely funded by user \nfees. These users pay for a service when they send in their fees: the \ntimely consideration and processing of their patent or trademark \napplication or renewal. They are entitled to have the benefit of what \nthey paid for. These funds should not be sequestered, to pay for other \ngovernment services, for which there is a deficit. The PTO does not \ncontribute at all to the deficit, and that has been the case for more \nthan 20 years.\n  As a result of PTO's budgetary shortfall, in which sequestration \nplayed a significant part: information technology modernization was \nscaled back significantly; the process of opening new PTO satellite \noffices, called for in the America Invents Act, was frozen; hiring of \nmost support personnel was stopped; and travel and training was \nvirtually eliminated.\n  Last fall brought another unfortunate budgetary disruption: the \nshutdown of the federal government. Fortunately, the PTO was able to \nkeep operating for that limited time, with the balances it had in its \naccount. However, had the shutdown continued, PTO, too, would have been \nforced to close up--despite the fact that it collects fees that make it \nself-sustaining.\n  There is no good reason why PTO should be subject to sequestration \nand shutdown. As the Business Software Alliance states in their \nsupporting letter, ``This bill would ensure the USPTO can continue \nconducting self-funded operations that produce tremendous economic and \nsocial value for the United States.''\n  The Patent Fee Integrity Act strikes current language that makes PTO \nsubject to the appropriations process, which has been the principal \navenue through which its funding has been diverted, and ensures that it \ncan keep its funding. However, we also include measures to maintain \naccountability for the agency; the bill: requires the PTO Director to \nsubmit an annual report and operations plan to Congress; requires the \nPTO Director to submit an annual spending plan to the Appropriations \nCommittees; and requires an annual independent financial audit.\n  This bill is supported across the width and breadth of the patent \nuser community. It is endorsed by: Bayer Corporation; Biocom; The \nBiotechnology Industry Organization; BSA, The Software Alliance; The \nCoalition for Patent Fairness; The Coalition for 21st Century Patent \nReform, which represents a broad group of nearly 50 global corporations \nwho employ hundreds of thousands of Americans in a variety of sectors, \nincluding 3M, Caterpillar, General Electric, General Mills, Procter & \nGamble, Johnson & Johnson, Medtronic, and Northrop Grumman; Fallbrook \nTechnologies; The Innovation Alliance, which includes innovative small, \nmedium, and large businesses, including Dolby Laboratories and \nQUALCOMM; the Intellectual Property Owners Association, which\n\n[[Page S1660]]\n\nrepresents more than 200 companies and 12,000 individuals in the U.S. \nwho own intellectual property; The Internet Association; Mattel; Motor \n& Equipment Manufacturers Association; National Association of \nManufacturers; Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America; \nand Xerox.\n  Many of these groups disagree vehemently with each other about patent \nreform. However, they all come together to unite in support of the bill \nwe are introducing today, the Patent Fee Integrity Act.\n  BSA, The Software Alliance aptly observes, ``with their funds \nconstantly under attack, the USPTO faces an endless and unnecessary \nchallenge to provide the services for which American innovators have \nalready paid. The Patent Fee Integrity Act will help the USPTO continue \nto increase patent quality, provide critical, time-sensitive services, \nand guarantee continuity of its operations independent of continually-\nshifting political considerations.''\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this critical bill. As \nthe Coalition for 21st Century Patent Reform and others observed in the \nletter they sent to me in support of this bill: ``Your legislation \nwould empower the USPTO to fully support America's innovators without \nadding a single penny to the deficit.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    BSA/The Software Alliance,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 13, 2013.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: On behalf of BSA/The Software \n     Alliance and its members, which are among the world's most \n     innovative companies, I write to express strong support for \n     the Patent Fee Integrity Act, which would remove the US \n     Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) from the congressional \n     appropriations process. This bill would ensure the USPTO can \n     continue conducting self-funded operations that produce \n     tremendous economic and social value for the United States.\n       The USPTO plays an indispensable role in sparking the \n     growth of America's economy by protecting intellectual \n     property (IP) and promoting innovation. Over the last two \n     decades, however, the federal government has withheld, \n     diverted, or sequestered more than $1 billion in USPTO user \n     fee collections. This bill recognizes that with their funds \n     constantly under attack, the USPTO faces an endless and \n     unnecessary challenge to provide the services for which \n     American innovators have already paid.\n       The Patent Fee Integrity Act will help the USPTO continue \n     to increase patent quality, provide critical, time-sensitive \n     services, and guarantee continuity of its operations \n     independent of continually-shifting political considerations. \n     Moreover, it will protect against reducing the USPTO's \n     operating capacity at a time when it needs to expand to \n     enable American businesses to bring new innovations to \n     market.\n       We commend you for your leadership in introducing the \n     Patent Fee Integrity Act and look forward to working with you \n     and others to ensure it garners the broad bipartisan support \n     it deserves.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Victoria A. Espinel,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   March 13, 2014.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: We commend you for introducing the \n     Patent Fee Integrity Act and we offer our full support.\n       America's economic future depends on our continued ability \n     to innovate and commercialize new products and processes. \n     American businesses are among the most dynamic and innovative \n     in the world. We develop the technology that creates jobs and \n     stimulates our economy. Our nation's universities partner \n     with business to conduct the ground-breaking research, as \n     well as educate the creative people, that fuel the innovative \n     dynamism of the business sector. Such investment is not \n     without risk, which is why the Patent Fee Integrity Act has \n     never been more critical.\n       U.S. innovators rely on patents to protect their investment \n     in the research and development of breakthrough innovations \n     such as manufacturing and product technologies and life-\n     saving drugs. Valid and enforceable patent rights are \n     essential in this process and enable the United States to \n     maintain its competitive edge. An adequately funded United \n     States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is vital in \n     ensuring that high quality patent rights are promptly \n     granted. Yet, the precarious funding situation of the USPTO \n     makes the realization of this essential mission impossible.\n       Over the last two decades, the government has withheld, \n     diverted, or sequestered hundreds of millions of USPTO user \n     fee dollars. With uncertain and insufficient funding, the \n     USPTO faces an endless and unnecessary challenge in providing \n     the services for which American innovators have requested and \n     paid. The Patent Fee Integrity Act would end this problem by \n     removing the USPTO from the Congressional appropriations \n     process and allow all of its user fees to fund its \n     operations. Your legislation would empower the USPTO to fully \n     support America's innovators without adding a single penny to \n     the deficit.\n       Our innovation based economy demands a fully-funded USPTO. \n     The USPTO needs predictability and certainty in its budgeting \n     so that it can provide the patent protection needed champion \n     America's innovators.

When patent quality suffers, innovation throughout \n     America's economy is stymied, and patent trolls are able to \n     prosper. Quite clearly, patent reviews conducted today will \n     have a lasting impact in the future; by helping to establish \n     adequate funding of the PTO, the Patent Fee Integrity Act \n     will support innovation.\n       The U.S. patent system plays an important role in helping \n     America's economy flourish, and abuses of that system pose a \n     significant threat to innovation and economic growth. We \n     thank Senator Feinstein for her leadership and will continue \n     to work with her and her colleagues toward the passage of \n     patent litigation reform.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                       Fallbrook Technologies,\n\n                                   Cedar Park, TX, March 13, 2014.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: As CEO of an emerging technology \n     company with roots in California, I write to enthusiastically \n     endorse your effort to introduce patent legislation that is \n     critically important to America's innovation ecosystem and \n     the U.S. economy, the Patent Fee Integrity Act. Although \n     Fallbrook Technologies cautions the Senate to tread extremely \n     cautiously with other proposed patent legislation, the Patent \n     Fee Integrity Act represents the only patent reform bill \n     which advances the one issue that unifies intellectual \n     property stakeholders across the innovation spectrum and thus \n     should be advanced by the Senate without delay.\n       Fallbrook is an emerging manufacturing and technology \n     development company dedicated to improving the flexibility of \n     power transmission within a wide variety of mechanical \n     devices. Currently, Fallbrook is located in Texas, but we \n     have California ties as our technology was invented in \n     Fallbrook, California, a large number of our investors are in \n     California and some key employees currently reside in San \n     Diego. Our core technology is the patented and award-winning \n     NuVinci' continuously variable planetary (CVP) \n     transmission system. Fallbrook's NuVinci CVP technology is a \n     standard component on more than 60 major bicycle brands \n     throughout Europe, and can improve the performance and \n     efficiency of products that use a transmission, such as \n     automobiles, agricultural equipment, light electric vehicles, \n     outdoor power equipment and wind turbines. Fallbrook employs \n     over 130 people in the U.S. (as of the date of this letter), \n     including about 30 of the best engineers in the transmission \n     sector. We currently hold over 600 patents and pending \n     applications worldwide and are working with our key \n     automotive licensees to bring gas-saving vehicles to the \n     marketplace.\n       As you are aware, for more than a decade, American \n     innovators like Fallbrook have had our U.S. Patent and \n     Trademark Office user fees diverted by Congress for other \n     purposes. Essentially, such fee diversion has worked as an \n     innovation tax which slows the technology development process \n     and hinders job creation. The Patent Fee Integrity Act will \n     repeal this innovation tax and is long overdue. Full USPTO \n     funding will provide the USPTO the resources it needs to \n     improve patent quality while Congress determines whether \n     further actions may be needed to improve the patent system.\n\n[[Page S1661]]\n\n       We applaud you and your bipartisan cosponsors for \n     introducing the bill and stand ready to assist you in any way \n     necessary.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    William Klehm,\n     Chairman and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                          Innovation Alliance,\n\n                                                   March 13, 2014.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: The Innovation Alliance, a \n     coalition of research and development-focused companies, \n     thanks you and your cosponsors for introducing the Patent Fee \n     Integrity Act, which will put an end to fee diversion once \n     and for all. We have long maintained that ending fee \n     diversion, and thereby giving the U.S. Patent & Trademark \n     Office (``USPTO'') all of the fees it is paid by patent \n     applicants, is the single most important change policymakers \n     can make to improve the U.S. patent system.\n       Over the last 20 years, approximately $1 billion in fees \n     paid by patent applicants has been diverted from its proper \n     use at the USPTO. This unwarranted diversion of fees has \n     resulted in more than 600,000 unexamined patent applications \n     and more than 28 months in the average patent pendency time. \n     Ending this tax on innovation is perhaps the one change to \n     the patent law that unites stakeholders from all parts of the \n     innovation ecosystem in the United States.\n       The Innovation Alliance thanks you for your leadership on \n     this critically important issue for the patent system. We \n     look forward to working with you and your cosponsors to pass \n     the Patent Fee Integrity Act into law as soon as possible.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Brian Pomper,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             Intellectual Property\n\n\n                                           Owners Association,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 12, 2014.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: Intellectual Property Owners \n     Association (IPO) writes to express its strong support for \n     the Patent Fee Integrity Act, to provide for the permanent \n     funding of the United States Patent and Trademark Office \n     (USPTO).\n       IPO is a trade association representing companies and \n     individuals in all industries and fields of technology who \n     own or are interested in intellectual property rights. IPO's \n     membership includes more than 200 companies and more than \n     12,500 individuals who are involved in the association either \n     through their companies or as inventor, author, law firm, or \n     attorney members. Our members all agree that the United \n     States needs a fully-funded USPTO to keep our nation \n     competitive, encourage innovation and create new jobs.\n       Over the last two decades the government has withheld, \n     diverted or sequestered about $1 billion in USPTO user fee \n     collections. Removing the USPTO from the congressional \n     appropriations process is the most promising approach we know \n     for stopping the hemorrhaging of USPTO fees. We hope the \n     Senate will move ahead with the bill as soon as possible.\n       Thank you for your help in securing full, permanent funding \n     for the USPTO.

Improving \n     patent quality is an essential step in improving the entire \n     patent ecosystem by shutting off the supply of low-quality \n     patents that fuel litigation by patent trolls. That is why \n     The Internet Association also supports an expanded review of \n     the covered business method patent program to eliminate \n     patents that never been granted in the first instance. An \n     expanded review program, coupled with strong fee shifting and \n     discovery provisions, make up the necessary components of a \n     meaningful response to the patent troll epidemic. We look \n     forward to working with Senator Feinstein and Members of the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee as they prepare to address these \n     important issues in the coming weeks.\n\n\n                     About The Internet Association\n\n       The Internet Association, the unified voice of the Internet \n     economy, represents the interests of the leading Internet \n     companies including Airbnb, Amazon, AOL, eBay, Expedia, \n     Facebook, Gilt, Google, IAC, Linkedln, Lyft, Monster \n     Worldwide, Netflix, Practice Fusion, Rackspace, reddit, \n     Salesforce.com, SurveyMonkey, TripAdvisor, Twitter, Uber \n     Technologies, Inc., Yelp, Yahoo!, and Zynga.

Res. 384\n\n       Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 2139, \n     adopted on February 22, 2014, expresses grave alarm at the \n     significant and rapid deterioration of the humanitarian \n     situation in Syria, in particular the dire situation of \n     hundreds of thousands of civilians trapped in besieged areas, \n     most of whom are besieged by the Syrian armed forces and some \n     by opposition groups, as well as the dire situation of over \n     3,000,000 people in hard-to-reach areas, and deplores the \n     difficulties in providing, and the failure to provide, access \n     for the humanitarian assistance to all civilians in need \n     inside Syria;\n       Whereas widespread and systematic attacks on civilians, \n     schools, hospitals, and other civilian infrastructure, in \n     violation of international humanitarian law, continue in \n     Syria, and parties to the conflict are blocking humanitarian \n     aid delivery, including food and medical care from many \n     civilian areas;\n       Whereas the World Health Organization estimates that 70 \n     percent of Syria's health professionals, up to 80,000 people, \n     have fled the country, cases of typhoid, tuberculosis, polio \n     and other diseases are rampant and increasing, and medical \n     personnel inside Syria are deliberately targeted by parties \n     to the conflict;\n       Whereas the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees \n     (UNHCR) has registered\n\n[[Page S1662]]\n\n     more than 2,500,000 Syrian refugees, nearly 80 percent of \n     whom are women and children, and by the end of this year, the \n     United Nations estimates the number of refugees will increase \n     to 4,000,000;\n       Whereas nearly 500,000 refugees from the Syrian conflict \n     are children under the age of five, and more than 11,000 \n     children have been killed and thousands more have suffered \n     severe injuries, including burns, shrapnel wounds, the \n     severing of limbs, and spinal cord injuries;\n       Whereas over 5,000,000 children affected by the conflict \n     desperately need food, clean water, shelter, medical care and \n     psychosocial support;\n       Whereas, since 2011, nearly 3,000,000 Syrian children have \n     been forced to quit their education as fighting has destroyed \n     classrooms, left children too terrified to go to school, and \n     forced families to flee the country;\n       Whereas the refugee crisis threatens the stability of the \n     Middle East, putting immense burdens on Syria's neighbors, \n     most notably Lebanon and Jordan, as well as Turkey and Iraq;

and\n       (13) calls on the President to develop and submit to the \n     appropriate committees of Congress within 90 days from \n     adoption of this resolution a strategy for United States \n     engagement in addressing the Syrian humanitarian crisis, to \n     include assistance and development, and protecting human \n     rights inside Syria and in the region.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, today, along with Senator Rubio, I am \nsubmitting a bipartisan resolution to coincide with the third \nanniversary of the Syria crisis.\n  We are witnessing one of history's greatest humanitarian catastrophes \nunfolding before our eyes. The numbers are staggering. Nearly 3 million \nSyrians have fled to neighboring countries. Syrians are about to pass \nAfghans as the world's biggest refugee population.\n  The UN released a report this week stating Syria has become the \nworld's most dangerous place for children. This is truly heartbreaking. \nMore than 5.5 million children are in need of desperate humanitarian \nassistance and three million are out of school. 40,000 babies have been \nborn as refugees.\n  Conditions inside are even Syria worse. There are nearly 7 million \ninternally displaced persons and over 9 million in need of humanitarian \nassistance. Nearly 250,000 remained besieged, mostly at the hands of \nthe Assad regime, and are suffering from disease and starvation.\n  The Syria Humanitarian Resolution of 2014 strongly condemns the \nunlawful use of violence against civilians by all parties to the \nconflict in Syria, particularly the ongoing violence and widespread \nhuman rights violations perpetrated against the people of Syria by the \nGovernment of Syria.\n  The resolution urges all parties to the conflict to immediately halt \nindiscriminate attacks on civilians and to allow for immediate, \nunfettered access to humanitarian aid throughout the Syrian Arab \nRepublic, respecting the safety, security, independence, and \nimpartiality of humanitarian workers and ensuring freedom of movement \nto deliver aid. We call on the international community to assist the \npeople of Syria, especially internally displaced persons and refugees, \nin meeting basic needs, including access to food, health care, shelter, \nand clean drinking water. Finally we call for the full implementation \nof UN Security Council 2139 and call on the President to submit to the \nappropriate committees of Congress within 90 days a strategy for United \nStates engagement in addressing the Syrian humanitarian crisis, to \ninclude assistance and development, and protection of human rights \ninside Syria and in the region.\n  The solution to the Syrian conflict will be complicated. But the \npeople of Syria should not continue to suffer in the interim. I refuse \nto accept that there is nothing more we can do to end the suffering. \nHumanitarian relief and access are fundamental principles all parties \nshould adhere to. History will harshly judge those who do not.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/13/senate-section/article/S1662-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1662]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 385--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE \n          USE OF ELECTRONIC DEVICES ON THE FLOOR OF THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE (for himself and Mr. Enzi) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration:\n\n                              S.

Madam President, I know the day is long; I feel it as much, \nif not more, than anyone else. But before consent is granted, I can't \nlet the night go by and this about to pass without saying something \nabout this good man.\n  I have had the good fortune to travel the world meeting Kings, \nPresidents, Prime Ministers, and many people, but I have never met \nanyone more impressive than this man. He is a visionary. What he has \ndone for the small country of Israel, which is so important to us, is \nsomething the history books will report for generations to come.\n\n[[Page S1667]]\n\n  I spoke with him earlier this week about another matter. I haven't \nbeen to Israel a lot of times, but I have been there a few times. Every \ntime I go, I make sure to take my delegation to visit him. I always \ntell them this is my favorite. I think so much of this man. It is the \nleast we can do for someone who has done so much for world peace and so \nmuch for our country.\n  I will be fairly quick. I was a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives and was on a delegation led by the late Tom Lantos, a \nHungarian Jew who escaped the Holocaust because of Raoul Wallenberg. \nThere have been a lot of Members of Congress there and a number of \ndelegations, but Tom Lantos said to him in that beautiful speaking \nvoice he had in that Hungarian accent: Here is our delegation, Mr. \nPrime Minister. We are so sorry to bother you. We know how busy you \nare, how many difficult situations you have in your country.\n  I will never forget this. He said: You don't understand. I am never \ntoo busy to meet with the delegation from the Congress of the United \nStates. They have done so much for my country.\n  He said a few other things. I have said--and I want the Record to so \nreflect--this is something we need to do as quickly as possible.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2851\n\n  Mr. REID.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Shimon Peres was born in Poland in 1923.\n       (2) The Peres family emigrated to Tel Aviv in 1934, and all \n     of the family members of Shimon Peres who remained in Poland \n     were murdered during the Holocaust.\n       (3) Before Israel gained independence, Shimon Peres earned \n     the respect of senior leaders in the independence movement in \n     Israel, most notably David Ben-Gurion.\n       (4) The founding generation of Israel was central to the \n     development of Israel, and Shimon Peres is the only surviving \n     member of that founding generation.\n       (5) Shimon Peres has served in numerous high-level cabinet \n     positions and ministerial posts in Israel, including head of \n     the Israeli Navy, Minister of Defense, Foreign Minister, \n     Prime Minister, and President, among many others.\n       (6) Shimon Peres has honorably served Israel for over 70 \n     years, during which he has significantly contributed to \n     United States interests and has played a pivotal role in \n     forging the strong and unbreakable bond between the United \n     States and Israel.\n       (7) By presenting the Congressional Gold Medal to Shimon \n     Peres, the first to be awarded to a sitting President of \n     Israel, Congress proclaims its unbreakable bond with Israel \n     and reaffirms its continual support for Israel as we \n     commemorate the 65th anniversary of the independence of \n     Israel and the 90th birthday of Shimon Peres, which are both \n     significant milestones in Israeli history.\n       (8) Maintaining strong bilateral relations between the \n     United States and Israel has been a priority of Shimon Peres \n     since he began working with the United States in the days of \n     John F. Kennedy. The strong bond is exemplified by the \n     following:\n       (A) President Reagan said to Shimon Peres upon his visit to \n     the United States, ``Mr. Prime Minister, I thank you very \n     much for your visit. It's been an occasion to renew a \n     friendship and to review and enhance the strength of our \n     unique bilateral relationship.''\n       (B) At another point President Reagan said of Shimon Peres, \n     ``His vision, his statesmanship and his tenacity are greatly \n     appreciated here.''\n       (C) While visiting with Shimon Peres at the Residence of \n     the President in Jerusalem, President Obama described Shimon \n     Peres as ``. . . a son of Israel who's devoted his life to \n     keeping Israel strong and sustaining the bonds between our \n     two nations''.\n       (D) On March 20, 2013, Shimon Peres reaffirmed his belief \n     in the relationship between the United States and Israel, \n     stating, ``America stood by our side from the very beginning. \n     You support us as we rebuild our ancient homeland and as we \n     defend our land. From Holocaust to redemption.''\n       (E) On March 21, 2013, Shimon Peres stated, ``. . . America \n     is so great and we are so small. But I learned that you don't \n     measure us by size, but by values. When it comes to values, \n     we are you and you are us. . . . As I look back, I feel that \n     the Israel of today has exceeded the vision we had 65 years \n     ago. Reality has surpassed our dreams. The United States of \n     America helped us to make this possible.''\n\n     SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.\n\n       (a) Award Authorized.--The President pro tempore of the \n     Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives shall \n     make appropriate arrangements for the award, on behalf of \n     Congress, of a single gold medal of appropriate design to \n     President Shimon Peres.\n       (b) Design and Striking.--For the purpose of the award \n     referred to in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury \n     shall strike a gold medal with suitable emblems, devices, and \n     inscriptions to be determined by the Secretary.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 324, S. Res. 375.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 375) concerning the crisis in the \n     Central African Republic and supporting United States and \n     international efforts to end the violence, protect civilians, \n     and address root causes of the conflict.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution, which had been reported from the Committee on Foreign \nRelations, with an amendment and an amendment to the preamble, as \nfollows:\n  (Insert the part printed in italic.)\n  (Strike the preamble and insert the part printed in italic.)\n\n                              S. Res. 375\n\n       Whereas, for more than 50 years, successive governments in \n     the Central African Republic have struggled to build a \n     durable system of democratic institutions, to effectively \n     secure and control the country's territory and borders, and \n     to ensure a basic level of socio-economic development for the \n     country's people;\n       Whereas, despite its natural resource wealth, the Central \n     African Republic remains one of the poorest countries in the \n     world and one of the lowest ranking countries in terms of \n     human development according to the United Nations Development \n     Program;\n       Whereas, in January 2013, regional leaders brokered the \n     Libreville Agreements between the government of then-\n     President Francois Bozize and the loosely allied rebel \n     militia known as Seleka, which resulted in the formation of a \n     government of national unity;\n       Whereas, despite the Libreville Agreements, President \n     Bozize was ousted in March 2013 by the Seleka coalition, and \n     the Seleka leader, Michel Djotodia, declared himself \n     president;\n       Whereas, in April 2013, regional leaders issued the \n     N'djamena Declaration in an effort to pursue a return to \n     constitutional order based on the Libreville Agreements;\n       Whereas an influx of foreign fighters, especially from Chad \n     and Sudan, has been a major factor in the increased number of \n     Seleka fighters, from approximately 5,000 in March 2013, to \n     an estimated 20,000 as of December 2013;\n       Whereas both Seleka forces and armed militia groups known \n     as ``anti-balakas'', some of which formed initially as a \n     means of protecting communities against Seleka, have been \n     implicated in ethnically-motivated violence and grave and \n     systemic human rights abuses against civilians;\n       Whereas, over the course of the crisis, Seleka and anti-\n     balaka groups have displayed weak control and command \n     structures, and committed crimes against humanity with \n     impunity;\n       Whereas, according to UNICEF, thousands of child soldiers \n     are involved in armed groups in the Central African Republic, \n     amid the near-total collapse of the country's primary \n     education system;\n       Whereas interethnic, intercommunal, and interreligious \n     tensions and violence have risen to alarming levels and led \n     to systematic human rights abuses in the Central African \n     Republic, including targeted killings, rapes, acts of \n     torture, looting, and arbitrary detention;\n       Whereas the United States Embassy in Bangui suspended \n     operations on December 28, 2012, and the ordered departure of \n     country team staff has temporarily suspended the diplomatic \n     presence and consular services of the United States in the \n     Central African Republic;\n       Whereas more than 700,000 civilians have been internally \n     displaced; another 290,000 have sought refuge in neighboring \n     countries, including the Democratic Republic of the Congo, \n     Chad, Cameroon, and South Sudan; 2,600,000 people, or over \n     half of the population of the Central African Republic, are \n     in need of humanitarian assistance; and 60 percent of \n     households have no available food stocks;\n       Whereas a failure of the international community to \n     appropriately respond to and address the rapidly \n     deteriorating situation in the Central African Republic could \n     result in further atrocities, mass displacement, and \n     protracted instability with significant repercussions for \n     regional and international security;\n       Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 2127 \n     (2013) called for urgent and increased international \n     assistance to the African Union International Support Mission \n     in the Central African Republic (MISCA) to ensure that the \n     force can fulfill its mandate to restore security and protect \n     civilians, and placed an arms embargo on the Central African \n     Republic;\n       Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 2127 \n     requested the Secretary-General to establish an international \n     commission of inquiry to investigate reports of human rights \n     abuses in the Central African Republic in order to ensure \n     accountability for perpetrators of violence;\n       Whereas the United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office \n     in the Central African Republic has been hindered by a lack \n     of resources and constrained by insecurity;\n       Whereas, consistent with United Nations Security Council \n     Resolution 2127, the Government of France launched a \n     stabilization operation, Operation Sangaris, in the Central \n     African Republic to assist MISCA in fulfilling its mandate;\n       Whereas, on March 3, 2014, United Nations Secretary-General \n     Ban Ki-moon recommended to the United Nations Security \n     Council a transition to a United Nations peacekeeping mission \n     with a primary mandate to protect civilians; and\n       Whereas the United States Government has provided crisis \n     and humanitarian assistance commitments totaling $182,500,000 \n     in response to instability in the Central African Republic, \n     including support for conflict resolution efforts, \n     humanitarian assistance to refugees and internally displaced \n     persons, and assistance to troop contributing countries to \n     MISCA such as airlift, non-lethal equipment, military \n     logistics, and training, as well as logistical support for \n     French forces: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns the violence, atrocities, abuses, and human \n     rights violations committed by all parties to the conflict in \n     the Central African Republic;\n       (2) commends the efforts of religious and community leaders \n     in the Central African Republic condemning violence and \n     engaging in conflict prevention and conflict resolution \n     activities;\n       (3) welcomes the mobilization of international \n     peacekeeping, conflict mitigation, humanitarian, and \n     diplomatic resources, and encourages continued efforts to \n     help address humanitarian needs, bring an end to the \n     violence, and develop sustainable democratic institutions in \n     the Central African Republic;\n       (4) welcomes the January 2014 decision of the Transitional \n     National Council on the election of Catherine Samba-Panza as \n     the Central African Republic's new transitional president;\n       (5) commends the African Union and its troop and police \n     contributing countries for their work establishing and \n     supporting MISCA;\n       (6) recognizes the Economic Community of Central African \n     States (CEEAS) for its leadership in the political transition \n     process;\n       (7) commends France for its swift intervention under United \n     Nations Security Council Resolution 2127, and for its \n     contributions to stabilization efforts and other forms of \n     assistance;\n       (8) welcomes the United Nations Security Council support \n     for MISCA and the Department of Peacekeeping Operation's \n     ongoing contingency planning for a possible transition to a \n     United Nations peacekeeping operation;\n       (9) affirms support for multilateral peacekeeping and \n     policing capacities and recognizes the important \n     contributions these efforts have made in protecting civilians \n     in the Central African Republic and promoting international \n     peace and stability;\n       (10) calls on the President to work with international \n     partners to develop a short-term strategy to support a full \n     and immediate cessation of armed conflict in the Central \n     African Republic, including attacks targeting civilians and \n     the recruitment of child soldiers;\n       (11) calls on the President to develop a long-term United \n     States strategy, in support of international and domestic \n     efforts, to establish a durable peace and greater security \n     for the Central African Republic and to enhance regional \n     stability, including--\n       (A) engagement and coordination with the international \n     community, including the African Union, the Economic \n     Community of Central African States, the United Nations, and \n     other partners;\n       (B) appropriate assistance to help provide emergency relief \n     and support reconciliation for the people of the Central \n     African Republic;\n\n[[Page S1669]]\n\n       (C) technical, logistical and other forms of assistance, as \n     appropriate, in support of effective disarmament, \n     demobilization, and reintegration of fighters; and\n       (D) support for appropriate mechanisms to ensure \n     accountability for perpetrators of human rights abuses and \n     violence; and\n       (12) urges the Secretary of State to consider the \n     expeditious reestablishment of a United States diplomatic \n     presence in the Central African Republic.\n\n  Mr. REID.

Res. 392\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this resolution concerns a subpoena for \ndocuments and deposition testimony in a civil action pending in New \nJersey Federal District Court. Plaintiffs in the case own and manage \nfive assisted-living facilities in Connecticut and are in a labor \ndispute with the employees of those facilities. They have sued the \nunion representing those employees for allegedly criminal and fradulent \ntactics in this labor dispute.\n  Plaintiffs have sent a subpoena to Senator Blumenthal seeking \ntestimony and documents involving a broad scope of matters beyond \nmerely the underlying labor dispute. Senator Blumenthal has agreed to \nseek Senate authorization to provide written communications between his \noffice and the union regarding the underlying labor dispute. However, \nthe Senator believes this subpoena presents an undue burden as it is \noverly broad in scope and seeks material that is not relevant to the \nlawsuit, and also encroaches on areas subject to privilege, and \ntherefore objects to producing other documents and to the request for \ndeposition testimony.\n  This resolution would authorize the production of documents from \nSenator Blumenthal's office except where a privilege or objection is \nasserted.

We \nhave a new bipartisan unemployment insurance compromise introduced \ntoday that was put together by a group of bipartisan Senators. We have \nthe SGR, the so-called doc fix, to prevent a 24-percent cut in Medicare \npayments to doctors, which would be extremely hurtful to patients. We \nhave to do that. We have a backlog of nominations we have to do.\n  Everyone should understand--I hope it is not necessary--because of \nthe enormous amount of work we have to do this month, Senators should \nbe on notice--all Senators--that there is a high probability that we \nneed to be in session on the weekend of March 29 and 30, before the end \nof the month.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/13/senate-section/article/S1670-4", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1670]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS THROUGH MONDAY, MARCH 24, 2014\n\n  Mr. REID.
