Mr. President, following my remarks and those of the \nRepublican leader, the Senate will be in a period of morning business \nuntil 12:30 p.m. today. During that period of time, Senators will be \npermitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each.\n  Following morning business, the Senate will recess from 12:30 p.m. \nuntil 2:15 p.m., to allow for weekly caucus meetings. At 2:15 p.m. the \nSenate will proceed to rollcall votes on confirmation of the Baran and \nBurns nominations, followed by several voice votes on executive \nnominations.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time between 3 p.m. \nand 4 p.m. today be under the control of the majority and the time from \n4 p.m. until 5 p.m. be under the control of the Republicans.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           A Flawed Approach\n\n  Mr. President, the 18th century French philosopher Voltaire once \nsaid:\n\n       One day everything will be well, that is our hope. \n     Everything's fine today, that is our illusion.\n\n  There is no better portrayal of the Republican Party's flawed \napproach to governance than what Voltaire said. Senate Republicans \ndeceive themselves by thinking their obstruction is good for the \nNation, that the status quo is helping American families. Meanwhile, \nthe Republicans are out stumping and promising the American people that \nif they just put Republicans in charge, everything will be better. What \nare those promises based on? Certainly not recent history.\n  Let's take a look at what Republicans in this body have done for \nAmerican families: Republicans have blocked the Paycheck Fairness Act \nnot once, not twice, not even three times but four times, thereby \npreventing American women from receiving a fair wage for their work. \nRemember, this is simply making it possible for a woman who does the \nexact same work as a man to get paid the exact same amount of money. \nRepublicans have blocked legislation to prevent companies from denying \ntheir workers specific health benefits, including birth control, as \nrequired by Federal law.\n  Republicans also blocked a bill allowing Americans with student debt \nto refinance their loans at lower interest rates. The student loan debt \nstands at $1.3 trillion. It is higher than credit card debt. It is \nhigher than any other debt.\n  Republicans rejected an increase in the minimum wage, essentially \nrelegating millions of hard-working\n\n[[Page S5596]]\n\nAmericans to poverty. Republicans even refused to give unemployment \nbenefits to the very long-term unemployed. Republicans rejected the \nBring Jobs Home Act which would end the absurd practice of American \nworkers bankrolling the outsourcing of their very own jobs.\n  Republicans even filibustered an extension of tax credits that help \nAmerican families. The Republicans have repeatedly refused to pass \ncommonsense immigration reform that keeps families together, spurs the \neconomy, and reduces our national debt by $1 trillion. Let's not \nforget, Republicans in Congress shut down the Federal Government. Too \noften Republicans have rebuffed Democrats' attempts to give American \nfamilies a fair shot. Republicans must know their obstruction is \nhurting our country. The Republicans must know the status quo is not \nworking.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Navy Yard Tragedy\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, 1 year ago today, just a few blocks \nfrom here, a lone gunman slipped into the Navy Yard and tragically took \n12 lives. It was one of the deadliest such attacks on a U.S. military \nbase in American history. We have not forgotten those who fell that day \nin Building 197, and all of us in the Senate send our condolences to \ntheir families and everyone who loved them. They are not forgotten.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. President, the Democrats who run Washington have had almost 6 \nyears to fix the economy. They have already tried just about everything \ntheir ideology will allow to fix it. They raised taxes on everything \nfrom lifesaving medical devices to personal medical expenses. They have \npiled up record debt and shoveled billions in subsidies to the well \nconnected, and they have empowered bureaucrats to cancel health care \nplans for the middle class, declared war on the jobs of vulnerable \nKentucky families and--through EPA's Waters of the United States \nproposed rule--they are trying to regulate every last pond and ditch in \nour country. None of this has worked.\n  According to a recent Gallup survey, a solid majority of Americans \nbelieves the economy is actually getting worse, not better. Let's not \nforget that for several years the Democrats had supermajority control \nof Washington, could have passed anything they wanted, and all too \noften they did.\n  Since then, a Republican-led House of Representatives has tried to \nadvance solutions on its own by passing dozens of jobs bills--many with \nstrong bipartisan support over in the House. But the Democratic \nmajority in the Senate simply refuses to take them up, and it is hard \nto understand why. It is hard to know if today's Washington Democratic \nParty is blinded by ideology or if they are so obsessed with the never-\nending campaign that they cannot be bothered to govern.\n  Whatever the reason, the simple truth is this: Washington Democrats \nhad a choice between helping the middle class and bowing to campaign \npollsters and the left. It is obvious whom they chose.\n  The American people are worried about ISIL and the continuing threat \nof terrorism. They see a humanitarian crisis at the border. Many \nstruggle every month to pay the bills. Millions still can't find work.\n  How do Democrats respond? They bring up a bill that would take an \neraser to the First Amendment. So the hard left is clearly in the \ndriver's seat on the other side. That is clear every time the \nDemocratic majority ignores the concerns of our constituents to turn to \nyet another one of their so-called messaging bills, such as the recent \none on eroding free speech, and it is truly a shame. That is not why \nthe American people sent us.\n  It is long past time for Democrats to drop all the designed-to-fail \nbills and turn to serious job-creation ideas instead. There are \nliterally dozens of House-passed jobs bills on the majority leader's \ndesk. Why not pick up some of them and pass them. Let's get them to the \nPresident. Let's work together on a serious energy policy. Let's join \nhands to erase the strain on working moms and dads. Let's work toward \nsensible health care reform that doesn't hurt the middle class as \nObamaCare does. Let's help college graduates find full-time work and \nstart marching toward the careers they have always dreamed of. That is \njust a start.\n  If the Democratic Party is truly interested in getting serious, they \nshould look at the many commonsense policy ideas advocated by Senators \non my side of the aisle.\n\n\n                              NLRB Reform\n\n  Mr. President, my friend the senior Senator from Tennessee has always \nbeen a strong advocate for smart reform policies. He will discuss \nanother one of those in just a moment. It is a bill that would go a \nlong way toward remedying a serious problem that has been caused by the \npolitics-at-all-cost mentality I have just described.\n  Here is the issue: Everybody is familiar with the President's \nunconstitutional effort to pack the National Labor Relations Board with \nliberal partisans back in early 2012. Some people are also familiar \nwith the NLRB's more recent effort to undermine secret ballots for \nunion elections, allow labor bosses access to sensitive employee \ninformation without their consent, and prevent companies from building \nfactories in States with laws the President's picks don't like.\n  The NLRB is trying to destroy the franchisee model that has allowed \nso many Americans to own and operate their own businesses. They want to \ntake away independence from small business men and women--such as \ndecisions on whom to hire, how much to pay them, and how to run their \nbusiness--and put it in the hands of corporate bosses. The so-called \njoint employer standard is all about politics and appeasing the left.\n  Big Labor bosses want it because it helps them expand and acquire \nmore dues at the cost of small business owners who employ so many \nAmericans. This is simply not right. For many in the middle class \nfranchising represents a ticket to the dream of opening their own \nbusiness. For many it may be their only chance to live that dream.\n  This is how one single mom and second-generation franchisee put it:\n\n       To have my franchiser take over greater control of my daily \n     operations would not only change my relationship with them, \n     but it would ruin the dream of small business ownership for \n     many hardworking Americans.\n\n  This is what a hotel franchise in Lexington had to say:\n\n       My family came to the United States in search of the \n     American dream and we found it as hoteliers and franchisees. \n     The current franchise model has been instrumental in \n     providing my family and me with opportunities for \n     entrepreneurship and the ability to employ over 300 \n     hardworking Kentuckians.\n\n  But this Kentuckian warned that this action by the NLRB could end his \nindependence as a small business owner by ceding decisions to a far-off \ncorporate headquarters. The NLRB action could have ``devastating \nimpacts on my ability to create jobs, grow my businesses and support my \ncommunity,'' he said.\n  Extreme, politically motivated proposals such as these hurt our \nconstituents.\n  It is time to restore the balance to the National Labor Relations \nBoard. Let's take the politics out of it. That is just what the \nlegislation of my friend from Tennessee seeks to do. I will let him \nexplain it, but here is the key: It would restore the NLRB to its \nproper role as an umpire instead of an advocate for the right or the \nleft. It is the kind of thing our constituents want to see us doing--\nstanding up for reform and against entrenched political interests.\n  I am asking our Democratic friends to please shelve the designed-to-\nfail playbook and work with Republicans on a designed-to-succeed agenda \ninstead. Six years of failure is quite enough.\n\n\n                             Ebola Epidemic\n\n  Today President Obama will visit the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention to announce new efforts to contain the Ebola epidemic in \nWest Africa. The U.S. Africa Command will stand up a Joint Force \nCommand in Monrovia, Liberia, to provide command and control of U.S. \nmilitary activities and help coordinate international relief efforts. \nCurrent estimates are that 3,000 military personnel will establish an \nintermediate staging base for supplies and equipment, set up a training \nsite to prepare 500 health care workers per week to provide medical \ncare to patients, and stand up a\n\n[[Page S5597]]\n\nfield Defense Department hospital to care for any of our health care \nworkers who become ill. Also contributing to our national reaction to \nthis epidemic is the U.S. Agency for International Development.\n  The CDC has deployed personnel to Africa, and the National Institute \nof Health is developing an investigational Ebola vaccine. CDC is also \nworking with Customs and Border Patrol to identify travelers showing \nany signs of infectious disease.\n  I support these efforts to contain the Ebola epidemic and know we \nwill monitor this humanitarian crisis in the weeks ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/16/senate-section/article/S5597-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5597]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, before discussing the legislation \ninvolving the National Labor Relations Board which the Republican \nleader mentioned, I wish to align myself with his comments on the Ebola \nepidemic. In my view, he is right to support the President's effort for \na more urgent response to this epidemic.\n  I am not given to making overstatements--I think that would be a fair \nreputation in this body--but I believe we should treat the Ebola \nepidemic as seriously as we treat the danger of ISIS. Why would I say \nthat? Because the head of the Centers for Disease Control and our \nUnited Nations Ambassador, who is working with other countries to get \nthem involved, say this: This is one of the most deadly, explosive \nepidemics in modern times. It moves rapidly. There is no vaccine, and \nthere is no cure. One sick person can fairly quickly infect 20 other \npersons within a family in these West African countries where it is now \na problem. One can see how quickly this could spread and become \nhundreds of thousands of cases or even millions of cases.\n  This is a case where Samantha Power said to me: We should be running \ntoward burning flames with our fireproof suits on. In other words, we \nknow how to control it. We know how to identify sick people and isolate \nthem and treat them. Even though half of them die, we know how to do \nthat. But the rate of growth of this epidemic is so rapid that we need \nto have a response that is as urgent as the problem.\n  I congratulate the Republican leader for supporting the President's \neffort today to call attention to this. So much is happening in the \nworld, and there is a possibility that we would treat the Ebola \nepidemic as an important issue but not a major issue. As I said, I \nbelieve we must take the deadly, dangerous threat of Ebola as seriously \nas we take the threat of ISIS.\n  I support the administration's recommendation to spend $30 million in \nthe continuing resolution to upgrade the public health efforts there. I \nsupport the reprogramming of $500 million to involve the military in a \nway to deal with this. I support the effort to spend $58 million, which \nwould be to fast track efforts to develop a treatment and cure, as well \nas vaccines to prevent it.\n\n\n                              NLRB Reform\n\n  Mr. President, the Republican leader spoke about legislation he and I \nare introducing today which we call the National Labor Relations Board \nReform Act.\n  (The remarks of Senator Alexander pertaining to the introduction of \nS. 2814 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have great respect for the Senator from \nTennessee, having worked together on many issues, as politicians often \nthrow those words around. He is a good person, a good Senator. I enjoy \nworking with him. I do have to take exception to one thing, though.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/16/senate-section/article/S5597-3", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5597-S5601]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               EQUAL PAY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yesterday we had a vote on a labor issue. This was a vote \nas to whether men and women in the workplace working the same jobs get \nthe same pay. Most people would say: Well, isn't that the law already? \nYes.\n  Unfortunately, the law as written in 1963 with the Equal Pay Act \nisn't working very well. In a lot of workplaces women are paid less. In \nthe State of Illinois, it is about 75 cents for every dollar paid to a \nman for most women unless you happen to be an African man and then it \nis 65 cents, or Hispanic, it is 65 cents. The actual working \nrelationships in many businesses discriminate against women.\n  We offered a bill yesterday to the Equal Pay Act brought to the floor \nby Senator Mikulski of Maryland and Senator Boxer of California. We \nasked if we could now revisit the Equal Pay Act to make sure it is \nenforceable and that it works so that literally if my son or my \ndaughter ended up with the same job and the same workplace and the same \nwork record, they would get the same pay. Not a radical idea by any \nmeasure. That was what we brought up for a vote yesterday.\n  I took a look at the Congressional Record to refresh my memory and \ntalked with the staff. Not one Republican Senator would vote for that \nbill--not one. There were 52 votes in favor of moving forward on this \nbill. All of them were from the Democratic side.\n  So when I listen to these calls for reform when it comes to labor \nlaws and bipartisanship when it comes to labor laws, my obvious \nquestion to my friends on the other side of the aisle is: Where were \nyou yesterday? We had a chance here on the floor of the Senate to do \nsomething on a bipartisan basis for pay equity, equal pay for men and \nwomen in the workplace.\n  This is not the first time we faced this issue. Lilly Ledbetter \nbecame somewhat legendary in America. This lady, whom I had the \nprivilege to meet a few times, had a tough job. She worked at a tire \nmanufacturing facility in Alabama. She worked hard for a long time. As \nshe was nearing retirement, someone went up to her and said: Lilly, you \nhave been a manager around here a lot of years, but they are paying you \na heck of a lot less than the men who have the same job in this plant. \nShe didn't quit.\n  They don't publish the wages of all coworkers so that you would know \nthis. She was upset about it. She spent all those years working there \nand she was being discriminated against because she was a woman. She \nfiled a lawsuit, as she was entitled to under the law, saying that this \nwas discriminatory and she was entitled to back pay for this \ndiscrimination.\n  The Supreme Court, right across the street, threw out the lawsuit and \nsaid she didn't report this discrimination in a timely fashion. She \ndidn't report that she was being paid less within a certain number of \nmonths, and her response was: How would I even know that? I don't know \nwhat that man who was the manager next to me is being paid any more \nthan he knows what I am being paid.\n  That is what the Supreme Court decided.\n  The first bill that was signed into law by President Obama, the Lilly \nLedbetter Act, said that Lilly Ledbetter and people like her at a \nfuture time would be allowed to sue for back wages if they were \ndiscriminated against.\n  Very few, if any, Republicans supported this. When I hear speeches on \nthe floor about reforming labor laws and the workplace laws in America, \nlet's do it in a bipartisan fashion. When it got down to the real \nbasics, S. 2199 yesterday, not a single Republican would join us, not \none. I would think they would feel as we do. It is only fair. It is \nonly fair that if you are in the workplace doing the same job, you get \nthe same pay. Unfortunately, not one of them would. So when they call \nfor reforming the National Labor Relations Board and they call for \nbipartisanship, I think it should start right here when it comes to \nlegislation that comes before the Senate.\n  I also listened to the Republican Senate leader come to the floor \ntoday and talk about the state of our economy. I wonder sometimes if \nMembers of the Senate, who are entitled to their own opinions, should \nalso be entitled to their own facts because what the Senator from \nKentucky failed to note was\n\n[[Page S5598]]\n\nthe economy which President Obama inherited when he took office in \nJanuary 2009. It was in sad shape.\n  What a contrast from 8 years before when President Bill Clinton left \noffice in January of 2001, 14 years ago. We had gone through a period \nof 4 straight years of Federal budget surplus. A Democratic President, \n4 straight years of Federal budget surplus, and President Clinton left \nto the new President, George W. Bush, a surplus in the next year's \nbudget of $120 billion, if my memory serves me.\n\n  The last time that happened, 4 straight years of surplus, had been 40 \nyears before. So here is Democratic President Clinton leaving office to \nPresident George W. Bush with a string of surpluses in the budget that \nwe hadn't seen for four decades.\n  In addition, President Clinton was taking the surplus and investing \nit in Social Security so that it was stronger than it had been in years \nbecause of the surpluses.\n  During the period of the Clinton Presidency, 23 million new jobs were \ncreated in this country. Eight years, 23 million jobs, and government \nspending was still growing each year. Yet there were surpluses, job \ncreation, and economic growth in the 8-year period of time.\n  When President Clinton left office, the national debt that had been \naccumulated over the entire history of the United States totaled $5 \ntrillion. That was January of 2001. He handed that economy and that \nbudget to President George W. Bush.\n  Now fast forward 8 years. What did President George W. Bush hand to \nnew President Barack Obama? One of the weakest economies America had \nseen since the Great Depression. The month President Obama took the \noath of office in January of 2009, when he put his hand on the same \nBible Abraham Lincoln used when he was sworn in as President, that \nmonth we lost nearly 800,000 jobs in America. That previous year, \nprivate employers had shed more than 4 million jobs. We know what \nhappened to savings and retirement accounts. They were devastated by \nthat recession. The economy was shrinking.\n  In just 8 years, President George W. Bush took one of the strongest, \nfastest growing economies in American history and, sadly, turned it \ninto an economic recession. How did he do it? Tax breaks for wealthy \npeople and wars that were not paid for. Those were the two things that \ndrove us from a $5 trillion debt when President Clinton left office--\ncumulative debt in the history of America.\n  When President George W. Bush left office, handing it over to \nPresident Obama, the national debt had broken $5 trillion to $12 \ntrillion. It more than doubled in the 8-year period of time. So \nPresident Obama had a challenge. Get the economy back on its feet.\n  Right now, Public Television has a series on the Roosevelts. I have \nenjoyed it because Ken Burns is one of the best. He is telling the \nstory of Teddy Roosevelt, Franklin Roosevelt, Eleanor Roosevelt.\n  We remember what happened when Franklin Roosevelt came to office at \nthe end of 1932 and the beginning of 1933, facing the Great Depression \nin America. He said: We have to get America back to work. That is what \nPresident Obama says. The stimulus package. Let's get back to work \nhere. Let's put people earning paychecks into a position where they can \nsave their homes and keep their families together and rebuild the \neconomy. He got almost no help from the other side of the aisle.\n  Remember the automobile industry. Remember what was happening in the \nautomobile industry when President Obama took over office from \nPresident Bush. It was flat on its back. Two major companies, Chrysler \nand General Motors, were facing bankruptcy and even the prospect of \ngoing out of business.\n  President Obama said: We cannot let this happen. There are too many \ngood-paying jobs across America. He stepped in and helped by loaning \nmoney to these automobile companies to get back on their feet.\n  Just last week I had some auto dealers from the Chicagoland area come \nto see me in my office. One said, Do you know what happened? We were \nselling about 9 million cars when the recession hit. Now we are back on \nour feet. We are up to 16 million a year. The automobile industry is \ncoming back strong.\n  I look at Illinois and I can see it in Belvidere where the Fiat \nChrysler plant is working three shifts. I see it at the Ford plant on \nthe South Side of Chicago. They are working three shifts as well.\n  President Obama said: Let's get back to work. Let's save the auto \nindustry. He did. Now they come to the floor and say: You know, it just \nhasn't been fast enough.\n  When it came to the stimulus package, we had little or no support \nfrom the other side of the aisle. When it came to rebuilding my State \nof Illinois and across the country, it was resistance.\n  Then comes the issue of health insurance. I want to say a word about \nthat. I have voted for the Affordable Care Act. It may be one of the \nmost important votes ever cast.\n  I did it for personal reasons because I personally experienced with \nmy family a moment when we had no health insurance.\n  My wife and I got married very young. I was still in law school. God \nsent us a baby. She had some medical issues. We had no health \ninsurance. I was going to school here at Georgetown Law School. I would \nleave class, pick up my wife and baby and go to the charity ward at \nChildren's Hospital in Washington, DC.\n  We were sitting in there with a number in my hand waiting to see who \nwould walk through that door to be the doctor to save my baby's life. I \nhad no health insurance. I have never felt more helpless as a husband \nand father than at that moment.\n  I believe today, as I did then, that should never happen to any \nfamily. I believe this great Nation should provide basic health care \nfor everyone living in this great Nation. That is why I voted for the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  What has happened since? Eight million Americans are now insured \nunder the Affordable Care Act. We have seen an 8-percent decline in \nuninsured people in my home State and many States.\n  One of the most successful States when it comes to the Affordable \nCare Act happens to be the Commonwealth of Kentucky which the \nRepublican Senate leader represents.\n  They have signed up in substantial numbers. Hundreds of thousands of \npeople in his State now have health insurance because the Affordable \nCare Act, which some characterize in a friendly or derogatory way as \nObamaCare, has worked.\n  What has it meant in Illinois? Some 640,000 people in Illinois now \nhave insurance because of the Affordable Care Act. In a State of about \n13 million people, that is a substantial number, and 400,000 of them \nwere low-wage workers who had no benefits in their job and now qualify \nfor Medicaid. They have health insurance.\n  I met one of them, Rich Romanowski. What a perfect Chicago name, \nright? Rich, a big barrel-chested Polish guy, is a musician. He has \ndone part-time work all his life and he never had health insurance. Now \nhe is in his sixties. Rich came to one of our press conferences, \nsmacked his wallet, and said: I have a card in my wallet that says I \nhave health insurance for the first time in my life.\n  He is not the only one. He is one of 400,000 in my State, which means \nwhen they get sick and go to the hospital, their bills are not passed \non to the rest of us, to all the people with insurance, to those who \nuse Medicare. They have their own insurance now, and it means they are \ngoing to be healthier.\n  I think of Judy. Judy works in Southern Illinois. She works in one of \nthe motels that I stay in there, and she is a hospitality lady. When \npeople go for breakfast, she is the one greeting us and showing us \nwhere to sit down. Judy is about 62 years old, a hard-working Southern \nIllinois lady and one of the sweetest people we would ever want to \nmeet. Judy got health insurance for the first time because of the \nAffordable Care Act, and it is a good thing she did because she has \njust been diagnosed with diabetes. She needs good care because \ndiabetes, if not treated right, can lead to serious complications: \nblindness, amputations. Judy has that health insurance.\n  Remember when the government shut down last year, Senator Cruz of \nTexas came and read Dr. Seuss books to us. I came to the floor and said \nto him: You tell us you are shutting down\n\n[[Page S5599]]\n\nthe government to protest the Affordable Care Act. Well, what do you \nsay about Judy? Judy, who has worked in Southern Illinois all her life, \nhas no health insurance, needs it, and is now going to get it under \nMedicaid. Are you going to tell me we are going to do away with this \nlaw now and take away her health insurance? What would you say to her?\n  Senator Cruz said on the record on the Senate floor: Judy needs to \nget a better job.\n  I think many times folks in the Senate need to get the heck out of \nthe Capitol, get out, meet the rest of America, and come to understand \nthey are working hard every day, they are not getting paid a whole lot \nof money, and basic health insurance is beyond their reach, beyond \ntheir grasp. Well, the Affordable Care Act changed that, and we are not \ngoing back.\n  The House has voted over 50 times to repeal that law, and I say that \nas long as Barack Obama is President, that is not going to work. He is \nnot going to let them do it. I am going to stand with him because I \nhappen to be one of those persons who had a member of my family with a \npreexisting condition--the situation with my daughter.\n  I know the kind of discrimination that people with preexisting \nconditions used to face before the Affordable Care Act. We are not \ngoing back to those days. This Senator and this President for sure, we \nare going to fight all the way to make sure that health insurance is \nthere for those who are struggling in their work and there for families \nthat would otherwise not have a chance.\n\n\n            Bank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act\n\n                           Student Loan Debt\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I spent much of my time over the August recess visiting \ncollege campuses and talking to current students and graduates about \ntheir student debt.\n  I visited Northern Illinois University in De Kalb, Judson University \nin Elgin, and Lincoln Land Community College in Springfield, and \nUniversity of Illinois at Chicago.\n  With an estimated 1.7 million Illinoisans holding a combined $47 \nbillion in student loan debt, it is no wonder that it was on the minds \nof nearly everyone I spoke with. On average, Illinois graduates of the \nClass of 2012 left with $28,028 in debt--but individual debt is often \nmuch higher. I have had students contact me who have upwards of \n$100,000 in debt and no chance to ever pay it off.\n  For too many young Illinoisans, and students across the country, the \nopportunity for a fair shot at an affordable college education has \nbecome a long shot. They do the right thing--they go to school to get \nahead but end up with so much debt that it becomes impossible for them \nto ever pay it back let alone get ahead.\n  I recently met Jessica Ibares at NIU.\n  Jessica graduated from Northern Illinois and is now working as a \nfinancial aid counselor.\n  How about that? She helps others figure out how to pay for their \neducation, but struggles paying for her own.\n  She holds almost $40,000 in Federal student loan debt that she'll \nhave to start repaying in November. Working at a public institution, \nshe makes a modest salary and will only be able to pay about $50 a \nmonth on her loan--which may not even cover the interest.\n  How will she ever start repaying the principal? Jessica will find it \ndifficult to get out of the debt she's in--and she went to a good, \npublic school.\n\n\n                             Dawn Thompson\n\n  Imagine what students who went to predatory for-profit schools face.\n  I recently met Dawn Thompson in Springfield. She is a 48 year old \nsingle mother of two.\n  Dawn thought she was doing the right thing getting a paralegal degree \nfrom Everest College online. That is right, Everest College--one of the \nsubsidiaries of the failed Corinthian Colleges chain.\n  This disgraced company was caught falsifying job placement rates and \ncollapsed under the ensuing scrutiny. In the meantime, they left \nthousands of students in financial ruin with no real education to show \nfor it, all the while making money hand over fist off of taxpayers.\n  Dawn could never find a job in her field with her degree from \nEverest. She was over $100,000 in student loan debt, both Federal and \nprivate loans, and working a minimum wage job as a bank teller. Dawn \ntried to file for bankruptcy in 2013 and, you guessed it, her student \nloans were not dischargeable--one of the only debts that is not.\n  At that point, she felt like her only option was to go back to school \nto hopefully improve her chances of getting a good-paying job and to \ndefer her loans. Unfortunately, she went back to Everest--she started \nher Master's in business administration at Everest. Regardless of what \nhappens with Everest as they end their reign of fraud, Dawn is likely \nto be stuck with her $100,000 plus student loan bill.\n  Perhaps the only thing more sickening than Dawn's story, is that it's \nnot unique. While the schools I visited were different, the borrower's \npersonal backgrounds varied, and the amount they owed unique--the \nrefrain over and over from these Illinois students was the same: \n``Senator, Washington has to help us.''\n  My guess is that my colleagues heard the same thing from some of the \n40 million Americans in their States drowning in more than $1.2 \ntrillion in collective student loan debt.\n  Well, Democrats have an answer that will help many of these \nstudents--it's called the Bank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing \nAct. It would help an estimated 25 million current borrowers who are \nstruggling to repay their Federal or private student loans refinance \ninto lower federal interest rates--saving the average borrower $2,000 \nover the life of the loan.\n  In Illinois, an estimated 1.1 million of the 1.7 million with student \ndebt could lower their interest rates under our bill--nearly two-thirds \nof all borrowers in my home State.\n  Here is how it would work. Those with Federal loans could refinance \ninto lower rates--the same rates available to students who took out \nloans last school year.\n  Those with private loans--many of which have sky-high interest rates \nand very few protections for borrowers--could refinance into Federal \nloans with lower rates and stronger consumer protections.\n  What's more, our bill is fully paid for.\n  It assesses a modest tax on millionaires to help borrowers refinance \nand get back on a path of financial security--this is often referred to \nas the Buffet Rule.\n  I am hopeful we will have a chance to vote again on this bill to help \nstudent borrowers.\n  Earlier this summer, this bill was killed by 38 Republicans who voted \nagainst even moving to debate it. These Republicans were given a \nchoice--side with working families and students seeking the American \nDream or protect millionaires from paying a single penny more in taxes; \nside with 25 million Americans who could be helped by the bill or \n22,000 or so millionaire households who might have to pay more in taxes \nunder the bill.\n  Sadly, I don't have to tell you who those 38 Republican Senators \npicked.\n  Americans across the country are talking about this issue--I have \nheard them. But, even so, in June, 38 Republicans said: ``The Senate \ncan't talk about it.''\n  It doesn't seem right to me.\n  Thankfully, though, there were three Republicans--Senators Collins, \nCorker, Murkowski--who joined every Democrat to support moving the bill \nforward.\n  But if the 38 Republicans who voted ``no'' have another chance, I \nhope they remember the struggling students and families they talked to \nback home over the August recess.\n\n\n                            Economic Impacts\n\n  I hope they realize that if we don't give struggling borrowers \nanother option besides default, this student debt will haunt them for \nthe rest of their lives and will have a drag on our economy. It already \nis. Experts tell us it is stagnating growth in the housing market, \npreventing business creation, and jeopardizing future retirement \nsecurity for a generation of young Americans.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n  I hope America's youth are paying close attention to this issue: how \ntheir Senators voted on this measure offers them the bare truth. I hope \nmore of my Republican colleagues will join us to move forward this \nimportant piece of legislation if we get a chance to vote on it again.\n\n[[Page S5600]]\n\n  But for now, it shows the stark difference between those Senators who \nbelieve hard-working students deserve a fair shot at the American Dream \nand those who will stand by and do nothing as America's next generation \nis sentenced to debt.\n  This afternoon my colleague Senator Warren is coming to the floor. \nElizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is a new Senator--and what a terrific \naddition to the Senate. She is the best. I have known her for years, \nand I encouraged her to run because I knew she would bring something \nspecial to the Senate.\n  She has done it. She came up with a way for college students and \ntheir families to renegotiate student loans. People can renegotiate \ntheir auto loans; they can renegotiate the mortgages on their homes. \nWhy shouldn't students, those who have graduated, and their families \nwho face student loan debt be able to renegotiate to a lower interest \nrate? That is the Warren bill.\n  She is right. It is a big difference. It would bring down the \ninterest rate on undergraduate loans, I think, to 3.8 percent. I run \ninto students who are trying to pay off loans at 9 percent. Ask anybody \nwho owns a home the difference between a 9-percent mortgage and a 3.8-\npercent mortgage. They will tell you it is big. When someone makes a \npayment under a 3.8-percent interest rate, a lot more goes to reduce \nprincipal and you finally put that loan to rest after so many years. So \nSenator Warren is going to try again. We tried it once before but \ncouldn't get the Republican support. I think we had three--maybe \nthree--who voted with us on the Republican side. Under Senate rules we \nneed 60.\n  In my State of about 13 million, there are about 1.7 million people \ncarrying student loan debt. They aren't all young people. They include \nparents who signed up for PLUS loans and even grandparents who wanted \nto help a grandson or a granddaughter get into college and go forward. \nThey are carrying this debt. If Elizabeth Warren's bill passes to \nrenegotiate college loans, it is going to save them--on average--$2,000 \napiece and give them a chance to reduce and retire that loan at an \nearlier stage.\n  There is an interesting phenomena going on in Chicago now. I talked \nto some younger friends of mine and they said: If you have an apartment \nfor rent in Chicago, and it is a good one, get there fast and sign up \nquickly.\n  There is a land rush on to rent apartments. Why? Because younger \npeople cannot even consider buying a condo or a little house. Why? Too \nmuch student debt. Student debt in America, cumulatively, is greater \nthan credit card debt in America, cumulatively.\n  More of these students graduating with the debt, paying it off, are \nmaking life decisions because of the debt. I have run into it: They \nstudied to be a teacher but ended up with so much debt that they \ncouldn't even consider it and had to take a better-paying job. We lost \na good teacher because of student debt.\n  Students are putting off getting married, putting off going out on \ntheir own, buying a car, and, if married, starting a family. I have \nheard it all. That is what this student debt is all about.\n  When my colleagues come to the floor and say why don't we do \nsomething on a bipartisan basis, I say: This student debt isn't just a \ndebt for Democratic students; it is a debt for all students.\n  So let's come together when Elizabeth Warren makes her unanimous \nconsent request this afternoon and finally do something for a change, \nfor middle income and working families who want their kids to go to \nschool but don't want them so deep in debt that their lives are changed \nor ruined. That is only reasonable.\n  If we want to make sure that America continues to be a leader in the \nworld, we need to graduate the very best with the education and \ntraining they need to lead our Nation. Some of them are holding back, \nholding back because of a fear of college debt.\n  One other thing I will mention, college loans are different than \nother loans. I studied many years ago back in law school bankruptcy \nlaw, and we learn in bankruptcy law that most of the loans you take out \nin life are dischargeable in bankruptcy, which means if everything \nfails--you lose your job, you are in a situation where there is a \nserious pile of medical bills and you can't get back to work--in most \ncases you can go to bankruptcy court and through a long process those \ndebts will be wiped out and give you a second chance in life. It is not \nan easy process. It is not something people rush to, but many people \nhave no choice.\n  If you did that with a college loan, it wouldn't help you a bit. \nCollege loans are not dischargeable in bankruptcy. They are with you \nfor a lifetime. That is a sad reality. This is all the more reason to \nmake sure those loans are affordable, all the more reason to support \nElizabeth Warren when she talks about reducing these interest rates.\n\n\n                            First Amendment\n\n  The Senator from Kentucky, Mr. McConnell, today talked about the vote \nwe had on a constitutional amendment. It was an amendment which didn't \nget the necessary votes; it needed 67. It didn't get the necessary \nvotes on the Senate floor.\n  Its sole purpose, offered by Senator Udall from New Mexico, was to \nreverse the Citizens United decision. That decision by the Supreme \nCourt basically took off the caps and limits when it came to \nindividuals and corporations putting as much money as they wanted to \ninto the political process. One of my colleagues, Senator Kay Hagan of \nNorth Carolina, by her latest estimate has had more than $20 million of \nnegative ads run against her in her home State--not by her opponent, \nnot even by the North Carolina Republican Party but by these outside \ninterests such as the Koch brothers.\n  The Koch brothers in the last election cycle spent over $250 million \nof their own money. They are a bigger deal than most political parties \nnow--these two brothers who are billionaires--and they are putting more \nmoney into this system. Sadly, many of the beneficiaries of the Koch \nbrothers are walking behind them on a leash. They are being led around \nby them because you don't want to cross the Koch brothers.\n  The amendment of Senator Udall of New Mexico would have finally given \nthe States the authority to regulate the amount of money that could be \nspent on campaigns.\n  It comes to this: If we want mere mortals to run for public office--\nas opposed to multimillionaires--we have to get this playing field back \nunder the control of the normal people. Maybe we won't have as many \ntelevision ads to see--and I know how much people enjoy those--but at \nthe end of the day we could still get our message across.\n  I supported and actually introduced public financing laws. I still \nstand by them. We would be a better country if we had public financing, \ntook the special interests out of the campaigns, shortened the \ncampaigns, and had actual debates. Those sorts of things would get us \nback to what the country is all about and maybe start to restore some \nconfidence in Congress, in our political system, and in both political \nparties--and we are all pretty low at this moment.\n  So public financing is a right step but not likely to happen soon. Of \nthis approach by Senator Udall to basically reverse the Citizens United \ndecision, the other side argues it inhibits freedom of speech. Well, \nthere is only so much speech that individuals can claim. The Koch \nbrothers, because of their multimillions--and there are folks on the \nleft, incidentally, spending a lot of money too--left and right--don't \ndeserve to pick up a microphone or have a bigger voice in our political \nprocess.\n  We have a lot of work to do. This week we are going to get down to \nbusiness on a few things that are essential. I am sorry that yesterday \nthe Republicans wouldn't help us when we wanted to pass pay equity and \nmake sure that women were treated fairly in the workplace. We needed \nthem, and they weren't there.\n  That is disappointing, but it is an indication of where the two \nparties are today on that issue. They didn't support our efforts to \nincrease the minimum wage. I support increasing the minimum wage.\n  They haven't been able to help us when we come up with legislation to \ndeal with college loans, but this afternoon they will have a second \nchance. I hope Elizabeth Warren's bill moves forward and that we end \nthis week on a\n\n[[Page S5601]]\n\npositive note for working families and their kids who want to go to \nschool but don't want to be burdened with the debt that is going to \nchange their lives.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schatz). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/16/senate-section/article/S5601-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5601-S5602]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           FACING CHALLENGES\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, as we continue with what will likely be the \nfinal legislative week before the elections, it is a good time to take \na look back at the year and take stock of where we are and what \nCongress has accomplished.\n  The House of Representatives, of course, has spent the past year \nlegislating. Members of the House have sent literally hundreds of bills \nover to the Senate for consideration, including 40 jobs bills, many of \nwhich passed with bipartisan support in the House of Representatives.\n  Even now, in the final week before recessing for election season, the \nHouse is taking up two legislative packages, one focused on creating \njobs and another focused on lowering the price of gas and groceries. \nUnfortunately, like so many other House bills, neither of these bills \nis likely to go anywhere in the Democratic leader's Senate because \nunlike the House, the Senate has not spent the past year taking up \nlegislation to solve the many challenges facing American families. \nInstead, Senate Democrats have spent the past year taking up political \ngimmicks and designed-to-fail messaging bills they hope will win a few \nvotes for them in November.\n  Back in March--earlier this year--the New York Times reported that \nDemocrats planned to spend the spring and summer on messaging votes \n``timed to coincide with campaign-style trips by President Obama.''\n  The Times went on to say: ``Democrats concede that making new laws is \nnot really the point. Rather, they are trying to force Republicans to \nvote against them.'' That is from the New York Times earlier this year, \nwhich was laying out and predicting what the Democrats' strategy was \ngoing to be for the balance of this year.\n  Unfortunately, Senate Democrats have followed that playbook pretty \nexactly. Again and again, Senate Democrats have bypassed serious \nlegislation and chosen to bring up bills designed to win them votes \nwith their far-left base or to smear Republicans in the November \nelections.\n  Take last week was an example. After an August recess beset by \neconomic stagnation at home and crises abroad, including, I might add, \nthe murder of two American journalists at the hands of ruthless \nterrorist group ISIS, you might think Senate Democrats would want to \nspend our first week back focused on the challenges our Nation is \nfacing.\n  Well, Mr. President, you would be wrong. Instead of legislation to \naddress some of these challenges, Democrats chose to kick off this \nbrief 2-week session with a bill to erase many of the speech \nprotections of the First Amendment. That is right. Faced with crises \nabroad and a sluggish economy here at home, Democrats thought the most \nappropriate use of our time last week was legislation to erase parts of \nthe First Amendment.\n  As with so many of the other bills they have brought up this year, \nDemocrats knew this legislation did not have a chance of passing in the \nSenate. But they chose to bring it up anyway because they thought it \nmight help get portions of their base out in November. And they swiftly \nfollowed it up with another designed-to-fail piece of legislation they \nhoped to use to criticize Republicans. In fact, the newspaper Roll Call \nreported earlier this week--this is from a story written about the \nDemocrats' strategy: ``Republicans should prepare to be criticized \nregardless of how they vote'' on this particular bill. The article went \non to quote an email that was sent to Democratic communicators which \noutlined plans, and again I quote, ``to slam Republicans for either \nblocking the bill once again or for letting us on the bill only to slow \ndown the rest of the Senate.''\n  So basically the message to Democratic communicators around here on \nCapitol Hill was to slam Republicans no matter how they voted. If they \nvoted to get on the bill, slam them for slowing down the Senate so we \ncannot do other things. If they voted against getting on the bill, \nobviously, attack them for blocking the bill.\n  So here is the strategy, at this late hour of the game when we have \nso many big issues and challenges facing the country: It is simply to \nput bills on the floor that are designed to help Democrats in the fall \nelections and essentially to make Republicans look bad. That is a \nquote. That is a direct quote from an email that was sent out to \nDemocratic communicators: ``slam Republicans'' no matter how they vote. \nEither way, take advantage of the situation. Try and play politics with \nit.\n  There is certainly a place for campaigning. There is certainly a \nplace for politics. But the place for campaigning is not in the halls \nof Congress. Our job here in Washington is to pass legislation to \naddress the challenges facing our country. And that job does not change \nif one party controls the House and the other party controls the \nSenate. The Senate and the House still have a responsibility to work \ntogether to get serious legislation to the President, and that is \ncertainly what the House has tried to do.\n  The House has sent bill after bill to the Senate, many of them, as I \nmentioned earlier, bipartisan bills. They got strong bipartisan votes \ncoming out of the House of Representatives. But again and again, Senate \nDemocrat leaders have said no--no to working together, no to bipartisan \nHouse legislation, no to developing bipartisan solutions.\n\n  Senate Republicans' efforts have met a similar response. Again and \nagain Republicans here in the Senate have put forward legislation to \nhelp create jobs, grow the economy, and to provide help to working \nfamilies struggling with the high price of everything--from groceries \nto health care. Several of our bills have even received support from \nrank-and-file Democrats--bills such as Senator Collins' Forty Hours Is \nFull Time Act, which would fix an ObamaCare provision that is reducing \nworkers' hours and wages, or Senator Blunt's Hire More Heroes Act, \nwhich would give employers an incentive to hire our Nation's veterans.\n  But the Senate Democratic leadership has refused to consider our \nproposals.\n  Senate Republicans have even been prevented from offering amendments \nto bills that come before the Senate. Since July of 2013, Senate \nRepublicans have been allowed just 14 amendment votes--less than one a \nmonth in the world's greatest deliberative body known for unlimited \ndebate and unlimited amendment. Less than one amendment per month, that \nis what Senate Republicans have been allowed in the last year. Compare \nthat to the House of Representatives where the Democrat minority has \nbeen allowed 194 amendment votes over the same period.\n  When the minority party is denied a voice in the Senate, it is the \nAmerican people--the people whom we represent--who are really being \ndenied a voice.\n\n       Democrats may not control the House, but through the \n     amendment process, they have been able to make their \n     constituents' voices heard. Republicans in the Senate, on the \n     other hand, have been prevented from bringing their \n     constituents' voices to the legislative process.\n\n  American families are struggling. The economy continues to stagnate. \nUnemployment is still above 6 percent--way higher than that if you \nfigure in the labor participation rate the number of people who have \nactually given up even looking for work.\n  Last month's job creation was the worst this year, and opportunities \nfor advancement in this economy are few and far between. Health care \ncosts, which were already high when the President took office, have \ncontinued to increase. Average health care deductibles have increased \n50 percent, and health care premiums have risen by an average of $3,459 \nsince the President took office, despite--despite--the President's \npromise that his health care law would drive down premiums by $2,500. \nGas prices have increased by\n\n[[Page S5602]]\n\n87 percent over the course of the Obama administration.\n  A Politico poll released this week found that ``strong majorities now \nsay that they lack the savings to grapple with an unforeseen job \nloss''--61 percent of the people in the poll said that--``and that the \ncost of basic household items like gas and groceries has strained their \nfinances. . . .''--62 percent of the people polled had that response.\n  It is not surprising that a recent George Washington University/\nBattleground poll found that 70 percent of Americans think the country \nis ``on the wrong track.''\n  With these challenges facing the American people, our focus in the \nSenate this year should have been legislation to address our struggling \neconomy and to repair the damage ObamaCare is doing to families and \nbusinesses. Instead, Senate Democrats have chosen to focus the Senate's \nefforts on politics. The Democrat-led Senate has failed in its most \nbasic responsibility this year; and that is to pass solutions for the \nAmerican people.\n  With just a few days left in the session, it is a little late for \nDemocrats to do anything about that now.\n  I hope that when we return in November things will be different. I \nhope Democrats will spend less time trying to save their jobs and more \ntime trying to create jobs for the American people. I hope they will \nspend less time campaigning and more time legislating. I hope they will \nbe ready to work with Republicans to deliver solutions for the American \npeople.\n  That is what we are here to do. That is what we ought to be focused \non. All this using the floor of the Senate to conduct campaigns doesn't \nserve any constructive purpose when it comes to solving problems and \nmeeting the challenges being faced by the American people every single \nday--chronic high employment, a sluggish economy, reduced take-home \npay, higher costs for health care, groceries, fuel, college education, \nwe go right down the list. These are the real and present impacts of \nthis economy on the American people and middle-class families.\n  Congress can do better. The American people deserve better. I hope \nwhen the dust settles and the smoke clears from the November elections, \nwe will come back with a renewed sense of purpose and focus on what is \ntruly important to the people we represent.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/16/senate-section/article/S5602-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5602-S5603]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           SPENDING AND DEBT\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, as we consider this continuing resolution to \nfund the Federal Government in fiscal year 2015, which begins October \n1, I rise to voice concern about our Nation's spending and debt. At \nlast count our country was more than $17 trillion in debt, and that \nnumber increases every single day.\n  My parents told me you shouldn't just complain, you should have \nsolutions, and I am going to talk about two solutions.\n  One is the Penny Plan, which would cut 1 cent out of every dollar we \ncurrently spend and, according to the Congressional Budget Office, \nbalance the budget in just 3 years. If we continued it for another 7 \nyears, we would reduce spending by $7.6 trillion.\n  Another solution would be to do biennial budgeting. We obviously \ndon't have time to look through the budget--we keep doing continuing \nresolutions and then we do an omnibus bill. We are supposed to do those \nthrough 12 separate bills--12 separate bills that get debated not just \nin committee but on the floor of the Senate with amendments. It has \nbeen a long time since we have done that. So biennial budgeting would \nallow us to get into this nerve center of spending and get something \ndone.\n  For fiscal year 2014, we expect to pay $231 billion in interest on \nthe national debt according to the Congressional Budget Office. With \nour pattern of unsustainable spending, in 10 years we could pay close \nto $800 billion in interest. That is not counting the interest rate \ngoing up. Now, $231 billion this year at 1 percent is about what we are \npaying, but imagine if that went to 5 percent. That would put us over \n$1 trillion. That is what we are talking about spending in this \ncontinuing resolution, and if we are doing it all on interest, that \neliminates defense and all the other things we put our money into. That \nis more to our creditors than we currently spend on national defense.\n  Our future interest payments would be even higher if interest goes up \nmore than CBO has predicted. The interest we pay on our debt doesn't \nbuy anything. A large portion of that just pays other countries for \nloaning us money.\n  The Federal Government consistently spends billions more than it \ntakes in, and the CBO reported in August that if current laws remain \nunchanged, growing budget deficits over the long term will push the \ndebt even higher. Yet today we are considering legislation to continue \ndiscretionary funding on autopilot.\n  The continuing resolution funds Federal programs through December 11, \n2014, at the current annual rate of $1.012 trillion. We will not have \nany debate. We will have an up-or-down vote and spend another $1 \ntrillion. The legislation does nothing to address the CBO projection \nthat our ratio of public debt to gross domestic product--that is \neverything our economy earns in the United States--will reach 74 \npercent by the end of this fiscal year, twice that of just 7 years ago \nand higher than any year since 1950.\n  We are doing nothing to reverse CBO's projection that in 25 years \nFederal debt held by our constituents will exceed 100 percent of gross \ndomestic product--again, everything we produce in the United States in \n1 year. The CBO notes that this trend, which I view as perilous, cannot \nbe sustained indefinitely.\n  I ask my Senate colleagues what would happen if we as individuals \nadopted the same spending habits held by the government. I can tell \nthem with little doubt that over the long term we would each face \nbankruptcy, and that is the point. Sometimes it seems we have our heads \nburied in the sand. Are we in denial? Sometimes we act as if there are \ndifferent sets of principles for the Federal budget and the outcome of \nexcessive personal spending. But I am here to tell you, the same \npotentially dire consequences face the government that face individuals \nif we do not put our fiscal house in order.\n  Our President often frames issues in the context of how it would \naffect his daughters. Similar to the President, at times I am up at \nnight with concerns about how our country's fiscal path will affect the \nlives of my children and grandchildren. I worry about how our debt will \nharm families and generations to come.\n  Sometimes as lawmakers we seem to act as if this problem is too big \nto solve, but it is not. Understanding how to reach and maintain \nfinancial health is not rocket science. It merely requires exercising \ncommon sense and commitment.\n  As individuals we learn to live within our means. If we spend too \nmuch, we tighten our belts and we work hard to ease our financial \nsituation. The government should and could do the same. We can't wait \nlonger. It is time for us to act.\n  I have introduced the Penny Plan as a simple and straightforward way \nto put our country back on the right fiscal path. It reduces \ndiscretionary and mandatory spending, less net interest payments, by 1 \npercent--or 1 penny for every dollar--for each year of 3 years until \ntotal spending has reached approximately 18 percent of gross domestic \nproduct. Based on figures from the CBO, reducing spending this way will \nresult in a balanced budget within 3 years. Total spending would then \nbe capped at 18 percent for subsequent years since that is the historic \naverage level of government spending for the past several decades.\n  Importantly, the Penny Plan steers us away from some of the \ncontroversial and political traps we have seen for spending reductions. \nAt the onset, it does not identify the specific cuts that are necessary \nto achieve this 1-percent reduction in savings. Instead, such decisions \nare left for us to make. Its beauty is it puts a broad plan into action \nand gives flexibility.\n  I have had a lot of grassroots interest in this. I have had a number \nof organizations that have done resolutions. I have a lot of \nindividuals who have signed up on my Web site as cosponsors of the \naction that is needed to be taken. I encourage people to go to my Web \nsite and become a part of this movement to show there is interest in \nbalancing the budget and in paying down the debt.\n\n[[Page S5603]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of one of the resolutions be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nResolution in Support of the One Percent Spending Reduction Act of 2014\n\n       Whereas, the U.S. National debt currently exceeds $17.5 \n     trillion and continues to grow;\n       Whereas, the estimated population of the United States is \n     318,360,075, so each citizen's share of this debt is \n     $55,037.88.\n       Whereas, the National Debt has continued to increase an \n     average of $2.38 billion per day since September 30, 2012.\n       Whereas, the ``One Percent Spending Reduction Act of 2014'' \n     reduces discretionary and mandatory spending (less interest \n     payments) by 1 percent each year for 3 years until total \n     spending has reached approximately 18 percent of gross \n     domestic product (GDP).\n       Whereas, the Congressional Budget Office reports that \n     reduced spending in this fashion would result in a balanced \n     budget in FY2017.\n       Whereas, total spending would then be capped at 18 percent \n     of GDP for FY2018 and subsequent fiscal years.\n       Whereas, over a 10-year budget window, the bill would cut \n     spending by about $7.6 trillion from currently projected \n     levels.\n       Whereas, the bill amends the Congressional Budget Act of \n     1974 to make it out of order in both chambers to consider any \n     bill, joint resolution, amendment, or conference report that \n     includes any provision that would cause the most recently \n     reported, current spending limit to be exceeded.\n       Whereas, the ``One Percent Spending Reduction Act of 2014'' \n     is also referred to as the Penny Plan.\n       Whereas, upon passage by Congress and signature from the \n     President of the United States, the Penny Plan would be \n     effective in FY2015 and each fiscal year thereafter.\n       Whereas, the Penny Plan would quickly halt the nation's \n     debt spiral and set our country on a fiscally responsible \n     path.\n       Therefore, the Board of Directors of the Petroleum \n     Association of Wyoming supports the One Percent Spending \n     Reduction Act of 2014, on this 20th day, August 2014.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Another step we can take to stop the autopilot spending \npath we are on, passing the CRs year after year, is to enact my \nBiennial Appropriations Act. The legislation we are considering \nillustrates once again why we need to pass my bill.\n  In less than 1 month the new Federal fiscal year begins. Yet once \nagain we have not passed a single one of the 12 appropriations bills \nfor the 2015 fiscal year which starts October 1. Our answer? Another \nshort-term continuing resolution. What will come after that? One big \nomnibus bill put together by a couple people in the backroom and we \nwill get to vote yes or no on it.\n  That is not responsible spending. We have to be able to look at the \nitems in the bill. A short-term continuing resolution is not the way \nthe government should operate, nor does it meet the expectations of \nthose who sent us to Washington to represent them. It is no wonder our \napproval rating is sinking perpetually lower.\n  Congress should debate each individual spending bill. It should vote \non amendments and it should pass all 12 separate spending bills.\n  However, the last time we passed all the appropriations bills \nseparately before the start of the fiscal year was 20 years ago, in \n1994. That is a pretty poor record, especially since that is the main \nresponsibility we are charged with overseeing spending for the United \nStates. We ought to be starting on the spending bills April 15, right \nafter the budget is required to be finished--which also doesn't get \nfinished by then--and considering each of those until we have \nresolution on each of them. We could easily have that done before \nOctober 1.\n  When we don't follow that regular order, we can't adequately consider \nthe detail including a line-by-line look at individual programs and an \nanalysis of appropriate funding levels and duplication in government. \nInevitably, we get the types of agreements reached in January in which \nCongress is given one chance to vote on $1.1 trillion, up or down, with \nno amendments.\n  It is time for this chronic and debilitating pattern to stop. We have \nto start legislating and stop deal-making. My biennial appropriations \nbill would allow for each of the appropriations bills to be taken up \nover a 2-year period. That gives us a little more time to do it. It \nwould also give the agencies 2 years' worth of time to use that money \nthe most efficient way possible, instead of having to worry each year \nand then not receive the money until late.\n  The six most controversial bills--the six that are the toughest--we \ntake up right after an election. The six that are the easiest we take \nup just before the election. That way we can get through both of them \nin some detail and not have to worry about the election. The Defense \nappropriations bill, however, would be taken up each year. Another one \nof our main charges is to ensure the defense of our country, and this \nwould allow us to scrutinize the spending details and eliminate \nduplication and waste there as well.\n  Biennial budgeting is an idea both parties have endorsed.\n  In 2000, former OMB Director, now-Treasury Secretary, Jack Lew told \nthe House Rules Committee that the budget process took so much time \nthat there wasn't as much time to devote to making programs better. He \nsaid: ``I think biennial budgeting, if it is properly designed, could \nvery much help alleviate these pressures.''\n  I think anybody who observes our appropriations process would agree \nwe need to do something different. If we keep on doing what we have \nalways been doing, we are going to keep on getting what we have, which \nis an omnibus bill of $1.1 trillion with little scrutiny. We can't keep \ndoing that. Let's move our budget and appropriations process into the \n21st century, providing the prudent oversight and judgment of our \nbudget and appropriations while at the same time guaranteeing a more \nsecure future for the generations to come.\n  We need to pass the Penny Plan and biennial budgeting, get our \nspending under control, and change our legislative process to where we \nactually make decisions on how government tax dollars are being spent.\n  As I have said before, one of the reasons government expands is we \nhave this rule of RIFing people, which is, if someone is the last \nperson hired, they are the first person fired.\n  Consequently, as soon as someone gets a government job, it is very \nimportant for them to expand their workload, because if they can expand \ntheir workload, they can show they need an assistant. Once they have an \nassistant on board, they are not the first one fired. I attribute a lot \nof the reports produced as a means to expand work so somebody has \nsomething to do so they can get an assistant. We can't keep doing that. \nThat leads to duplication.\n  I hope we will pay attention to the Penny Plan and the biennial \nbudgeting process. I will be giving more details on that as we go \nalong.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, last week the House of Representatives \nvoted for the 53rd time to repeal or undermine all of--or aspects of--\nthe Affordable Care Act. This is beginning to sound like a broken \nrecord. I was in the House of Representatives for a period of time, so \nI had the privilege to vote on 30 or 40 of those different pieces of \nlegislation.\n  Republicans, of course, shut down the government a year ago because \nof their pique over the health care law. There are those who still have \na desire to shut down the government again.\n  The other day one of our colleagues said they were hopeful that among \nthe\n\n[[Page S5604]]\n\nRepublicans priorities--should they increase their numbers in the \nSenate this fall--would be, once again, to repeal the health care bill. \nIt is a story we have heard over and over despite an absolutely \noverwhelming array of data points which tell us only one story, and \nthat is that the Affordable Care Act is working.\n  I don't deny that my colleagues can come down to the floor of the \nSenate or House and tell stories of people who have had poor \ninteractions with the health care system. In fact, some people have had \npoor interactions with the Affordable Care Act. But those are stories. \nData and information tell us something fundamentally different.\n  At the very least, I am glad that our Republican colleagues say they \nare still focused on this very vague idea of repeal and replace. But \nhere is the problem: We have had 53 votes in the House of \nRepresentatives to repeal the law and not a single vote to replace it \nwith anything of any substance. So it is one thing to just say you want \nto replace the health care law, and it is another to actually put \ntogether a plan to do it.\n  I wish to credit three of our Republican colleagues in the Senate. \nThey are the only ones who have outlined an alternative. It is only an \n8-page summary, but it is important for people to know what it would \ndo. It would allow insurance companies to go back to their old ways of \nimposing annual limits on coverage, charge women more than men, provide \nlittle coverage for individuals with preexisting conditions, and \neffectively charge millions of Americans more by capping the tax \nexclusion for health care benefits. It is just an 8-page summary, but \nit is not pointing the way to a better health care reality for \nthousands of Americans.\n  Frankly, Republicans are not listening to what the American people \nare telling us. Over and over polls tell us that the American people \ndon't want this law repealed. They want changes and so do Democrats and \nRepublicans, but they don't want to repeal it.\n  A recent poll from Bloomberg, which I think is the most recent on \nthis subject, found that two-thirds of Americans want the new law to \neither be left alone entirely or given the chance to work with small \nimprovements. That is the reality of where people are in this country.\n  Why is there growing support for the law, and why is there \ndiminishing support for repeal? Well, because 10.3 million uninsured \nAmericans--as outlined by the New England Journal of Medicine--now have \ninsurance thanks to this law. The uninsurance rate among 18-to 64-year-\nolds, which is our target audience, fell from 21 percent in September \nof 2013 to 16 percent in April of 2014. I will say that again. In a 6-\nmonth period of time, the uninsurance rate in this country dropped by 5 \npercentage points. That is an absolutely stunning achievement, and \nthere is only one reason for it--the Affordable Care Act. The people \nwho have this insurance are using it.\n  According to the Commonwealth Fund, nearly 2 in 3 newly covered \nconsumers who went to the doctor or filled a prescription said they \nwould not have been able to afford or access those services if it were \nnot for the new coverage.\n  In a moment I will talk about what is happening when it comes to \nrates and health care expenditures. But the theory of the case is this: \nIf you get people insurance, they are going to use it for preventable \ncoverage rather than wait until their illness is so serious that they \ngo to the emergency room, which would require much more expensive \ninterventions. It is bad for them, and it is bad for the taxpayers and \nratepayers as well.\n  We are seeing record low rates of increase in health care spending. \nPremiums--probably for the first time in my lifetime--are stable from \nyear to year, and that is because the theory of the case is actually \nworking out in practice. People are getting insurance, using preventive \ncoverage, not getting as sick, and as a result health care is costing \nless.\n  The Kaiser Family Foundation said that in the 16 major cities they \nsurveyed, families will pay less on average to enroll in a health care \nexchange in 2015 than they did in 2014. I don't mean they will have a \npremium increase in 2015. They will actually pay less. The cost of the \nplan in the exchange will be less in real dollars than they were in \n2014.\n  I will talk about Connecticut in a second. We are an example of that \ntrend line.\n  It is not just the exchange that has stabilized. Employer-sponsored \ncoverage has stabilized as well.\n  I get it. There are outliers here. There are examples where health \ncare insurers are still passing along big increases to employers. So \nthe information I am giving is the average across the country. There \nare always outliers on the high side--but also on the low side.\n  Kaiser's study also says that the average premium for family coverage \nthrough employer-sponsored coverage care increased by 3 percent in \n2014, tying 2010 for the slowest rate of increase on record for \nemployer-sponsored premiums. That is the reality of what is happening. \nMore people have coverage, and the growth of health care spending is at \na historic low. Medicare's 2019 budget is about $95 billion less than \nit was projected to be 4 years ago.\n\n  We are saving $100 billion a year on just Medicare alone, and that is \non top of all the money that is being saved through relatively low \nrates of increase on exchanges. That $100 billion--just to give you \nsome perspective, because I know it is hard to get your head wrapped \naround what it means to save $100 billion--is greater than the total \namount of money we spend as a country on unemployment insurance, \nwelfare programs, and Amtrak combined. It is a lot of money to save as \na government.\n  The quality is getting better too--because that is what this is \nreally about. It is about delivering a better quality of life and a \nlonger life expectancy to consumers. Hospital readmissions--you go in \nfor a surgery, you go back home, and then you have to come back in--are \ndropping like a stone. Hospital-acquired infections--one of the leading \ncauses of death in this country--are dropping precipitously. Costs are \ngetting lower, more people have insurance, and the quality is getting \nbetter.\n  Here is the Connecticut story. We have dropped the overall insurance \nrate in the country by about 25 percent--unbelievable news over the \ncourse of 6 months. Connecticut is double that. We cut our insurance \nrate in half in Connecticut. We are a small State with 3.5 million \npeople and had about 285,000 uninsured individuals. Connecticut has \ntaken the 250,000 people and put them into either the Medicaid \nexpansion or the private health care exchanges and a little more than \nhalf of those people were previously uninsured.\n  A lot of my friends on the other side of the aisle say: That is \ngreat, but those numbers are illusory because over time people aren't \ngoing to pay those premiums; they are just going to drop off the plans. \nWell, here is Connecticut's experience: 80,000 people signed up for \nprivate plans on the health care exchanges, and 78,000 are still paying \ntheir premiums about 4 to 6 months in. Everybody is still paying their \npremiums. And we know why. Because it is largely affordable and because \npeople need that health care.\n  People love the exchange and their interaction with the new plan in \nConnecticut. Tomorrow the Connecticut exchange will release data \nshowing that about 83 percent of people who went through the exchange \nto buy private health care were satisfied with their experience. Of \nthose who went through the program to get Medicaid expansion, over 90 \npercent were satisfied as well.\n  We are saving money. Medicaid in Connecticut is 2 percent lower this \nyear than it was last year. We have cut our uninsured rate by half. We \nare spending less as a government. People are satisfied with it. Rates \nare stable.\n  Here are the three plans in Connecticut that submitted rate increases \non the exchange, and, at least for our biggest insurer, they are also \ngoing to be the rates of increase outside the exchange. Our biggest \ninsurer, Anthem, which is our Blue Cross Blue Shield: Rates are going \ndown by an average of .1 percent. ConnectiCare is raising its rates by \n3.1 percent. Our other insurer on the exchange, Healthy Connecticut, is \nreducing its rates by 8.5 percent.\n  Republicans have kind of moved the ball on this a little bit. They \nnow say the way we judge a successful ACA is that health care rates go \ndown from\n\n[[Page S5605]]\n\nyear to year--not that we are controlling the rate of increase but that \nthe Affordable Care Act isn't succeeding unless rates are going down. I \nheard my colleague from Wyoming make this claim about Connecticut a few \nweeks ago in which I was talking about rates going up by 1 percent and \nthe claim was made: Well, that is not good enough.\n  People have been used to 10-, 15-, \n20-, 30-percent increases in premiums in Connecticut. They are pretty \nhappy with a .1-percent reduction. Frankly, they are pretty happy with \na 3.1-percent increase. That is because of the Affordable Care Act.\n  So there is all the data. There it is. That is just the tip of the \niceberg. Costs are going down, more people have insurance, and quality \nis getting better. It seems as though we open the paper every week and \nthere is some new piece of good information.\n  I get it. This needs to be better. This needs to be perfected. The \nlaw still has warts. The Senator sitting in the Presiding Officer's \nchair is leading the fight to make this law work even better for \npeople. I look forward to being involved in that conversation. But that \nis where the conversation should be--perfection, not repeal. And we are \nreminded again that if Republicans were to win control of this body, at \nthe top of their agenda would be this same old fight--53 different \nvotes in the House of Representatives over the past several years--to \nrepeal the law without any real tangible plan to improve it.\n  This morning I met with a good friend of mine whom I have spoken \nabout on this floor before, but because she is here in town I wish to \nspeak about her one more time, and that is Betty Berger. Betty is here \nwith the American Cancer Society. We will see them all over the Hill \ntoday in their light-blue shirts. Betty is arguing for a lot of things \nto happen here, with research funding increases at the top of the list, \nbut she is also here to make a very personal case to protect the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  Years ago Betty's family was faced with a terrible choice when her \nson was diagnosed with cancer. In the 1-week period of time her family \ndidn't have health care insurance--her husband had one job and he \nswitched jobs--in the 1-week period of time between when he went from \nthe first job to the second job, the diagnosis of cancer came down and \nit became a preexisting condition not covered by the new employer. \nBetty's family was left to pay for their son's cancer treatments on \ntheir own. They eventually lost their home, they lost their savings, \nand they had to declare bankruptcy.\n  Unfortunately, Betty's story is pretty familiar. Half of all \nbankruptcies in this country are due to stories very similar to \nBetty's. A mistimed illness at a point where the family didn't have \ninsurance results in them losing everything.\n  The reality is that the Affordable Care Act makes sure that Betty's \nstory never has to be told again, that no family ever has to make the \nchoice between declaring bankruptcy, saving their home, protecting \ntheir savings, or choosing to care for a loved one.\n  Let's talk about making this bill better, but let's recognize that \nthe data, the numbers tell only one story; that is, the Affordable Care \nAct is working.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/16/senate-section/article/S5605-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5605-S5606]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor today, as \nRepublicans have come to the floor week after week ever since the \nPresident's health care law was passed. I have many concerns about the \nway this health care law is impacting families in my home State of \nWyoming as well as families all across the country. In one State after \nanother, people are feeling the devastating side effects of the health \ncare law.\n  President Obama says Democrats who voted for the health care law \nshould, as he said, ``forcefully defend and be proud of the law.''\n  I heard earlier today the Kaiser Family Foundation's report being \nquoted. What they said is that premiums have gone up, on average, \n$3,500 from 2009 for family workplace coverage, plus the deductibles \nare higher. So premiums are up $3,500 since 2009 for family workplace \ncoverage, and the deductibles are higher--higher money paid out-of-\npocket.\n  The President of the United States said they would go down by $2,500 \nper family. Nancy Pelosi said they would go down for everyone. She was \nthe Speaker of the House. She was the one who said: First you have to \npass it before you get to find out what is in it. Americans have found \nout what is in it, and they don't like it. People do not like what they \nsee with the President's health care law. It continues to be very \nunpopular.\n  So I ask, is the President really proud that families all across the \ncountry are suffering because of his health care law and the many \ndangerous side effects they are now having to live with?\n  Let's look around the country a little bit and see what the new \nheadlines are bringing, and there are new headlines every day. In \nVirginia a television station in Charlottesville, WVIR, reported on \nwhat is happening there. Last Wednesday they had a report which said \nthat ``nearly a quarter million Virginians will have to change their \ninsurance plans this fall.'' The President said: If you like what you \nhave, you can keep it. Not in Virginia. A quarter of a million \nVirginians will have to change their insurance plans this fall. It is \nbecause the plans don't include all of a very long list of things \nWashington mandates have to be offered.\n  Even if a person had an insurance plan that worked well for their \nfamily, that met their needs, the President and Democrats in this body \nsay: Sorry, you can't keep it. The President said: If you like your \nplan, you can keep it. What happened there? At least 27 Democrats stood \non the floor of the Senate and said: If you like what you have, you can \nkeep it. If you like your plan, you can keep your plan. That is what \nthey said. What happened? Was this intentionally to deceive the \nAmerican people? Why are nearly a quarter of a million Virginians \nlosing their insurance plan?\n  The head of the Virginia Association of Health Plans says it is \nsimple. He told the TV station: ``We're not allowed to offer those \nplans anymore.'' The President said they could, and now these people \nare being told by the law they are not allowed to even offer the plans \nto people who want to buy them because it works for them.\n  Are the Democrats in the Senate willing to forcefully defend the fact \nthat 250,000 people in Virginia will have to buy new plans that they \ndon't want, don't need, and many can't afford, with all of these \nadditional provisions Washington says have to be included? To me, that \nis a very expensive and unnecessary side effect of the President's \nhealth care law.\n  But it is not just people's health care plans. People are concerned \nabout keeping their doctors and keeping their hospitals that they go to \nin their own communities. Let's take a look at what happened in \nConnecticut, in a report that came out. Hartford Courant: ``Five \nConnecticut Hospitals Could Leave Anthem's Network on October 1.'' What \nabout the people who go to those hospitals and get their health care \ncoverage that way? What are those people supposed so do? The President \nsaid: If you like your plan, you can keep your plan. If you like your \ndoctor, you can keep your doctor. If you like your hospital, you can \nkeep your hospital. These people may be losing their hospital come \nOctober 1.\n  Here is another side effect of the law that is hitting middle-class \nAmericans and their wallets. It is the part of the law that says the \nworkweek is no longer 40 hours. Now it is just 30 hours. That is what \nthe law says. People who are working part time have had their hours cut \nto below 30 hours, and they are getting lower take-home pay. I hear \nabout this in Wyoming. I hear it from school district workers, from \nfolks who have had their hours cut, who are having to get by with less \npay because if they have their hours cut, their take-home pay goes \ndown. It is another destructive side effect of this health care law.\n  It is not just Wyoming; it is happening all around the country. In \nLouisiana there was a report by KNOE television in Monroe last Thursday \nwhich said that 400 employees within Lincoln Parish schools--people who \nwork within the school system--are getting their hours cut in half. \nFour hundred workers, one school district, Louisiana, half\n\n[[Page S5606]]\n\nthe hours, half the pay. Where did the school board put the blame? They \nput it directly on the President's health care law. They said they \ncan't afford the Washington-mandated health insurance for all of their \nworkers, so they are cutting back on the hours for substitute teachers, \ncutting the hours for cafeteria workers, cutting the hours for \ncustodians, for paraprofessionals who work with the kids. Is that what \nthe President envisioned? Is that what the President means when he says \n``forcefully defend and be proud''? Cutting back things for children in \nour schools, is that the President's solution for health care, making \nit harder for kids to get an education and making it harder for \nteachers to teach?\n  One custodian told the paper that it is depressing knowing his pay is \nabout to be cut. He said, ``It's rough the way it is. Why make it \nharder to survive?'' That is my question to the President of the United \nStates and to Senators on the floor who come to talk about the health \ncare law.\n  Why make it harder to survive? Why, Mr. President? You said people \nshould forcefully defend and be proud of this law. Are you proud of it, \nMr. President? That is what I need to know. That is what the American \npublic wants to know.\n  Is the President proud that people are getting their hours cut in \nhalf specifically because of his law? And school districts are pointing \nto that as the cause. Is the President proud he is making it harder for \nAmericans to survive?\n  Now, some people aren't just getting their hours cut; they can't get \nhired in the first place because of the health care law. That is what \none business owner said in an op-ed for the Charlotte Observer \nnewspaper in Charlotte, NC. It ran September 10 and was entitled ``How \nObamaCare jams a stick in my company's wheels.'' Rodney Pitts, who runs \nthe Southern Elevator Company in North Carolina, says he wants to hire \nmore elevator mechanics for his business, but he hasn't been able to \nhire anyone this year. Why? He says the main reason is because of the \ncosts associated with the health care law and all of the requirements \nof the health care law. He said, ``Thousands of businesses in Charlotte \nand in North Carolina are in the same holding pattern.''\n  So people all across the country who want to work won't get that \nopportunity because businesses can't afford to take on all of the extra \ncosts of the President's health care law. That is an extremely \ndestructive side effect of the law. It is hurting American families.\n  This health care law is hurting our economy. Every Democrat in the \nSenate voted for this health care law--every one. Where are the \nDemocrats willing to forcefully defend these alarming side effects of \nthis health care law? Is the President ready to go to North Carolina \nand talk to this business owner? Is the President going to say he is \nproud his health care law is keeping the businesses from hiring more \npeople in North Carolina and all across the country?\n  This isn't the kind of health care reform the American people needed. \nIt is not the kind of health care reform the American people wanted. \nPeople didn't want a law that forced them to get rid of the insurance \nwhich they had and liked and which worked for them and for their \nfamilies. They didn't want a law that forced their local schools to cut \nthe hours of custodians and part-time teachers, cafeteria workers, and \npeople who look after their children. That is not how to help people in \na community.\n\n  These are the tragic side effects of the President's health care law. \nRepublicans are going to continue to talk good patient-centered \nreforms, reforms that get patients across the country the care they \nneed from a doctor they choose and at a lower cost.\n  We are going to talk about restoring people's freedom, freedom to buy \nhealth insurance that works for them, for their families because they \nknow what works best for them, not President Obama. We are going to \ntalk about giving people choices, not Washington mandates. Republicans \nare going to keep offering real solutions for better health care \nwithout all of these intrusive and intolerable side effects.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/16/senate-section/article/S5606-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5606]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I am very pleased to join with a number of colleagues today \nrepresenting all of those in our conference who are deeply concerned \nabout the mound of debt that students incur when they are doing the \nright thing.\n  We say: Go to college, work hard, get skills for this new economy, \ncome out so you can be successful. Having done that, too many of them \nare coming out with mounds of debt--crushing debt--that is stopping \nthem from buying a house, starting a business, and moving forward with \ntheir future. There is something that can be done about that, and that \nis what we are here to talk about and invite our Republican colleagues \nto join us.\n  There was a filibuster a number of weeks ago against our student loan \ndebt bill, the bank on students bill. We have an opportunity today to \ncome together, rather than seeing a Republican filibuster, to join in a \nbipartisan way to provide incredibly important relief to millions of \nnot only young people but older people across the country who are still \nstruggling with student loan debt.\n  In every generation there are young Americans from middle-class \nfamilies who have the grades to go to college but not the financial \nresources. They take out student loans because they know that before \nthey can get the job they want to be able to get a fair shot at the \nAmerican dream, they have got to have a degree, and that is what they \nare taught. That is what we all tell our children. That is what I was \ntold as well. What they are looking for is a degree, not debt. \nUnfortunately, by the time students graduate, they are in fact saddled \nin today's world with mounds of debt.\n  To address this problem, Senator Warren, Senator Franken, and I and \nmany Democratic colleagues have joined to introduce the bank on \nstudents emergency loan bill. It would allow responsible borrowers to \nrefinance their loans at lower rates, the rates from last year, the \nlowest possible rates in place. These are rates that are currently only \navailable to new borrowers. We think everyone ought to have an \nopportunity to do that. In fact, with lower interest rates, we have \nseen so many people, including many of us, refinancing their homes, \ntaking advantage of lower interest rates, being able to use lower \ninterest rates in other ways. But students have been prohibited--anyone \nwith a student loan has been prohibited from refinancing. That is plain \nwrong, and our bill addresses that.\n  Passing this bill would help more than 25 million Americans. I cannot \nthink of any one single thing we could do that would immediately help \n25 million people, including 1 million hard-working people in the State \nof Michigan.\n  A mother named Frances from Macomb County outside of Detroit wrote to \nme on September 6, and she talked about her children. She has two \nchildren. Both of them chose jobs that serve the public. One is a \nteacher and one is a nurse. Because of the loans they took out when \nthey were working hard to get their way through college, their student \nloan debt now is nearly $100,000--$100,000.\n  In Michigan, 62 percent of college students have debt when they \ngraduate. The average is about $29,000, although I have talked to \npeople with not only the $100,000 debt I just mentioned but young \nprofessionals with $185,000 or $200,000 debt if they have gone to \ngraduate school or medical school or law school, and it can be even \nhigher.\n  On the other end of the spectrum, there are some Americans who worked \nall their adult lives and are now retired, and in fact they are on \nMedicare and they are still paying student loan debt. This is wrong. We \nneed to act to change this.\n  The total student loan debt in this country right now is $1.2 \ntrillion. That is more than credit card debt--more than credit card \ndebt, $1.2 trillion. If you put it another way, after every one of the \n7.2 billion people--men, women, and children in the world--if everybody \nin the world donated $165 to pay off America's student loan debt, it \nstill wouldn't be quite enough.\n  This is something with a great sense of urgency to it. This bill \nneeds to pass. We need to pass it now. If this passes, it means parents \ncan save for their children's education, for a home, can start a \nbusiness, can afford their car, can begin saving for their own \nretirement instead of just paying off student loan debt. These aren't \nluxuries, these are basics, basics of the American dream.\n  Everyone in this Chamber can agree that America isn't strong without \na vibrant middle class, and, frankly, it is outrageous that we have \nallowed this situation to go on where the only way to do the right \nthing, to get the skills needed to get ahead, is to put yourself in \nsuch jeopardy with student loan debt. We can do better than that.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to join us in helping millions of \nAmerican workers to manage their student loan debt more effectively, \nsaving thousands--tens of thousands--of dollars in interest payments. \nWe can help right now.\n  This is something where we could jump-start the economy, as the \nFederal Reserve Chairman said--jump-start the economy right now by \npassing this bill and being able to lower the cost of student loans.\n  It is now my great pleasure to turn to a champion not only on this \nissue but on the broader question of making sure that every American \nhas a fair shot to make it so that we have a strong middle class in \nthis country.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin, Ms. \nBaldwin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Ms. BALDWIN. It is a delight to join Senator Stabenow on the floor to \ntalk about this critical issue that is a growing crisis here at home in \nAmerica and threatens Americans' economic strength and competitiveness.\n  As you have heard, today there is a debt crisis in America. Student \nloan debt is more than $1.2 trillion, and that is holding back an \nentire generation and creating a drag on our economy. It is a crisis \nthat demands action from Washington.\n  Once again, Congress is failing the American people by refusing to \nwork together to confront it. In June the Senate took a vote on the \nBank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act, which I am proud to \ncosponsor. While it received majority support in this body, a minority \nof Republicans obstructed the bill and prevented it from moving \nforward.\n  The choice was clear, and opponents addressing the student debt \ncrisis chose to protect tax loopholes for millionaires and billionaires \ninstead of helping give students a fair shot at getting ahead and \nproviding relief to middle-class families struggling with student loan \ndebt.\n\n[[Page S5609]]\n\n  I believe every student in America deserves a fair shot at an \naffordable education, and I believe college education should be a path \nto the middle class and not a path to indebtedness.\n  Nearly 40 million students and graduates in America have outstanding \nstudent loans. The total amount of student debt in the United States \nhas tripled in the past decade. According to new data from the Federal \nReserve, student loan debt grew by $31 billion from January to March of \nthis year. In my home State of Wisconsin, almost 70 percent of the \nstudents graduating from 4-year institutions will have student loan \ndebt and the average debt amount will be $28,000. That is real money. \nThat is real money that isn't going toward buying a car or a first \nhome. It is real money that isn't going into growing our economy at a \ntime when we so desperately need economic growth.\n  To help give Americans a fair shot at getting out from under that \nburden of student loan debt, we should let borrowers refinance at \ntoday's lower rates. That is why we are pushing for a vote on the Bank \non Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act. This legislation will allow \nthose with outstanding student loan debt to refinance. It is pretty \nsimple: It is paid for through the Buffett rule by making millionaires \nand billionaires pay their fair share of taxes to give our students a \nfair shot at a bright future, and it will help strengthen the economic \nsecurity of the American families who are struggling with this debt.\n  The Department of Education estimates that 25 million borrowers in \nthe United States could benefit from refinancing under this \nlegislation, including just over half a million Wisconsinites.\n  I have traveled the State of Wisconsin and listened to students and \ngraduates who are struggling with student loan debt. They shared their \nconcerns and the burdens that the cost of a higher education puts on \nthem and their families. They asked me to bring their stories and their \nmessages to Washington, DC.\n\n  One graduate student said she lives with her fiance's parents to save \nmoney. Another said her husband borrowed against his 401(k) so that the \ncouple could afford daycare for their children while she attends \nschool. Another woman said she owes about $27,000 in loans. When she \ntried to buy a $6,500 car, she needed her grandfather to cosign because \nshe would not have been able to get the loan on her own. I heard from a \nwoman in Green Bay, WI, who is strapped with $600-a-month payments for \nher student loans.\n  The failure of Washington to hear these voices and take action is \nholding them back, and it is holding back our economy. This money isn't \ngoing to support small local businesses that are working so hard to \nmove our economy forward. That is why we should seize this opportunity \ntoday to pass the Bank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act. By \nallowing student loan borrowers to transfer their loans into the \nFederal program and by closing costly tax loopholes for billionaires \nand millionaires, we are solving a major economic crisis in a \nmeaningful and effective way. It is the least we can do to address the \nstudent loan debt crisis, but it is not all we can do.\n  Last week I had the opportunity to introduce two bills to help \naddress the larger issue of student debt and college affordability. My \nlegislation targets working students and students enrolled in career \nand technology education programs. My Working Student Act will allow \nstudents who must work while in college to complete their degrees more \nquickly and with less debt. The new legislation increases the amount \nworking students can earn without that income counting against them in \naccessing need-based Federal financial aid, including Pell grants.\n  In addition, some career and technical education students cannot \naccess Federal student aid to help them advance their careers, and that \nis why I have introduced the Career and Technical Education Opportunity \nAct. This legislation simply allows CTE students enrolled in short-term \nprograms that lead to industry-recognized credentials to also qualify \nfor Federal student aid. CTE is one of the most effective vehicles to \nrespond quickly to labor market changes and workforce readiness needs \nof business and industry.\n  My legislation will help ensure that Federal investments are \nsupporting ``ready-to-work'' education.\n  One thing is clear: There is a lot more we can do in Washington to \ngive a much needed break to people struggling to build a stronger \nfuture for themselves, their families, and for America. I am pleased \nthat in a short while Senator Warren will call for a vote on this \nimportant matter. We have a chance today to make a powerful difference \nin the lives of millions of students and graduates. Let's do so.\n  I yield back my time.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, it is now my great pleasure to yield to \nthe distinguished Senator from New Hampshire. I have to say that \nSenator Shaheen's voice has been strong and clear. She has been one of \nour strongest advocates as far as what we need to do on student loan \ndebt and also making sure middle-class families have a shot to get \nahead. We are very pleased to have the Senator from New Hampshire, and \nI yield 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I thank Senator Stabenow and Senator Baldwin.\n  I am pleased to be on the floor today joining the distinguished \nSenator from Michigan, Ms. Warren, Senator Franken, and all the other \nSenators who will be here to speak on the Bank on Students Emergency \nLoan Refinancing Act. This is a critical piece of legislation, and it \nwill allow eligible borrowers who took out student loans prior to \nJanuary 1, 2013, to refinance those loans at a lower interest rate. You \ncan refinance a car and you can refinance a mortgage, but you cannot \nrefinance a student loan.\n  We have heard from literally hundreds of students and residents in \nNew Hampshire who are no longer students but who are trying to pay back \nloans after years of having to try to pay back the loans and start \ntheir lives. Supporting this bill is a commonsense way we can come \ntogether to help the millions across this country who are struggling to \npay back their student loans. This is especially important to New \nHampshire because we rank second in the country in average debt per \ngraduate--almost $33,000 per graduate for student loans. According to \nrecent estimates, almost 130,000 New Hampshire residents could benefit \nfrom this bill. These folks need some relief from their student debt \nburden because it often comes at interest rates that are higher than \nthey pay for a home or a car. It is unacceptable to leave these \nborrowers struggling with crippling debt when we have an opportunity to \naddress this growing problem.\n  It is not just for those people who are affected because of their own \nstudent loans; this has a ripple effect through our economy. I met with \na group of realtors over the summer, and one of the things they talked \nabout was how they are seeing first-time home buyers delay buying a \nhome because of the cost of student loans.\n  To put this issue into perspective, I wish to talk about some of the \npeople I have met who have been burdened by their student loans.\n  I first met Calvin, a young soldier from New Hampshire, at Walter \nReed Medical Center. He was recovering from losing his leg after \nstepping on an IED in Afghanistan. He was married and had a young \nchild. We were talking about the challenges he was facing after he \nrecovered from his injuries. What impressed me the most about our \nconversation--in addition to his commitment to this country--was that \nthe issue he was most concerned about was not losing his leg or where \nhe was going to get a job after he got out of the military, it was how \nhe and his wife were going to pay back their student loans.\n  Another college graduate--a woman from Durham, NH--wrote to me \nrecently. She has a master's degree and is employed in the public \nservice field. She has been working for 12 years but has not been able \nto buy a home for her family because she still has $90,000 in student \nloan debt.\n  I also heard from a woman in Stratham, NH, who has a $150,000 student \nloan debt. She consolidated her loan but has a 7-percent interest rate, \nwhich accrues nearly $900 per month in interest alone. A lower interest \nrate would make a critical difference to this woman and her young \nfamily.\n  Those three young people represent thousands--almost 130,000 people \nacross New Hampshire--who would benefit\n\n[[Page S5610]]\n\nfrom refinancing their student loans. This bill is important for New \nHampshire, and it is important for the country.\n  We should take action today for the benefit of all Americans with \nstudent loan debt who deserve a fair shot at the American dream and \nopportunities for themselves and their families. I urge my colleagues \nto join me. As Senator Baldwin and Senator Stabenow said, we have an \nopportunity this afternoon to make a huge step forward in addressing \nthe student loan debt faced by too many Americans. I hope our \ncolleagues will support the Bank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing \nAct.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I will yield 5 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from Minnesota, and as one of the lead sponsors \nof this bill, I thank Senator Franken for his passion and fight not \nonly for people in Minnesota but for the 25 million people across the \ncountry who will benefit from the opportunity to be able to afford to \ngo to college.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I thank the generous Senator from \nMichigan, and I thank the Senator from New Hampshire for her remarks \nabout the Bank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act.\n  I have held college affordability roundtables around my State of \nMinnesota ever since I got to the Senate. It is astounding how hard \nstudents work while they are also in college. I remember speaking to \nthe student governing body from MnSCU--the Minnesota colleges and \nuniversities student body--and I asked: How many of you work 20 hours a \nweek? They all raised their hands. They were in the governing body. I \nsaid: How many of you work 30 hours a week? A few raised their hands. I \nsaid: How many of you work 40 hours a week? A couple raised their \nhands. These students work while going to college.\n  In Minnesota students graduate with more than $30,000 in student loan \ndebt. We are about fourth in the Nation. I heard Senator Shaheen say \nthey are second in the Nation. This bill would help over 550,000 \nMinnesotans and 25 million Americans cut down their debt and keep more \nof their hard-earned checks.\n  A few months ago I had a roundtable at the University of Minnesota, \nand I met Joelle Stangler. She happened to be the student body \npresident at the University of Minnesota. She was the valedictorian of \nRogers High School in Minnesota with a 4.12 GPA. She doesn't lack \nmotivation. Both of Joelle's parents were teachers. In fact, she comes \nfrom a long line of educators going back six generations.\n  You will see why I am telling this story.\n  A couple of years ago Joelle's mother Cassie Stangler made the tough \ndecision to quit her job as a fifth grade teacher to go to work in the \nprivate sector because she could make more money in the private sector. \nShe needed to do this because she had four kids in college. Among the \nfifth grade classes in Mrs. Stangler's school district, her students \nshowed some of the highest rates of improvement in test scores. This is \nwhat I am talking about--we lost a great teacher because of the expense \nof postsecondary education.\n  Even with her mom's sacrifice, she has $12,000 in student loans, and \nshe estimates that her total debt will be around $30,000 by the time \nshe graduates.\n  There are so many students such as Joelle who are drowning in debt in \nMinnesota and across the country. Student debt totals are over $1.2 \ntrillion, and it is a threat to our economy. We are seeing young people \ndelay decisions to start a business, to start a family, to buy a home, \nor make other types of purchases that make an economy grow. But there \nare commonsense solutions, and they are contained in our Bank on \nStudents Emergency Loan Refinancing Act.\n  Our bill simply allows students and graduates to take advantage of \nlower interest rates and refinance their loans. That is what people \nwith mortgages, car loans, and business loans can do. They can take \nadvantage of lower interest rates and refinance their loans, but the \ngovernment will not refinance student loans, and that is just not \nright.\n  In the summer of 2013 we came together in Congress to prevent the \ninterest rate on new student loans from doubling. Thanks to that \neffort, undergraduate students taking out new loans now pay a lower \nrate. Our bill would enable students and graduates who are saddled with \nhigher interest rates on their undergraduate loans to refinance at the \nsame lower interest rate. The bill would similarly enable Americans \nwith graduate student loans or PLUS loans to refinance at lower rates.\n  Student debt is holding Americans back, it is holding back our \neconomy, and that is why we need to pass this bill.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield to the Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished Senator \nfrom New York, who not only is a leader on this issue and so many other \nissues but is the author of a major tax credit in our Tax Code that \nallows middle-class families to be able to get help for college. There \nis not a bigger champion for middle-class families than the senior \nSenator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and dear friend from \nMichigan for the great work she has done as chair and vice chair of the \nDPCC. We have worked very hard on this ``fair shot'' agenda. We believe \nit is resonating with the American people.\n  When our colleagues on the other side of the aisle oppose simple \nmeasures such as a fair shot at getting out of poverty if a person \nworks 40 hours a week, a fair shot for a woman to get equal pay to a \nman, and a fair shot to prevent jobs from being sent overseas to get a \ntax break, they know what we are talking about. Perhaps no issue \nresonates more than a fair shot for people to be able to afford college \nand then repay their loans with a reasonable amount of money.\n  Probably the greatest problem America faces is the decline of middle-\nclass incomes. They have been declining since 2001. If they continue to \ndecline for another decade, whoa is America, whoa is America.\n  America has been expanded--has grown to the greatest country in the \nworld on the notion of opportunity. In my harbor sits a lady with a \ntorch. That torch symbolizes the American dream to just about every \nAmerican and most citizens in the world. What is the American dream? \nWhat does that torch symbolize? If we ask the average American, they \nwouldn't put it in fancy words or highfalutin language. They would say: \nIt means if I work hard, I will be doing better 10 years from now than \nI am doing today, and my kids will be doing better than I.\n  Nothing keeps that American dream burning more brightly than the \nability to afford a college education.\n  The bottom line is simple. The statistics show that in our new and \ntechnological world, those who have a college education, whether it is \nan A.A. degree or a B.A. degree or higher, do a lot better economically \nthan everybody else. Amazingly enough, they do better in other ways in \nterms of how good their health is, in terms of their longevity, in \nterms of their happiness.\n  So college, which used to be a rare commodity 100 years ago, is now \nalmost a necessity to millions of Americans. Yet it is so expensive. It \nis expensive in two ways. First, it is hard to get there. We have been \nworking very hard on the American opportunity tax break, which my \nfriend from Michigan mentioned, reducing the rate of student loans for \nthose who are already in college, and many other ideas we have pursued \nto try to make college affordable for families who have someone in \ncollege or will enter college in future years.\n  There is another huge problem as well. Those who have been to college \nhave huge amounts of debt and they are paying this government far more \ninterest than would be paid on the market. We can refinance almost \neverything--mortgages, cars, loans on jewelry--but we cannot refinance \ncollege loans the government has given us. So people are paying 6, 7, 8 \npercent; whereas, if they went to a bank on their own, they would pay \nless.\n  How dare the Federal Government make money on the backs of young \npeople who are struggling to pay back their debt. Boy, does it hurt \nthose families. It prevents them from starting\n\n[[Page S5611]]\n\nbusinesses, buying homes, going on vacation, and many delay their \nmarriages. So there could be nothing that would make millions and \nmillions of Americans happier economically. There could be nothing that \nwould help people get a fair shot and a decent education, the ability \nto repay, than this simple bill put together largely by the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, who has done a great job.\n  It is hard to figure why our colleagues oppose this. They have some \ndistrust in the Federal Government. In this area we do too. We think \nthe Federal Government is demanding too much money to repay loans. Why \ndon't they join us?\n  The cost of tuition goes up and up, the cost to repay goes up and up, \nand the burden on the backs of so many goes up and up.\n  So all we want is a fair shot for everyone to be able to afford \ncollege and to be able to repay. This should have been a bipartisan \nbill; it is not right now, but maybe there will be a change of heart. I \nwill tell my colleagues this: This will become law, maybe not today but \nin the next months and next year. It has become an issue in campaigns \nthroughout the country. This is an issue that resonates with voters--\nDemocratic, Independent, Republican, liberal, conservative, North, \nSouth, East, and West, and we will keep fighting until every American \nhas a fair shot at affording college and repaying their loans.\n\n  With that, I yield back to the Senator from Michigan, who has been \nkind enough to put together this hour of debate.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank my friend from New York, who has \nbeen so passionate on the broad question of how do we have a fair shot \nas Americans to get ahead and particularly as it relates to \naffordability and college loan debt.\n  We are so pleased to have another champion with us from the great \nState of Maryland. I yield now to Senator Cardin from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, let me thank Senator Stabenow for \norganizing this time to underscore the importance of a fair shot for \neveryone to afford a college education.\n  Earlier this month Senator Mikulski and I met with students. We met \nwith students from the University of Maryland Baltimore County. We met \nwith students from Bowie State College. We sat around a table and \nlistened to their stories. Bowie State College is one of our \nhistorically Black colleges and universities in America with fairly \nreasonable tuition costs--much lower than most State colleges and \ncertainly a lot lower than private schools. So Senator Mikulski and I \nwere shocked to find that the average amount of debt today at a State \ncollege such as Bowie is over $27,000 for a graduating senior. That \naffects their decisions.\n  We were there during the first week of school and we talked to the \npresident, and the president said he still doesn't know the enrollment \nthis year because there are a lot of students who have preenrolled, but \nuntil they have paid their costs, they are not fully enrolled, and a \nlot aren't fully enrolled because they didn't know how to pay for their \ncosts. We also heard from students who said they showed up for class \nand several of the students didn't even have textbooks because they \ncouldn't afford to buy their textbooks. Then we heard from students who \nsaid: Look, it is difficult enough to afford a 4-year college \neducation, but the average length of time to get a degree was 6 years. \nWhy? Because they have to work in order to pay for part of their \nschooling to keep their debt down. They couldn't graduate earlier. The \ncourses are only offered certain times of the year, and it took them 6 \nyears to get the required amount.\n  We have heard the numbers. The amount of student debt outstanding is \n$1.3 trillion--more than credit card debt. In the United States, of a \nfamily's income, it takes maybe half the income to afford a college \neducation. For the rest of the industrialized world, it is between 5 \nand 10 percent. We can't be competitive with that rate. Education is a \ngreat equalizer in this country and we have outpriced ourselves.\n  We have a chance to do something about it today. I will give one more \nexample, if I might. I was at a 4-year college this year and I was \nspeaking to a student who was a second-year student going into her \nthird year, and she said she was going to drop out. I asked her: Why \nare you going to drop out? Are you not doing well in school? She said: \nI get straight A's. I am dropping out because I can't justify to my \nfamily taking out more debt, knowing what the interest costs are going \nto be to my family.\n  It broke my heart. That is the situation.\n  We need to have greater budget support for public colleges and \nuniversities. We need to increase Pell grants. We need to make Pell \ngrants 12 months a year because some of these courses are only offered \nin the summertime and that is when students can make it up. Senator \nHarkin has a bill in to do that, and we need to do that. There are a \nlot of steps we need to take, but today we could take a giant step \nforward with interest costs.\n  My colleague Senator Elizabeth Warren will be making a request. We \nhave a chance to pass this bill today in the Senate that would say it \nis wrong for the Federal Government to make $66 billion on the interest \nflow. From 2007 to 2012 the Federal Government made $66 billion on the \ndifference between what they charge in interest and what the cost is to \nthe government. To me, that is the worst tax on the most vulnerable in \nour community, and we should eliminate that. That is what the Warren \nbill does.\n  The bill says let our students refinance their loans. By the way, it \nis not just young people. There are several million Americans over the \nage of 50 who have student debt. This is a lifetime burden. Let them \nrefinance so they can take advantage of the lower interest rates and \nsave several thousand dollars doing that. We have a chance to do that \ntoday.\n  I urge my colleagues to allow us to take up this legislation and \nlet's pass it. Let's show the people of this Nation that we want a fair \nshot for everyone to afford a college education. I am proud to be a \npart of the Senators who are on the floor urging this to happen. Again, \nI thank my colleague Senator Stabenow for her leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I join with my colleagues to urge the Senate \nto take up and pass the Bank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act \nled by my colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Elizabeth Warren.\n  This is about fairness, it is about values, and it is about what is \nbest for our students and our shared economic future.\n  Earlier this month Senator Whitehouse and I held a roundtable with \nRhode Islanders about student loan debt. Rhode Island ranks in the top \nfive for the amount of debt students incur to earn an undergraduate \ndegree. We heard from a teacher who works a second job to help make his \nloan payments and a parent who worries how she will be able to help her \nson pay for college while she is still making loan payments. We heard \nfrom Rhode Island realtors about the impact student loan debt is having \non the housing market.\n  This is an issue that strikes home for all of us. Even our Nation's \nseniors are impacted. GAO recently reported that from 2002 through \n2013, the number of individuals whose Social Security benefits were \noffset to pay student loan debt increased fivefold. Think about it. \nThese are senior citizens who are paying off student loans. Their \nactual Social Security benefit checks are being affected by student \nloan debt. That is something I find disturbing and completely \nunpredictable.\n  If you would have asked me 2 or 3 or 4 years ago--certainly if you \nasked me 30 years ago when I was in my thirties or so, I would have \nsaid, no, that wouldn't happen. That would have been impossible back \nthen because we had a country that supported students through college. \nThe Pell grant and Stafford loans were such that people had a chance to \npay them off rather quickly and then go on to buy a home, establish a \nfamily, and then use their resources for their retirement or to help \ntheir grandchildren a little bit with their student loans.\n  When it comes to student loans, we are in this incredible situation. \nSince 2003, student loan debt has quadrupled to an estimated $1.2 \ntrillion, and the interest rate on undergraduate student loans was 3.86 \npercent for the last year. Yet many borrowers are locked into loans at \n6.8 percent or higher with no way to refinance.\n\n[[Page S5612]]\n\n  Just last year the GAO estimated that the Federal Government would \nearn an estimated $66 billion from student loans originated between \n2007 and 2012. Again, in the 1950s and certainly in the 1960s--but \nparticularly after the Pell Grants in the 1970s--we were investing in \nstudents. They were our future, not profit centers. We are now \ngenerating--over a 5-year period--$66 billion. Student loans are \nsupposed to be an investment to help individuals reach their potential \nand strengthen communities, not just a revenue generator. Approximately \n25 million Americans could benefit from refinancing, including 88,000 \nin Rhode Island. They could lower their monthly payments if they could \njust refinance their student loans.\n  One of the ways we have been trying to help is by allowing borrowers \nwith high fixed rates on their student loans to refinance at a lower \nrate. That is the simple premise behind the Bank on Students Emergency \nLoan Refinancing Act that I am proud to cosponsor with Senator Warren \nand many of my colleagues.\n  In June the Senate fell just shy of the number of votes needed to \nmove forward on this legislation. Today, once again, the Republicans \nwill block us from taking up this legislation.\n  I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will reconsider \ntheir opposition because student loans should help people get ahead, \nnot weigh them down with debt, thereby holding them and our economy \nback.\n  Looking forward we also need to work together to tackle the drivers \nof the student loan debt--rapidly rising college costs and a rollback \nof the State investment in higher education.\n  We need to get back to the idea that educating Americans is \nfundamentally in our national interest and that we have a shared \nresponsibility--at the Federal, State, local, institutional, and \nindividual levels--for investing in our future. We need to ensure that \nthis generation and future generations have opportunities to develop \ntheir talents and pursue their dreams in order to secure a brighter \nfuture for them and our country.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in providing student loan debt relief \nto millions of Americans. Help us pass the Bank on Students Emergency \nLoan Refinancing Act. Help us relieve this burden of debt on so many \nyoung, middle-aged, and remarkably so--based on recent studies--some \nsenior citizens.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  Let me stress what I think Senator Cardin said so eloquently. We have \nthe opportunity to vote today on a fair shot for everybody to go to \ncollege, so we will ask our colleagues to join us. The rules of the \nSenate are such that even though we have a majority--because our caucus \nis all supporting this effort we have a majority to get this done--if \nthere is an objection, we go into filibuster mode, which takes a \nsupermajority. It is the way the rules are. We know we have a majority \nto pass this bill. If our colleagues don't want to vote for it, that is \nfine, but what we ought to be doing is having the vote.\n  If somebody wants to stand and say this is not important, it is not a \npriority to make sure everyone has a fair shot to be able to go to \ncollege and not be buried in student loan debt, if they want to say \nthey would rather protect those we are asking to help chip in to pay \nfor this, which are millionaires and billionaires who aren't paying \ntheir fair share in taxes right now as middle-class families are asked \nto do--we are paying for this refinancing by closing a loophole that, \nas Warren Buffett said, shouldn't be there when he as a billionaire has \na lower tax rate than his secretary. So we are saying join us to close \nthat loophole. Take those dollars and help 25 million people--25 \nmillion people--be able to cut thousands of dollars off of their \npayments. For me, I am laser focused on the 1 million people in \nMichigan this would help.\n  Let me share a few of those stories. Nathan Collison and his wife \nlive in Saginaw. They are young professionals. They have a combined \nstudent loan debt of $185,000. They have a 3-year-old little girl. I \nwill never forget Nathan saying to me: When she is ready to go to \ncollege, I am still going to be paying off our student loan debt, and I \ncan't afford to put money aside for my little girl to be able to go to \ncollege. That is not right. He and his wife both work and right now \nthey are talking about $600 a month on student loan debts. As Nathan \npointed out to me, that is a house payment. That is a good house in \nSaginaw at $600 a month. Yet it is only a fraction of the interest on \nNathan's loans, which means his debt is going to keep growing and \ngrowing and growing. Just to make his debt stop growing, he would have \nto be paying $2,200 a month. So if he was going to be paying the full \namount and not deferring part of it, it would be $2,200 a month, which \nis a very nice house in Michigan. He would like the ability to do more \nthan just have a nice house. Nathan and his wife would like to put \nmoney aside for their little girl to be able to go to college and to be \nable to invest in their future.\n  So this legislation wouldn't automatically make Nathan's debt go \naway, but it would make it a whole lot easier. If we look at $185,000 \nover a 20-year period, we are talking about tens of thousands--$100,000 \nin savings.\n  So this is very much about having a vote today, the opportunity to \nvote. Our colleagues don't have to vote yes. They don't have to vote \nyes. We are confident we have enough votes to pass this. We just need \nto get through the procedural hurdle, the objections that trigger a \nfilibuster. That is all we are asking for. I think the 1 million \nfamilies and the 1 million people in Michigan and their families, the \n25 million people across the country who are buried in student loan \ndebt deserve a vote. They deserve a vote today.\n\n  We also talk about a young woman from Lambertville, MI. She went to \nmy alma mater, Michigan State University. She graduated in 2008 and was \non the Dean's list.\n  Of course, 2008 was a disastrous year for the economy, nationally and \ncertainly in Michigan, as we saw what happened to auto manufacturing. \nIt was especially brutal for young people looking for work.\n  Even though she graduated among the top in her class, it ended up \ntaking her 4 years to find a job in her field. Today she is only making \nslightly more than minimum wage and trying to figure out how in the \nworld she is going to pay off her student loan debt, let alone proceed \nwith her dreams for the future.\n  Last week I heard from a young man who was originally from Union \nCity, MI. He was working in North Carolina when his father was \ndiagnosed with a terminal illness--brain cancer. He came home--as I'm \nsure his family appreciated--to help care for his father. He was \nshowing the right kind of family values to come home and help care for \nhis dad.\n  During the recession he lost his job in Michigan and was out of work \nfor 2 years, which is why he ended up in North Carolina and ended up in \na low-wage job with no benefits. Now he is back trying to figure out \nhow he can help take care of his dad, figure out a job, and not be \ntotally buried in the debt that he already has.\n  His debt has been turned over to a collection agency and, counting \nthe fees, he now owes $90,000 and counting. He tried to do the right \nthing not only by going to college but for his family.\n  I think about how things have changed over the years--the kind of \nsupport we used to give. One of the great American strengths has been \ncreating opportunity for people to be successful. A lot of that \nopportunity has been in relation to going to college and getting an \neducation.\n  I remember growing up in Clare. When I was going to high school my \ndad was very ill. We didn't have any money for me to go to school. I \nworked very hard. I was at the top of my small class of 93 people, and \nI was in a position to get a tuition and fee scholarship that allowed \nme to go to college.\n  Somebody somewhere thought at that time it was important for some \nredheaded freckle-faced kid they did not know had a shot to make it. \nThat has been what is best about America. Now we have tried. We have \nincreased Pell grants, but certainly they need to be increased much \nmore.\n  We have focused on other areas, and we certainly need to do more. \nWhat we have seen over time is that more of what students have had to \ndo is take student loans. There have been less opportunities for \nscholarships and less opportunities for grants.\n  I am very sorry to say my home State has cut K-12 and higher \neducation. On higher education--and more\n\n[[Page S5613]]\n\nthan in most States--it is in the top ten in student-loan debt and \ncertainly not something I am proud to see happen in my home State of \nMichigan because of what I think have been upside-down values.\n  What we have seen over time is that as the economy is changing, we \nare telling people who are going back to school who lost their job: You \nneed to go back and get the education, the tools, and the skills for \nthe jobs that are available in today's economy.\n  We have new opportunities and a new economy, but it means we have to \nhave new skills. We have to have an education, so students are doing \nthat. They are doing the right thing. They are doing what they have \nbeen told to do. Then they turn around and their only option is loans.\n  They take a look at the fact that somehow student loans are treated \ndifferently than student loan debt. You cannot get the lowest interest \nrates and refinance if you are in the unfortunate situation of going \ninto bankruptcy and can't discharge those loans in bankruptcy such as \nyou can other kinds of debt.\n  I don't understand how we got into a place where somehow student loan \ndebt is with you forever and ever. We don't have the same ability to \nallow people to manage that debt as they do other kinds of debt. But \nthat is where we are in this country. There are cuts at the State level \nand tuition goes up.\n  We then see a situation where more and more people have to turn to \nstudent loans.\n\n  We can do something about that today. There is a lot we can do. I \nsupport doing all that will allow us to get us back to right-size the \nsituation in terms of our values and supporting opportunity for \neducation in our country.\n  One thing we can do right now is to have a vote on this bill. We \ncould immediately see change happen. Put more money back into the \npockets of folks across our great country who have been doing the right \nthing and want a fair shot to make it and the opportunity to have some \nkind of help as they are paying off their student loans.\n  I am so pleased to see our leader and the main author of this \nlegislation join us on the floor. She understands, as we all do, and is \nsomeone that has been dedicated to education and higher education her \nwhole life, advocating for an opportunity for people to be successful \nand have a fair shot.\n  It is my pleasure at this point to turn to the distinguished Senator, \nthe senior Senator from Massachusetts, and support her request as she \nmoves forward this afternoon.\n  I yield for the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I wish to commend all of the incredible \nwork that the Senator from Michigan has done on the ``fair shot'' \nagenda, how she really has been out there working hard for families \nacross this country. For middle-class families, for working families, \nfor people who are just trying to get a fair shot, and on education she \nhas been a tremendous leader. It has been a real privilege to have this \nopportunity to work with the Senator from Michigan. I know the Senator \nfrom Michigan and I are going to keep working on this set of issues.\n  I rise today to urge my colleagues to allow a debate and vote on the \nBank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act. Some 40 million \nAmericans are dealing with student loan debt, and many of them are \ndrowning in it.\n  A quarter of all Federal student loan borrowers are behind on their \npayments. Student loan debt is dragging down our young people, and it \nis dragging down the economy. It is keeping borrowers from buying \nhomes, moving out on their own, buying cars and opening small \nbusinesses.\n  In June the Senate voted on a proposal to allow borrowers to \nrefinance their existing student loans down to the interest rates \noffered to new borrowers. These are the same rates that nearly every \nRepublican in the House and the Senate voted just last summer to offer \nto new borrowers. This refinancing bill would not add a single dime to \nthe deficit. It is fully paid for by closing the tax loophole that \nright now lets millionaires and billionaires pay less in taxes than \nmiddle-class families. The vote on our student loan refinancing \nproposal asks Senators to make a simple choice: protect billionaires \nfrom paying their fair share of taxes or protect student loan borrowers \nwho work hard to get an education and are struggling to stay afloat; \nprotect the billionaires who have already made it big or help young \npeople who are still trying to build a future.\n  A majority of the Senate, including every Democrat, every \nIndependent, and three Republicans sided with students in support of \nmoving forward on this bill, but the rest of the Republicans blocked \nit. We heard a lot of excuses from those that oppose the bill.\n  Some Republicans suggested that the benefit for our young people on \nthis bill is small. I disagree. Putting billions of dollars in Federal \nstudent loan profits back into the pockets of Americans who worked hard \nto get an education is not small. Saving millions of Americans hundreds \nor thousands of dollars a year in excessive student-loan interest \npayments is not small. If the Republicans think the benefit is too \nsmall, then work with us to offer amendments to this bill and give \nstudents a bigger break but don't refuse to even debate the bill.\n  Some Republicans suggested that the $1.2 trillion in outstanding debt \njust isn't a big deal, that we should focus on rising college costs \ninstead. Yes, the rising cost of college is a terrible problem but so \nare the outstanding loans at 6 percent, 8 percent, 10 percent, 12 \npercent, and even higher. We need to fix both problems and not play \nrope-a-dope politics and say we can't fix this because we haven't fixed \nthat yet.\n  Millions of young people are just stuck. They can't buy homes, they \ncan't buy cars, they can't save for retirement, they can't do the \nthings that would help this economy grow--all because they are \nstruggling under the weight of student loan debt.\n  If Senators think we should do more than just refinancing, more to \nimprove college accountability and to reduce the future costs for \nstudents, then work with us to offer amendments, but don't refuse to \neven debate the bill.\n\n  Some Republicans don't like that this proposal is paid for by closing \ntax loopholes. If Senators don't like that, if they have other ideas, \nthen they should offer amendments. But don't refuse to even debate this \nbill.\n  Some Republicans even suggested that Democrats don't want this bill \nto pass. That is just plain ridiculous. Only in Washington can you vote \nagainst something, and then when it doesn't pass, you blame the people \nwho voted for it.\n  These excuses don't fool anyone. They don't fool the hundreds of \nthousands of people who have signed petitions, attended rallies, and \ncalled their Senators asking for a vote on this bill.\n  This is not complicated. Senators can make a choice. It is a choice \nthat raises a fundamental question of who this place works for. Does it \nwork for those who can hire armies of lawyers and lobbyists who want to \nprotect loopholes in the Tax Code to get more advantages for \nmillionaires and billionaires? Does it work for the big banks with \ntheir armies of lobbyists who just want to maximize student loan \nprofits? Does it work for young people who worked hard, who played by \nthe rules, who got an education, and who are trying to build a future \nfor themselves and their families?\n  We are just a few votes away from breaking the Republican filibuster \nand moving forward to debate this bill. I urge my Republican colleagues \nto allow a vote and to let us debate and pass this bill.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 2432\n\n  I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of Calendar No. 409, S. 2432, the Bank on Students \nEmergency Loan Refinancing Act, and the Senate immediately proceed to \nvote on passage of the bill, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I want to \nsay to my colleague from Massachusetts I appreciate her highlighting \nthe importance of student debt in the lives of a lot of our young \npeople who are struggling in this stagnant economy. The best thing we \ncan do is to try to get the economy growing again. But the majority \nleader has chosen not to use the Senate floor for the purpose of \nlegislating. This is the killing field for good bipartisan ideas that \nhave come from the House of Representatives--now\n\n[[Page S5614]]\n\nmore than 380 bills. Unfortunately, the majority leader refuses to take \nup any of those. We stand ready to work with our colleagues across the \naisle on serious legislation through an open and deliberative process \nthat our constituents are demanding. There is a reason why the approval \nrating of the Congress is 14 percent. People look at Washington, DC, \nthese days and realize it is completely broken and nowhere else is it \nmore broken than in the Senate, where Senator Reid has decided to grind \nwhat used to be known as the world's greatest deliberative body to a \nhalt.\n  We will now pass a continuing resolution and adjourn with 47 days \nleft--by the time we do it--until the election.\n  It is really beyond dismay.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senator modify her request, and that \nit be in order for the minority leader or his designee to offer an \namendment, and then for the majority leader or his designee to offer an \namendment, and it be in order for the leaders or their designees to \ncontinue to offer amendments in an alternating fashion. In other words, \nwe would ask for an open amendment process on the legislation that the \nSenator is proposing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from Massachusetts so modify \nher request?\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I thank the \nSenator from Texas for his remarks. As I stated previously, there are \n58 Senators who have supported moving forward to debate this bill. But \nit has not passed the Senate because of a Republican filibuster. I \nwelcome Republican ideas to address the exploding student debt crisis. \nFor months Senator Stabenow, others, and I have reached out to our \ncolleagues to put ideas forward so that we could have a real debate. \nBut allowing an unlimited number of amendments on any topic forever is \nnot a reasonable way forward on a student loan debt refinancing bill.\n  We face a student debt crisis now. We need to act on it now. If my \ncolleague from Texas is not willing to provide a reasonable path \nforward to debate, improve, and vote on this bill, then I object to his \nrequest and ask that he agree to my original request that we take up \nand pass this piece of legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard to modify the request. Is \nthere objection to the original request?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would say that the best way to get this \npiece of legislation resolved on the Senate floor is what used to be \ncalled the old-fashioned way. That is where both sides of the aisle get \nto offer amendments and vote on them. But this is what has happened to \nthe Senate. It has become completely dysfunctional. Frankly, the \nAmerican people are disgusted with all of us because they see us \nunable, even when Republicans and Democrats would like to debate \nlegislation and offer solutions, to be able to do so.\n  This is solely within the control of the majority leader, Senator \nReid. He has decided it is better to shut things down than to pass \nlegislation which both sides of the aisle would like to see pass. So I \nwould object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, what is dysfunctional is a Republican \nfilibuster of a bill on which 58 Senators want to move forward and \ndebate. Allowing an unlimited number of amendments on any topic, going \non forever, is not a reasonable way forward. We want to be able to \ndebate the student loan refinancing bill. We want to be able to do it \nnow. Young people are struggling and are counting on us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I appreciate the great talents and \ncredentials that the Senator from Massachusetts brings to the Senate. \nUnfortunately, whether one is in the majority or in the minority, the \nSenate has not been able to function for the last 4 years. I have been \nfortunate to be in the Senate at a time when any Senator who wanted to \ncould come to the floor and offer an amendment and get a vote on that \namendment.\n  What to me is completely ironic is even if you are in the majority, \nyou cannot get a vote on an amendment--if you are in the majority. How \ndo you explain that to your constituents back home--that you were \nrendered completely ineffective because of the way the Senate is being \noperated under the current majority leader. I want to turn to another \ntopic briefly, and that is the matter of the President's proposed \nstrategy on the floor.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Out of respect to my colleague, I realize we are going \ninto the next hour that is controlled by the Republicans. But I did \nwant to take 1 minute to wrap up, if that is acceptable to my \ncolleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I just wanted to go on record to say there are \nthousands of excuses always on everything for reasons not to do things. \nWe are talking about a very specific bill, a very specific vote that \nwould put money in the pockets of 25 million Americans. We could do \nthat right now. People can have lots of reasons. It reminds me a lot of \nhearing that my kids have hundreds of excuses about why they cannot do \nsomething, whether it is because of somebody else or this, that, and \nthe other.\n  I think the American people just want us to get stuff done. We want \nto get things done. The motion that Senator Warren put forward is about \ngetting things done. A vast majority--58 Senators--has already said \nyes, they want to move forward. Yes, they will vote yes. We need to get \nthis piece done to help 25 million people and then move on and work \nwith each other across the aisle to do other work.\n  I greatly regret the objection and indicate that we will be back and \nback and back until we get the American people the relief they need.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I appreciate the frustration of the \nSenator from Michigan at the Senate not functioning the way it should. \nBut really her complaint ought to be with the majority leader. \nRepublicans are happy to have an open amendment process. I say to the \nSenator from Massachusetts that we are not talking about amendments ad \ninfinitum. We are talking about a reasonable amount of amendments. We \nhave been down this lane before. We know that the majority leader rules \nthis body with an iron grip. In the waning days now of this session, \nthere is going to be veritably nothing done, because, of course, that \nis the way the majority leader has chosen to use his authority. It \nwould make sense if we had an opportunity to offer House legislation. \nAs I said, there are 44 different jobs bills and more than 385 \nbipartisan pieces of legislation that have passed the House which would \nbe great for us to take up and to work our way through in an orderly \nand deliberative sort of way.\n  I agree the American people want to see us get things done. But they \ncannot. We cannot get things done when the majority leader essentially \nsays: You know what. It is my way or the highway. Those of you who are \nelected from red States, where you are elected by Republicans, you \ncannot participate in this process. So what is the use of being elected \nto the Senate? What is the use of States such as Texas having two \nSenators and not being able to participate or shape the legislative \nprocess? That is an unreasonable demand by the majority leader.\n  I know our colleagues on the Democratic side, many of them, are \nfrustrated by that too. I will tell them that if this election in 49 \ndays turns out the way I hope it does, we will have a new Senate where \nRepublicans and Democrats can come to the floor, offer amendments, and \nget votes as long as they want to get votes on amendments. That used to \nbe the way the Senate operated. That is not the way it operates now. It \nis really a disservice to the American people. I am saddened by the \nmajority leader's choice to create such a situation in the Senate.\n\n\n                                  ISIL\n\n  We will be voting, along with the continuing resolution--I am told \nthe House will add an authorization that has been requested by the \nPresident to train and arm some Syrian rebels, which we hope will be an \neffective force in defeating ISIS or ISIL, the Islamic State in the \nLevant. This is a group that Al Qaeda kicked out because they were so \nbarbaric that they wanted nothing to do with them. They are now one of \nthe best financed terrorist organizations in the world, now occupying\n\n[[Page S5615]]\n\nvast swaths of Iraq and Syria, and virtually erasing the border between \nthose two countries. This is a threat not only to the region and to the \npeople of Iraq and Syria, but it is a threat to other countries in that \nregion.\n  If you believe the King of Saudi Arabia, he said in a month they will \nexport their terror to Europe, and they will then, a month later, \nexport their terror to the United States. The biggest threat to the \nUnited States is there are--people who have gone from the United States \nand from the United Kingdom to the region and trained as fighters for \nISIL.\n  The problem is that because of the Visa Waiver Program, many of \nthem--if you are a passport holder from the United States or the United \nKingdom, you can come back to the United States with just a passport \nand you do not even need a visa. So this is an opportunity for this \nterrorist organization to infiltrate the United States and threaten our \nnational security and safety.\n  But in particular in Syria, it is ironic--indeed, it is tragic to \nnote--that after refusing for 3\\1/2\\ years to provide even moderate \nassistance to opposition groups in Syria, President Obama is now asking \nCongress to give him the necessary authorization. Now, this is not an \nauthorization to take the fight to degrade and destroy ISIL. The \nPresident said that is his military goal. That is an important goal. I \nagree with that. I think he would find a lot of support on a bipartisan \nbasis for that kind of authorization. What the President has done is \nbasically to ask for money for a very much more limited task; that is, \nto recruit and train so-called moderate Syrian opposition to fight ISIL \nin Syria.\n  But he has chosen to go it alone once again on this broader effort to \ndegrade and destroy ISIL. I know the President is famous for saying \nwhat he will not do. Of course, they always add: No American boots on \nthe ground. But this morning the chief of the U.S. military, General \nDempsey has said if the air campaign is unsuccessful in degrading or \ndestroying ISIL, then we should not take the prospect of some limited \nnumber of American boots on the ground off the table. Military expert \nafter military expert has said: Air strikes alone will not turn the \ntide on ISIL in Iraq and Syria.\n  But I am glad the President has at least made this limited request. \nWe ought to have a broader debate about his authority to take the fight \nto ISIL in Syria and Iraq. I note with interest that our colleague \nSenator Kaine of Virginia wrote what I thought was a compelling piece, \narguing that the President should come to the Congress for that \nauthority. That was published in the New York Times today. I thought he \nmade a very important case.\n  If the President is concerned that he will come to Congress and he \nwill not get the authority, I think circumstances have changed to where \nhe would get that sort of bipartisan vote to give him authority. There \nare prudential or practical reasons why he should do so. First of all, \nthere is the Constitution which the President seems not to care most \nabout. But assuming the President has the authority, I think if he came \nto Congress, it would provide a broader basis of support both in \nCongress and across the country.\n  Of course, you do not want to go to war without the support of the \nAmerican people. If you believe the public opinion polls, I think they \nare pretty persuasive that the American people do support air strikes \nagainst ISIL, particularly in the wake of these barbaric beheadings of \nboth British and American citizens. But as we know, the tide of war can \nturn very quickly. It is important that the President have broader \nsupport here in Congress and broad support from the American people in \ndoing what we know we have to do regardless of how popular or unpopular \nit may be.\n  But I do have questions about how the different rebel groups will be \nvetted and how the U.S. military aid will advance our larger policy of \ndestroying ISIL. While I still have those questions, I will support the \nauthority and the money to train and equip the moderate groups as part \nof our broader strategy.\n  I remain deeply concerned, though, about President Obama's \nunderstanding--or lack of understanding--of just what has gone so wrong \nwith his policies in the Middle East. After all, the first step in \nfixing a mistake is to admit you have made one--not for the purpose of \nembarrassing the President but learning from those mistakes and then \ngoing on to correct them.\n  Last week he discussed his foreign policy record with a number of \noutside analysts at two separate meetings. According to one story in \nthe New York Times by Peter Baker, the President ``admitted no errors \nalong the way.'' It is pretty breathtaking. I do not know any human \nbeing, any mere mortal--certainly me--who has not made a mistake. These \nare enormously complex judgments, and I understand that, and we ought \nto cut the President some slack in trying to execute this war and this \nfight to degrade and dismantle ISIS. But to say ``I have not made any \nmistakes. My judgments have been perfect'' is not helpful. He said \nthere are no errors. He has made no errors. There is nothing that needs \ncorrecting, no change of conditions because of misjudgments.\n  But we know that despite the creation of a massive terrorist enclave \nspanning Iraq and Syria, despite the explosion of a huge refugee crisis \nin Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey--millions of Syrians have been \ndisplaced by the civil war there alone, along with about 200,000 \nSyrians who have lost their lives. As a result of the President's \npolicies, we have also seen the emergence of a failed state in Libya, \nwhere in September 2012 four Americans were killed by Al Qaeda-related \naffiliates. We have seen the emergence of yet another failed state in \nYemen, and we have seen the embarrassing decline of U.S. influence in \ncountries such as Egypt and other gulf nations. Despite all that, the \nPresident says he had not made any mistakes and it is somebody else's \nfault and not his.\n  I would contrast that with the conduct of President George W. Bush \nwhen he announced the troop surge in Iraq and the counterinsurgency \nstrategy in 2007. He was admirably forthright about the fact that his \nIraq policy was not working--and, indeed, it was not. President Bush \nsaid at the time, ``We need to change our strategy in Iraq.''\n  Boy, it would be a breath of fresh air if President Obama would say, \n``We need to change our strategy'' rather than saying, ``I have not \nmade any mistakes. There have been no misjudgments. We don't need to \nreconsider any of our activities abroad.'' I think people understand we \ndo.\n  When we look at America's Middle East policy failures under President \nObama, it is painfully clear that once again we need to change our \nstrategy, but by refusing to acknowledge his mistakes, the President \nraises troubling questions about the credibility of his new policies.\n  Despite announcing that the military aid to the more moderate rebels \nwill now be the centerpiece of U.S. policy in Syria, the President \nstill publicly rejects the idea that arming those rebels a few years \nago would have been a good idea. And, oh, by the way, arming the rebels \na few years ago was the recommendation of all of his most significant \nnational security advisers, but the President rejected it.\n  If it is a good idea to arm the more moderate rebels today in hopes \nof countering ISIL, then surely it would have been a good idea to arm \nthose rebels before ISIL took over large portions of eastern Syria and \n200,000 Syrians lost their lives in that civil war. Likewise, if we are \nnow sending U.S. military forces back to Iraq to conduct bombing raids \nagainst ISIL terrorists based there, then surely it was a mistake to \nwithdraw all U.S. forces from Iraq back in 2011 without leaving a \ntransitional force there to help be the glue in that famously \nsectarian-driven part of the world. But the President will admit no \nmistakes and no lessons learned in either Iraq or Syria.\n  Of course, the thing about acknowledging your mistakes, as I said \nearlier, is that you can learn from them, and President Obama's recent \nforeign policy failures are no different. The lessons we have learned \ncan and should inform our strategy against ISIL. But first the \nPresident needs to accept, internalize, and then allow himself to be \nguided by those lessons. If he does that, America's military campaign \nagainst the Islamic State will have a much better chance of succeeding.\n\n[[Page S5616]]\n\n  I would say again that we want the President's plan to be successful. \nI think it is virtually universal here in the Senate that we want our \nmilitary, in conjunction with our coalition partners, to degrade and \ndestroy ISIL because we believe it is a serious threat not just to the \nregion but to the United States and our allies and our interests. But \nif the President will not learn from the lessons of the past, if he \nwill not work with Congress to come up with an effective strategy, and \nif he will not listen to his own military leaders and experts, I am \nvery concerned that strategy will end up being a failure, and that need \nnot be.\n  Mr. President, I see my colleague from North Dakota on the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                  Tribal General Welfare Exclusion Act\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair for the opportunity to \nspeak this afternoon. I am also pleased to see on the floor my \ncolleague from North Dakota, Senator Heitkamp. She and I have a \nlegislative interest in a matter now pending before the House of \nRepresentatives, and it is at least my desire to see the Senate utilize \nthis opportunity of a bill passing the House to also be considered by \nthe Senate and hopefully be approved. While it has been a challenge \nthroughout this year and throughout this session to get legislation to \nthe floor and voted on, I would not want us to pass up the chance for \nthis legislation to be approved and sent to the President for \nsignature.\n  The legislation we are speaking about is the Tribal General Welfare \nExclusion Act. The House of Representatives, as I said, is considering \nH.R. 3043 this week. This is legislation I am absolutely certain will \nenhance the economic opportunities and the quality of life for our \nNative Americans in this country.\n  The Constitution states that a core responsibility of the Federal \nGovernment is to promote the general welfare of the people. The Federal \nGovernment has a trust responsibility to protect tribal interests. \nThese two objectives come together in this legislation. It certainly \nwould be an understatement to say that the Federal Government over the \nyears has fulfilled its trust responsibility. We know that to not be \nthe case.\n  In an effort to fill that void, tribal governments have taken actions \nto meet their tribal members' needs with initiatives such as cultural \nprograms and education and social services and health care.\n  Unfortunately, over a period of time, those benefits have been \ntreated as income and those benefits have been subject to the Internal \nRevenue Service Code.\n  We need to make certain we don't add to the burden that tribes too \noften have encountered from the Federal Government and that these \nbenefits would not be subject to income taxes and these benefits and \nthe tribes will not be subject to IRS audits because of them.\n  The Tribal General Welfare Exclusion Act extends to Native Americans \nthe same tax privileges that are provided by our States; namely, that \nthe value of government services provided by the tribes to their \nmembers, just like the services provided by a State to its citizens, \nwould be excluded for tax purposes. Federal and State governments have \nenjoyed the privilege of having such services as education, social \nwelfare, health care programs, housing, as well as cultural programs \nexempt from that taxation. Native Americans have not been as fortunate.\n  The House is close to correcting this problem, and it is my plea and \nhope that the Senate will follow suit this week. The IRS recently \nissued a notice that establishes the tribal gender welfare exclusion. \nIt is a matter of treasury policy, and this is appreciated. It is a \nstep in the right direction, but we want to make certain that this \npolicy is extended and codified.\n\n  The general welfare issue should be put into law to protect against \nfuture policy changes, and among other provisions this legislation \nestablishes a tribal advisory committee within the Department of the \nTreasury to advise the Secretary on Indian tax policy and also declares \nthat any ambiguities of the act will be resolved in favor of tribal \ngovernments. It directs the IRS field agents to be educated and trained \nin matters of Federal Indian law and government trust responsibilities.\n  This is a reasonable commonsense, constitutional piece of \nlegislation. It fosters fairness within our Tax Code and promotes \nbetter understanding of the Federal Government's trust relationships.\n  Four years ago similar exclusion rules for Native Americans' health \nbenefits were passed. We have before us now the opportunity to clarify \nthe exclusion as it should be. This legislation makes a lot of sense. \nIt adheres to the Constitution which recognizes tribes as sovereign \nnations with the authority to provide for their peoples. This has been \naffirmed many times by Congress in the past. It is clearly part of our \nU.S. Constitution.\n  The economic benefits are obvious. Our tribal territories, \nreservations, our Native Americans need not be worrying about the \nonerous IRS audits and should not be paying taxes when no one else is \nrequired to pay taxes on similar benefits.\n  This legislation is revenue neutral, something that is very pleasing. \nThe Joint Committee on Taxation has deemed any impact on the revenue of \nour Federal Government to be negligible.\n  As a person who cares a lot about the fiscal condition of our \ncountry, we ought to be reducing our deficit and boosting our economy. \nThis piece of legislation does not increase the deficit, and it does \nboost the economy, particularly of tribes across the Nation. Here in \nthe Senate, Senator Heitkamp and I introduced S. 1507. It is a \ncompanion bill to the one the House is considering. This piece of \nlegislation has broad bipartisan support, and more\n\n[[Page S5617]]\n\nthan 20 Senators from Alaska to Georgia have joined us in this effort.\n  I am grateful for the members of the Finance Committee and the Indian \nAffairs Committee who lent their support to this legislation. I am not \na member of either one of those committees, but there are four tribes \nin Kansas and I have an interest in their well-being as well as that of \nall Native Americans.\n  Native Americans are not seeking to play here by different rules. In \nfact, it is quite the opposite. They simply want to enjoy the same \nbenefits accorded any other government in our country. They emphasize \nto me the principle of tribal sovereignty and self-government. This \nlegislation reinforces those principles.\n  More than 40 tribes in 24 states, nearly a dozen Indian organizations \nand a number of regional tribal organizations representing tens of \nthousands of Native Americans supported this legislation. It is not \njust Native Americans. In fact, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has \nrecognized this legislation as one that will foster economic \ndevelopment and supports its passage.\n  As we are preparing to depart Washington, DC, and take time away from \nthe Nation's Capital, it would be a terrible mistake on our part and a \nmissed opportunity if we don't take advantage of House action this week \nwhile the Senate is here in session this week to see that this \nlegislation is approved.\n  My hope is that this could be accomplished by unanimous consent, and \nI know Senator Heitkamp and others and I have been talking to members \nof the committees as well as the leadership of the Senate to see that \nwe accomplish this.\n  It is a wrong that can be righted. It is a wrong that should be \nrighted quickly and not at a later date. This certainly is one of those \npieces of legislation that is a win-win for all.\n  If we see the House pass the Tribal General Welfare Exclusion Act, I \nurge my colleagues to join with me, Senator Heitkamp, and Republican \nand Democrat Senators who are supportive of this legislation, to see \nthat this legislation arrives on the President's desk in the most \nexpedient manner possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I ask to speak as if in morning \nbusiness.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, it is truly a great honor to stand with \nmy colleague from Kansas as we are on the cusp of actually passing \nlegislation that has consequences for a lot of our American citizens \nand especially our Native American citizens. I will tell you as someone \nwho represents Indian Country in my State, this is the number one \npriority for our tribes.\n  It is interesting because a lot of people would look at this and say: \nWhy this issue? I think it goes to the heart of Native American \nsovereignty. What has been happening, as it relates to 1099s and the \npotential of taxing services provided by tribal governments, basically \nbegs the question: Do we really understand or do we really appreciate \nthat these are sovereign governments--the same way the States are \nsovereign and the same way the counties and cities would be sovereign?\n  I think in many ways it has very real economic consequences, but a \ngreat value in this legislation is in the symbolic consequences of \nhaving this body recognize the importance of recognizing these treaty \nrights, recognizing the value of treaties and trust responsibilities. \nAs a former attorney general and as a lawyer, I view treaty rights and \ntrust responsibilities like a contract between the United States and \nour Native American tribes. As a U.S. citizen, I view these treaties as \nsacred obligations.\n  We have not done a good enough job living up to our commitments to \ntribal nations. As a consequence tribal governments have been forced to \nsupplement services that the Federal Government promised to provide. \nYet for years the IRS has audited Indian tribes for providing health \ncare, education or housing assistance for those in need.\n  Here are just some of the stories I have heard from Native Americans \nin North Dakota and across the country. I have heard about the IRS \nwanting the tribes to issue 1099s--basically saying you have something \nof taxable value--to tribal elders who received blankets as honoraria \nfor performing traditional ceremonies.\n  I heard about the IRS questioning a tribal government's provision \nproviding backpacks and school supplies to elementary school children \nas a taxable benefit to the families of the children.\n  I have heard about the IRS imposing a tax on the value of a handicap \nramp--a value of $2,000--erected by the tribal government to help a \ntribal elder access her home.\n  The stories go on. The status quo isn't fair and it isn't right. This \npractice certainly does not fully respect that tribes are governments. \nThat is why I joined with Senator Moran to introduce the bipartisan \nTribal General Welfare Exclusion Act last year.\n  The bill would fully recognize that Indian tribes, as sovereign \nnations, are responsible for making certain government programs and \nservices best fit the needs of their citizens. Just as State and local \ngovernments are determined to decide what is in the best interest of \ntheir citizens, such as scholarships, elder or child care or housing \nassistance, we have to recognize that tribal governments have the right \nto make those decisions without tax consequences.\n  With this bill, we are supporting tribal self-determination and \ntaking a step towards living up to our trust and treaty obligations. \nIndian tribes and their members should not be subject to heightened IRS \nscrutiny.\n  I think Senator Moran outlined that issue so well because some people \nmay see that what we are doing here is carving out an exception, \ncreating an extra benefit for tribal members that is not enjoyed by the \nentire citizenry of this country.\n  Nothing could be further than the truth. In fact, we are leveling the \nplaying field. The Tribal General Welfare Exclusion Act will bring \nparity in the tax treatment of Indian governments. It will recognize \nthe unique relationship with tribal governments that they have with \ntheir citizens and allow them the opportunity to craft programs which \nbest fit their community need.\n  I want to take a moment and suggest to all of you that if you spent \ntime in Indian Country and if you have looked at the benefits that \ntribal governments provide and you think about the resources of the IRS \nand where you might go to actually collect dollars that would enhance \nrevenue, the last place you should look in this country is in Indian \nCountry.\n  I would like to address a few other really important reasons why this \nbill is so critical. The IRS recently issued helpful guidance, and we \nare very appreciative of that work. With that being said, we also must \nmake sure that parity provided by that guidance is in statutory \nlanguage. That way, we weighed in. There is certainty that no one can \ndo a look-back and no one can change it without that change coming to \nthis body and coming to the House of Representatives and being enacted \ninto law.\n  In addition, the Tribal General Welfare Exclusion Act includes two \nitems that are critical to the advancement of a better relationship \nbetween tribal governments and the Federal Government.\n  First as a training requirement, we must make sure that IRS field \nagents are well versed in Federal Indian law and unique treaty and \ntrust relationships that the Federal Government has with their tribes.\n  Second, as the training is taking place, our bill also suspends all \naudits of examination of tribal governments for one year to allow this \neducation to take place.\n\n  It isn't rare for Congress to pass legislation that supports guidance \nissued by the Federal agencies to give more weight to the issues and \nmake sure that there is no potential misinterpretation.\n  That is what we are doing this week with the help of a lot of our \ncolleagues who believe in this legislation as well. We want to \nsupplement the IRS guidance to expand rather than restrict the safe \nharbor provisions.\n  When I joined the Senate, I promised to be a partner--to honor and \nrespect the sovereign rights of Native Americans just as I always have. \nThis bill is a step in the right direction. I fully anticipate that as \nwe move forward this week, we will, in fact, enact this legislation. I \nfully anticipate that we will\n\n[[Page S5618]]\n\nsend the right message to tribal governments that we see you the way \nyou are.\n  You are a sovereign government entitled to make the decisions that \nyou need to make to the benefit of your citizens without undue and \nirrational interference from the IRS.\n  I think the bipartisan nature of this bill is a tribute to my friend \nfrom Kansas who understands completely what we are attempting to do. It \nis one of those rare moments that I have had since I have been in the \nSenate, where you see a good bill being debated--a good bill being \ndiscussed--and then having an opportunity to actually do the right \nthing. I thank my friend from Kansas for the opportunity to join with \nhim as a cosponsor of this legislation.\n  It is critically important that this message get sent and that we \nhave an opportunity in the future to continue to work with tribal \ngovernments to act in the best interests of tribal citizens and provide \nthe services that are essential for a growing population of Native \nAmerican citizens but also of a population that lives in a great deal \nof poverty.\n  I thank my friend from Kansas. I look forward to seeing this bill \nsigned into law--which I think will happen. I think that the stars are \naligning. It will be a great day and a very important step in securing \na better relationship of all governments with the Native American \npeople.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, tomorrow we will mark Constitution Day--a \nday set aside to reflect on our Nation's charter and how it has shaped \nwhat it means to be American. On September 17, 1787, George Washington, \nJames Madison, and their fellow Framers made the momentous decision to \nsign the Constitution and send it along to the American people for \nratification marking a new beginning in our Nation's profound \nexperiment in democracy.\n  As important as the original charter continues to be, the Founders \ndid not design it to be immutable. One of its most notable features is \narticle 5, which established the process for improvement in the form of \nconstitutional amendments. This key provision rooted in both \nintellectual humility and constitutional faith--ensured that our \nNation's constitutional journey would not conclude in Philadelphia in \n1787. Instead, it would continue to unfold in the decades and centuries \nthat followed, tasking each generation of Americans with improving the \ncharter in order to build ``a more perfect Union.''\n  Since the ratification of the Bill of Rights in 1791, our \nConstitution has been amended 17 times. These changes have helped to \nmake the Constitution the revered document it is today. As I have noted \non previous Constitution Days, Americans must celebrate not just the \noriginal Constitution of Washington, Madison, and the founding \ngeneration, but the whole Constitution, including its 27 amendments. \nThis is all the more important as we approach a key set of \nanniversaries--the 150th anniversaries of the 13th, 14th, and 15th \nAmendments, which many scholars have rightly described as our nation's \n``Second Founding.''\n  Ratified by President Lincoln and his generation after the Civil War, \nthese Second Founding amendments transformed our original charter--\nending slavery, banning racial discrimination in voting, and elevating \nliberty and equality to a central place in our constitutional order. \nPerhaps most importantly, these amendments gave Congress the authority \nit needed to protect the civil rights of all Americans--authority that \nwe have used to pass landmark civil rights laws such as the Voting \nRights Act of 1965.\n  Before our Nation marked the original Constitution's bicentennial in \n1987, Congress established a commission led by Chief Justice Burger to \norganize a national celebration. Americans from across the political \nspectrum came together in a spirit of unity and pride to honor the \nfounding generation's profound achievements. With the 150th anniversary \nof the second founding, President Lincoln and his generation deserve \nthe same.\n  It is deeply saddening to me that the anniversary of the 13th, 14th, \nand 15th Amendments coincides not with such a celebration, however, but \nwith what can be called nothing short of an attack on the principles of \nequality and liberty they protect. The Supreme Court's decision in \nShelby County v. Holder and the wave of recent State laws undermining \nthe right to vote demonstrate a dangerous erosion of these monumental \nAmendments that provide us the tools we need to build a fairer, freer, \nand more equal society.\n  Tomorrow, as we celebrate the signing of our Constitution 227 years \nago, I hope we also reflect on the unfinished work ahead that is \nnecessary to live up to the core principles enshrined in our Nation's \ncharter--including those of the second founding. The racial tensions \nexposed by the police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, MO are not \nnew, but they should serve as a clear reminder that our work is not \ndone. I am heartened by the national dialogue that has been sparked by \nthat young man's tragic death, and it is my sincere hope that we can \nharness that energy, directing it not toward greater distrust and \ndivide but toward meeting the challenge to build ``a more perfect \nUnion'' left to us by our Founders.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/16/senate-section/article/S5618-3", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5618-S5619]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE LAKE MEAD NATIONAL RECREATION AREA\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 50th \nanniversary of the Lake Mead National Recreation Area.\n  In the early 1900s, the populations of Nevada, southern California, \nand Arizona were beginning to grow. New communities were in need of \nwater for irrigation, electrical power, and a way to control the \nseasonal flooding of the mighty Colorado River. On December 21, 1928, \nPresident Calvin Coolidge signed the Boulder Canyon Project Act, which \nauthorized funds for three dam projects along the Lower Colorado River, \nthe largest of which became the Hoover Dam, and this monumental dam \ncreated our Nation's largest reservoir, Lake Mead.\n  On October 8, 1964, 18 years after the completion of the Hoover Dam, \nthe Lake Mead national recreation area was established, making it the \nfirst National Recreation Area in the country. Since its founding, Lake \nMead has become essential to Southern Nevada. The reservoir supplies \nlocal communities with drinking water, provides low-cost electricity \nthroughout the Southwest, and is a beacon for outdoor recreation, which \nattracts millions of dollars annually to local and regional economies. \nIn 2013, the Lake Mead National Recreation Area visitors contributed \n$260 million to communities surrounding the lake, and this helped \nsupport approximately 3,000 jobs in the area.\n  Today, Lake Mead is one of the most popular destinations in America, \nwith more than 6 million visitors every year. Lake Mead boasts more \nthan 900 plant and 500 animal species, 24 of which are threatened or \nendangered. Within the national recreation area, there are 9 wilderness \nareas that help support the rehabilitation of these important species \nand over 1,300 recorded archeological sites that tell the story of the \nregion's rich cultural heritage. In addition to the area's many hiking \ntrails, Lake Mead also has several boat marinas and the Black Canyon \nWater Trail, which was recently dedicated as Nevada's first National \nWater Trail by the Secretary of the Interior.\n  I recognize Guy Edwards, Robert Rose, Ben Thompson, George Baggley, \nCharles Richey, Roger Allin, Glen Bean, William Briggle, Gary Bunney,\n\n[[Page S5619]]\n\nAlan O'Neill, and William Dickinson, the past and current \nsuperintendents of the Lake Mead Nation Recreation Area.

John \nJorgensen has devoted his life to promoting education, literacy, and \nthe arts. This November he will be honored with the Benefactor Award \nfrom the Council for Resource Development. According to the CRD, the \nBenefactor Award ``recognizes individuals . . . for outstanding \ncontributions to community colleges. The CRD Benefactor Award embodies \nthe ideals of philanthropy, leadership, and volunteerism in the service \nof community, technical, and junior colleges.'' The Council only honors \na handful of people each year, and I am delighted that John Jorgensen \nwill receive this prestigious award.\n  John is no stranger to hard work. His ties to the community are \nnumerous. In addition to serving as the president of Casper's Hilltop \nNational Bank, John is also the president of the Casper College \nFoundation. During 25 years in this important role, he has tripled the \nfoundation's assets. Under John's leadership the foundation has \nprovided more than $70 million to the college for support of campus \nfacilities, college programs, and student scholarships. The funds have \nprovided a margin of excellence that ensures Casper College continues \nto be one of the finest community colleges in the country.\n  Casper College is just one of many organizations benefitting from \nJohn's time and talents. He leads Wyoming Reads, an organization \ncreated in his late wife Sue's memory that puts books into the hands of \nnearly every Wyoming first grader. He has served on the Natrona County \nPublic Library Foundation and the Nicolaysen Art Museum board. John is \na member of the Casper Rotary Club. He has a passion for the performing \narts and has acted in a number of Casper College's plays, including the \n``Grapes of Wrath'' and ``Death of a Salesman.''\n  John Jorgensen is an example of what makes America great. He has \nchanneled his blessings and his heartbreaks into organizations that \nhelp others. Casper and Wyoming are even greater because of his \ncontributions. My wife Bobbi joins me in congratulating John on \nreceiving this special award from the Council for Resource Development. \nWe are blessed to call him our friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/16/senate-section/article/S5619-3", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5619-S5620]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE WEXNER CENTER FOR THE ARTS\n\n Mr. PORTMAN.

The exhibits, \nperformances, and educational programs at the Wexner Center achieve \nthis mission and effectively promote the importance of art throughout \nour Columbus region.\n  On July 5, 1985, the architectural design by Peter Eisenman and \nRichard Trott was selected from a competition of six designs and paid \nhomage to the Ohio State Armory, which formerly occupied the space. The \nWexner Center opened its doors to the public on November 5, 1989 and \nover the past quarter century has served as an exhibition space for all \ntypes of art.\n  Today, the Wexner Center features many exhibits and programs each \nyear\n\n[[Page S5620]]\n\nand is home to The Ohio State University Fine Arts Library. The center \nwelcomes visiting artists to Ohio State and Columbus from around the \nworld.

Mr. President, I wish to mark the 225th \nanniversary of the United States Marshals Service. As America's oldest \nlaw enforcement agency, the U.S. Marshals Service has played a unique \nrole in our history, serving our Nation in a variety of ways since \n1789. In their 225 years of service, U.S. Marshals have been \nresponsible for protecting the Federal judicial process, securing \nFederal facilities, and ensuring the safety of court officials: U.S. \nMarshals are also tasked with a number of law enforcement activities \nthat keep our Nation safe and our judicial proceedings secure on a \ndaily basis.\n  Operating in over 94 Federal court districts, U.S. Marshals serve \nwith nearly 4,000 Deputy U.S. Marshals and criminal investigators to \nform the backbone of the agency. All of these individuals have provided \na great service to our Nation by carrying out the dangerous and \nextraordinary missions asked of them by Congress, the President, and \nGovernors.\n  The first U.S. Marshal for the Colorado Territory was appointed by \nPresident Lincoln and began his service on March 25, 1861. Today, the \nmen and women of the U.S. Marshals Service for the District of Colorado \nmaintain their core mission to serve and protect our Federal judiciary. \nIn doing so, the Marshals ensure the survival of one of our Nation's \nmost fundamental democratic principles--the Rule of Law. Marshals \ncontinually work together with other Federal, State and local law \nenforcement agencies to create safer cities and communities around the \nNation.\n  On this anniversary, we must not forget to honor those Marshals who \nsacrificed their lives in pursuit of justice, integrity, and service. \nTheir legacy of bravery continues with U.S. Marshals serving today. It \nis my privilege to mark this 225 year milestone with these outstanding \nand noble Americans. We are greatly indebted to all U.S. Marshals for \ntheir service to our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/16/senate-section/article/S5620-2", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5620]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n       25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 160TH SOAR OF HUNTER ARMY AIRFIELD\n\n Mr. CHAMBLISS.

Supporting \nOperation Just Cause in Panama, Desert Shield and Desert Storm in the \nPersian Gulf, and multiple operations in support of crisis management \nprepared them for their most challenging mission of all, the global war \non terrorism.\n  Over the last 13 years, their battalion of MH-47 Chinooks and MH-60 \nBlack Hawks have been continuously deployed in support of Operations \nEnduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom and New Dawn, and throughout the world \non numerous unnamed and often unknown missions.\n  In 2013, the unit flew over 8,000 flying hours in support of ongoing \ncombat operations and training missions to support the special \noperations community and our allies, including over 4,300 under night \nvision.\n  Through fiscal management and lean logistics, the battalion has \ncontinued to refine the processes enabling a leaner sustainment package \nwhile still maintaining effectiveness in every environment in which the \nbattalion's aircraft operate.\n  The 160th continues to be at the forefront of Army aviation and \nforeign internal defense aviation support to our allies.\n  In tribute to its outstanding service during wartime, its important \nrole in strengthening the security of this Nation, and its support to \nthe special operations community, I am honored today to recognize the \n160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment and its contributions to the \nUnited States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/16/senate-section/article/S5620-3", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5620]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         TRIBUTE TO GEORGE LONG AND THE MONTFORD POINT MARINES\n\n Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I wish today to honor George Long \nof Vicksburg, MS, a World War II veteran to whom I had the pleasure of \npresenting the Congressional Gold Medal during the August recess.\n  Just months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, 16-year-old \nGeorge Long bravely volunteered to serve in the U.S. Marine Corps. He \nwas one of the African-American recruits who volunteered for service \nafter President Roosevelt signed an Executive order in 1942 lifting a \nprohibition against their enlistment.\n  Mr. Long is part of a group of American warriors known as the \nMontford Point Marines--those African-American recruits assigned to the \nsegregated basic training facility at Montford Point, adjacent to Camp \nLejune, NC.\n  Given the magnitude of the threat our country faced in Europe and the \nPacific, President Roosevelt recognized that the status quo of Jim Crow \nsegregation, which at that time prohibited African Americans from \nserving in the U.S. Armed Forces, would not suffice. In 1941, he signed \nthe historic Executive Order 8802, which required the military to \naccept recruits regardless of race, creed, color, or national origin. \nThis action would later become a crucial component of the landmark \nCivil Rights Act of 1964 and help bring an end to segregation in the \nUnited States.\n  Approximately 20,000 African-American marines received basic training \nat Montford Point, before the Marine Corps became fully integrated in \n1949. Of those, about 13,000 would serve overseas during World War II. \nThese marines fought valiantly in the fiercest battles of the Pacific \nisland hopping campaign, as allied forces reversed the tide of Imperial \nexpansion. Mr. Long notably served as a guard for Japanese prisoners of \nwar during the legendary Battle of Iwo Jima, where ``uncommon valor was \na common virtue.''\n  On November 11, 2011, legislation was enacted granting the \nCongressional Gold Medal to the Montford Point Marines. This honor--the \nhighest civilian award in the United States--was bestowed on these \ncourageous veterans for their brave and honorable service to our \ncountry, despite segregation and other prejudices that were common at \nthe time.\n  Due to his health, George Long was unable to attend a ceremony at the \nU.S. Capitol in June 2012 where the Congressional Gold Medal was \npresented to some 370 of the estimated 420 remaining Montford Point \nveterans. I am grateful that his daughter Felicia Hawkins and friend \nSteve Houston worked with my office to ensure that Mr. Long eventually \nreceived the medal.\n  It was an honor to present the Congressional Gold Medal to George \nLong on August 5 at the G.V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery Veterans Medical \nCenter in Jackson in recognition of his contributions to our country. \nMr. Long and all the Montford Point Marines will be remembered as \ntrailblazers who bravely helped protect our Nation from foreign threats \nand helped improve our society by bringing about change within our \nmilitary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/16/senate-section/article/S5620-4", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5620-S5621]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               REMEMBERING COLONEL BERNARD FRANCIS FISHER\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I wish to honor the life of Medal of \nHonor recipient Col. Bernard Fisher, known as Bernie. He passed away in \nAugust after a meaningful and inspiring life, and he leaves behind a \nlegacy of heroic and steady service.\n  Colonel Fisher, of Kuna, ID, earned the Medal of Honor for putting \nhis life on the line to rescue a fellow pilot downed in enemy-\ncontrolled territory during the Vietnam war. According to an Air Force \nfact sheet, under enemy\n\n[[Page S5621]]\n\nfire, he landed his airplane, pulled the pilot aboard, and escaped \ndespite the airplane he piloted being hit with multiple rounds. He is \nknown as an outstanding, steady pilot. In 1967 President Lyndon B. \nJohnson presented him with the award. His ``conspicuous gallantry and \nintrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty'' \nwas noted in his Medal of Honor citation.\n  Bernard Fisher joined the U.S. Navy and attended Boise State Junior \nCollege and the University of Utah before receiving a commission in the \nU.S. Air Force and serving as a fighter pilot. He married his wife \nRealla in 1948, and they had six sons. He went on to have a \ndistinguished military career before retiring in Kuna, ID, as an Air \nForce colonel. Three of his sons and one grandson carried on his legacy \nof service in the Air Force.\n  In addition to his being known for his eminent military career, he is \nknown as a loving husband, father, grandfather, generous friend, and \ncommitted member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. \nAfter his retirement from the military, he and Realla grew a number of \ncrops, raised livestock, looked after their family, and were active \nmembers of the community. He served as a Boy Scout leader and mentored \nairmen at Mountain Home Air Force Base. Bernie and Realla also served \nas missionaries for the church.\n  Colonel Fisher truly lived the ideal of selfless service--risking his \nown life to save other lives. He inspired and encouraged others not \nonly directly through his children, but also through the countless \nother servicemembers and Americans who have heard his story and have \nhad the thought of dedicated service awakened in them. Bernie embodied \ngreat leadership. He led by example. I join his family, including his \nsons and their families, which include 33 grandchildren and many great-\ngrandchildren, and his numerous friends in mourning his passing. His \nlegacy will endure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/16/senate-section/article/S5621-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5621]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO JAMIE MIDDLEBROOK\n\n Mr. DONNELLY. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and \nhonor the extraordinary service and ultimate sacrifice of New Carlisle, \nIN, Assistant Fire Chief Jamie Middlebrook. Dedicated, loyal, and above \nall compassionate to those in need, Assistant Chief Middlebrook served \nwith the New Carlisle Volunteer Fire Department for 22 years.\n  On Tuesday, August 5, 2014, Assistant Chief Middlebrook and \nfirefighters from local fire departments battled a massive fire at an \narea business. While advancing a water hose inside the facility, the \nroof of the building collapsed on top of Middlebrook. Despite the best \nefforts of his fellow firefighters, EMTs, and medical personnel, Jamie \nMiddlebrook, 41, succumbed to his injuries.\n  ``He took me in, he taught me the right way to do things . . . He \nshowed me how to be strong, be brave, and be there in somebody's time \nof need,'' said New Carlisle Fire Chief Josh Schweizer of Assistant \nChief Middlebrook.\n  A native of South Bend, IN, Jamie Middlebrook lived in the nearby \ntown of New Carlisle. As the son of a firefighter, Middlebrook learned \nthe importance of serving his community at an early age, and he \npossessed a servant heart. In addition to Middlebrook's service with \nthe New Carlisle Fire Department, he was the assistant chief of the New \nCarlisle EMS. Never shying from the responsibility of serving his \ncommunity, Middlebrook continued to work full time with the New \nCarlisle EMS even after being diagnosed with cancer.\n  ``He'd been a paramedic so long that many elderly people in town knew \nhim. They would request him by name on medical calls,'' said his \nmother, Carol Middlebrook.\n  Assistant Fire Chief Middlebrook is survived and deeply missed by his \nwife Julie, parents Robert and Carol Middlebrook, brother Brook \nMiddlebrook, as well as other relatives, friends, the New Carlisle \nVolunteer Fire Department, the New Carlisle EMS family, and Hoosiers \nacross the State.\n  Assistant Fire Chief Jamie Middlebrook loved his work, and he gave \nhis life in service and protection of the citizens of Indiana. Although \nhe would have never thought of himself as a hero, Middlebrook \ndemonstrated his character daily by conducting himself with courage, \nbravery, compassion, honor, and integrity. Thus, he was a true American \nhero in his everyday life as an EMS worker, a firefighter, a husband, a \nson, and friend to so many--and in his final call to duty.

Mr. President, I wish to honor Jack Rossi, who is \nnot only a truly remarkable West Virginian, but he is also one of my \ndearest friends and closest confidants. After tirelessly working his \nentire life, Jack has finally surrendered to a well-deserved retirement \nhaving stepped down as presiding member of West Virginia's largest \naccounting and consulting firm, Arnett Foster Toothman, and as chairman \nof the Charleston Area Alliance, a multi-faceted economic, business and \ncommunity development organization. But these prominent titles just \nbreach the tip of the iceberg since Jack's story is based on a lifetime \nof accomplishments and a lifetime of service that ceaselessly has \nhelped our great State of West Virginia thrive and prosper.\n  A native of the small town of Coalton in Randolph County, WV, just a \nfew counties away from my hometown area in Marion County, Jack learned \nat an early age the importance of hard work and embraced West \nVirginia's cultural practice of neighbors helping neighbors. As the son \nof an Italian coal miner who shared a roof with 13 siblings, Jack was \nno stranger to staying busy with chores and helping out around the \nneighborhood until he was old enough to work at Coalton's general store \nat the ripe age of 12. As he grew older and became intrigued by how to \nrun a business, Jack watched the local accountant balance the store's \nnumbers. Soon enough, Jack was finishing the accounting work himself \nuntil he set out to attain a higher education at West Virginia \nUniversity, where it just so happened that our paths crossed.\n  I will never forget that day. I was hobbling down the hallway on \ncrutches after I blew out my knee on the football field. Juggling \nbooks, bags and crutches on one leg, a fellow student approached me to \noffer assistance. His name was Jack. I will never forget his selfless \nact of kindness and how naturally it seemed for him to see a person in \nneed and immediately want to help. But, as I learned quickly and \nthroughout the years of a beautiful friendship, that is just who Jack \nis--amiable, loyal, and gracious.\n  We hear about lifetime achievers, but Jack is a lifetime giver. At \nevery turn of the road, whether it be as a young boy, as an \nenthusiastic college student, a Vietnam veteran or as a professional, \nJack has devoted his time and his efforts to helping others and helping \nhis surrounding communities. Jack's unwavering dedication to the \nMountain State, accompanied by his innovative vision, inspirational \nspirit, and savvy aptitude, have helped countless West Virginians, \ntheir businesses and our communities statewide.\n  Because of his passion, discipline, and staunch work ethic, everyone \nwho meets Jack immediately recognizes his aptitude for success and \nknows he will work day and night until the job is done. His loyalty, \ntrustworthiness and dedication know no bounds.\n  Jack has not only played the roles of accomplished certified public \naccountant and savvy business and community developer, but he is a \ndevoted volunteer who has always spent his free time joining \norganizations that impact our local communities. He has served as \npresident of the Charleston Chapter of CPAs, the WV Society of CPAs and \nthe WV Board of Accountancy. He has supported his profession through \nservice on numerous committees on statewide and national levels.\n  Jack spends countless hours each year in service to West Virginia \nState government. He currently serves on the West Virginia Board of \nTreasury Investments and the West Virginia Racing Commission.\n  And of course, never forgetting his Mountaineer roots, Jack currently \nalso serves on the Board of Directors of the West Virginia University \nAlumni Association as Immediate Past Chairman.\n\n[[Page S5622]]\n\nHe previously served 5 years as Treasurer and was heavily involved in \nthe successful fundraising campaign to build a new Alumni Center at \nWVU.\n  Due to Jack's unwavering commitment to his community and the \norganizations in which he dedicated his time and energy toward year \nafter year, he is also no stranger to receiving prestigious awards. To \nname a few, he has been the recipient of the State Journal's Who's Who \naward for making a difference in the business climate, the National \nAssociation of Athletic Development Directors 2009 ``Volunteer of the \nYear'' award for volunteering and fundraising for the WVU Mountaineer \nAthletic Club, the WVU Alumni ``Most Loyal Mountaineer'' award and the \n``Life Time Achievement'' award, the highest honor given out to a West \nVirginia CPA by the West Virginia Society of CPAs.\n  Time and again, Jack has shown how greatly an individual can \ncontribute to his community through passion, commitment and hard work.\n  Although Jack and his wife, Joy, temporarily left for a job \nopportunity in North Carolina right after college, they quickly \nreturned to the place they call home and there has never been a doubt \nthat Jack's roots are truly imbedded in the Mountain State. West \nVirginia is his home and I am forever grateful for his dedication to \nthe state.\n  Jack's career and accomplishments are a testament to his hard work \nand commitment to the State of West Virginia. It is a privilege to know \na man who has contributed so much of his life to strengthening our West \nVirginia communities. I am honored to call Jack my friend and I \ncongratulate him on a long and happy retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/16/senate-section/article/S5622-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5622]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO GABE GRIFFIN\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish today to honor a \ncourageous young Alabamian Gabe Griffin. Gabe is a 9-year-old boy who \nlives with his family in Shelby County, AL.\n  Right now, Gabe lives like any other child, but that is expected to \nchange soon. Without a cure, Gabe's doctors expect him to be in a \nwheelchair by the time he is 12 years old and lose his life around the \nage of 20. Gabe suffers from a fatal genetic mutation called Duchenne \nmuscular dystrophy, DMD, which is caused by an absence of dystrophin, a \nprotein that helps keep the body's muscles intact. The onset of this \nfatal disorder occurs during early childhood and causes generalized \nweakness and muscle wasting that increases over time. While medical \nadvances have led to some very promising clinical trials, to date there \nis no cure and no one has survived. DMD affects approximately 1 in \nevery 3,500 boys, which adds up to about 15,000 boys in America.\n  Symptoms usually appear in male children before age 6, and \nprogressive proximal muscle weakness associated with a loss of muscle \nmass is observed first. This weakness eventually spreads to the arms, \nneck, and other areas, and most patients are wheelchair dependent by \nthe age of 12.\n  Gabe can currently walk, breathe, and feed himself like any other \nchild. Since his diagnosis, his family has been relentlessly striving \nto raise awareness and increase research funding for DMD. They play an \nactive role in the fight against this devastating disease and are \ntireless in their efforts to find a cure.\n  Recently, a cross-country bicycle ride to raise awareness of DMD was \ncompleted. Wes Bates, a student at Indiana University; Michael Staley, \nchief of staff for U.S. Rep. Bachus; and their support team rode 3,300 \nmiles from Astoria, OR, on June 28 to Mobile, AL, on August 14. They \nworked to educate people across America about DMD, and the funds they \nraised will be used to raise awareness and advance current research.\n  Through his struggle, Gabe has continued to bring happiness and light \nto those around him. He is a wonderful and courageous boy. It is my \nhonor to recognize Gabe Griffin and his family for their incredible \nefforts to defeat Duchenne muscular disorder. It is my hope that with \ntheir continued efforts, Gabe may live to see the cure of DMD.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/16/senate-section/article/S5622-2", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5622]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECOGNIZING THE CANNON LAKE ALL STARS\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the Canyon \nLake Little League all-star team for qualifying for the 68th Little \nLeague World Series in South Williamsport, PA.\n  The Canyon Lake Little League all-star team's journey to the World \nSeries was drama filled. After a rough first two innings in the \nqualifying game, Canyon Lake scored six runs in the bottom of the \nthird, capturing the lead and continued their rally into the fourth \ninning, where they scored another eight runs, defeating the Nebraska \nLittle League team, 15 to 4. This final win in Indianapolis captured \nfor the team the Midwest Regional title with an impressive 6-to-0 \nrecord. Previously, the Canyon Lake team gave equally impressive \nperformances at the South Dakota/North Dakota district games, including \na sixth inning comeback against Fargo to win 10 to 9 in the final. Once \nin Pennsylvania, the team rounded out their performance at the Little \nLeague World Series on a high note, as they captured South Dakota's \nfirst win at the world level. Canyon Lake defeated the Czech Republic 5 \nto 3 in the consolation round, ending their run on a high note.\n  Canyon Lake was led by manager Rich Hegre and assistant coaches Scott \nSpencer and Steve Richey. The athletes of the 2014 Canyon Lake all-star \nlittle league team, in alphabetical order, are as follows: Colton \nHartford, Matthew Hegre, Jake Kostenbauer, Mason Litz, Logan Miller, \nBridger Nesbit, Dylan Richey, Adam Salter, True Synhorst, Daniel \nVigoren, Cooper Voorhees, and Blake Weaver.\n  I commend the players and coaches of the Canyon Lake all-star team \nfor their efforts. These athletes should be incredibly proud of all \ntheir remarkable achievements. On behalf of the state of South Dakota, \nI am pleased to congratulate the Canyon Lake All-Stars on this \nimpressive accomplishment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/16/senate-section/article/S5622-3", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5622]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              YELLOW RIBBON FUND FAMILY CAREGIVER PROGRAM\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to recognize a group of \nincredible individuals who are part of the Yellow Ribbon Fund Family \nCaregiver Program. The Yellow Ribbon Fund Family Caregiver Program is \nan outstanding organization that supports both wounded service members \nand veterans, and the extraordinary people who care for them. I would \nlike to recognize the hard work, passion, and dedication of the \nfollowing caregivers: Brian Vines, Sharon Roberts, Autumn Bailey, \nMargaret Jones, Stacey Kelley, Heather Miller, Dawna Barber, Helen \nGooding, Kellene Cole, Alicia Lee, Joey Caswell, Vicki Boswell, \nElizabeth Martin, Rose Haley and Jessica Allen.\n  The Yellow Ribbon Fund was founded in 2005, when several Washington-\narea business owners came together to help a mother struggling to take \ncare of her son, a wounded Marine being treated in a hospital far from \nhome.\n  These individuals have sacrificed much in order to care for their \nwounded loved ones, and their hard work often goes unnoticed and under-\nappreciated. The Yellow Ribbon Fund Family Caregiver Program recognizes \nthe challenges faced and sacrifices made by caregivers, and offers \nsupport programs, family-oriented activities, and retreats for \ncaregivers and their families.\n  Our military men and women and their families serve and sacrifice for \nour country. I would like to thank the Yellow Ribbon Fund for the \nservices they provide to our wounded veterans as well as the invaluable \nsupport they offer to caregivers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/16/senate-section/article/S5622-4", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5622-S5623]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:15 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 83.

to the Committee on Banking, \n     Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n                       Senate Joint Resolution 28\n\n       Whereas, The magnitude 6.7 Northridge Earthquake in 1994 \n     was the costliest natural disaster in the history of the \n     State of California to date, with more than $25 billion in \n     property damage, and $49 billion in economic losses to region \n     and the state; and\n       Whereas, A major earthquake in the San Francisco Bay area \n     or in southern California could have an even greater impact \n     than Hurricane Katrina had in Louisiana and Mississippi; and\n       Whereas, Risk Management Solutions, Inc., estimated the \n     potential cost of a repeat of the 1906 San Francisco \n     earthquake at $260 billion, and a magnitude 7.0 earthquake \n     rupturing the southern and northern Hayward Fault between \n     $210 and $235 billion; and\n       Whereas, The seven southern California counties that would \n     be most affected by an earthquake on the southern San Andreas \n     Fault are home to 621,000 businesses, 6.3 million employees, \n     and an annual payroll of $303.3 billion; and\n       Whereas, A magnitude 7.8 southern California earthquake \n     modeled by the United States Geological Survey and the \n     Southern California Earthquake Center at the University of \n     Southern California in 2008 found that such an earthquake \n     could cause more than $213 billion in damage, and affect \n     roughly 1 out of every 15 workers in the United States, and \n     that the nationwide toll on unemployment and lost \n     productivity could be severe; and\n       Whereas, Risks from flood and earthquake are generally not \n     included in homeowners' insurance and must be purchased \n     separately, but few homeowners purchase earthquake insurance \n     for many reasons, including its high cost; and\n       Whereas, The National Flood Insurance Program makes \n     federally backed flood insurance available to homeowners, \n     renters, and business owners in exchange for state and \n     community floodplain management regulations that reduce \n     future flood damages; and\n\n[[Page S5624]]\n\n       Whereas, Unlike flood insurance, there is no requirement at \n     the federal or state level to obtain earthquake insurance for \n     purposes of securing financing for real property located in \n     high risk areas, leaving the mortgage industry, including \n     Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, effectively the insurer of last \n     resort; and\n       Whereas, Under current federal law, earthquake insurance \n     premiums that are collected and not used for claims arising \n     within the year of collection are taxed and there is no \n     ability to reserve profits or accumulate capital for Future \n     losses, leading to the need for higher premiums; and\n       Whereas, California Senators Dianne Feinstein and Barbara \n     Boxer have introduced the Earthquake Insurance Affordability \n     Act (EIAA) that would authorize a federal guarantee of \n     limited postearthquake borrowing by actuarially sound state \n     residential earthquake insurance programs; and\n       Whereas, The EIAA would lower the cost of earthquake \n     insurance for homeowners who buy coverage from nonprofit, \n     state earthquake insurance programs and direct funding to \n     effective seismic-mitigation measures; and\n       Whereas, The EIAA would allow the California Earthquake \n     Authority to sell postevent bonds in the private capital \n     market, reducing the need to purchase reinsurance preevent \n     and resulting in rate reductions and lower deductibles; and\n       Whereas, With more Californians insured, postevent disaster \n     assistance would cost less to both the state and the federal \n     government, and communities could recover more quickly; and\n       Whereas, A Congressional Budget Office analysis of a \n     similar bill introduced in 2007 estimated that the cost to \n     the federal government for loan guarantees and post disaster \n     loans would be negligible: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and the Assembly of the State of \n     California jointly, That the Legislature memorializes the \n     President and the Congress of the United States to enact the \n     Earthquake Insurance Affordability Act; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate transmit copies \n     of this resolution to the President and Vice President of the \n     United States, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, to the Majority Leader of the Senate, to \n     each Senator and Representative from California in the \n     Congress of the United States, and to the author for \n     appropriate distribution.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-326. A resolution adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Louisiana memorializing the Congress of the United \n     States to review the Government Pension Offset and the \n     Windfall Elimination Provision Social Security benefit \n     reductions and to consider eliminating or reducing them; to \n     the Committee on Finance.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 33\n\n       Whereas, the Congress of the United States of America has \n     enacted both the Government Pension Offset (GPO), reducing \n     the spousal and survivor Social Security benefit, and the \n     Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP), reducing the earned \n     Social Security benefit for any person who also receives a \n     public pension benefit; and\n       Whereas, the intent of congress in enacting the GPO and the \n     WEP provisions was to address concerns that a public employee \n     who had worked primarily in federal, state, or local \n     government employment might receive a public pension in \n     addition to the same Social Security benefit as a worker who \n     has worked only in employment covered by Social Security \n     throughout his career; and\n       Whereas, congress enacted these reduction provisions to \n     provide a disincentive for public employees to receive two \n     pensions; and\n       Whereas, the GPO negatively affects a spouse or survivor \n     receiving a federal, state, or local government retirement or \n     pension benefit who would also be entitled to a Social \n     Security benefit earned by a spouse; and\n       Whereas, the GPO formula reduces the spousal or survivor \n     Social Security benefit by two-thirds of the amount of the \n     federal, state, or local government retirement or pension \n     benefit received by the spouse or survivor, in many cases \n     completely eliminating the Social Security benefit even \n     though their spouses paid Social Security taxes for many \n     years; and\n       Whereas, the GPO has a harsh effect on hundreds of \n     thousands of citizens and undermines the original purpose of \n     the Social Security dependent/survivor benefit; and\n       Whereas, according to the Social Security Administration, \n     in 2013, at least 614,644 individuals nationally were \n     affected by the GPO; and\n       Whereas, the WEP applies to those persons who have earned \n     federal, state, or local government retirement or pension \n     benefits, in addition to working in employment covered under \n     Social Security and paying into the Social Security system; \n     and\n       Whereas, the WEP reduces the earned Social Security benefit \n     using an averaged indexed monthly earnings formula and may \n     reduce Social Security benefits for affected persons by as \n     much as one-half of the retirement benefit earned as a public \n     servant in employment not covered under Social Security; and\n       Whereas, the WEP causes hardworking individuals to lose a \n     significant portion of the Social Security benefits that they \n     earn themselves; and\n       Whereas, according to the Social Security Administration, \n     in 2013, at least 1,549,544 individuals nationally were \n     affected by the WEP; and\n       Whereas, in certain circumstances both the WEP and GPO can \n     be applied to a qualifying survivor's benefit, each \n     independently reducing the available benefit and in \n     combination eliminating a large portion of the total Social \n     Security benefit available to the survivor; and\n       Whereas, because of the calculation characteristics of the \n     GPO and the WEP, they have a disproportionately negative \n     effect on employees working in lower-wage government jobs, \n     like policemen, firefighters, teachers, and state employees; \n     and\n       Whereas, Louisiana is making every effort to improve the \n     quality of life of its citizens and to encourage them to live \n     here lifelong, yet the current GPO and WEP provisions \n     compromise their quality of life; and\n       Whereas, the number of people affected by GPO and WEP is \n     growing every day as more and more people reach retirement \n     age; and\n       Whereas, individuals drastically affected by the GPO or WEP \n     may have no choice but to return to work after retirement in \n     order to make ends meet, but the earnings accumulated during \n     this return to work can further reduce the Social Security \n     benefits the individual is entitled to; and\n       Whereas, the GPO and WEP are established in federal law, \n     and repeal of the GPO and the WEP can only be enacted by \n     congress: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States of America to \n     review the Government Pension Offset and the Windfall \n     Elimination Provision Social Security benefit reductions and \n     to consider eliminating or reducing them; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-327.

A resolution adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of South Dakota relative to their ratification of the \n     Twenty-Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution; to \n     the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 1\n\n       Whereas, on March 10, 1971, the Senate voted 94-0 in favor \n     of proposing a Constitutional amendment to guarantee that the \n     voting age could not be higher than eighteen; and\n       Whereas, on March 23, 1971, the House of Representatives \n     voted 401-19 in favor of the proposed Constitutional \n     amendment; and\n       Whereas, forty-two of the fifty states have ratified the \n     26th amendment to the United States Constitution; and\n       Whereas, both Houses of the Ninety-Second Congress of the \n     United States of America by a constitutional majority of two-\n     thirds of each House thereof, made the following proposal to \n     amend the Constitution of the United States of America as \n     follows:\n       Proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States extending the right to vote to citizens eighteen years \n     of age or older.\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled (two-thirds of \n     each House concurring therein), That the following article is \n     proposed as an amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States, which shall be valid to all intents and purposes as \n     part of the Constitution when ratified by the legislatures of \n     three-fourths of the several States within seven years from \n     the date of its submission by the Congress:\n\n                           ``Article . . . .\n\n       Section 1.

The Congress shall have power to enforce this \n     article by appropriate legislation.'' Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the Senate of the Eighty-Ninth Legislature of \n     the State of South Dakota, the House of Representatives \n     concurring therein, that the 26th Amendment of the United \n     States is hereby ratified by the Legislature of the State of \n     South Dakota; and be it further,\n       Resolved, That certified copies of this Joint Resolution be \n     forwarded by a I the Secretary of State, to the Secretary of \n     State of the United States, to the presiding officers of both \n     Houses of the Congress of the United States, and to the \n     Archivist of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-334. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Michigan memorializing the United States Congress to make any \n     murder of a police officer or corrections officer while in \n     the line of duty a federal offense; to the Committee on the \n     Judiciary.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 123\n\n       Whereas, Michigan law enforcement and corrections officers \n     are highly-trained and courageous individuals, often finding \n     themselves in dangerous situations in order to enforce and \n     maintain the laws of the state and to protect the residents \n     of Michigan; and\n       Whereas, The killing of a federal law enforcement or \n     corrections officer is a federal offense. However, the \n     killing of a state law enforcement or corrections officer is \n     only considered a federal offense if the officer was working \n     with federal agents in furtherance of a federal \n     investigation. In addition, certain circumstances can elevate \n     a state crime to a federal crime; and\n       Whereas, There should be a consistent national policy to \n     protect our law enforcement and corrections officers. Law \n     enforcement is a necessary and vital function of our \n     government at all levels. All U.S. citizens rely on federal \n     and state law enforcement and corrections officers to keep us \n     safe in our home states and all states throughout the nation. \n     Creating a uniform penalty for the crime of taking the life \n     of a law enforcement or corrections officer while on duty \n     will underscore the importance of all peace officers \n     nationwide: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the Congress of \n     the United States to make any murder of a police officer or \n     corrections officer while in the line of duty a federal \n     offense; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives, and the members of the Michigan \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-335.

A bill to establish the National Prostate Cancer Council for \nimproved screening, early detection, assessment, and monitoring of \nprostate cancer, and to direct the development and implementation of a \nnational strategic plan to expedite advancement of diagnostic tools and \nthe transfer of such tools to patients; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce the National \nProstate Cancer Council Act with my colleague, Senator Sessions. This \nbipartisan legislation addresses the urgent need for a national \nstrategy for the accelerated creation, advancement, and testing of \ndiagnostic tools to be used in the fight against prostate cancer.\n  Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in the United \nStates, and the second-leading cause of cancer-related death in men. \nThe American Cancer Society estimates that in 2014, 233,000 new cases \nof prostate cancer will be diagnosed and almost 30,000 men will die \nfrom the disease.\n  Early detection of prostate cancer saves lives. Unfortunately, \ncurrent screening techniques result in numerous false-negatives, \nleaving men at risk to wrongly believe they are cancer-free, and false-\npositive alarms, which often lead to painful, costly, and unnecessary \nprocedures. In addition, the prostate is one of the few organs in the \nhuman body where biopsies are performed blindly, which can miss cancer \neven when multiple samples are taken.\n  The National Prostate Cancer Council Act mirrors the commitment the \nFederal government has made to fight Alzheimer's disease under the \nNational Alzheimer's Project Act, which was signed into law in 2011. \nSimilarly, this bill will bring together federal agencies, medical and \nscientific experts, advocacy organizations, and patient survivors to \ncreate a clear national plan for achieving the ultimate goal developing \nreliable tests that can detect prostate cancer and diagnose its \nseverity.\n  The National Prostate Cancer Council will evaluate our current \nefforts across all Federal agencies, and it will coordinate those \nefforts to be more effective. Congress and the Department of Health and \nHuman Services will receive a report from the Council each year \ndetailing the progress made toward fulfilling the national plan.\n  A national strategy and commitment can be the key to diagnosing \nprostate cancer earlier and more accurately. It will help us identify \nthe best use of our resources and focus on the most pressing needs, \nultimately saving lives and reducing unnecessary procedures. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this effort, and to cosponsor this \nlegislation.\n\n[[Page S5631]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALEXANDER (for himself and Mr. McConnell):\n  S. 2814. A bill to amend the National Labor Relations Act to reform \nthe National Labor Relations Board, the Office of the General Counsel, \nand the process for appellate review, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, today I am introducing the NLRB Reform \nAct with Senator McConnell. Our legislation is very simple. It will \nchange the NLRB from an advocate to an umpire. That is the role the \nNational Labor Relations Board was always supposed to have. The Board \nwas created 79 years ago to act as an impartial umpire in labor \ndisputes that threaten the free flow of commerce. The Board's decisions \naffect millions of private sector workers. But over time the Board has \nbecome an advocate for one interest group or the other, changing \npositions with each new administration.\n  There are three significant problems the Board faces today:\n  No. 1, the biggest problem is partisan advocacy. Today the majority \nof the five-member Board is made up of appointees who follow President \nObama's political leanings. President Obama has appointed three labor \nunion leaders to the Board.\n  No. 2, the Board also has a freewheeling advocate for its general \ncounsel. The Board's most recent general counsels have been exceeding \ntheir statutory authority and bringing questionable cases that threaten \nAmerican jobs and threaten sending overseas manufacturing jobs that we \nneed to keep here.\n  No. 3, the National Labor Relations Board has been slow to resolve \ndisputes. Last year 109 cases--that is 30 percent of the Board's \ncaseload--were pending for more than a year.\n  Occasionally someone will say to me: If Republicans were to win the \nSenate, what would Republicans do?\n  What we would do is try to come up with sensible proposals that lead \nus in the right direction, proposals that have so much commonsense that \nthey attract the support of enough Democrats and the House of \nRepresentatives and the President to become law. This is one such \nproposal.\n  Our bill provides three solutions to the problems I identified:\n  No. 1, it would end partisan advocacy on the National Labor Relations \nBoard. The Board would become a six-member board of three Republicans \nand three Democrats, and a required majority of four will force both \nsides to find a middle ground.\n  No. 2, it reins in the general counsel. Businesses and unions would \nbe able to challenge complaints filed by the general counsel by taking \nthem to the Federal district court, and they will have greater \ntransparency about the basis and legal reasoning for the charges \nbrought by the general counsel.\n  No. 3, our legislation would encourage timely decisions. First, \neither party in a case before the Board may appeal to a Federal court \nof appeals if the Board fails to reach a decision in 1 year. Second, \nfunding for the entire NLRB would be reduced by 20 percent if the Board \nis not able to decide 90 percent of its cases within 1 year over the \nfirst 2-year period following reform.\n  Our bill would offer these solutions without taking away one single \nright, one single remedy from any employee, business, or union.\n  With each new administration, the pendulum at the NLRB has swung \nfurther from the middle, further away from being an umpire. The result \nis that labor policy whipsaws back and forth, taking employees and \nemployers for a wild ride. This has happened under most \nadministrations, but it has been worse under the current \nadministration. The minority leader mentioned several of those \nexamples.\n  Under the partisan advocacy of today's National Labor Relations \nBoard, workers are losing their right to privacy. The Board is \nembarking on a regulatory effort to expand requirements that employers \ngive employees' names and addresses to union organizers. The Board \nwants more personal information about these employees to be given to \nthe organizing union, including telephone numbers, email addresses, the \nemployee's work location, the employee's shift, the job \nclassifications. They propose doing everything but attaching a GPS to \nthe lapel of each employee.\n\n  In my State of Tennessee, for example, we have had an ongoing \norganizing effort in the Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga. In a secret \nballot election last February, employees at the Volkswagen plant said: \nWe don't want a union; we don't need a union. So 712 to 626 they \nrejected the United Auto Workers' bid to unionize the plant. Imagine if \nyou were one of those 712 employees who voted against unionizing. Now \norganizers can get your private email address and all of this other \npersonal information.\n  Here is another example. Factions of employees within single stores \nnow have a path to forming their own unions. In 2011 the Board suddenly \nadopted a new way to define what makes a local union bargaining unit. \nThe Board changed the law so that any group of employees with an \noverwhelming community of interest could become a bargaining unit and \ntherefore a union. At the same time, the Board is moving a regulation \nto limit the employer's ability to question which employees should be \nin a bargaining unit. This allows a union to cherry-pick employees who \nwill be most likely to support forming a union.\n  How has this worked in the real world? Here is an example. The Board \njust approved a bargaining unit for cosmetic and fragrance employees in \na Macy's department store--not the shoe salespeople, not the lady's \nfashion employees, not the junior's department, just cosmetic and \nfragrance. Imagine if every department of Macy's decided to form a \nunion. The employer would have dozens of different groups to negotiate \nwith, and the different unions would be fighting each other over who \ngot the better raises and break rooms in terms of employment.\n  During this administration the NLRB has ruled that common employment \npolicies are unfair labor practices, such as--and Senator Scott brought \nthis up at a hearing the other day--the NLRB has said that an employer \nmay not have a policy that requires employees to be courteous to \ncustomers and fellow employees, or prohibiting employees from making \nnegative comments about the business that employs them on social media \nor selecting arbitration for employment disputes.\n  Our solution: Senator McConnell and I would solve this by requiring a \nsix-member board of three Republicans and three Democrats. Like the \nFederal Election Commission, a majority of four will require both sides \nto find a middle ground.\n  Here is the second problem. The Board's general counsel is acting \nlike a freewheeling advocate, stretching labor law to its limits and \nsometimes beyond its limits. For example, in 2011 the general counsel \nmoved to stop Boeing from building new airplanes at a nonunion plant in \nSouth Carolina. The general counsel to the NLRB jeopardized a $1 \nbillion factory and hundreds of jobs with this move, but even worse, he \ntried to make the case that a unionized American company can't expand \nits operations into one of the 24 States, such as Tennessee, with \nright-to-work laws which protect a worker's right to join or not to \njoin a union. The general counsel eventually withdrew this outrageous \ncomplaint against Boeing, but if it had set a precedent, jobs would \nhave fled overseas as manufacturers look to find a competitive \nenvironment in which to make and sell cars around the world.\n  We want to make sure manufacturers such as Boeing, Nissan, and \nGeneral Motors can have a competitive environment in the United States \nin which they can make airplanes and cars and other goods and sell them \naround the world. We do not want them making them in Mexico or Japan or \nEurope or somewhere else because we have undermined right-to-work laws. \nOur solution would allow employers and unions to challenge complaints \nfiled against them by the general counsel in Federal court and give \nemployers and unions new rights to learn the basis and legal reasoning \nof charges filed against them by the general counsel.\n\n  Finally, the NLRB is taking too long to resolve cases. For example, \none case has been pending at the Board for more than 7 years. The case \ninvolves the question of whether an employer has to allow labor union \norganizers access to private property.\n  Our solution--Senator McConnell and I encourage a timely resolution \nof\n\n[[Page S5632]]\n\ncases, first, by allowing either party to appeal to a Federal court of \nappeals for a de novo, or fresh, review if the Board fails to reach a \ndecision on the case within 1 year. To further incentivize timely \nresolution, we include the threat of a 20-percent budget cut with the \nBoard if 90 percent of the cases are not decided within a year.\n  In conclusion, while the increasing partisanship of the Board has \nappeared in Republican administrations as well as Democratic \nadministrations, it has reached a climax in this administration. Three \nof this President's recent nominees came from major labor unions' \nleadership. One law professor at a major university said she can't use \nthe most recent labor law textbook. The decisions changing the law are \ncoming out so rapidly and the NLRB is venturing into new territory with \nthese efforts at rulemaking. This is no way to maintain a national \nlabor law policy.\n  Our plan, the NLRB Reform Act, will, first, end partisan advocacy; \nsecond, rein in the general counsel; third, it will encourage timely \ndecisions. Our bill would offer these solutions without taking away one \nright or one remedy from one employee, one business, or one union. I \nhope my colleagues will carefully review this proposal and consider \ncosponsoring the NLRB Reform Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FISCHER:\n  S. 2817. A bill to assign the Office of Strategic Planning and Policy \nAnalysis of the Federal Communications Commission the responsibility of \nbringing institutional focus to the important function of approving new \ntechnologies and improving regulatory certainty at the Commission; to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, today I introduced the Helping \nInnovation and Revitalizing Innovation Act. It is a Federal \nCommunications Commission, FCC, process reform idea called the HIRE \nAct. This measure seeks to make the FCC more efficient and accountable \nin processing new technology applications.\n  Section 7 of the Communications Act requires the FCC to review new \ntechnologies and determine whether or not approval is in the public \ninterest within one year of application--a deadline Congress imposed on \nthe FCC in 1982. Part of Section 7 reads, ``The Commission shall \ndetermine whether any new technology or service proposed in a petition \nor application is in the public interest within one year after such \npetition or application is filed.''\n  The HIRE Act would complement Section 7. Specifically, it would: \nrequire the FCC Office of Strategic Planning and Policy Analysis to \nhelp facilitate attention and response to pending technology \napplications and licenses and it would require the FCC to report to \nCongress any time it fails to comply with the 1-year deadline for \nreview of such applications.\n  Right now when the FCC misses its 1 year deadline nothing happens. \nThe notification clause in this bill would provide a backstop for the \nFCC to enhance regulatory certainty for innovators and consumers alike.\n  Specifically, the HIRE Act would bring institutional focus to the \nimportant function of approving new technologies. FCC delays stall new \nopportunities for investment and job creation that are critical at this \ntime in our Nation's history. FCC delays also deprive consumers from \nthe benefits of accessing new technologies at lower prices.\n  The senior Republican Commissioner at the FCC, Ajit Pai, has \nidentified assisting new technology applications as a high priority. In \na July 18, 2012, speech at Carnegie Mellon University, he said, \n``Bureaucratic inertia should not be a barrier to the deployment of new \nservices or capital investment. Rather, the Commission should \nfacilitate economic growth and job creation by making decisions in a \ntimely manner . . . Entrepreneurs need an advocate at the FCC--one that \nwill hold us accountable if we delay, rather than decide.'' \nAdditionally, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, \nIEEE, has encouraged the FCC improve its decision-making process for \nspectrum management.\n  The HIRE Act is about improving the FCC's decision-making process and \nsupporting job creation. It is a small, common-sense reform that \nincreases government efficiency without increasing spending. I look \nforward to working with consumers, businesses, and those in the Federal \nGovernment who want to make our government more effective, efficient, \nand responsive. The HIRE Act is one proposal that would do that, and I \nwelcome a conversation with others about this important issue.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID:\n  S. 2820. A bill to provide for the withdrawal of certain Federal land \nin Garden Valley, Nevada; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2820\n\n         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives \n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n         This Act may be cited as the ``Garden Valley Withdrawl \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. GARDEN VALLEY, NEVADA, WITHDRAWAL.\n\n         Subject to valid existing rights in existence on the date \n     of enactment of this Act, the approximately 805,100 acres of \n     Federal land generally depicted on the map entitled ``Garden \n     Valley Withdrawal Area'' and dated July 11, 2014, is \n     withdrawn from--\n         (1) entry, appropriation, and disposal under the public \n     land laws;\n         (2) location, entry, and patent under the mining laws; \n     and\n         (3) operation of the mineral leasing, mineral materials, \n     and geothermal leasing laws.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HOEVEN (for himself, Mr. Donnelly, Ms. Murkowski, and Mr. \n        Manchin):\n  S. 2823. A bill to require approval for the construction, connection, \noperation, or maintenance of oil or natural gas pipelines or electric \ntransmission facilities at the national boundary of the United States \nfor the import or export of oil, natural gas, or electricity to or from \nCanada or Mexico, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise today to present the North American \nEnergy Infrastructure Act. It is a bipartisan piece of legislation that \nI think is very important to helping our country build the \ninfrastructure we need to truly become energy independent or energy \nself-sufficient--energy secure, if you will.\n  This is bipartisan legislation. It is legislation that has already \npassed the House. It was sponsored in the House by Representative Fred \nUpton, who is the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee. It was \ncosponsored on the Democratic side by Gene Green, a Congressman from \nTexas. I have bipartisan sponsors for this legislation in the Senate as \nwell--on the Republican side, Senator Lisa Murkowski, who is the \nranking member on the energy committee; and then I have two other \nmembers of the energy committee who are Democrats cosponsoring this \nlegislation as well, Senator Joe Donnelly from Indiana and Senator Joe \nManchin from West Virginia. Certainly Senator Manchin is recognized as \none of the leaders in the Senate on important energy issues. I am very \nappreciative of having him join me on this legislation as well. I am \nintroducing this legislation now.\n  This is the sixth anniversary of the application by TransCanada for a \npermit to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline. They applied for approval \nof a pipeline project--the Keystone XL Pipeline project--6 years ago as \nof Friday of this week. Can you imagine that? Americans fought and won \nWorld War II in less time than this application has been pending before \nthe President of the United States, yet still no decision from this \nadministration after 6 years.\n  This is vital infrastructure we need to truly make this country \nenergy secure. Working with Canada, we can truly produce more energy \nthan we consume and make our country energy secure, but we cannot do it \nwithout the necessary infrastructure--the roads, the pipelines, the \nrail, the transmission lines--the energy infrastructure we need to get \nenergy from where it is produced, places such as my State of North \nDakota, which is now the second largest producer of oil in this \ncountry, second only to Texas. We produce more than 1 million barrels a \nday of oil, but we have to get it to market. It is getting loaded and \noverloaded on rail. We have tremendous congestion on rail. Our farmers \ncannot get their ag products to market anymore because we\n\n[[Page S5633]]\n\nhave so much congestion on the rail. Yet here we have an application \nthat has been held for 6 years by the President of the United States \nwithout a decision. That is after last year when he came to the \nRepublican caucus and told us point blank that he would have a decision \nbefore the end of 2013. No decision. Here we are in 2014, the sixth \nanniversary.\n  Well, look, we cannot continue to have that problem.\n  We have to find a way to build this infrastructure. Even though we \nare working on Keystone on a separate track--and I believe we will have \nthe votes next year to pass it. We will have the 60 votes in the Senate \nwe need to pass it. We are at 57 right now. We are very close. I think \nby next year we will have those 60 votes to pass Keystone, and we will \nwork to do that and attach it to legislation the President will not \nveto. So we will continue to work on Keystone on that track, but at the \nsame time we have to avoid this problem in the future with oil \npipelines, with gas pipelines, and with transmission lines.\n  We have to be able to build that infrastructure not only in this \ncountry, but we have to be able to cross the border with Canada. Canada \nis a huge producer of energy. So working together, we have this \nincredible opportunity if we can build the infrastructure to do it. It \nis not just for fossil fuels. It is not just for oil. It is not just \nfor gas. It is for renewables as well. Canada produces an incredible \namount of hydro, which, of course, is electricity. We need transmission \nlines to bring that renewable hydro across the border.\n  So this is about all forms of energy, and this is about working with \nour closest friend and ally to truly address that energy issue. It is a \njob-creation issue. It is a national security issue.\n  What does this legislation do, the North American Energy \nInfrastructure Act? What it does is it expedites, streamlines the \napproval process for cross-border construction of oil pipelines, gas \npipelines, and electric transmission lines.\n  How does it work? First, oil pipelines. Right now, a Presidential \nnational interest determination is needed for approval or authority to \nbuild an oil pipeline across the Canadian border. Of course, that is \nthe problem we see with Keystone. That has been held up now for 6 \nyears. So this changes that process for future projects. As I said, it \nhas already passed the House overwhelmingly--overwhelmingly. I think it \nhad pretty much all of the Republican votes and I think more than 50 \nvotes on the Democratic side. They had very strong bipartisan support \nin the House.\n  What it does is it changes that approval process for crossing the \nborder with an oil pipeline, moving it to the State Department. So the \nState Department will make that determination approving a cross-border \ntransfer. It will still be subject to the NEPA process. You will still \nhave to do an environmental impact statement. But the focus of that \nEIS--environmental impact statement--or the NEPA process, will be on \nthe border section, not on the entire length of the project throughout \nall the States that pipeline may cross. It will focus on the border \nsection. And the State Department has to come up with reasonable rules \nto determine what that distance is that constitutes crossing the border \nwith Canada.\n  Then the rest of the NEPA process will continue just as it does today \nfor any other project that does not come across the border. Right now \nStates have their jurisdiction in some cases and the Federal Government \nhas its jurisdiction in some cases, depending on whether it is private \nland or it is public land or Federal land. Maybe it is a body of water. \nWhatever. So the NEPA process continues as before, driven by the States \nor the Federal Government depending on what particular part of the \ncountry or the type of land or the body of water you are crossing.\n  I think that is why it garnered such strong bipartisan support. We \ncontinue that process and those protections, but we do not allow the \ndetermination on the cross-border process or the cross-border piece to \nbe held up by all of the NEPA process and all of the sitings that may \nbe covered in all the respective States that pipeline crosses. Those \nprocesses are already in place. Do not use crossing the border as an \nexcuse to tie up all these other processes and basically usurp the \nauthority of the States that are affected by that project.\n  I think it is a very reasonable process, and it is one that I think \nwe should be able to come together on in a bipartisan way to say: It is \nopen. It is fair. That is why we have bipartisan support in the \nsponsorship--Senator Donnelly, Senator Manchin, Senator Murkowski, \nmyself, all people who work on energy--because we have struck that \nbalance. It is about creating a good business climate that will \nencourage that investment to create the infrastructure we need to move \nthe energy from where it is produced to where it is consumed in the \nsafest way possible--in the safest way possible--in the most economic \nway possible.\n  That is what it is about, the best environmental stewardship. Isn't \nthat what we all want? Obviously it is. But if we don't do this, where \nare we? Well, right now we are waiting 6 years for a determination on \nthe Keystone XL Pipeline.\n  Here is another example I will give, the Bakken North pipeline, a \npipeline that goes from North Dakota to Cushing, and they have been \nwaiting for 1\\1/2\\ years on an ownership name change from the \nDepartment of State, 1\\1/2\\ years to change the name. Really? Does that \nmake sense to anybody? If it takes that long for something that simple, \nwhat do we do when we actually need to build this infrastructure that \nis so important to the energy future of our country?\n  What about gas pipelines? Gas pipelines will be covered by FERC, the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission. What we say is: Look, they will \ngo through the NEPA process too. Just as we describe with the \nDepartment of State on an oil pipeline, they will take that cross-\nborder piece and do the same thing, do a NEPA process so you have an \nenvironmental impact statement and cover all the bases. But then 30 \ndays after, they have to make a decision. They can't just sit on it, \nand the rest of the NEPA process continues as we described on an oil \npipeline. Again, very simple, very straightforward, and it comports \nwith the free trade agreements we have with Canada and with Mexico.\n  On the third piece, electric transmission lines, that process will be \noverseen by the Department of Energy. We simply streamline the process. \nRight now there are two permits required, one that is driven by the \nadministration, one that is congressionally driven. We combine those \nand make it one process; again, cover all the bases, as I have \ndescribed, with an oil pipeline or a gas pipeline, but we make it one \nprocess instead of a duplicative process.\n  When we look at what is going on in the world today, we see why this \nlegislation is so important. Look at ISIL. Look at ISIL in the Middle \nEast and what is happening there. We are right now confronting how we \nneed to address this very significant challenge, how we need to work \nwith allies in the region to take out ISIL. Do we really want to \ncontinue to be dependent on oil from the Middle East? I think we could \nask every single American that question and the answer would be a \nresounding no. There is no way we want to have to get oil from the \nMiddle East. But we still are today. Yet we can produce more oil and \ngas in this country, particularly with Canada, than we can consume.\n  Why would we continue to want to be dependent on the Middle East or \nVenezuela or any other place that is antagonistic or hostile toward our \ninterests? We don't. This is a national security issue. It is an energy \nissue. It is a job creation issue. It is an economic growth issue. And \nit is for darned sure a national security issue. Which is why every \ntime we ask the public about it, more than two-thirds say: Yes, build \nthat infrastructure. Build that Keystone Pipeline. Let's work with \nCanada, our closest friend and ally in the world, to get our energy.\n  Look what is going on in Europe. Look what is going on with Russia \nand Ukraine. Look at the situation a country such as Ukraine or the \nEuropean Union is in because of Russian aggression. Where do they get \ntheir energy? Where does Ukraine get its energy? Where does the \nEuropean Union get their energy? They get a third or more--from? \nRussia. Russia, the same\n\n[[Page S5634]]\n\ncountry that is invading Ukraine, the same country occupying Crimea and \nthe eastern part of Ukraine.\n  Then when we try to get the European Union to join with us to push \nback, what do they say? Geez, I don't know. We can't, because Russia is \ngoing to cut off the gas and it is fall and it is getting colder.\n  Does that make sense to anybody? Is that the situation we want to be \nin? I think it is pretty compelling. Do we want to be in a situation \nwhere we have to try to get oil out of the Middle East with ISIL over \nthere operating the way they are? I don't think so.\n  These issues are all interrelated, and they are not short-term \nissues. We can't start building that infrastructure today and have it \ndone tomorrow. These are billion-dollar investments. They don't cost \nthe government a single penny, but they are billion-dollar investments \nthat private enterprise is willing to make and put people to work, \nprovide that energy more safely, more securely, with better \nenvironmental stewardship, and address our national security \nchallenges. That type of energy plan is a long-term plan for this \ncountry, and it is one we need to start now.\n  For six years we have been waiting for a decision from the President \non a multibillion dollar pipeline project that will not only bring oil \nfrom Canada to the United States but will move 100,000 barrels a day of \noil from my home State to refineries in this country, that by the State \nDepartment's own admission will create more than 40,000 jobs, that will \ncreate hundreds of millions in tax revenue, that will help us create \nenergy security for our country, that will allow us to work with our \nclosest friend and ally, Canada, rather than telling them: No, we are \nnot going to work with you. Send that oil to China. It is something the \nAmerican people overwhelmingly want by about 70 percent in most of the \npolls that I guess is being held up by special interest groups.\n  This is about how we run this country. This is about who we work for. \nThis is about having a long-term plan to build the kind of energy \nfuture for America that I believe the American people very much want.\n  Let's go to work and pass this bipartisan legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANDERS (for himself and Ms. Stabenow):\n  S. 2832. A bill to provide for youth jobs, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, if you talk to the people in Vermont, and \nI suspect in any other State in America, they will say the most serious \ncrisis facing this country is the lack of decent-paying jobs, \nparticularly when it comes to young Americans. This is an issue we do \nnot talk enough about, and this is an issue on which we have to focus.\n  Yes, we are better off today than we were 6 years ago when we were \nhemorrhaging 700,000 jobs a month and the Nation's financial system was \non the verge of collapse, but the truth is that the economy for working \nfamilies and lower income families today remains in very difficult \nstraits. The middle class of this country--the backbone of this \ncountry--continues to disappear and more and more people are living in \npoverty. In fact, we have almost more people living in poverty today \nthan at any time in the history of this country, and all the while we \nare seeing more wealth and income inequality, such that 95 percent of \nall new income generated in America since the Wall Street crash is \ngoing to the top 1 percent.\n  The fact is that real unemployment in this country is not the \n``official'' 6.1 percent we see on the front pages of newspapers. The \ntruth is that if you count those people who have given up looking for \nwork because they live in high-unemployment areas or the people--and \nthere are many of these--who are working part time when they want to \nwork full time, real unemployment is 12 percent. That is a crisis \nsituation.\n  As bad as that is, the unemployment rate is far worse for young \nAmericans. Today the youth unemployment rate is 20 percent--20 percent. \nWe all paid a lot of attention to the tragedy in Ferguson, MO, a few \nweeks ago, but what was not discussed is that African-American youth \nunemployment is 33 percent, and in many areas of the country it is even \nhigher than that. Today over 5.5 million young people have either \ndropped out of high school or have graduated high school. And do you \nknow what they are doing? Nothing. They have no jobs. Many of them in \nVermont and throughout this country are hanging out on street corners \nand many of them are getting into trouble. Maybe they are doing drugs, \nmaybe they are involved in crime, but this I will tell you, and the \nstatistics are very clear on this: If you leave school--either you drop \nout or you graduate high school--and you don't get a job in your first \nyear, you don't get a job in your second year, you don't get a job in \nyour third year, there is a strong likelihood you will never get a job, \nnever get a career, never make it to the middle class, never be part of \nmainstream America.\n  Youth unemployment at 20 percent is clearly one of the reasons why in \nthe United States of America we have more people in jail today than any \nother country on Earth. A lot of people don't know that. China's a \ngreat big country, a Communist authoritarian country. Doesn't China \nhave more people in jail than we do? No. We have more people in jail \nthan China.\n  I think the time is long overdue for us to start investing in our \nyoung people, helping them get the jobs they need, helping them get the \neducation they need, helping them get the job training they need so \nthey can be part of our economy, part of the middle class, and not end \nup in jail or dead from overdoses of drugs. The situation is so dire \nthat there are studies out there that tell us now that one out of every \nthree African-American males born today, if we do not change this, will \ngo to prison in his lifetime--one out of three. This is a crisis \nsituation, and it is one that cannot be ignored.\n  The legislation I have introduced today, along with Congressman John \nConyers of Michigan, is called the Employ Young Americans Now Act. This \nlegislation will provide $5.5 billion in immediate funding to States \nand localities throughout the country to employ 1 million young \nAmericans between the ages of 16 and 24 and provide job training to \nhundreds of thousands of other young Americans. Under our bill the U.S. \nDepartment of Labor would provide $4 billion in grants to States and \nlocal governments to provide summer jobs and year-round employment \nopportunities for economically disadvantaged youth, with direct links \nto academic and occupational learning. There is another $1.5 billion in \nthere to provide such services as transportation or childcare, which \nwould be necessary to enable young Americans to participate in job \nopportunities.\n  I am very grateful this legislation has already been endorsed by the \nAFL-CIO, which is the largest labor union in the country, representing \nsome 13 million workers; the American Federation of State, County and \nMunicipal Employees; the United Auto Workers; the United Steel Workers \nof America; the Campaign for America's Future; and the National \nEmployment Law Project.\n  I thank Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan for her support on this \nlegislation as well.\n  We cannot continue to ignore the crisis of youth unemployment in \nAmerica. We are talking about the future of an entire generation. We \nare talking about the future of the United States of America. Let's \nstart focusing on this issue. Let's give millions of young people the \nopportunity to earn a paycheck and to make it into the middle class.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/16/senate-section/article/S5634-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5634-S5635]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 546--CONGRATULATING INDONESIA'S PRESIDENT-ELECT JOKO \nWIDODO ON HIS ELECTORAL VICTORY AND COMMENDING THE PEOPLE OF INDONESIA \n      ON THEIR COMMITMENT TO DEMOCRACY AND FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE (for himself and Mr. McCain) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the passage of the \nGovernment Reports Elimination Act--a bill that will eliminate or \nmodify 53 Congressionally mandated reports.\n  In 2010, we passed the Government Performance and Results \nModernization Act, which added several new reporting requirements for \nFederal agencies. Too often, we add these new reporting requirements \nwithout looking back to see if there are any outdated reports that \ncould be eliminated.\n  So we asked Federal agencies to identify any duplicative or outdated \nreports that we could cut. In response, the administration published \nits first list of more than 300 reports from about 30 agencies and we \nturned this list into the Government Reports Elimination Act.\n  Senator Ayotte and I introduced this bill in the Senate and \nCongressmen Darrell Issa and Gerry Connolly introduced the companion in \nthe House. The final bill will eliminate or modify 53. In doing so, we \nare removing real barriers to productivity across the government. This \nrepresents a real step, albeit a modest one, toward making our \ngovernment work better.\n  If these reports are not being used--and are simply collecting dust \non a shelf--then they are wasteful, and we cannot afford that kind of \nwaste Eliminating a handful of reports won't solve our budget \nchallenges--but every hour and dollar saved helps. This bill helps free \nup time for our Federal employees to focus on priorities.\n  The passage of the Government Reports Elimination Act makes a small \ndown payment on the broader problem, which is why I'm also working on \nanother bill to make further reductions in Congressionally mandated \nreports.\n  In June, the administration sent over the second list of outdated \nreports for\n\n[[Page S5647]]\n\nelimination and our new bill will include their recommendations and \nreflects my ongoing commitment to eliminating these outdated reports.\n  I wish to thank Senator Ayotte for being my partner on this work. It \nhas been an honor to work with her on our Budget Committee Government \nPerformance Task Force.\n  I also want to thank Senators Carper and Coburn for their leadership \non this issue and advancing this bill through their Committee. \nAdditionally, I would like to thank our other cosponsors, Senators \nFeinstein and McCaskill for their support.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ncommittee-reported substitute amendment be considered; the Carper \namendment which is at the desk be agreed to; the committee-reported \namendment, as amended, be agreed to; the bill, as amended, be read a \nthird time and passed; and that the motion to reconsider be considered \nmade and laid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.
